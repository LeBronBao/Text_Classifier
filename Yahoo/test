justified jealously? The girl i am seeing becomes quite upset when we go out and she notices that when my face begins to flush,i start breathing differently,become super relaxed and sweaty...in the presence of other girls. This usualy happens prior to and during intimacy..or when i am really attracted to someone.how do i explain to her that it's out of my control and i don't conciously choose to feel this way? she claims that i want to 'screw' every girl i see and just gets worked up.She's a very confident person also, i just don't understand where this is all coming from.I try to comfort her before(never works),but now i tell her to deal with it..because i did nothing wrong. Tell her to get over it or get out...Jealousy sucks and only gets worse..If she trys to control your emotions she'll try and control everything else. 9

i am 37 years old i havent married yet  what is the age of the girl that  i can marry?  Sali,\n This is the computer forum, please limit questions to computer related topics. There is a whole category of Romance for you to ask this question in, with better answers, I'm sure. \nMy own advice would be to find out what the laws on marriage would be wherever you are. If you are in the States, the age of consent varies by whatever state you are in. Generally, it is 18. If you are in another country, feel free to consult the laws there for the appropriate age that you can marry.\nBest of Luck to you! 5

Legal recourse on dentist who performed poor dental work? I had some dental veneers done 2 years and 9 months ago in New York City. Recently, at least two dentists identified the work was performed below standard of care. It is so bad that I have to get them re-done. Otherwise, my teeth will decay and eventually die. The re-do will take $10,000! Although the dentist belongs to the New York State Dental Association, they do not accept complains for work done more than 2 years and 6 months ago. \n\nIs there any other legal recourse I can pursue? There is a limit to time that you have to take action in matters Like this. You could try to get a Atty- that Will shake them up But thats also Money But we also have freedom of free speach USE IT make sure you dont say anything that they didnt really do Like ( i went it and come out with a sex change) Also This is a Great Tool and site to use\nwww.planetfeedback.com\nI do feel your pain though (Only in the USA can you go to school and pass and Mess a person up for life and Become Rich for it) This matter like I said how far do you want to take this and If it gonna cost 10000.00 to fix them the atty- might cost twice as much. NOT WORTH IT but use that Site and The BBB good Luck. And dont worry oneday your smile will be great as the dentist falls out (we Hope) 3
What is Intellectual Property? I.  How can universals, or abstract ideas, be "owned" ?\nIa. Does ownership of an abstract idea mean that the owner has the right to exclude, use, possess, and transfer the idea, under the traditional definition of property?  \nII. If Intellectual Property does not mean the right to exclude, possess, use, and transfer a universal, what does linguistic item "Intellectual Property" signify?\nIII. If there is no denotation of Intellectual Property, what is the connotation of "Intellectual Property"?\nIV. If ideas are fundamental features of the world, like mathematical expressions, that is, they do not exist in space and time, then how can the concept of ownership be applied to them?\nV. Is "Intellectual Property" just a "contraditio in adjecto" (a contradition in terms)? Definition:\nA product of the intellect that has commercial value, including copyrighted property such as literary or artistic works, and ideational property, such as patents, appellations of origin, business methods, and industrial processes.\n\nHere's some history:\nBy the time the U.S. Constitution was being written, the Founding Fathers had a good philosophical grasp of intellectual property, and provisions regarding it were included: Article I, Section 8 gave Congress the power "To promote the progress of Science and Useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries." Almost as soon as the Constitution was ratified, Congress proceeded to set up a patent law to protect monopolies on inventions. By 1836 the U.S. Patent Office was functioning effectively, and it soon became apparent that invention fared better under the U.S. system than under any other. A monopoly for a limited time on a specific invention encouraged people to invent, knowing they could be protected, and enabled them to sell rights to others who had the capital or existing trade to manufacture and promote an invention.\n\nRest of your answers:\nWikipedia has a great article on this topic, I think it should answer most of your questions.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property 10

What does "tau" mean?  The 19th letter of the Greek alphabet. \n\nAn elementary particle of the lepton family, having a mass about 3,550 times that of the electron, a negative electric charge, and a mean lifetime of 3 × 10-13 seconds. \n\nIn the system of Greek numerals it has a value of 300\n\nTau is the name of an island near Kilinailau, Greenwich Island, and Ocean Island\n\nIn Games Workshop's Warhammer 40,000 science fiction gaming universe, the Tau are an alien race\n\nTau is a symbol used from antiquity and is represented by a type of cross. There are those who accuse Christ of being the pirate of this ancient symbol, but it did not become a symbol of Christianity until a later date. As with Christianity, other ancient societies who used the "Tau" symbol also evolved its use to represent resurrection, reincarnation and blood sacrifice.\n\nThe prefix of many cosmic entities, fictional or not. Notably Tau Ceti Five from System Shock 2 1
Why is Bode Miller doing so badly in the Olympics ? Were we expecting to much of him ? Is he overated ? Or is the pressure to much ?\n\nNo Wikipedia answers please I think he distracted himself from the task at hand with his media battles and problems he's had in the weeks prior to the Olympics. That was time he should have spent putting the finishing touches on his preparations for Torino...but instead he spent it making contreversial comments, doing commercials, and doing media interviews. 6

Which celebrity would you prefer to have dinner with and why? I'd go for Meg Ryan; she's smart, beautiful and real. I would have dinner with Paul Newman (it would be great for his wife Joanne Woodward to come along, too). I think he is a great actor and mentor to other actors. He is a very humble man who "has been around the block" and could teach me alot.\n\nI also greatly respect him for how he has used his celebrity for such positive results with The Hole in the Wall Gang and his Newman's Own food products (shameless exploitation for the common good). Paul Newman donates all his profits and royalties after taxes for educational and charitable purposes. Paul Newman has given over $175 million to thousands of charities since 1982.\n\nPaul Newman will leave a great legacy in his accomplishments in the entertainment industry, plus a great one in people's lives. 8

Who decided that God is male ? While watering my plants today, this query struck me. \n\nIf "God" created humans in ___ likeness, and only the female of our species is able to create life within her, and bring that life forward into the world, then doesn't that imply that God is actually female, and created more females in her likeness, then created men to fulfill the required cycle of life ?\n\nMy apologies if this question is taken in a negative context. I'm just curious as to why God is considered Male, when women are known to the life creaters.. Yesterday, in my dream, saw God, and SHE was BLACK.\n\nGod is beyond of any discrimination,sex,caste,creed. God is one in all, no limits, no boundries, jusrt endless stream of bliss, peace and joy....\n\nThe dream of God, is reflected in men and women all around the world.\n\nWe are all a part of God, who in his/her limitless grace and kindness, showers blesings upon us, in every possible form.\nLike rain, dewdrops, water, the limitless clear, blue sky, the freedom and joy to be free.\n\nGod is beyond.\nLike uncountable daffodils on background of shining sun.\nOr like lotuses in a lake with blossomed moon....\n\nNo one decided God is male. Its just way of expressing our gratitude to God. \n\nYou can call God her.After all, God is God. We are mortal humans.\n\nGood Luck, and keep faith in God. 1

How is the property & casualty business in Florida? Information about the company I work for MetLife Auto & Home. Property insurance premiums in Florida have risen dramatically.

what is the effect of the condensation in the steam generator?  Steam generators produce steam not condensation.  A steam generator (e.g., in a nuclear plant) generates steam that can be used to drive a steam turbine to generate mechanical or electric power.  The oldest systems (non-nuclear) discharged the steam wastefully to atmosphere.  In modern plants, exhaust steam from a steam turbine is directed to a steam condenser (where cooling water is used to condense the steam).  This allows the condensed water that must be highly pure and chemically treated to be reused by pumping it back to the steam generator.  More importantly, because the steam condenser reduces the turbine exhaust pressure well below atmospheric pressure, the steam is permitted to expand even more through the turbine blades extracting more power from the steam.  This greatly improves overall system efficiency by providing far more power from the energy expended to produce the steam. 2

Should we have the right to decide how much is paid? Has anyone else here ever thought about the fact that our so called representatives in Washington are supposed to be working for us ,paid their salaries with our tax dollars, yet they decide what we are going to pay them and when they are going to give themselves a raise, does anyone else feel that the American people should have the right to vote on how much these people are paid. None of us can walk into a job and say this is what you are going to pay me and when I tell you it's time for a raise you will give it to me, why should they be able to. Your absolutely right, but don't forget that we put these people into office.  When people vote for legislators, they are voting for all the things they want to do for themselves as well.\n\nThere are many congresspersons who vote against raises, but they are often out numbered.  The goal of the people is to vote for those who aren't all about money. \n\nThanks for making me think! :) 10

Asteroid strike on July 3 2006? NASA Near Earth Object (NEO) website has data on asteroid 2004XP14 which is pretty large (at least 1/3 of a kilometer in diameter, perhaps more) and which is currently set to come about as close to Earth as the moon on July 3, 2006.  But perturbations could send it much closer, or even cause impact. One lunar distance is still a reasonable safe distance.  There have been some that have been a lot closer, within geostationary range (approx. 22,800 miles). Yes, any chunk of space rock will be preturb as it is more influenced by another gravitational mass (Earth, Moon, even the Sun and Jupiter), but by the orbital data on this particular rock and the angle it is coming in on, I doubt the influence would be remotely enough to put it on collision course with Earth for any time soon. 2

what is "phenylalanine" and what does it do to your body?  "Phenylalanine is a hidden danger to anyone consuming aspartame. Most consumers don't know that too much Phenylalanine is a neurotoxin and excites the neurons in the brain to the point of cellular death. \n\n"ADD/ADHD, emotional and behavioral disorders can all be triggered by too much Phenylalanine in the daily diet. If you are one in ten thousand people who are PKU or carry the PKU gene, Phenylalanine can cause irreversible brain damage and death, especially when used in high quantities or during pregnancy. Phenylalanine is 50% of aspartame, and to the degree humans consume diet products, Phenylalanine levels are reaching a dangerous peak.\n\n"Phenylalanine is one of the essential amino acids found in proteins...\n\n"Phenylalanine is found naturally in foods such as eggs, milk, bananas, and meat. If you are PKU (Phenylketonuric) or sensitive to phenylalanine, you will react to the phenylalanine in aspartame. You may want to get a blood test to check for this condition. Over the past 20 years, humans have become more aware of PKU reactions because human beings began using isolated phenylalanine to the degree it is harmful to some individuals, many as aspartame side effects...Phenylalanine can be very harmful to diabetics. 2
Do you think the EU, with it's common currency,  could be the beginning of Europe as a single, huge nation?  Highly unlikely. They are quite diverse, even within their own countries. Many have multi-party political systems, as well as a standard of different forms of government (eg, some have monarchies while others purely support elected officials). Because of their own "internal conflicts," they likely will continue to vie for their own standards. 1

How does one get rid of the odor caused by mold(black) which has been in basement for several years? The house I'm renting has a horrible odor caused by mold that has been in basement for more than four years now (the time I have lived here). It has ruined many walls causing them to crumble. Landlord just recently cleaned out his belongings which were ruined by the mold. He says he sprayed chlorine but the smell hasn't gone away! It smells like dirty socks inside my house which is hard to deal with!\n   My children and I are constantly sick and experience wheezing, sinus problems and shortness of breath. You need to get out of that house.  No doubt!!  \n\nI used to have a mold problem and it wasn't even half as bad as you are having. We had the nasty smell down in the basement and you can't do anything about it because the mold is constantly being fed by the moisture down there.  we bleached the heck out of the walls and floor but it never totally got rid of it.  it Always would get much worse in the summer months too.  Occasionally on the very hot and humid days we experienced what you are describing - about the smell coming into the rest of the house.  and making it hard to breath etc...  It is not good!  Do yourself and your kids a HUGE favor and move out.  \n\nThere is no cure. 3

You'd be surprised how much money you can make if you work in an affluent neighborhood. Tips + Full Salary = Rox. 8
How does one know who the right one to marry is or to ask out and if one is not very well off?  I guy was about to get married in a few days when his girlfriend's best friend invited him to her house. He went and found his girlfriend's friend in a bikini. She was astoundingly sexy and he always wanted to do something with her. She told him, " I've always wanted you, and since you are getting married with my friend I want to have you just one time before you get married", and then she said "I'll wait for you upstairs". As soon as she went upstairs, the guy turned around and ran for the door, opened it as quickly as possible and found his girlfriend standing outside. She said, "Oh my love, you passed the ultimate test!" and the guy felt a great relieve.\n\nLesson: Always leave your condoms in your car.\n\n0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n\nSo the point is, try that! hahhahahahhahaha. 1

how do u ice skate?  Ice skating takes a lot of skill, but to skate for fun, it actually is pretty simple. When you put on your skates, make sure your skates are not to tight or loose, and that your laces are tucked in. When you first step onto the ice, you may be tempted to cling onto the side. At first take small steps, and go slow and steady. if you think you are getting the hang of it, then try pushing off the side. I am an experianced skater and have been skating since I was four, so I know it looks easy but is hard especially at first. 6

The Orioles havent upgraded much this offseason do you think that they can keep up with the rest of the ALEast  the Orioles have only had 1 decent season under Angelos, that being the first season Davey Johnson managed them and they went wire-to-wire in first place. Of course, Angelos couldn't leave the managing to the managers, and Johnson left. The best Orioles teams of the past had pitchers they developed, so hopefully Mazzone can get them back on track. 6
So what is going to happen with the seaport management issue ? Will the House and Senate prevail?  I hope this is the tide turning. It seems that even some of the republicans are starting to question the ideas of the bush administration. I was at my mechanic yesterday and overheard rush limbaugh (on the radio, of course) even criticizing bush's plan. It seems like selling the ports to the arab company is like asking the fox to gaurd the hen house. \nI think the Congress will try and stop Bush from going through with the sale since republicans and democrats are against it. Bush says he'll veto any act by Congress concerning the matter, but i would not be shocked to see the veto overridden. That would certainly be exciting and representative of our nation's growing disatisfaction with our president. 10
how are avi,mpg,mpeg video files made? what do people use to make them and what would i need to make them AVI, MPEG, QuickTime and other digital video formats are created two ways, on the fly, and captured/encoded.\n\nIn order to understand either process, it helps to understand what digital video consists of.\n\nDigital video is stored as a series of key frames and "dif" frames. A key frame is basically a picture of everything you see in a frame of video. Now if you're recording me talking, most of the picture remains exactly the same from one frame to the next. The only difference or "dif" between one from and the next frame would be the pixels around my mouth, which have changed. Since the "dif" frames are much smaller (It takes less space to store my mouth than an entire picture of me) the video is smaller and plays faster.\n\nDigital video consists of a key frame, followed by a bunch of dif frames, then another key frame and more dif frames, lather, rinse, repeat.\n\nOkay, so how this applies to making a digital video file.\n\nWhen you buy a DVD, you basically get an optical disk with an MPEG-2 movie on it. Someone with a very fast computer with an even faster hard drive "Captures" the movie. What I mean by this is that they record the movie to their hard disk as quickly as possible. In order to do this, this "raw" video is stored uncompressed. Basically nothing but key frames. The only problem with raw video is that it’s huge. A movie can take up more than 60 gigabytes of space!\n\nSo it goes through a second process, called encoding. Encoding goes through the raw video, and converts it into key frames and dif frames. So it compares frame 1 to frame 2, and stores them as one full frame, and one dif frame. It then does this with frame 2 to 3, 3 to 4, etc.\n\nThe encoded video is now much smaller. The 60 gigabyte "raw" movie now takes up 5 to 6 gigabytes of space, since each dif frame is really small.\n\nAs technology gets better, having a two stage process is less necessary. For instance, your Tivo is fast enough to encode “on the fly”, and go directly from the TV signal to encoded video, without having to do a capture first. The same principal works with web cams. Television and web cams are of low enough quality; they can do all the processing quickly. However, capturing movies for a DVD requires much higher quality, so they will continue to be captured and encoded for some time to come. 8
California:  I have an ARM at 6.8% and rising - should I refinance now? Wait for prepay penalty phase to end?  It depends on when your prepayment penalty is over and if it is cheaper for you to absorb the prepayment.  If you're planning on living in your home for the forseeable future I would move into a fixed rate mortgage.  If you think you may move in the next few years you may want to consider another ARM or an Interest Only option.  There are many ways to look at your situation and if you'd like to discuss them try me at MYLOAN.  We're a national lender and comparable to Ditech and ELOAN except our rates and service are better.  \n\nI wish you luck in your search for financing 7
Is it possible to clean the "underside" glass on a HP All-In-One Scanner? I noticed that the glass is clouding over on the inside and it seems pretty straight forward to open it up and clean it.  Only problem is , it's not obvious how to open it up.  Don't care about voiding warranties at this point. you can find if your HP scanner can be cleaned on the link below.\n\nIf your scanner is not listed, you will get instructions on how is done to other scanners so you get the idea of how is it done. \n\n=) 5

should the Sabres trade Martin Biron?  Yes, and now is the time when Buffalo can get the most for him. He's the best he's ever been and has been in the league about 10 years. With the 13-game win streak he had in Nov.-Dec., and his good stats, now is when his value is highest. I hope Sabres don't just let him get away and get nothing, like Zhitnik and Satan. 6

David Fincher's Alien 3 - most underrated sequel of all time? Hey folks I just got done watching the ALIEN trilogy for the umpteeth time. The first two in the series are nearly universally regarded as great (quite deserved I might add), and have a significant cult status. However, the third Alien flick often gets maligned, quite unfairly. I think Fincher's dark, claustrophobic finale is not only a fitting, but compellingly tragic end to the overall harrowing journey Ripley suffered. I want to go on record and maybe get some support and/or opinions of other fans of this series. I liked Aliens 3.  It was interesting and scary.  I remember seeing at the theater and being really impressed by it.  I really liked the characters even though they were prisoners.\n\nMy mom and I have watched Aliens so many times we can practically quote the entire movie.  "!@#$ We're Dead! We're Dogmeat Pal!" 8

How do you think the Cleveland Indians will do this year? Am I going to see another upsetting season where they just miss the playoffs? NO!! They are actually going to make the playoffs this year! I have faith in them. Also, it's their 100th aniversary, so they have to make it last as long as they can!!\n\n\n\nHeehee....I'm loving these answers. Either someone isn't old enough to remember before the late 90's or they are just uneducated baseball fans. Seriously, how can you forget Baerga, Ramirez, Belle, Vizquel and Thome (as mentioned above!)? I shall quote Drew Carey "CLEVELAND ROCKS!!". I will be at the Jake this year rooting on the tribe. 6
Does the Decibel(db) will acculmulate when few objects make noise together? For example, when 1 drum make 40db noise.\nDoes 2 drums make 80db noise and 3 drums make 120db noise?\n\nWhy ? or Why not? Thanks! The Decibel is a logarithmic measure of sound intensity and cannot usually be added as simply as adding apples to a basket.  Also, different sound sources interact with each other much as the ripples on a mill pond when you throw in one or more stones.  At one point the ripples add and at another they cancel each other where a crest meets a trough.  Crests add and troughs add negatively.  Then did you us a large and small stone?  I think you get the picture.  It is complex.\n\nThe sound level in Decibels is the sound energy being emitted by a device and can be measured in a special lab with a meter.  That is different from the sound energy received by the ear (which depends on many things including distance from the source(s) and reflection of the source(s) from walls, etc.).\n\nI was told that the net effect of two sound sources was not purely additive but more like considering each source to be a side of a square or rectangle then calculating the diagonal of the figure (hypotenuse by trig where A2 = B2 + C2 and 2 means squared).  Three sources would thus add as the diagonal of a cube, etc. 2
who smokes pot?is pot safest narcotic? or it isn`t a narcotic at all? Alot of people smoke pot. Lawyers, Doctors, teachers, maybe even the cashier at your local grocery. Im not saying that all of them do but there is no doubt a small percentage. Alot of bad propaganda has been forced on to pot. Its not for everyone and sure isn't for young teens. But lots of research show that the properties of marijuana can help prevent cancer cells and doesn't kill nearly half as much brains cells as alcohol. As for safety, there will unfortunatly always be risk involved when using an illegal drug because of legality and such. And since pot is the least addictive in the narcotic list, any other drug could surely pose a serious risk to your health and life. 7
what is the number of beds in hospitals in US totally? or number of disable of walking patients in US especially since the number changes daily - you wont find the answer on the internet (at least an accurate one) unless you ask something like how many hospital beds were there on such and such date- even then good luck! 3
Why do doctors say "stat" instead of something like "right away?"?  Many medical terms are from Latin: e.g., NPO=nil per os, nothing by mouth.\n\nHere's what Wikipedia says about stat:\n"Stat, from statim is a medical term meaning "immediately" (from Latin) or Sooner Than Already There."\n\nWhen I worked at a hospital it carried a greater urgency than "rush" or "right away!" It was only meant to be used when someone might die if not acted on. So; drop your lunch, pull up your pants, stop whatever you were doing if doing so didn't threaten someone else's life, and respond!\n\nThere's the other side, too. Obscure language gives power. Someone goes to clinic and says "I have an upset stomach." The doctor replies, "yes, you have gastritis." Now you know the word in Latin (inflamed stomach=gastritis) and he has his fee. 4
tell me about ethanol fermentation and how it  takes place?  The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is used in production of most alcoholic beverages. When oxygen is present, yeast grow efficiently on a sugar substrate, making yeast cells and carbon dioxide (the citric acid cycle). This is  the chemoorganotrophic metabolism of respiration. When oxygen is absent, yeast switch to an anaerobic metabolism, fermentation, which is less efficient (only about 27% energy conversion to ATP), producing carbon dioxide, fewer yeast cells and the by-product ethanol.\nThere are a small number of yeast cells present on the skins of grapes in the vineyard. These stay in the must (the pulp and skins)when the grapes are crushed. During the first few days the yeast grow by respiration, consuming oxygen from the juice. When the oxygen is depleted the yeast switch to fermentation. Care must be taken to ensure that no air is allowed into the container or the cycle will be disrupted. Certain subspecies of yeast are more alcohol tolerant and will continue to reproduce until the ethanol reaches 10 to 15% by volume. The product must be distilled if higher alcohol concentration is desired. Overall, one molecule of glucose yields two of ethanol and two of carbon dioxide.\nGlycolysis, the fermentation of glucose, is also called the Embden-Meyerhof pathway. The first stage produces two molecules of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. The second stage conserves energy as ATP by oxidation-reduction, producing two molecules of pyruvate. The third stage is a second oxidation-reduction with the formation of fermentation products.\nDetailed discriptions and illustrations of the glycolysis pathway can be found in many science texts, including the source I used. 4

love or money? Okay, so you're offered to spend the rest of your life happy with the person you love or to spend it with a billion dollars.  which do you choose? Love. Believe me, once you get the feeling of love, theirs nothing like it. Don't get me wrong, I am materialistic. I would love to have a Ferrari, mansion, a billion dollars. But without someone you love in your life who loves you back, even a billion dollars wouldn't make a person happy for a long time. 9
why do girls do porn? don't they have so much lose? Many reasons.\n\n1. Money- In a 6 month period, a female can make up to 30,000 dollars by doing 2-3 scene a week and/or model shot. If that female is "hot" the amount is more.\n\n2. Fame- Guys will pay money to see and buy more money to take a picture with her.  porn stars can hide this money away from the IRS easy.\n\n3. Quick and Easy- Fill out a app and in 12 hours you shot, in a week you may be a "Star".  So many girls are braking their necks to became that next star.\n\nBut for all the reward and quick cash.  The girls and some guys will be label for a long time.  The label will fall in time. Many women dont make it 6 month and they life is ruined. Snice porn is a rough(and I mean rough)business, you may have to "try" new things just to make new and keep your fans.  Like gangbangs, ATM, Cum eating, gagging, and many other fetishes that normal girls will never do. 9
Why is drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge so controversial? And please serious answers.\n\nThe Senate has routinely blocked this measure despite it being pushed through in the House. I realize that animal rights folk have seizures when this is brought up.. but animal rights are not held as sacred as happy American consumers in the political arena.  Something else has to be going on.  What is it? Because liberals care more about the life of one caribou (which likely will not be affected anyway-- ANWR is larger than some states) than they do about the lives of fully-developed, unborn children, or the security of America.\n\nThere are huge herds f caribou (and other wildlife all over the north slope where we have been drilling for 30 years. 10
I am looking for a programme to sort asci files into alphabetical order on a Pc? Over a period of 10 years I have written over 1,000 files - data and reference, and all in ascii format - or unformatted text in Pc language.  Many of these were written on an Atari.  I have since moved onto a Pc, and some of the old files need sorting into alphabetical order.  Each file consists of one-line entries - world capitals, leaders, famous artists, writers, poets, that sort of thing.\n      (I have an Atari emulator, but it is a lot of hard work to use).\n\n      If anybody knows of such a prog, I would be glad to hear from them.\n\n    (If anyone wants a copy of these files - useful for quizzes - email me at buntslever@yahoo.co.uk, quoting Quizword) Go to the Dos prompt. There is a program called sort.\n\nSort [unsorted file name] > [sorted file name]\n\nIf you want to concatenate all your files together first, that's a bit more tricky:\n\nCopy [file name 1] ABC.Txt\nType [file name 2] >> ABC.Txt\nType [file name 3] >> ABC.Txt\n.\n.\nSort ABC.Txt > ABC.Srt 5
what is the source of power that enables pagans/wiccans to perform witchcraft/spells? answers from my previous question about this religion has inspired this question.  thank you for your time and knowledge.

why is there no light in space?  There is light in space. After all, the light we see on Earth from the Sun, the moon, and the stars travels through space to get here. \n\nThe big difference between Earth and space is that our atmosphere reflects the light that goes through it. So it makes our surroundings seem brighter. Since space doesn't hold an atmosphere there is nothing to reflect the light and it just passes through.\n\nSo basically light is always travelling through space but it doesn't get reflected (which makes it dark).\n\nHope that makes some sense. 2

what does "60 is the curcumference, 2 is the perpendicular" mean? this is geometry question Jan 17 Note: If this is hard to understand, after sleeping on it, I may have an easier construction.\nIf you need further explanation, add another note to your question.\n\n-----------\n\nI think I have a solution.\nI'm making the assumptions that the Babylonians didn't have an acurate value for pi and used the value three. If I do that, every thing falls out.\n\nDraw a cirlce. Mark off 2 arcs. Make one the top portion of a circle say from 10 o'clock to 2 o'clock, the other the matching arc from 4 o'clock to 8 o'clock. Note: These arcs are just to get a representation of the problem and are not an acurate length.\n\nNext draw the two chords for the arcs, that is, the straight line from 10 to 2 and the other from 8 to 4.\nNow draw in the diameter of the circle from 12 o'clock to 6 o'clock.\nThe two chords cut off pieces on the ends of the diameter. Label these as length 2 (2 is the perpendicular) "Double 2 and get 4" That's the length of the two end pieces of the diameter.\n"Take 4 from 20 and get 16" This is where using 3 as a value for pi comes in. If pi 3, then a circle of circumference 60 will have a diameter of 20, so let the length of the diameter be 20. Taking 4 from 20 gives you the length of the diameter that is between the 2 chords, 16.\n\n"Square 20 get 400, square 16 get 256, take 256 from 400 get 144. Find the square root of 144. 12, the square root, is the chord."\n\nWe're obviously doing some Pythagorean theorem here so where is the triangle? \nDraw the diameter of the circle from 8 o'clock to 2 o'clock, that's the hypoteneuse as has length 20.\nThe distance between the two cords is 16. That's also the distance from 8 o'clock to 10 o'clock. Draw that line and label it 16. (Remember the drawing isn't accurate just enough to show us how things are layed out).\nThat leave the 3rd side of the triangle as the chord between 10 o'clock and 2 o'clock. \n\n20^2 - 16^2 = 12^2  so 12 is the length of the chord.\n\nHow does that sound?\n\nIn modern English, the statement of the problem would be something like this:\n\nLet AB be an arc of a circle of circumference 60. Let X be the chord connecting A and B.\nLet Y be the perpendicular bisector of the chord. If the distance from X to the circle along Y is 2, find the length of X. (You may assume that pi = 3 for the purposes of solving this problem.) 2

why was Thomas More beheaded?  More refused to attend the coronation of Anne Boleyn as the Queen of England. Shortly thereafter More was charged with accepting bribes, but the patently false charges had to be dismissed for lack of any evidence. In 1534 he was accused of conspiring with Elizabeth Barton, a nun who had prophesized against the king's divorce, but More was able to produce a letter in which he had instructed Barton not to interfere with state matters.\n\nOn April 13 of that year More was asked to appear before a commission and swear his allegiance to the parliamentary Act of Succession. More accepted Parliament's right to declare Anne the legitimate queen of England, but he refused to take the oath because an anti-papal preface to the Act made of it an acknowledgement of Parliament's authority to legislate in matters of religion by denying the authority of the Pope, which More would not accept. Four days later he was imprisoned in the Tower of London, where he wrote his devotional Dialogue of Comfort Against Tribulation.\n\nOn July 1, 1535, More was tried before a panel of judges that included the new Lord Chancellor, Sir Thomas Audley, as well as Anne Boleyn's father, brother, and uncle. He was charged with high treason for denying the validity of the Act of Succession. More believed he could not be convicted as long as he did not explicitly deny that the king was the head of the church, and he therefore refused to answer all questions regarding his opinions on the subject. Thomas Cromwell, at the time the most powerful of the king's advisors, brought forth the Solicitor General, Richard Rich, to testify that More had, in his presence, denied that the king was the legitimate head of the church. This testimony was almost certainly perjured (witnesses Richard Southwell and Mr Palmer both denied having heard the details of the reported conversation), but on the strength of it the jury voted for More's conviction 4

do guys have to pay when we go out on a first meeting date??  If the guy asks you out on a date, as in, not "friends" but a real live date, he is making the invitation to take you out and treat you. That is the understanding. If you ask him out, then it should be you who pays, since you would be the one planning the date. If the outing is more casual, like just coffee, and he doesn't offer to pay when he asks you to hang out, order your biscotti to go: because he just wants to be friends, or is totally clueless and not boyfriend material. 9

Computer problem- Hard crash with video playback.....? I'm having a hell of a problem... Recently, my computer has started freezing when I play videos, I can't find any reason why..... It will play for a random amount of time, and then the sound hiccups for a second, and bam. Complete lockup. Even the mouse won't work. You might as well take a picture of the Desktop and tape it on the front of the monitor, because that's how unresponsive it is..... I can't think of anything that I've done that would have caused this, last night I cleaned out my case, suspecting dust choking, but to no avail. I've even done numerous system restores to times before this problem arose, no dice... I'm PRAYING it's not a hardware problem, because that would suck so hard.... The computer doesn't freeze during 3D, or just during normal operation, but video playback freezes it 3/4ths of the time.... 2D (i.e. video playback) and 3D use different processes to decode the video.  First step is to \n1. Try a different video player with a updated codec pack\n2. Try the newest version of your video driver.\n3. Check your bios settings for the video-card.\n4. Check to make sure its not the video-card itself by borrowing a friends to test out\n\nThings I would already rule out:\n1. overheating, if it was a issue it would freeze during 3D gaming.\n2. the motherboard and memory, (same as above, lock-ups should effect the 3D as well)\n3. Power supply (same as above) 5

How can i help my family? I have a brother In-Law addicted to drugs and he steals from his family that? houses him and feeds him (his brother and mother) what should i do? He needs to be put into rehab as soon as possible.  One of my old roomates had a brother on drugs.  He would get off drugs, to make people believe he was clean, and then start again.  I remember her making excuses for him re how he will get help and he never did.  In fact, he had to come live with us, because he got kicked out of his house.  He had a wife and two children, but that didn't help matters.  He loved the drug.  I wanted, so badly, to move out after she let him stay with us.  He would go out late and knock on my window, at night, to let him in the house.  He basically would sneak out, so his sister wouldn't know.  Instead, he used me to get back in.  One night, I ignored the knocking and she found out.  She finaly called a few people to come make him understand that rehab was the best thing he could do with his life.  At that point, he decided to go.  \n\nI don't know the details of what is going on with your brother in-law, but if he doesn't get help soon, it may be too late.  You can help your family by convincing them to get help.  \n\nI don't know if this answered your question?  I hope it helped out a little. 9

What is with the new move to say "Happy Holidays" instead of "Merry Christmas"? I think my sentiments are evident by the way I ask the question, but really are we becoming so general and trying not to offend anyone that we're at the risk of real expressions and living? I don't celebrate Christmas, but it doesn't offend me in any way... your thoughts? I am an Atheist and have no problem at all with "Merry Christmas" or "Christmas Tree" or anything simular.  If a store wants to display signs that say Merry Christmas than I think thats great.  If they want to have Happy Holidays instead, I see no problem with that either.\n\nFor me, December 25th is Christmas Day.  Its not Holiday Day or Solstice Day... its Christmas Day.  \nOf course the word Christmas may have more meaning to some people than to others.  I dont celebrate the birth of Christ and most Theists dont either.  Maybe one day we will have an ATHEIST DAY and damn to hell if I would let some Jesus Freak make me change it! 1

if a muslim and a christian want to get married can they both have there faiths preform the cermony? my friend and her boyfriend want to get married. He is a muslim she is achristain they want to now how can they get married without anyone converting believes they can. my best frineds sister is mormon and married a jehova whitness. And I've been to many weddings with a cathcolic bride (or groom) and the other is Jew. 1
becouse jews dont believe in jesus wiil they go to heaven> or will they go to hell?  ~Most~ Jews do not accept Jesus as the Messiah who comes twice. Scripture doesn't say He'll come twice; it doesn't say He comes once to do it all. It is undefined enough so God can share salvation with the gentiles, while the Jews are blinded (as marianne stated). That does not mean they are lost.\n\nThe question is better for discussing than answering.... \n\nThe first hurdle is that the mainstream Christian denominations are quite Judeophobic - so you get a biased response from most Christians.\n\nThe other major problem from Christians to answer this question is that they are hung-up on the name, "J-e-s-u-s." The Messiah who lived 2000 years ago was not known as "Jesus" - no one called Him that, no one referred to Him like that. Why? There is no "J" in Hebrew or Aramaic. "Jesus" is a Westernized creation. His name is Yeshua, which means "God saves," "salvation," or "savior" -- "She will give birth to a son, and you are to name him Yeshua, [which means `ADONAI saves,'] because he will save his people from their sins." --Matthew 1:21 (The Complete Jewish Bible).\n\nAnother issue for most Christians is that God did not forsake Israel or the Israelites/Jews; God did not replace Israel with the "Christian Church." And probably most important, God has one plan of salvation for people - the faithful - His people. Abraham was deemed righteous (and saved) because of his faith - all of the OT patriarchs & faithful believers were saved by the Grace of God because they believed that God would send His Salvation ["Yeshua"] to save them. How are faithful believers saved today? By the Grace of God because they believe in Jesus, Yeshua, God's salvation. What's the difference? (That's a rhetorical question - tear the uninspired pages <i.e. "Old Testament" title page & "New Testament" title page> out of your Bibles - God never intended for there to be a separation in His Scripture - it is a man-made barrier to understanding Scripture, it is a man-made barrier to Truth, it is a man-made barrier to salvation.) There is no difference. The OT is the NT concealed; the NT is the OT revealed -- they are the SAME Gospel message!\n\nNow, back to the question: What about the Jews? Those who were faithful believers in God's salvation were saved in the OT; I believe that today they will be saved the same way - even if they don't use the word "Jesus" for God's salvation.\n\nIf you think "Jesus" is a ~magical~ name, check with your spiritual leader for clarification.\n\nPS- The "man-made barrier" is devil inspired - that's his job! 1
Is it wrong to be married and yet fall in love with another woman? During a low period in my marriage, I began chatting with a Lady on the Internet. She is a widow with two daughters, and I was lonely. I was upfront with my Internet friend from the start telling her about my wife and problems we are having. Now we have become very very close. I know I must honor my wife and children, but I have strong feelings for my friend too. I feel torn apart by obligations of love and a spark I can't explain. This doesn't just happen to men. Women get torn between two people also, but you have an obligation to your wife and your CHILDREN!!! I know it is hard, but be a man and keep your word. Good Luck! 9

Which religion is right?!!!!!!!!!!!? I'v been investigating different religions, and someone please tell me which one is right, please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! All and none are right. The answer depends on the religion of the person you ask. Ask a Christian, and he'll say you can't get to heaven without Jesus. Ask a Muslim, and he'll tell you that it's honorable to die in the service of your superiors. Ask an atheist, and he'll most likely blame religion for every evil act humanity ever committed. 1
Besides Shawn Alexzender who was the best running back for the 2005-2006 season?  It's got to be Larry Johnson for sure.  Finally given a chance to start, he finally reminded everyone why he was a first round draft pick.  As the starter for nine games, he managed to rush for over 1350 yards and to score 16 TDs.  It's unthinkable what he could have done if he was the starter for the whole season.  He is also a pass receiving threat as well.  He is the real deal! 6
how long does somebody have to cash a check? I know there are several outstanding checks from my bank account.  Some of them are several years old.  Is there a time limit that a person has to cash a check?  I don't know the check numbers so I can't put a stop payment on them. The best answer to this is to ask your bank.\n\nMy bank will only honor a check up to 1 yr after it is dated.  I think that is the standard rule, but each bank may be different. 7
What is CIA?

what are day light savings?  From wikipedia:\n"Daylight saving time (also called DST) is the North American term for a system intended to "save" daylight (the British observe summer time, and likewise the Europeans). The official time is adjusted forward, (usually) one hour from its official standard time, remaining that way for the duration of the spring and summer months. This is intended to provide a better match between the hours of daylight and the active hours of work and school."\n\nIn my own wordings, it's adjusting time in summer/winter so you won't be going to school/work when it's dark, or waking up at 6am and the sun is too high in the sky.\nCountries usually adjust the time to make the change between summer/winter in sunrise/sunset easier on people. 7

are universites in the usa sponsored by the federal government? if yes give me a few Most universities, whether public or private do receive federal monies directly or indirectly. For example, many American college students receive grants from the federal government which is used to pay their tuition at state-sponsored or private colleges and universities. The federal government also guarantees many student loans. \n\nStudents at the service academies pretty much get all their expenses paid by the federal government in exchange for an individual's committment to several years of military service. The graduates generally receive commissions as officers. Admission to these academies is very competitive, and admission may require the recommendation of a US Congressman or Senator.\n\nThese include:\n\nUS Military Academy (West Point, New York)\nUS Naval Academy (Annapolis, Maryland)\nUS Air Force Academy (Colorado Springs, Colorado)\nUS Coast Guard Academy (New London, Connecticut) 10

i need a poem by a black author in tpcastt?  Way Cool Question!\n\n"The Negro Speaks of Rivers" is an excellent poem by Langston Hughes to explain using TP CAST T!\n\n>>\nI've known rivers ancient as the world and older than the\nflow of human blood in human veins.\n>>\n\nTPCASTT is a way of analyzing a poem.\nSee the link below for how it works.\n\nT-Title - what does title mean *before* you read the poem.\nP-Paraphrase - put the poem in your own words.\nC-Connotation - what meanings are implied?\nA-Attitude - what is tone or attitude of speaker & poet?\nS-Shift - poem shifts, changes, develops\nT-Title - after reading, does title have other meanings?\nT-Theme - what *might* the poet be saying here?\n\nSo this is all about "critical thinking" -- teachers do not care about what YOU think about a poem. The purpose is to teach YOU to think and analyze.\n\nCheck out the link  for the essay on "Rivers" to get some ideas on how to use TP CAST T for the poem. 4
what are trans fats?  Basically, trans fat is made when manufacturers add hydrogen to vegetable oil--a process called hydrogenation. Hydrogenation increases the shelf life and flavor stability of foods containing these fats.\n\nTrans fat can be found in vegetable shortenings, some margarines, crackers, cookies, snack foods, and other foods made with or fried in partially hydrogenated oils. Unlike other fats, the majority of trans fat is formed when food manufacturers turn liquid oils into solid fats like shortening and hard margarine. A small amount of trans fat is found naturally, primarily in dairy products, some meat, and other animal-based foods.\n\nTrans fat, like saturated fat and dietary cholesterol, raises the LDL cholesterol that increases your risk for CHD. Americans consume on average 4 to 5 times as much saturated fat as trans fat in their diets. 3

How many spiders does a person eat over a lifetime while asleep? EWWWWWWWW!!! so nasty I know but I was just wondering! Also is there any way to prevent from eating them? yuck! actually this is an old wives tale. Most people would say 7 a year. This is actually untrue. I read a scientific document on this and there is a specific reason I cannot recall but spiders will generally recoil and scurry off at anything moving....including movement from breathing. Spiders also prefer high and dry locations over damp warm mouths. 7

Hw did pink become a feminine color? It seems boys are wearing pink more and more but it used to just be associated with girls, how did this come to be? According to the website "Gender Specific Colors," it would seem that assigning color to gender is mostly a 20th century trait.   It would\nalso seem that at one time, the color associations were reversed when color first came into use as a gender identifier.\n\nIn fact, this reversal of what we consider "normal" was considered conventional, even in the early 20th century.\n\n"At one point pink was considered more of a boy's color, (as a watered-down red, which is a fierce color) and blue was more forgirls. The associate of pink with bold, dramatic red clearly affected\nits use for boys. The reason is that pink being a more decided and stronger color is more suitable for the boy, while blue, which is more delicate and dainty,is prettier for the girl." [Ladies Home Journal, June, 1918]\n\nhttp://histclo.hispeed.com/gender/color.html - "Gender Specific\nColors"\n\nAccording to Jo B. Paoletti and Carol Kregloh, "The Children's Department," in Claudia Brush Kidwell and Valerie Steele, ed., Men and Women:  Dressing the Part, (Smithsonian Institution Press, 1989).  -\nIn the United States: "The current pink for girls and blue for boys wasn't uniform until the 1950's.\n\nIt would also seem that Nazi Germany had something to do with the association of pink with femininity:\n\n"Catholic traditions in Germany and neighboring countries reverse the current color coding, because of the strong association of blue with\nthe Virgin Mary...the NAZIs in their concentration camps use a pink triangle to identify homosexuals. (The yellow star of David is the best known symbol, used of course to identify Jews. The German system\nwas quite complicated, using various symbols an colors to identify criminals, political prisinors, an a whole range of other groups). The\nNAZI's choice of pink suggests that it by the 1930s was a color that in Germany had become associate with girls." - "Gender Specific Colors"\n\nWhile there are also myths and legends supporting both or either color for gender identification, those resources dealing with straight history date the identification of pink with femininity to the period of World War II or later. 7

What does A&R stand for in the music industry and what are their responsibilities? What does A&R stand for in the music industry and what are their responsibilities? Artist and repertoire (A&R for short) is a music industry term that refers to the division of a record label that is responsible for scouting and developing talent. The A&R department is the link between the recording artist/act and the record label, and is often required to handle contractual negotiations, find songwriters and record producers for the act, and schedule recording sessions.\n\nOne of the A&R department's main jobs is sorting through the plethora of demo tapes sent by hopeful musicians to the label. A&R departments typically only accept solicited demos, or ones from business contacts that they are familiar with.\n\nIn some more artistic record labels, creativity is encouraged and songwriting and record producing is done by the artists.\n\nExamples of A&R people include\n\n    * Simon Cowell\n    * Ian Dickson\n    * Mark Holden\n    * Chuck Paugh\n    * Frankie Vega\n    * Ben Watt\n    * Brad Delson 8

how many planets do we have in our solar system?  According to the authority of the IAU, there are nine planets in our solar system. In increasing distance from the Sun they are (with the astronomical symbol in brackets):\n\nMercury (☿) \nVenus (♀) \nEarth (♁) with one confirmed natural satellite, Luna (the Moon) \nMars (♂) with two confirmed natural satellites, Phobos and Deimos \nJupiter (♃) with sixty-three confirmed natural satellites \nSaturn (♄) with forty-six confirmed natural satellites \nUranus () with twenty-seven confirmed natural satellites \nNeptune (♆) with thirteen confirmed natural satellites \nPluto (♇) with three confirmed natural satellites, Charon, S/2005 P 1 and S/2005 P 2 \nHowever, there is some pressure for Pluto to be reclassified as a Kuiper Belt object, especially in light of the discovery of 2003 UB313. This object, however, has not yet received a definitive classification from the IAU.\n\nSedna was widely touted as a planet when it was discovered in 2003, as it was the largest object found since Pluto. However, mainly due to its size still being smaller than Pluto's, it did not achieve planetary status from the IAU. However, the discovery in 2005 of 2003 UB313 (nicknamed Xena), with a size and mass larger than Pluto seems to have forced the issue. As of January 2006 it has not yet been accepted as a planet, but the IAU is expected to announce a definition of a planet soon, which will likely either see 2003 UB313 become a planet, or have Pluto stripped of its status. 2

girls help? what are some signs that a girl may like you besides eye contact?? A lot of times a girl will go out of her way to hang out with you or talk to you if she likes you.  Smiling and eye contact are good signs, but if a girl seems to avoid eye contact or look down when you look at her, she may still like you but just be shy.  Try showing a little interest in her, (such as asking her about things she likes, striking up conversation) and see if she returns the interest. 9

what is computer-based learning? and what are the advantages/diadvantages that follow?  The term generally refers to a specific program which is designed to teach.  There are many advantages, such as the ability to go at the student's own pace, individually, instead of having a classroom where some students are bored while others are bewildered.  It can also give more direct and individualized feedback, and correct misconceptions more quickly.  Most of them do little pop quizzes throughout the program, and can also give interactive demonstrations.  The program is not designed to be impatient, argumentative, or insulting.  And the computer does not need a vacation or sick leave, although it may go down at times.\n\nThe only disadvantage I know about is the difficulty in getting a question answered for the student, if they need clarification of the questions in a quiz, for example.  But if the computer learning goes on in an atmosphere that provides access to a trouble-shooting human teacher, that can be overcome.  Also, not all subjects are standardized enough for the formal structure of the program.  I took a journalism course on a computer at the University of Michigan in the early 1970s, which only worked because the course required strict adherence to the UPS style book.  More flexible criteria for evaluating writing tasks might not be so programmable. 4

What principle is used to measure the content of oxyzen in combution gas of boilers?  "In recent years, electronic testers have become available for analyzing flue gases. [...] Most electronic testers use an electro-chemical cell as the gas sensing element. A different cell is required for each gas being measured.\n\nThe most common sensor used in oxygen testers is a zirconium oxide element that develops a voltage difference across two sides if there is a difference in oxygen concentration. The zirconium oxide element has the advantage that it can be exposed to flue gases for thousands of hours." 2

I'm 30 and I just found out that I have high cholesterol. Before I never cared about what I eat but know I .. I would like to find out more about how to read the Nutrition Facts on food, and how to decide which is a better choice. I know that the Cholesterol level and Saturated fat level is important. I'm wondering if the Sodium has anything to do with Cholesterol.\nI also would like to know more about specific foods that are good to control and lover Cholesterol level (like fish, chicken etc.. and how much I could eat of these healtier ones. ??????? Soluble fiber is very good at lowering cholesterol as it binds the bile (a digestive agent) & causes you to excrete it. The body makes more bile (to replace that which was lost - if it wasn't lost, the body tends to recycle bile) from cholesterol. You'll find soluble fiber in foods such as apples, oranges & oatmeal. \n\nInsoluble fiber is also good for your heart, so eat high fiber foods like beans & veggies. Sodium does not affect your cholesterol level, but it can affect heart health so it's best to keep it to a minimum. \n\nA little exercize, such as walking for 30 minutes 3 times a week, will also work wonders. If you eat a Whte bread, try to switch to something like Nature's Own White Wheat, which has lots of fibre. Try & drink fat-free or 1% milk instead of whole milk. A lot of little life-style changes will go a long way. 3

If I can't have a natural way of incresing d lenght  and width of my penis ,what is the chepest drug to use? where can I get it in nigeria? There is a natural way to increase length and girth, however this method is traction based, not drug based. Use a medical traction device such as the Andro Penis. This method is based on exerting a gradual tractive force of 600 to 1500 grams to permanently expand the blood-carrying chambers (the largest being the corpus cavernosa) of the penis. The microcellular result of this traction is an increase in the total number of cells, and the macrocellular result in an increase in the total tissue volume and thus an enlargement of the penis. These are permanent gains.\n\nUse the Andro Penis device 4-9 hours per day for 3-6 months. You will have time-linear flaccid and erect gains in length, and less pronounced gains in girth. The flaccid gains appear first. The first two months' gains are usually very significant because of additional gains from lengthening of the tunica muscle.\n\nI've gained permanently 1.75" length and 1" girth since June 2005 through the use of an Andro Penis medical traction device and PowerJelq for exercises. (You can supplement the traction with manual or PowerJelq exercises which increase blood flow to the penile tissues). Try the Andro Penis, and you will be happy to see serious gains after 3-6 months usage. 3

Did you learn anything new about CSS when you were developing Gothika?  Absolutely, yes. At the time, I was right in the middle of our University's site redesign, and literally learning CSS one rule at a time as I was going along. I actually never intended to enter any of my designs to the Garden; even though it was still in its infancy, it already featured such high quality entries that I felt my meagre attempts would be quite inadequate. As CSS was fast becoming the most popular topic in the web design area over at Sitepoint's forum (were I was a moderator at the time), we decided to run our own 'garden-like' competition. I was involved in the contest's organisation, and developed two example designs: the default Sitepoint style, and the slightly more elaborate 'Gothic'. \n\nImagine my surprise when, out of the blue, Dave Shea emailed me to ask if I'd like to rework 'Gothic' as an entry to the Zen Garden. It was this initial vote of confidence that pretty much took the 'fear' of the Garden from me and spurred me on to explore a variety of new techniques and styles, pushing my knowledge of CSS further than the constraints and boundaries of my large Salford redesign would have allowed. \n\nCertainly working on 'door to my garden' (which seems to be my most successful entry, even managing an appearance in Dave and Molly's book 'The Zen of CSS Design' - see the sample chapter at creativepro.com) has provided me with a very strong grounding on the various issues involving the use of background images and cross browser alternatives, and probably represents my most 'finished' piece of work in terms of striking a good balance between visual design and clean, simple stylesheet usage. \n\nFor completeness' sake, it may also be worth mentioning that I have two more entries which unfortunately did not quite make it into the 'official' list: phonephreak in the 'conceptual designs' category, an admittedly unreadable design that mimics a double page spread magazine layout, and an advanced version of 'door to my garden' under 'special effects', which uses some :hover trickery in browsers that support it, yet degrades gracefully in those that don't. 5

What is a Hamiltonian Operator?  the hamiltonian is the fundamental quantity in hamiltonian dynamics, which is a rather advanced form of basic, classical mechanics.  the essence of hamiltonian dynamics is that energy is the fundamental quantity of motion, whereas in a newtonian system, forces and momenta are the fundamental quantities.  neither is more correct - if you use them properly, both should give you the same results.  however sometimes one form is easier to use than the other.\n\nessentially the hamiltonian itself is a description of the total energy of a system in any given configuration.  the basic way of defining a hamiltonian is H = L + V, where L is the total kinetic energy of the system and V is the total potential energy of the system.  of course, L and V are themselves functions of other variables - V is often a function of position, if you are talking about a conservative potential.  L is a function of the momentum or velocity.\n\nif you have a real, complex system with many atoms and many degrees of freedom, the hamiltonian is a very large and complex quantity.  usually you see hamiltonians writen down for very simple or oversimplified systems.  \n\nalso, many physical systems are "non-hamiltonian", which means that energy is not conserved within the system.  so, for example, you cannot write a hamiltonian for something that radiates heat away and out of the system.  hamiltonian dynamics are insufficient to describe that kind of thing.\n\nanyway, the Hamiltonian is called an operator because it acts on something.  in the case of the quantum-mechanical hamiltonian, the form of this operator is:  H = h^2/2m * del^2 + V\nwhere del is the differential operator d/dx + d/dy + d/dz (in cartesian coordinates).  obviously something has to come after H, because d/dx doesn't mean anything on its own!\n\nin the languages of matrices and operators, a system can be described by a *vector* where each element in the vector is some physical property - the location in space on some coordinate axis, or velocity, for example.  \n\nif you multiply some vector of size N by a matrix of size NxN, you get out another vector of size N.  so, this is like the matrix performs some "operation" on the vector and transforms it into something else.  of course the transformation depends on what's in the matrix.\n\nso, the hamiltonian is a way of describing the time evolution of something.  it is used this way in quantum mechanics - if you have some quantum mechanical system in a state, and you operate on it with a hamiltonian, you get back the state of the system at some later time.  if you look at the basic form of the schroedinger equation (- d/dt Psi = H Psi, if you leave out all the constants etc), you can read out what the meaning is:  "the rate of change of the wavefunction equals the hamiltonian acting on the wavefunction".  this means the hamiltonian tells you how the wavefunction or state of the system changes with time.\n\nyou can see an example of what the hamiltonian matrix looks like for a very simple system, the quantum mechanical simple harmonic oscillator, here:\nhttp://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/HamiltonianOperator.html\n\nif you are interested in learning more about hamiltonians, i would suggest you first learn about lagrangian mechanics, which is closely related, and the notion of "generalized coordinates".\n\ncheers! 2

i need some hard facts from Christians that god is real, my relationship is crumbling because of this dillema? I am desperate, my relationship is crumbling because of this and i need hard facts. I know there was jesus but how can i prove he did those miricles because Gd is certainly real, even if you may not believe in Jesus. The Jews have believed in Gd for 4,000 years, without Jesus, and continue, and continue to believe in Gd without Jesus today.\n\nLet me remind you that the Bible tells us that miracles do NOT prove someone is from Gd, or that his or her message is from Gd. We are specifically told that if someone comes to you with a message he claims is from Gd, tells you that he will perform a miracle, and then he, INDEED, DOES THAT MIRACLE, it doesnt matter so long as his message contradicts what Gd has already told us. Read Deuteronomy 13:1-5\n\n     Deuteronomy 13:1-5 1If there arise among you a \n     prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and giveth \n     thee a sign or a wonder, 2  And the sign or \n     the wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto \n     thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, \n     which thou hast not known, and let us serve \n     them; 3  Thou shalt not hearken unto the words \n     of that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams: \n     for the Etrnl your Gd proveth you, to know \n     whether ye love the Etrnl your Gd with all \n     your heart and with all your soul. 4  Ye shall \n     walk after the Etrnl your Gd, and fear him, \n     and keep his commandments, and obey his voice, \n     and ye shall serve him, and cleave unto him. \n     5  And that prophet, or that dreamer of \n     dreams, shall be put to death; because he hath \n     spoken to turn you away from the Etrnl your \n     Gd, which brought you out of the land of\n     Egypt, and redeemed you out of the house of \n     bondage, to thrust thee out of the way which \n     the Etrnl thy Gd commanded thee to walk in. \n     So shalt thou put the evil away from the midst \n     of thee. \n\nSo, even if it could be proved that Jesus did miracles, it would not prove that Christianity is right. \n\nThis is especially true when one compares the basic Christian beliefs about Jesus with what one finds in the Bible. One example, Deuteronomy 24:16 "....Every man must die for his own sins.  (Eesh b'chet-o yumatu)." 1
Do the Simpsons do their own stunts?  They actually did do their own stunts on the Tracy Ullman show, where they got their start.\n\nBut, as Hollywood grinds, and fame comes, the insurance company covering the set and actors' safety demands that no stunts shall be done by the primary actors.  It is just too much of a liability.\n\nNow they have to create stunt-doubles, word has it the cast threatened to strike when this first came about (except for Lisa, who is just known for her level-headedness.), but luckily a nasty strike was avoided when the writers agreed to give these stunt doubles some bit parts on camera.\n\n\n\nWell....maybe.... 8
Can someome explain 6x-5=6/x?  The specific procedure has been given; so let's see a bit of theory:\nfirst of all, this equation IS NOT of first degree as it may appear at a first sight, because the x appears at the denominator of a fraction. In fact this is a FRACTIONAL equation.\nFractional equations need some specific skill and some specific additional attention.\n\nSpecific skills:\nDealing with fractional expressions (operating with polynomials which appear both at the numerator and at the denominator of a fraction, which also involves finding GCD between polynomials and dividing/multiplicating polynomials).\n\nIn this case the only denominator is a x, so the task is not so difficult\n\nAdditional attentions needed:\nbefore going on finding the solution for your equation, it is best practice to set the existence conditions for it. What is it? Simply, you must find the values that set to 0 each denominator involving your variable, and state that such values are not acceptable as solutions for the equation.\n\nIn this case the only existence condition is x != 0 \n(" x not equal to 0 ": on the paper use the right simbol for "not equal to")\n\nIf you ever found 0 as a solution, you should mark it as "non acceptable".\n\nWhen all solutions are non acceptable, the equation is in fact impossible in R 2

What do you know about femur fracture surgery? is it dangerous? is it hard to recover after that? A femur fracture that has to be repaired is going to be a long time in the healing. Femur fractures are extremely painful and dangerous due to their proximity to the femoral artery. But as far as surgery goes if the Doc knows what he's doing it's a long but fairly safe procedure. Good luck! 3
What does deferred sentence mean? I dont really get the definition in my book which states the following: a sentence that delays conviction on a guilty plea until the sentenced offender has successfully served his or her probation term." The only part i dont get is where it says the offender serves his/her probation term, doesnt the criminal serve probation after being sentenced to jail or something!! that def., just doesnt make sense to me!! What do u think? I've always been of the understanding that a deferred sentence means that; if a person is found guilty of an offence they can be sentenced to say one year in prison deferred for a period of two years. And what that means is that if during that period of two years (the probationary period) no further offence is committed, the one year sentence will not be applied. Converseley, if within that two year period a further offence is committed then the original sentence is automatically added to whatever sentence is given for the later conviction.\n\nSo. If Mr Smith steals a car and is found guilty of the crime, he is sentenced to one year in prison deferred for two years. If in that two years he is found guilty of stealing a second car and is sentenced to one year in prison for that crime, he will go to prison for two years. If in the same two years he doesn't steal another car or commit any other offence, he doesn't go to prison at all.\n\nIGNORE THE ABOVE\n\nSorry young lady I got this wrong. I was confusing deferred conviction with suspended sentencing. They are similar but not the same. I checked with one of my colleagues today and the definition you are looking for is as follows:\n\n'Deferred adjudication is available in some jurisdictions for certain offenses. It often involves probation, treatment programs, and/or some type of community supervision. If all the conditions of probation are met for the allotted time handed down by the court, the offender can avoid a formal sentence, and in some jurisdictions, no permament record of the crime will be made. Typically, at the end of the probationary period the charge will be dismissed and no record of conviction will result. Deferred adjudication may be available to eligible defendants upon recommendation by the prosecutor or at the discretion of the court'.\n\nSorry for the error. Slight difference between UK law and US law. I Hope I didn't cause you too much inconvenience.\n\nMy apologies also to the person who posted first and then withdrew after I posted. His answer was nearer to being correct than my first effort was. 10

what increases the risks of leukemia?  These are the known causes of AML:\n\nExposure to high doses of irradiation, as carefully studied in the Japanese survivors of atomic bomb detonations.\n\nExposure to the chemical benzene, usually in the work place.\n\nExposure to chemotherapy used to treat cancers such as breast cancer, cancer of the ovary or the lymphomas. Alkylating agents and topoisosomerase inhibitors are most frequently associated with higher risk.\n\nTherapeutic radiation, depending on the dose and setting.\n\nThe current causes of ALL are not known at this time.\n\nSuspected causes of Leukemia are viruses and exposure to environmental contaminants (pesticides, MTBE, etc...). My daughter Alex was diagnosed at the age of 10 months with AML. I personally believe that environmental contamination causes Leukemia (particularly in pediatric patients) but there's no definitive research at this time.\n\n-- T 2

what's behind the jumping beans? what makes them jump? It's doubtful (or very rare) that they actually "jump" above the surface of the ground, but they can certainly roll and tumble along in different directions. Just as pineapples are not apples and peanuts are not nuts, the jumping bean is not a bean, nor is it a seed. It is actually a small, thin-shelled section of a seed capsule containing the larva of a small gray moth called the jumping bean moth (Laspeyresia saltitans). After consuming the seed within the capsule section, the robust, yellowish-white larva has the peculiar habit of throwing itself forcibly from one wall to the other, thereby causing the jumping movements of the capsule. Mexican jumping bean capsules typically separate into three parts or sections, some of which contain a moth larva. It is these separate sections (technically called carpels) that are sold as "jumping beans." 2

An Arab sheik is old and must will his fortune to one of his two sons.? He makes a proposition. His two sons will use their computers, and whichever computer gets a blue screen of death first will win the fortune for its owner. During the race, the two brothers do nothing on their computers, neither willing to risk not getting a blue screen of death. In desperation, they ask a wise man for advice. He tells them something; then the brothers immediately jump onto the computers and start installing new hardware, sharing files, and downloading hastily written security updates. What did the wise man say? the wise man told them to use each other's computers... I like this joke better when it's about racehorses 8

who is the 1st human in the world and why did god creat the world ? i think jesus and beacus he want to have people This is a poorly worded question. You assume the answer. You assume that someone or something named god "creat the world" and that man just appeared. \n\nSecond you've already given your answer that the first person's name is jesus. This doesn't agree with the stories in your bible.\n\nAnd while you are at it, read it and maybe you'll understand why god creat the world. It says so in your bible. That is one of many bibles, by the way.\n\nBut of course, this is just one story. There are many creation stories from many different religions. 6
When you shoot the ball,should you flick your wrist or not? When I shoot the ball I flick my wrist, but most of the time it doesn't go in.There is one person on my team that he doesn't flick his wrist and when he shoots it it goes in the basket.My dad says that when I shoot I rush my shot.I rush my shot sometimes,but when I don't it still doesn't go in.Can somebody please give me a tip that helps the ball go in the basket. Yes, if you flick the wrist it helps keep your hand straight and that will help with keeping your aim true.  There are several reasons why when you shoot and it doesn't go in - your mechanics might be off, your body isn't squared to the basket, you start your shot too early or too late (mainly the rushing you mentioned) you take your eyes off your target, etc.\n\nThe key is to make sure your body is square to the basket when you're setting up to shoot.  Basically this means that your body is perpendicular to the plane of the rim as you're facing it.  (This doesn't apply for layups and hooks and shots like that, just jump shots.)  Second, when you jump to shoot, always shoot it at the peak of your jump, not when you're about to land or just as you jump.  Wait a split second, when you reach the height of your jump, you should be letting go of the ball.  Third, your arm should be straight up, elbow bent at close to 90 degrees hands cradling the ball before straightening up to shoot, palms do NOT touch the ball, shoot with your fingertips.  Roll the ball off the tips, and flick the wrist (that'll give it that spin, too) to follow through with the shot.  Make sure you put a bit of an arc on it - don't shoot it like a Shaq free throw!  (He throws it straight at the hoop - giving it virtually no chance of going in.  You want an arc; a good arc would be around a 25 degree angle or so.  Check out Jordan's shot or Bird's - or even some of the better 3-pt shooters nowadays, you'll see that arc.)\n\nLastly, PRACTICE!  Practice, practice, practice.  It's the only way to really start nailing your shot.  I should know - I'm 6'7" (thanks to my dad's genes) and I have a great jump shot due to all the time I put into it. 6

About how long does it take to be accepted or denied to a college once you apply?  The applications for most universities are due between November and December, and most of them respond with an acceptance or denial around late February to early March.  So, it takes about 3 months, but varies according to the size and popularity of the school.  A large, public, state university may take a little more time, and a small liberal arts university may take a little less time due to the volume of applications. 4

what laptop computor is the best.?  Every answer above is what 90% of the population believes. Dell, HP...etc. I have done a lot of research into this subject. You need to know about OEM and ODM companies. A great place to get information on this and all notebook questions is at notebookforums.com\n\nPeople who are "in the know" buy notebooks from companies such as Sager, Prostar, Hypersonic, Alienware and my favorites are Falcon-NW (luxury) & ASUS. ASUS makes some of the best built most stylish laptops available. Do a Google search to find online resellers. Most of the ones I listed above are not to be found in a store but rather online.  If you must have follow the pack and get an average laptop from a local electronic store then I would suggest HP. Stay away from Emachines at all costs! As well as anything from Fry's...not good to deal with them. Good luck! 5
Is Taiwan a country?  Yes!! Taiwan is  a country but most of countries don’t admit it because of china. China just want Taiwan to be apart of them, yet it's independent and it is a country not a county! it has its own currency national flag even president so please don’t call it a county of china it's a country- Taiwan thank you! ^^\nBy the way here's for "naklubyob" do you know why Taiwan couldn't use their own flag in Olympics (in fact the flag in Olympics wasn't their national flag) they couldn't use their flag because china gave pressures to Greek, not only Greek but also every country. And they were afraid of China for China's great power of economy. \n<sorry for my seriousness..> 10
Why the all the waves come to the coast of the beach?  All waves go outward from their source, they don't all go straight to the beach, that's just the only place you can see them.  Waves originate from wind and other forces causing water particles to build up and roll over and on top of one another...they are usually not very noticable until they come closer to shore and the compression between the particles is sent upward. 2

can you spred herpies if you do not have eany outbreakes and take acyclovir two times a day?  Yes. \nA person is considered contagious when prodromal symptoms, active sores, and healing lesions are present, however herpes can be potentially contagious when no symptoms are present. That is, a person who has genital herpes has the potential to always be shedding active virus. \n\nBut keep in mind that everyone is different-- all bodies and immune systems are different, and the longer you're infected, the less common any such outbreaks will occur. The physical ailment is minor compared to the mental anguish brought about by those in the world who "aren't infected," or simply not informed on such matters. Funny how many people in the world who have HSV (or-al canker sores) and think they DON'T have herpes. And yes, even that form of HSV can be spread from a person's mouth to their partner's genitals through or-al contact. \nEver wonder why there are so many Valtrex commercials on TV these days? The increase in infections has skyrocketed since the '70's. I think W caused that, too. ;) 3

how can i lose whight?  Exercise, and eating well.  Not a diet per say, but eating right.  Portion control is an important aspect to eating well, as well as omitting all the things in your diet that you know are bad for you.  Begin with a cardio work-out 3 times per week.  This can be as simple as walking fast.  I wouldn't run out and but a tredmill, but walking around your neighborhood until you know you are going to stick with it is a great start.\nWe all know the things we need to do to loose weight, it's just a matter of commitment. 3

What is the definition of a terrorist?  One who utilizes the systematic use of violence and intimidation to achieve political objectives, while disguised as a civilian non-combatant. The use of a civilian disguise while on operations exempts the perpetrator from protection under the Geneva Conventions, and consequently if captured they are liable for prosecution as common criminals.\nwww.aeroflight.co.uk/definitions.htm\n\n\nhttp://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&oi=defmore&defl=en&q=define:Terrorist\n\nThe exact definition of terrorism is highly controversial. According to one of the primary working definitions, it is the unconventional use of violence against civilians for political gain. It is a strategy of using coordinated attacks that fall outside the laws of war commonly understood to represent the bounds of conventional warfare (see also unconventional warfare). 4

good morning america, why if you r so conservative at least 50% did this movie broken back mountain do so well at the box office this is a confusing statistic that i do not understand i would like to hear from conservatives as well as my new found homosexual\nintelectuall writers, and all inbetween.was it to be better informed,or u didnt know the content of the picture show,or just curious,i would go out of curiosity,thanks for your participation, Depends on what you mean by conservative. I think that people in the USA still believe in free will, in the free market, in self-responsibility, and in people's right to pursue life, liberty and happiness. The fact that one movie, which has homosexual content, does well doesn't take away from that fact. The majority of people in the USA probably still find homosexuality to be uncomfortable, but most people are accepting of gay folks until their behavior becomes very public and intrusive.\n\nNow, people go to movies to be entertained. They know the content of movies before they go. People went to this movie because the reviews were positive. Most people like good stories and that is what Brokeback Mountain was--a good story. It wasn't made to "make a point" it was well-done, and it wasn't intrusive. That is what entertainment is about. 1
Are there any profession volley-tennis players? Or could I be the first one, if I try out for it? In case some of you don't know what that is, it's volleyball played on a tennis court. The ball can only hit the ground once on each side before being fist-hit to the other side. I love the game! well for it to be professional you'd have to be on a team that pays  you. and for a team to pay you they need sponsorships. and for a team to get sponsorships they need to find a sport that a lot of people watch or  know about or go to, and i think at this time volley-tennis isnt in that category. sorry. you can still try and set up some games for fun around your area. 6

non-profit question again? okay okay, I got one answer, not really in agreement. So I am gonna take a shot at it again.\nHow can a business like a credit union be non-profit when they have many branches open in the county(the only way to have those branches is by making a profit)\nand installing/upgrading the bank system, only possible way for that is making a profit.remember when answering,\nnon-profit is - not commercially motivated\ntherefore opening branches in different locations is equal to commercial the way I see it\nmaybe someone can enlighten me more? Non-profit does not = not making money.  It also does not mean volunteer.  A non-profit corporation plows all the money it makes beyond salaries and operating expense either back into the business or distributes the money for a charitable purpose.\n\nA non-profit is defined by its tax status, not by whether or not it brings in a lot of money.  The Red Cross, for example, has many many local branches and brings in millions.  But it is non-profit. \n\nA properly-organized credit union is tax-exempt under 501(c)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code. 7
how do i open a paypal account. is forex enterprise.com a scam sight?  For the first, go to Paypal, website (link below), then click "sign up now" to walk yourself through setting up an account.\n\nRegarding Forex, I don't know if it's a "scam", but it certainly is a repacking of several different questionable techniques that are each designed for someone to work independently.   While the results they generate and advertise are probably atypical, the businesses involved are legitimate, but from my evaluation of them, involve more effort than you're led to believe. 7

The fact that they are called SKILLS is your clue - A SKILL is something that a)you can learn and b) improves with practice. 7
how could i install program to other drive?  It depends on the program.\n\nMost professional programs will allow you to choose between a CUSTOM INSTALL and an Express Install.  If so, choose CUSTOM INSTALL.  This will allow you to choose program features to install and, usually, the installation folder.  For the installation folder, there will usually be a BROWSE button.  Click on that and select the drive and folder for the installation.\n\nIf there isn't a CUSTOM INSTALL choice, you still might be presented with a default folder and a BROWSE button.  Click on the BROWSE button and select the drive and folder you want to use.\n\nNOTE:  Most programs allow you to type in your own folder name, even if it doesn't already exist.  These programs will usually tell you the folder doesn't exist and ask your permission to create the folder.  Click YES or OK to create the folder.\n\nI highly suggest that you keep a well-organized naming scheme throughout your use of the computer.\n\nEXAMPLE:  I have a C:&#92;Program Files&#92; under which I have a lot of program folders.  I also have a D:&#92;Program Files&#92; with program folders under that (this is where I put utilities and small applications).  Finally, I have an E:&#92;Program Files&#92; with program folders under that (this is where I install games). 5

what is flushing response?  Flush: (1) A redness of the skin, typically over the cheeks or neck. A flush is usually temporary and brought on by excitement, exercise, fever, or embarrassment. Flushing is an involuntary (uncontrollable) response of the nervous system leading to widening of the capillaries of the involved skin. Also referred to as a blush (or, as a verb, to blush). Flushing may also be caused by medications or other substances that cause widening of the capillaries, such as niacin. (2) Flush also means to wash out a wound or body area.\n\nI hope this helps...\n\nDon 3
how should i fell and deal with a stressful situation? my g/f showed naked pic of her chest to guys that want to get with her and she knows it...but tells me it no big deal..that she loves me and atlease it wasnt further down on her body by her doing that says a ton of stuff about her.\nshe has a low self-esteem and enjoys the attention of any man who gives it. because of this SHE WILL CHEAT ON YOU! maybe not now, or soon, but one day she will cheat.\nunless she becomes comfortable with herself, you will never be able to do enough for her, that she will not seek "satisfaction" from another.\nunless you want an open sexuall relationship with her, get out now. the longer you wait the harder it will be.\nTHIS IS A BIG DEAL! don't let her bat her eyelashes and convince you its not. 9

If you have twelve golf balls....? If you have twelve golf balls, and one of them is not the same weight as the rest, how can you discover which one weighs more or less, and whether it weighs more or less, with only 3 weighings on a balance scale? Split them up into two groups of 6.\nWeigh them.\nTake the heavier group and split them up into two groups of 3.\nWeigh them.\nTake the heavier group and leave one off the balance, and one on each side of the balance.\nIf one balance side is heavier, you've found your ball. If not, the one that wasn't weighed is the heavier one. 8
Is it possible to safely drive a car up a truck ramp while both vehilcles move at 60 mph - KnightRider? I think the car will launch through the top of Devan's truck, killing everyone inside. It actually would be possible, yes.  The momntum of the car doesn't really change when it drives onto the ramp.  if the ramp is smooth enough then the tires will just spin and the car won't launch through the roof.  If the ramp has enough traction then this trick would be hard on the transmission would probabaly kill a stick shift, but again the car would not launch through the roof. 2

Was my revenge, too much? I caught my boyfriend sleeping with another girl, in our bedroom. It drove me,insane. So, I got back at him. About a week later, I waited until he was coming home from work, he walked in on me have trip penatration with three hot hunks. He started screaming and yelling, but at the time, I couldn't even smile because my mouth was full, not to mention I was man slam from both ends, I felt so much better. Okay, I know this is a bit much to read, but...I had a guy that cheated on me 5 times.  No, I didn't know about it until AFTER we broke up.  I didn't know what to do.  I ALMOST(really, REALLY considered) having sex with his sister's ex...which that was an on-again-off-again thing...but I didn't.  Then I thought about being friends with him again...that didn't work out 'cause he messed with my little brother and I thought about kicking some major butt but, again...didn't.  The reason why is really insane:  I still loved him at that point.  Don't ask me why because I don't know now.  Maybe I thought he'd come back crying(but he was the one that dumped me).  Karma hit him where it hurt quicker than I thought.\nApparently, one of the girls he cheated on me with got pregnant by him and wouldn't you know it...nine months later he was landed with the responsibility of fatherhood.  A few months after that, another girl got pregnant.  HA!  This was too good.  Anyways, after getting over the breakup(in a record time of a few weeks), I found this current guy that I've been with for 9 months and a few weeks.  KARMA ROCKS!  So, if you took Karma into your hands, that's great...even the threefold law works since he cheated once and you hit him 3 times as hard.  Buuuut....I think that if you went that far you might just be a little on the evil side(but who am I to judge, babe?).  Maybe you should post a pic of your cheater on the site I have listed...after all, there's too much girl power I can't resist. 1

Beard area on my face has become very rough. how to set it right? Due to improper way(stressing too much) of shaving my beard, the whole area has become so rough that it is not possible to have a comfortable shave.\nI end up having blisters in the neck region.\nIs there a way to smoothen my skin in that area? It sounds like you have "pseudo-folliculitis barbae". Basically, you have ingrown hairs caused by shaving. Unfortunately, there is not much of a treatment option out there. Some dermatologists are using new age lasers to treat but there is not a high success rate and it's very expensive. Some men try to alternate razors with electric shavers, but it doesn't really help too much. You may need to grow and maintain a beard. In the meantime, you can try doing an internet search. Just watch your pocket for quacks that claim to cure you. Insurance won't pay for these treatments...p 3
what will happen in future? And which country will rule the world would it be USA,Russia or China?  I wouldn't count on the US... global warming is melting the frozen lands of Siberia, where there are vast ammounts of natural resources. So if your choice is just because you think Russia is a pour country, think again. And remember that noone defeated Russia, they couldn't even take over one single town! (Stallingrad). And if you're just being patriotic when you say that US will rule, good for you. I love america too. I'm from Europe. 10
Why isn't dance considered a sport like ice skating & gymnastics?  It isn't considered a sport because unlike gymnastics and iceskating, people that dance don't compete in big competitions like the Olympics. I don't think that's fair because people get excersize from dance just like the other sports, but that's my oppinion and that's not what you asked. Anyway, that's why I think dance isn't considered a sport. 6

what is the difference in the feelings behind the statements"I LOVE YOU" and"I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU."? can utell how could you tell by a persons actions if they love you or are IN love with you or still in love with you blah blah Loveing someone is a lot different than being in love with someone. loveing someone is like you care about them and would never hurt them. but being in love with someone makes you have a sparkle in your eye when you look at them and when they look at you and wanting to be with them all the time. but dont confuse that with infatuation. people who have been marries 50 years can love eachother a lot but they cant always be in love with eachother. Its takes a lot to stay in love with someone for such a long time but you'll love them unconditionally. 9
what is the storage capacity of the human brain, i.e how much information can it store at a particular time ?  The brain has an unlimited measureless capacity for storage. With each new fact learned - especially in infancy & early childhood - you get a new wrinkle in your brain. No kidding! Check out brain weights of really supersmart folks like Einstein, you will be surprised! But there is no limit to what your brain can hold & it even takes in things you aren't aware of - all while running your body, as well. 2

When did Standard Amnerican English evolve? When did "American English" become the standard? What "English" did the Founding Fathers speak? (British, American, a mixture?) Different dialects of English have different standards.  Standard American English is the standard for many Americans, but British people have a different standard, and so forth.  So American English isn't really the standard for everyone (although it is for many if they have economic or cultural ties to the United States).\n\nAs for how the standard evolved, there have always been standards.  In general, the dialect of whoever's in power is considered the standard, because people want to be like that powerful group.  Americans who are trying to speak Standard American English do so because they think it will give them social power.  What's interesting, though, is that Standard American English is just agreed upon as the standard by many Americans even though it doesn't belong to a particular region.\n\nThe Founding Fathers spoke a dialect that is different from either American dialects or British dialects today.  They were British, but in the meantime English has evolved in both places. 1

How does Direct Democracy work in Switzerland?  Switzerland is the best current example of direct democracy, using both initiative and referendum.  In the initiative process, citizens gather petitions to force an election (referendum) on a proposed law.  In Switzerland over the last 120 years, about 240 issues have been put to referendum, only about 10% have gained approval.  At lower levels, referenda only require a majority of voters to pass, but at the national level, both a majority of voters and a majority of voting states are required.  This prevents states with small populations from being unfairly represented.  The Swiss got the idea of double majority from the US Congress, which has both the House of Representatives (representation proportional to population of each state) and the Senate (same representation for each state) 10

What helps Carpal Tunnel Syndrome?  Rest your fingers, hand, and wrist. Stop activities that you suspect are causing numbness and pain. \nIce your wrist for 10 to 15 minutes at a time, as often as once or twice an hour, and take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to relieve pain and reduce swelling. They may help you to relieve symptoms. \nWear a wrist splint at night to keep your wrist in a neutral position and relieve pressure on your median nerve. See an illustration of a wrist splint. \nAlso, do simple range-of-motion exercises with your fingers and wrist to prevent stiffening. Stop if you have pain or numbness. \nGood luck. 3
Why is everything round or square in this world? All objects! It's because the world in question is ruled by unicorns and merry elves. In "that" world it's only natural that everything is either square or circle. Here of course we have irregular shapes and other geometrical figures like triangles, trapezoids and such. Must sound very strange to you I believe.\n\nUs earthlings, we have strange ways. 2
In the Voodoo religion is it actually possible to transfer one's person's soul to another person's body?  I will not preach and give my opinion like others have.  I believe the question you are asking is if practitioners of voodoo *believe* it is possible.\n\nI believe they do.  In voodoo, a person has two souls.  One soul is given at birth, then deposited in a soul reservoir for other beings to use when they are born (like reincarnation).\n\nThe other soul leaves the body at night (like outer-body experiences).  I believe it is possible for this part soul to possess others.\n\nMy brother-in-law would know for certain, as his father is a voodoo healer.  I will edit my answer tomorrow if I talk to him or my sister. 1
what does bahhumbug mean? well i have this shirt but i dont know if i can wear it to school Actually, bah and humbug are two different words. Bah is an interjection to express impatient rejection or contemp, while humbug, in this case, would be a noun meaning something intended to decieve; a hoax or fraud.\n\nSo what Scrooge (which is where I'm guessing you got this phrase) was basically expressing contempt for Christmas, which he considered a great hoax. 4

quick way to make $400? does anyone know a legal way to make $400 dollars quickly, like in a month or 2? Sell some things you no longer need. Ebay is great but using the local paper is fine too. Got a lot of stuff and/or friends with stuff hold a garage sale. Another thing you might want to consider is a job with a temp agency. Around where I live you can make very good money with a temporary job assignment and the agency will find you the job. 7

People say you should workout every other day. Does this also apply to martial arts?  Like was stated earlier, it's a matter of what you're aiming for.  If you're just now getting into it, and are using it for self-defense, exercise, or just the knowledge, then whatever you feel comfortable with is going to be enough as you'll learn at your own pace what your body is comfortable with.\nHowever, for the past few years, I myself have been training 10-12 hours a day 6 days a week with Sunday's off. That includes weight training, cardio training, as well as in cage training, sparring, and learning new techniques. The more you wish to advance the more training it will take. The more time you devote to it, the faster you'll advance and the more you'll learn. 6

ACT v/s SAT? I am not sure if I should take the ACT or SAT.  What is the difference? Someone told me you only take the SAT if you are going out of state, is that true? It depends on which colleges you are interested in. Some prefer one over the other, but the vast majority of colleges accept scores from either exam. Check to see if the ones you want to apply to have a preference.\n\nOut-of-state vs. in-state is not an issue. 4
Can you prove that a sequence of numbers is not randomly generated? Is there a definitive method by which to prove that a sequence of numbers is not randomly generated or can you only access the probability of that sequence occuring? No.  You can't definitively "prove" a sequence of numbers is not randomly generated by just looking at the numbers, but you can still draw conclusions with a high degree of confidence.\n\nFor example, it is extremely unlikely that a random number generator will produce the same number twenty times in a row, but technically, it is possible.  So seeing this happen doesn't prove it's not random, but you can still conclude that it's not. 2

At what age do you think, a boy should should already know how to swim?  It's different for everyone.  I don't like the idea of being too forceful, but I also don't like the idea of leaving it completely up to the child.  Some kids will NEVER try if not pushed a bit.  A class would definitely help- sometimes being taught by someone who's not a parent or close relative can speed things along.  People develop at different rates, but generally speaking, a child can easily learn how to swim by the age of 5. 6
IS IT WEIRD TO BE SINGLE AT AGE 16?  No, it isn't weird at all to be single at age 16. It just means that you are taking things slowly and that you will probably have a better boyfriend later on. 7
can a man have bigger breast?  Yes, this is called gynecomastia and can occur in men who take female hormones (for whatever reason) and some other medications (such as cimetidine and spironolactone). This can also happen in patients with several disorders: chronic liver disease, hyperthyroidism, testicular tumors, klinefelter's syndrome, and many more. 3
Do you believe people should stop saying Merry Christmas because it has the word Christ in it? I heard in the news people at wal-mart were not allowed to say Merry Christmas because of the word Christ.  Is this really necessary?  Give your opinion. People should definitely be allowed to say "Merry Christmas" if they want to.  But the point is, stores do have customers who don't celebrate Christmas, and Christmas is a religious holiday.  So if a store like Walmart wants to be inclusive of all holidays, why can't they?  What's wrong with "Happy Holidays?"  It includes Christmas.  Christmas is the religion of the majority, but the majority of people are also white.  Should Walmart say "Merry Christmas, White People" ?  Of course not!  There is nothing wrong with an inclusive sentiment.  Bill O'Reilly is wrong on this one. Happy holidays is a sentiment that speaks to the majority and the minorities -- what's wrong with that?  Seriously -- some people don't believe in Christ or in Christmas -- why no be inclusive of all in this season?  It's completely wrong to punish stores for trying to send a message that is religion-neutral and in general good spirits. 1
HELP WANTED ! ! Girlfriend Problem...Over Possessive? I am in a long distance relationship, though we meet every 3-4 months.\nMy gf is too possessive about me and does not like me meeting any girl, even though she maybe my friend.\nAnd when I do, she throws a big fit...\nWHAT SHOULD I DO?\nI love her very much Its a hard thing, long distance. One thing is that if your girlfriend loves you and you love her, then she should be willing to understand that there are people in your path that are female that you will have to deal with. If she cant understand that, then she doesnt love you enough to get over her fear. \n\nThe only way that it should be okay for you to meet other females is, business, a friend's girlfriend's friend is ok too if its just hi how are you and thats it. There will be many times where you will be put in front of a female and what does you girlfriend expect you to do? Bow your head and avoid eye contact? Even I wouldn't want that for my man. \n\nIf you are meeting this (other) girl socially, and she is attracted to you and makes you aware that she is attracted, then get the hell out of there. If it's just a female that is new to your group of friends and you meet her, but she is a regular girl that isnt flirting or attracted to you, its ok. \n\nI hope that being an adult you know the difference and can control yourself. But controlling yourself shouldn't be a problem cause you did say you loved your girlfriend. \n\nSo, to finish up, you need to remain a good man and she needs to step up as a grown woman and push her fear to the side so she doesnt badger you with it. Especially if you arent doing anything wrong. 9

Find the minimum number of chances? There are 100 floors.there are two bulbs . both the bulbs are designed to the same threshold level(floor).ie for example if they are designed for floor number 20.then they will break if they are dropped from or above floor number 20. you can go to any floor (directly )and can drop the bulb.what is minimum number of chances(drops) to find the theshold of the bulb. You can find the floor in a maximum of 14 attempts.\n\nDrop a bulb from the floors in this order:14, 27, 39, 50, 60, 69, 77, 84, 90, 95, 99, 100\n\nIf the bulb breaks, stop and test starting from just above the last floor that it didn't break on, and go up one floor at a time. If the bulb breaks on the first attempt, resume the test from the first floor.\n\nExamples:\n14 (breaks), 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13\n14, 27, 39 (breaks), 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38\n14, 27, 39, 50, 60, 69, 77, 84, 90, 95, 99 (breaks), 96, 97, 98\n14, 27, 39, 50, 60, 69, 77, 84, 90, 95, 99, 100 (breaks) 2

How do you tell your guy best friend that you love him? even though we have different beliefs?  Tell him you love him, respect your differences and don't try to change his beliefs to match your own.  And be prepared to lose your best guy friend, because once you become lovers it is very difficult to salvage the friendship if the relationship doesn't work out. Remaining friends after being lovers happens sometimes, but not often. 9

what is the name of the company who product the cd rom for the first time in the history?  The CD-ROM Yellow Book standard was established in 1985 by Sony and Philips.

Probibility? You have 3 objects and two chances to get the "right" one. What are your chances? Is it 66%? I thought about it and if you you have a 33% chance the first time, and a 50% chance the second time, how don't you have an 83% chance? Sometimes, it's easier to find the probability of the opposite case you are looking for.  This is one of those times.  Try to find the probability that you don't get the right one.\n\nAfter taking you two chances, one of the three objects is left.  What are the chances that this one that is left is the right one? The one that is left is one of three, so there is a 33.3% chance that it is left behind- which means there is a 33.3% chance that you DID NOT get the right one.  Therefore, there is a 66.7% chance that you WILL get the right one. \n\nIf you are still not convinced, it is easy to show that your reasoning that got you to 83% is wrong.  What if you used the same reasoning with 4 objects and 3 chances to get the "right" one.  Your logic would say there is a 25% chance the first time, a 33% chance the second time, and a 50% chance the third time.  If you just added them (as you did to get 83%), you would find that 25% + 33% + 50% = 108%.  Clearly you can't have a percentage above 100%, which illustrates the problem with that reasoning.\n\nHere's why that reasoning dosn't work; 33% of the times you play this game, your second try has a 0% probability of getting the right one because you already got it on the first try.  The other 66% of the times you play the game, your second try has a 50% probability.  So the AVERAGE probaility of the second try is (33.3% x 0%) + (66.7% x 50%), or 33.6%.  Add this 33.3% to the 33.3% probability of the first try, and you get the correct answer of 66.7%.\n\nIf you still aren't convinced, come over some time for a "friendly" game of dice. 2
I am 31 years old. i work in a elevator company. i have a boyfriend but one of the machanics are hot.? He flurts with me and i decided to go out with him last weekend. he is happily married though and says he wants to see me again. but when i see him at work he doesn't talk to me. i don't know what happen on are date i kind of got sick and broke his car door. do you think that why he is not talking to me or becuause we at work. He is not talking to you because you are at work, he is married, and do not want other people to know and may be tell his wife. Obviously he just wants you for self-satisfaction, so if all you want is to have sex then go for it, if you think you may want something else, then stop it or you will get extremelly hurt. 9
you like someone and they like you, but all he wanted was sex . it was good but he is afraid to commit,?  Commitment is a natural evolution of any long-term, healthy relationship. It isn't given, it is gradually built on strong foundations made of trust and love.\n\nGetting too deep, too quick, is usually enough to scare many out of any kind of serious commitment. Contrary to popular belief, not only with men, but women too. \n\nTo be brutally honest with you, if all this fella wanted from you, was sex, the chances of him pledging anything, are extremely low.\n\nI wish you all the best in your quest for assuring love. 9

So if you try it and it doesnt work for you you can get different products or your money back. \n\nAlso it is so important that when you are using skin care you use one line be it Mary Kay or Avon or a Walmart brand. They are formulated to work with one another. Mixing products not designed to work together can cause reactions in some people. ;) Hope this was helpful!!\n\nMeganHill@MaryKay.com if you need anything else\nwww.MaryKay.com/MeganHill to check out the line\n\nMegan 3
Specific Heat of a Metallic Alloy? A piece of a metallic alloy weighing 36.0 g at 178.0 oC is placed into 185.0 g of water at 25.0 oC in an insulated container. The final temperature of the system (water and alloy) was 30.6 oC. What is the specific heat of the metallic alloy, assuming no heat loss to the surroundings? (Specific heat of water: 4.184 J/g.K) When the metal enters the water, it begins losing heat to the water. At the same time the temperature of the water rises. This process continues until the temperature of the metal and the temperature of the water are equal st which point (30.6oC) no net flow of heat occurs. The heat lost by a gained system is given by (mass)(Specific heat)(change in temp.)First calculate the heat gained by the water, then calculate the specific heat of the metal.\n\nTemp rise in the water - \n   (change in temp) 30.6 - 25.0 = 4.4\n\nHeat gained by water - \n              \n   (185.0)    (4.184J)/(g oC)  (4.4) = 3.4*10 pwr3 J\n\nThe metal dropped into the water must have the same temp as the water (30.6)\n\nTemp drop by the metal - \n   (Change in temp) = 178-30.6 = 147.4\n           \n Specific heat = \n(heat)/(mass)(change in temp)\n\nSpecific heat of the metal =\n(3.4*10 pwr3)\n(36g)(147.4)\n             \n=0.640 J/g oC\n\nhope this helps. good luck 2

What do you think are some ways that our education system can be improved? America has the access to the most resources of anyone in the world, and we spend the most on education. So why is the average American child stupider than kid's in other countries. I want your veiw on why America's youth don't stack up against other's, and how it can be fixed. Please recomend any legislation that should be formed to help. As a recent immigrant, I've noticed that the three most obvious differences to Europe are...\n\n(1) Tenure. Underperforming teachers must be fired. Tenure is ridiculous.\n\n(2) Underfunding is common world-wide. However, bizarrely in the US, non-critical programs are not cut first. In Europe underfunded schools focus on Math and English, all else is sacrificed before these. However it appears social studies and other non-critical courses continue regardless of overall funding.\n\n(3) You must stream kids based on skills. It is ludicrous to think a "no child is left behind" system will work, a more apt name would be "no child allowed to get ahead".\n\nBeyond this, I would suggest, get parents out of the class room, (no idea why this is thought to be a good idea in the US) and bring back discipline. 10
Sadie Hawkins dances? Do you like them? Why or Why not?  Sadie Hawkins dances seemed like a good idea way back when girls wouldn't dare ask a boy to a regular dance.  These days the idea of a Sadie Hawkins dance to encourage girls to be forward seems kind of out of place.  Now I think girls are free to make the first move whenever they want.  Maybe there are still enough girls that need the extra encouragement of a Sadie Hawkins dance to get the courage up, but my guess is that there are more girls than boys doing the asking these days anyway. 9

Is this illegal when making a demo tape? Is it illegal to use the same lyrics and beat as someone else to make a demo tape? For example, remaking one of Mario's songs and sending it to the record companies. Can I get sued for that? If you are not distributing the material publicly, nobody will say anything. However new artists can't expect to be signed unless they demo original material, from what I've seen. Anyone can do covers, and unless you're doing them on American Idol, you really can't expect to make any headway with it, unless your interpretation is really different and better than the original (i.e. the way Joe Cocker redid "With a little Help from My Friends")\n\nWrite your own stuff - either yourself or with a partner. Your odds, though still long, will be a lot better. 8

Do you think the U.S. will build a super Wal-mart and a MacDonalds in Bahgdad? Do you think Sadam would like a "Big Mac"? I hear he already loves "Fritos"!!! The US government will not build a private corporation in Iraq. However, there is a strong liklihood that some sort of freiegn Wal*Mart and McDonald's will be built in Iraq.  Both already have a presence in other Mid East nations. If the security of Irawq gets better and the economy improves, then the Capitalistic American way would require that they be built in Iraq. 10

Opinion: What are the odds of Seattle Seahawks winning their first playoff game since the 80's? If you have sources---great...but I just want other people's opinion....please no bad "karma" or jinxing my team....:) Their is no doubt in my mind that the Seahawks are going to win this weekend.  They have a strong defense going against a weak offense (the Skins put up less than 150 yards against the Bucs),and Seattle has the league MVP in their backfield.  Lets not forget that Seattle's D isn't shaby either Seattle has the 7th best D in the league only giving up 16.9 points per game against a Washington offense that has only produced the 13th best scoring offense putting up 22.4 points a game.  Yes Washingtons D is better than Seattles but The Seahawks had the best Scoring Offense in the League this year scoring 28.2 points a game.  Look their is no chance the Skins will come out of Seattle with a win. 6

Is it possible to lose 25lbs in 16 weeks?  Yes, and in a healthy way.\n\nYou want to set a goal of losing 1-2 lbs a week...in the beggining, it's ok to lose 3 lbs per week, but this will average out to be 1-2 lbs during the 16 weeks.\n\nTry Weight Watchers, LA Weigh Loss, or other groups and they'll support you and teach you how to control your calories to lose 1-2 lbs a week. It's not as hard as it appears, just take baby steps and focus on the individual week!\n\nYou should only be exercising <cardio : step, treadmill, jumping jacks, rollerblading, swimming> 3-4 times a week.  You're biggest part is controling what goes into your body: <diet soda-pop or water>, <chips or vegtables>, <chocolate or strawberries>, <hamburgar or skinless chicken breast>.  I've found that my liquid controll <only WATER> helpes the fastest to drop the weight.  Seriously, the groups that offer weight loss programs are reasonably prices, and effective tools to teach you.\n \n16 x 2 = 32 lbs 3

If a 20 year old dude tried to talk to you and you were 12,should you talk to him? What if he was 17 yearsold? When I went skating with ny friends a 20 year old dude was tryin' to talk to me. Before that at the mall around Christmas I got a 17 year old boy's number. Is that wrong? Stop talking to other guys that are way older than you. if you were a couple years older i could see why. But you being 12 is unsafe. From bad experience, please be careful. There are plenty of perverted people out there. If you grow to know the person and your parents approve and know him, then I can't argue, but don't ever do it behind their backs. If something was to happen to you, they would have no idea who the person was. There are guys out there trying to hit on younger girls, not women, girls...then they lure the girl to meet them and call them, then the girl eventually never sows up again. Please please  be careful. You are too young right now. Stick to friends and school. 9
irans pres says holocost never happened and jerusalem should be destroyed.why is bush bashed over this tyrant?  Best to let the foolish prove themselves to be what they are. Bush tends to pick his battles. No need to even give this nut a platform on which to speak. If Bush answers his rediculous accusation, the press will look to him for a rebuttal. He's not worth the air time. 10

when we pray? does God listen to what we say or does the angels listen to what we say than tell him ? Does God answer everything we ask for ? I know sometimes the answers is no.thanks God listens to what we say. The reason we say In Jesus Name, Amen is because we are admitting that without Christ we wouldn't be able to talk to God. So we are talking through Christ but GOd hears us. God always answers and the answers are: yes, no, not now. He knows when we should recieve things, and if we should recieve them at all. So I guess we have to have Faith in HIm and trust that He will do what is best for you. God Bless! 1

Is opensource term being over exploited by Software Companies?  i don't think so.. It takes a lot of convincing to show managers and non-tech people why open source is so much better..

Managers can save money and finally have their IT staff focus on doing things other then 'securing the network' and running anti-virus software... 5

how does efficiency relate to machines? how does efficiency relate to machines? If you have a seesaw let's say and you place a 100 Lb weight on one end and push down the other end to raise the weight one foot, your "machine" has done 100 ft-lb of work.  You should expect to get 100 ft-lb of work back out of the machine as the weight drops one foot to its original position.  However, if the bearings at the pivot are let's say badly rusted and you have to push down 200 lbs to rais the 100 lb weight the machine is inefficient and when the 100 lb weight drops again perhaps it exerts only 50 lb force at the other end.  If you divide output by input and multiply by 100%, you can calculate the machine's efficience.  In our examples:\n\n     output/inputx100% = efficiency\n\n     100/100x100% = 100%  (frictionless machine)\n\n     100/200x100% =  50%  (rusty work in)\n\n      50/100x100% =  50%  (rusty work out) 2

what to talk about??!!? so this guy and i really like eachother .. whenever we are with a bunch of we always have stuff to talk about because everyone always has something to add. but whenever its just me and him i feel like i can never think of anything to say or talk about. hes sorta shy and i don't want it to be awkward for either of us when its just me and him. any advice??? DONT TALK ABOUT SEX. Not yet anyway. Find out all you can about him. His hobbies, ask in detail about his job, his family, school, vacations he may have gone on. Talk about things that interest you and things you have done. Like if you like art, talk about your favorite artist. Make sure to read the paper or watch the news so you can throw some into in about whats going on in the world. (don't get into a convo about ex's u want to keep the focus on the 2 of u and also dont get into a convo about religion or anything else that could get the 2 of u heated up) Unfortunatley the more uncomfortable u feel the more anxiety is going to build up and the worse the situation is going to be. Try to relax (i know its easier said than done) When you know the 2 of u are going to be alone try to come up with a list of questions u want to ask him before you see him.\nGOOD LUCK. Hope this help u out a bit. 9

Do you agree or disagree with Affirmative Action Why or Why not?  I disagree. Though it has had positive results, if our target is true equality then affirmative action wont get us there. Equality is not going to be found in concentrating so hard on who is black, who is white, and who is in between. True equality is going to be found when we finally learn not to care about race. Equality will come when people finally decide that race doesn't matter. With affirmative action race DOES matter. Race is a big deal. Race is everything. That isn't equality. 10
How many integers between 1 an 1000000 have the sum of their digits equal to 18?  I can show that the answer is 25927 without using computer.\n\n\nFirst, we can ignore 1000000 since its sum of digits is not 18. Also, let's add 0's in front of numbers to have 6 digits if the number has less than 6 digits. So our range is going to be from 000001 to 999999.\n\nNumber of partition of 18 into 6 whole number is\n(18+6-1)C(6-1)=(23)C(5). Assign these 6 numbers to the 6 digits.\n\nNow, we need to remove the cases where one digit is 10 or bigger. It is very good thing that two digits cannot be 10 or bigger, as the sum would go over 18.\n\nLet one digit has x, where x>=10. The sum of the other 5 digits is 18-x. Since 18-x is partitioned into 5 whole numbers, we have (18-x+4)C(4) possible ways. This should be multiplied by 6 since the big digit can be the first digit, second digit, ..., sixth digit. x is from 10 to 18. So we need to calculate 6((12)C(4) + (11)C(4) + .... + (4)C(4)).\n\nSince (n)C(m)+(n)C(m+1)=(n+1)C(m+1), we get\n(4)C(4) + (5)C(4) + (6)C(4) + (7)C(4) + .... + (12)C(4)\n=((5)C(5) + (5)C(4)) + (6)C(4) + (7)C(4) + .... + (12)C(4)\n=((6)C(5) + (6)C(4)) + (7)C(4) + .... + (12)C(4)\n...\n=(13)C(5). (This shows beauty of mathematics, doesn't it?)\n\nTherefore, the answer is (23)C(5)-6*(13)C(5)=25927. 2

Has Judas been unfairly blamed all this time?  All of us know one thing which is “LUST”or in another sense it is “GREED”, but I think both are nearly the same.\n\nLets see what bible says about a desire.\n\n“DESIRE WHEN BECOMES PREGNANT GIVES BIRTH TO SIN”.\n\nWe see that desire is the beginning of a Sin, it is the root of a sin. So when we have a look at the character of Judas ASCARIOT we find out that he kept all the money and arranged everything he was kind of a manager. But another thing he always took something from the money from himself, we see he was greedy and greed is the strongest of all desires. When this desire grew it changed into a great lust “THE LUST FOR MONEY”, and day by day it grew and grew and ONE DAY HIS LUST BECAME SO STRONG THAT IT SOLD THE CHRIST.\n\nAs we know it before when desire becomes pregnant it gives birth to a sin so his greed his desire for money made him mad, sin overtook him in the shape of desire. \n\nIt is very much symbolic because there was a fruit(something which we gain) in heaven for which man sold himself to Satan. And here in case of Jesus, Judas also took something shiny and good looking because in the garden of Eden Eve Saw. MANY PEOPLE ASK ME WHY DOES JESUS SAY HIMSELF AS SON OF MAN? THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT ADAM AND EVE SOLD THEMSELVES AND THEIR CHILDREN TO SATAN IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN, AND JESUS WAS ALSO SOLD BY JUDAS ASCARIOT TOTHE HANDS OF SATAN FOR CRUCIFICTION BECAUSE SON OF MAN ARE SOLD TO SATAN FOR PUNISHMENT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND HE WAS GOD(JESUS IS GOD AND MAN AT THE SAME TIME), SO HE DEFEATED DEATH AND BROUGHT SALVATION FOR US.\n\nGenesis 3:6\nAnd when the woman saw that the tree was good (suitable, pleasant) for food and that it was delightful to look at, and a tree to be desired in order to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate; and she gave some also to her husband, and he ate.\n\nWhen we see Judas also had something in his Sight which looked good the “THIRTY SHILLINGS”. SO THE SIN OF JUDAS ASCARIOT IS DESIRE(GREED AND LUST) WHICH SOLD JESUS. \n\nAnd I think questioning the text means nothing because we know what is the meaning because we believe that JUDAS ASCARIOT BETRAYED HIMSELF BY SELLING JESUS, JESUS ALREADY KNEW WHAT JUDAS WAS GONNA DO. JUDAS ASCARIOT WAS TESTED BY HIS OWN DESIRES AS IT IS SAID IN THE BIBLE THAT WE ARE TESTED BY OUR DESIRES. \n\nJUDAS'S DESIRE SHOULD BE BLAMED AND HE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR NOT CONTROLLING HIS DESIRE. THE BLAME ON HIM IS NOT WRONG.\n\nGOD BLESS EVERYBODY 1

Question on graphics in C/C++? I need to work on 3D graphical transformational. I am pretty good at C/C++ and have also worked on made basic figures, but only under Turbo C. Kindly guide me which IDE for Windows, and which book or any other resource would be best for learning and making them. Start by downloading a 3D development kit and study the API's and tutorials that are available in them.  Your choices are basically OpenGL or Direct3D.  Direct3D is a Microsoft product while OpenGL is a more open standard; if you have any experience with Microsoft development tools Direct3D might be the better choice.  If you prefer Linux use OpenGL. 5

if God appear to you in a human form will you believe? God If he appeared to me in human form - I would KNOW.  \n\nthey say "seeing is believing" this is not true though...  \n\nSeeing is KNOWING...\n\nI wouldn't  say "I believe the sky is blue"  No, I see it and I KNOW It is blue.  When the sun is out and no clouds are in the sky it IS blue.  \n\nTo believe in something -  you have to have faith that it is there - dispite not being able to see it or physically touch it.  So your question doesn't really hit on a true point. 1

Does in christianity eating pork and drinking wine is allowed?  Those who  call  themselves Christian & who believe that the Savior died so they can eat bugs & scavengers are from  the traditions of man (mainly Emperor Constantine & his Popes).\n\nTrue believers know that God does not change; that God's Laws are perfect; that it is willful heresy to "iinterpret" Scripture to justify  whatever they want to do.\n\nIn the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God... And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us.... Jesus is the Word, He always has been, the OT is the Word (Jesus) of God..., and in the NT, Jesus is incarnate. Of course He could explain the OT Scriptures so well - He is the Author. He didn't change & He didn't change Scripture - He prophesied it; He clarified it; He personified it! That is our advantage of being born AD - we have the blessing, of knowing the prophesies have come true (we get to be Doubting Thomas'), and of being given divine insights into Scripture.\n\nWhether we were born BC or AD is rather irrelevant, salvationwise. In the OT days of the Patriarchs & prophets, God justified the faithful by Grace; in NT-days, God still justifies the faithful by Grace.\n\nEating unclean animals is an abomination to God. 1

" IASHIN " ..the best goal keeper of all times ,, any informaton about this great Russian goal keeper ? Why he's the best ? any details ? Lev Yashin truly deserves the title of best goal keeper in the world. The way he helped his team, defending the goal position of his team had been a strong point for his team, giving them so many glorius wins. \n\nOne of his best performances was the 1963 FA Centenary match when he appeared in the 'Rest of the World XI' against England at Wembley Stadium and made a number of the breathtaking and almost unbelievable saves. Known all over the world as the 'Black Panther' for his distinctive all-black outfit, acrobatic saves and agility, he was feared by his opponents who also called him "Black Spider" and "Black Octopus" because of his very long hands.\n\nFor more detailed information, please visit the source 6

What is critical ethics?  Critical Ethics thinking is the intellectually disciplined process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, and/or evaluating information gathered from, or generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning .......\n\nIt require the utmost care in their specification and design to avoid errors in their implementation, using state of the art techniques in a responsible manner. \n\nTo do otherwise is at best unprofessional and at worst can lead to disastrous consequences. An inappropriate approach could lead to loss of life, and will almost certainly result in financial penalties in the long run, whether because of loss of business or because of the imposition of fines. \n\nLegislation and standards impose external pressures, but education and ethical considerations should help provide more self-imposed guidelines for all those involved in the production of safety-critical systems. This paper considers some of the issues involved, with pointers to material providing greater depth in particular areas, especially with respect to the use of formal methods. 1

Has there ever been a hole-in-one on a par 4 (or Par 5) on the PGA tour? If so, when?  On the PGA tour it was accomplished during the 2001 Phoenix Open by Andrew Magee. It also ranks as one of the strangest shots in golf, occuring on the 333-yard, par 4 17th hole at the Tournament Players Club of Scottsdale, when it rolled onto the green with the group in front still on the green. The shot rolled up, caromed off Tom Byrum's putter (as he had it laying down while he was bent over checking the line on his own putt)and then rolled into the hole. The feat was also accomplished on the Nationwide Tour in 2003 by Chip Beck at the Omaha Classic on the 315 yard 9th hole. 6

what should i get my fiance (female) for a wedding gift? i am drawing a HUGE blank!! I wouldn't go with some materialistic like diamonds or a gift certificate...you'll both be getting enough wedding gifts to fit this kind of category. Rather I agree with the framing idea of a love letter. Or create something special out of a souvenir you have from a special day you shared or do something special with a photo. Better yet, (and I am getting married in July and would love this ) you could write down all the reasons you want to marry her and roll it up, place it inside an antique wine bottle and have it secretly placed in the room where she'll get dressed on your wedding day...LOVE IT! 9
why is the sky blue?  A clear cloudless day-time sky is blue because molecules in the air scatter blue light from the sun more than they scatter red light.

What do you think he wants, it was the first date and he gets her a ring? ok....so my friend has been talkin to a guy online for a while (she knew him from years ago but they have just started talkin online again) and she finally agreed to go on a "pre-valentines day" date with him last night\n\n(keep in mind she hasnt seen him for about 5 years)\n\nso they are havin a nice time, she goes to the toilets, comes back and theres a ring box on the table and he says "happy valentines" Well first of all she should be open and honest with him. She should tell him stright up how she feels. Its okay to tell him to wait, if he loves her he will wait. If she really love him and shes ready to take the next step in life, well maybe its her right time. Its all depending on her feelings for him and also her love for him. She needs to follow her heart. 1

When did trinity in christianity came about? When was the bible written? Was the new testament jesus's words or the interpretation of his disciples? When did the theology of Jesus came about? who came up with it? The theology of the trinity developed throughout the first few centuries of Christian history.  The Council of Nicea in 325 officially sanctioned the doctrine.\n\nIn order to answer when the Bible was written, you need to ask which book.  Since most of your discussion seems to be centered on the gospels, we'll use them as our example.  Most scholars believe that the oldest gospel is Mark, and that it was written early in the second half of the first century.\n\nIs the New Testament Jesus' words or the interpretation of his disciples?  The most accurate way to answer that question is probably yes, it would be a combination of both.  As stated earlier, Mark is believed to be the first Gospel written.  Matthew and Luke are believd to be based on Mark and a source of the sayings of Jesus that is now lost to us.  Scholars call this sayings source Q.  John appears to be more independent of the other 3 gospels.  If you want to see what this sayings source might have looked like, look at the Gospel of Thomas, which was not included in the New Testament.\n\nYour last 2 questions about the theology of Jesus also needs to be more specific.  The scholarly term for the study of Jesus is Christology.  It seeks to answer questions about Jesus.  How much of him was God?  How much of him was man?  When did he become divine?  And when did he know it?  Christians have disagreed on the answers to these questions since the time of Jesus.\n\nMany of your questions are the same questions early Christians were asking, and the answers could take up volumes of books.  You can do some searches on Wikipedia as a start 1

What is the phrase / ruling that a judge can make when he determines that a plaintiff is wasting time? Isn't there a ruling that a Judge can make, or a argument defense can use when they believe that the plaintiff is continually stalling or trying to delay a ruling? EG. We have tried to settle a number of times with the plaintiff, and each time he chooses to ignore the settlement, but then takes 4 - 5 months to come back with counter settlements or filing for trial dates. Then he rejects his own counter settlements or cancels the trial dates, and waits another 6 months before pursuing the case further. Some terms which might apply to this behavior:\n\nVexatious -\n\n"Vexatious" means "without reasonable or probable cause or excuse." Black's Law Dictionary 1559 (7th ed. 1999); see also Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U.S. 412, 421, 98 S.Ct. 694, 700, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978) (describing "vexatious" conduct in the Title VII context as being "frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation, even though not brought in subjective bad faith")\n\nFrivolous action - \n\nA "frivolous action" is one that is "[g]roundless ... with little prospect of success; often brought to embarrass or annoy the defendant." Black's Law Dictionary 668 (6th ed. 1990); see also Fed.R.Civ.P. 11.\n\nAbusive action - \n\nAn abusive action is that which misuses or perverts the procedures of the court. An abusive action is one which can lead to no possible good, indeed an action in which a party is dragged through long and expensive litigation for no possible benefit. 10

is labor at 34 weeks normal?  With a full term pregnancy running 40 weeks or thereabout, 34 weeks is a little early & still considered pre-term & therefore a risk to mom & baby.\nThat's a bit too early & the babys' lungs may not be manufacturing surfactant at that point, which would allow it to breathe on its own outside the womb. They can test for surfactant. They can also give you drugs to stop the premature labor. Good luck - 3

How do you get people to be quite? When people you don't like keep talking to you and you don't just want to walk away You guys are unbelievable. I can't believe you all are answering questions in the Etiquette area.\n\nSometimes, you just have to put up with listening to stuff you don't want to hear.  Politely excuse yourself, period.  Tell them you have to go.\n\nBeing rude will net you nothing but another enemy. There's no reason for that - you never know when the person you're talking to now will appear again in your life -- maybe a boss, a co-worker, or a friend's friend, or worse, a waitress or waiter who has the ability and opportunity to spit in your food.  It's always a good idea to be polite to everyone, and it's just the right thing to do. 1

My friend has 7 crushes in 5 years, she wants to know if that's normal? She thinks that she really likes this guy and WHAM, she gets another crush. She's sorta worried if that's normal? I believe having 7 crushes is just normal, no matter how much time you take to get over the previous one, but falling in love with 7 people could be termed abnormal. A crush is just a faulty attraction which tends to fade over the time hence its not too serious an emotion to be worried about and consider it as abnormal.\n\nThe moment your friend finds her true love, she could just cherish those 5 years full of crush which were a part of her life like anything else and that would be perfectly normal too. 9
Question for diabetics. What do you think of this situation? I have recently had problems with my blood pressure going up then sometimes in the normal range. I also have had fluid retention. My feet, legs, and ankles swell also. I was given HCTZ to take for the fluid and even after I complained that my feet, legs and ankles had a burning sensation, my doctor said nothing. I went off the HCTZ on my own and the burning sensation went away. I knew it was from the med but he didn't. I have also vision changes. I told my doctor that I had some symptoms that diabetics have. I asked him if a blood test would show if I had diabetes. He said it does and then said my blood tests are fine. Then I got a letter from him telling me my glucose has improved. I was never told that my glucose was not normal. What does this letter mean? He has not asked me to make another appointment nor has he scheduled other tests for me. Has anyone with diabetes ever been diagnosed with a medical conditon other than diabestes, when the real diagnosis should have been diabetes? First, you should change a doctor.  A good doctor should never let his patient confused like this. \n\nDiabetes is defined as fasting blood glucose higher than 126, twice.  So the easiest way to find out is to get a copy of your blood test result, and look at it yourself.  \n\nSince you've stopped HCTZ, make sure you are taking something else for your blood pressure. 3
what if your ready for kids and he wants them but its not time should i just get an abortion and never tell? because he do love me and ilove him but he wants alot of things out of his life although he might not be mad i dont want to stop him getting those things by giving him a unexpected child you feel me He has a right to know. That doesn't mean that he has a right to determine what you will do. I think that it should be a decision that you make together since it effects the both of your lives forever but the ultimate decision is yours. If it were me, I'd tell him and discuss the seriousness of the matter and make a decision together. 9
Gettysburg/N.H. - looking for good source material re: New Hampshire's military involvement at the Battle of Gettysburg Im a history grad student and I could tell you that if you have names of individuals that were at the battle or commanded a regiment, that would be a good start. I would go online and look up gettysburg under search and then dig deeper on what state armies were their and then look at the library web page in your area for the battle and who was involved. You will probably have a difficult time finding any one book that will cover N.H. in gettysburg so be prepared to get several books with bits and pieces of info. from each. I dont know what level or grade you are in but thats how its done in college. Also, go on the official website of Gettysburg and there are sevearal sites that has a lot of details. You can email me if you need further help. 4

when did galatasaray football team take Uefa cup? About Galatasaray On the 17th of May 2000 Galatasaray who were one of only two teams to have won the UEFA Cup without being beaten in a single match, and is also notable for being the first team to win the competition after having been knocked out of the Champions League. In winning the UEFA Cup during the 1999/2000 season, beating Arsenal of England on penalties 4-1, this was a result of play ending 0-0 after normal and extra time with both sides hitting the woodwork many times Galatasaray became the first Turkish club ever to win a European trophy 6

if you and your spouse are having problems ,and you are away ,is it a good idea to take a break .from calling?  No. Part of making your marriage a success is learing to live through life's ups and downs together.  There will occasionally be problems the 2 of you have to work through, but the answer to those problems is to turn TOWARD your marriage not away from it.  Not communicating is definately a step away from it.\n\nI'm not saying you should stay on the phone constantly.  Check in with each other once a day to say "I love you".  You may be having problems because both of you need to be reminded of what is most important in your lives and how you really feel. 9
What would be a good kayak to buy for a beginner? I'm a 5'11", 175-pound male.?  The most popular kayak for beginners is probably "Pungo", by Wilderness Systems. It comes from 10 to 14 feet, with the 10 ft. called the Pungo 100, 12 ft. Pungo 120, etc. The taller you are the longer your boat needs to be. You can find them at most kayak stores, or request a catalog from wilderness systems online. They have a lot of choices, like colors, and special "angler" and "camper" features. Another popular model from Wilderness System is the Pamlico, which is a sit-on-top kayak, which weighs a little more. This company makes really popular beginner kayaks that have great stablity. Good luck with it. 6
how much charge is on the earth's surface ?  the person before me solved for the capacity, which is how much charge the earth can hold, not how much charge it is actually holding.\n\nthere is no way to know for sure how much charge is on the earth's surface, it's too big, and it is constantly changing.  Charged particles go up into the atmosphere all the time, and everytime there's a lightning storm, it changes dramatically at one time, and there's no way to really measure how much charge is there at any given time.  Plus, it's not really 'charged' becaue it is so big and has so little charge compared to its mass, which is why it can act as a 'grounding' and not be affected when large amounts of charge are put into it, because they are still small charges relative to the mass of the earth.  it is impossible to calculate the total charge on the entire earth at any given time. 2
what if your spouse has been unfaithful more than once is the marriage worth saving....?  Ultimately, the only person that can answer that is you and your spouse. If they continue to be unfaithful, there is an underlying reason to their actions. If in fact the two of you wish to salvage the relationship, talk to the other and find their real feelings. Perhaps the other is doing this because hey are addicted to sex. If this is the case, maybe you can consider stepping up the sex life. If the other simply enjoys the feeling of being with someone else, perhaps you can consider opening the relationship to allow a third part to join the relationship from time to time. Consider all options before you make a choice as in relationships when we make a move the piece is sometime difficult if not impossible to move back. I hope this helps….\n\n-Jerry 9

female circumcision?  There is nothing Biblical that supports this, in fact mutilation of the body is a sin. Tattoos, piercing etc.- and that is not circumcision in the sense that males get.\n\nThe female genital mutilation is a seriously evil thing they are doing in Africa, torturing women from childhood to old age, and I saw some footage of this and it brought tears to my eyes to see that people could be so cruel.  This is NOT even a medical procedure it is a cruel torture that some sick minded people are doing to others. To imagine the pain these poor victims are going through- by the thousands and everyone turns their backs.  To ignore such a thing deserves a sentance in hell. It is as bad as doing the evil thing ourselves as far as I am concerned.\n\nI have a link to it on my website on the home page - it is IRIN News to the right of the page at the bottom of the news column.  The videos are there if anyone wants to see for themselves how horrible it is. (adults only of course!-very disturbing images) http://www.seekandfindhim.com 1

Do you like school? Do you or don't you like school? Explain Why or Why not.  This question is for everyone whether in college, high school, Jr. high, middle school, etc. I love school and I love learning.  I have been in school for more than 30 years!  From kindergarten to 7 college degrees and working on my 8th and accepted into a program for my 9th!\n\nI started college at 16 while still in high school to become a paramedic.  I finished that, became a nurse and then got my first BS soon after than.  I also have 3 Masters degrees- chemistry, business and library science, and I am working on a MA in Irish Cultural Heritage from the University of Ulster via distance learning. \n\nThe important part about making school fun is studying what you like.  While you can't study only what you like as we all have to take language and math so we can survive in the everyday world you can take electives in high school and college that you find fun.  In college you get to specalize in what you really like (and you can change from major to major - I did).  Then you can take more stuff that interests you.  That is the way I learned a little bit about a lot of things and sometimes a lot about a few specific things.\n\nThink of school and learning as fun, just as it was for Aristotle, Einstein, and probably some of the really smart people you know, and it will become fun. 4
why I would have pain when you press pretty much anywhere on my body?  Like my bones are inflammed? It hurts when you press on my bones, especially on my chest and rib cage area.  But it hurts most places I have found.  My cat can walk over my legs and it hurts.  What could this be?  I thought it might be fibromyalgia but when I looked it up it didn't really seem to be it.  I have had this for at least over a year now.  Thanks for your ideas. My first question is have you seen a doctor about this?\n\nThere are a number of diseases that could cause bone pain, but this question and answer format is not really a good place to get a diagnosis or help for it.\n\nI have attached just one website that talks about bone pain. I think if you read it you will see that you need to get yourself to a doctor.  Your problem may be nothing serious, but it could be quite serious.\n\nGood luck with getting this sorted. 3

i need to know if body knows if eminem has died resently? I was told today, that he was stabed and there are alot of us that need to know if it is true. We have searched the web and all we get is headlines saying the death of eminem and nothing more. Can u help? Details of a late night car crash involving Eminem made their way to national media outlets. The story, which began circualting in early-December, claimed the surly rapper was driving a rented Saturn coupe to a late-night party when he lost control. The falsified account described the incident in gory detail: \n\n"...Mathers, who authorities believe was under the influence of alcohol or drugs, was behind the wheel of a Saturn coupe that witnesses say swerved to avoid a slow moving vehicle, then lost control and slammed into a grove of trees. The car was crumpled by the impact, making extraction of Mather's body very difficult. He was declared dead on the scene by paramedics who arrived a short time later." \n\nMTV's Web site reportedly claimed to have a photograph and eyewitness accounts of the accident. However, less than two days after the rumor's inception, executives from Eminem's record label posted a statement on his Web site claiming that the contentious Slim Shady was "alive and at home with his family for the holidays in Detroit, " adding, "And he wishes all of you shady holidays and a dirty New Year." 8

what is the best way to start exercising for someone who never has for 40 years and needs muscles?  the first thing you want to do is check with your doctor to find out how much you can do. once you get older if you are out of shape or if you have certain health conditions they can put you at risk when exercising. once given the go-ahead i recommend having a personal trainer at a gym 2 or 3 times to get a few workouts. eating vitamins and doing cardiovascular exercises always work very well for getting the body toned. running, swimming, biking, and using exercise machines such as an elipitical are very good methods of cardiovascular exercise. if you also want bigger muscles than you want to start slow and build it up (again, a personal trainer is always good because they can show you how to lift and life in a safe manner). books with lifting exercises work well too. You would probably want to start with push-ups, sit-ups, pull-ups and chin-ups, and cardiovascular. After a while you could increase the intensity and amount of exercise you do. 3

why do people do not accept  the uglyface? and why they do it always? well pls i begging u to respond my question.....\nand its my pleasure to be one of ur friend Unfortunately, society (in general) have become very shallow and unforgiving.  Pencil thin gorgeous models and muscle bound, perfect haired men are what society is fed and told is a way to measure success.\n\nWhat worries me in this all too shallow society of ours is we're teaching our kids that attributes as vague and relatively meaningless as a toothy smile or a fine head of hair make a fine statement about a person. What they tell me is that they've got a nice smile and a nice head of hair. But I'm looking for what's behind the smile and what's underneath that head of hair.\n\nIf we started with the kids and stressed that it's what is INSIDE the person that matters, we MIGHT be able to counter the commercial affect ... not so sure about that, but worth a shot. 4

how did the cold war effect the third world?  The term Third World was initially coined to describe countries that took neither the US nor Soviet side in the Cold War.  India is a good example of such a country.  Once independent from the Brits India established a democratic government with a very isolationist and socialist bent.  As a result, economic growth stagnated for nearly 50 years until the government began opening itself to international trade and small bureaucratic reforms. 10

A weight lifter definitely needs to supplement protein because he/she is tearing down muscle fibers that require protein to be repaired. 3

NOW, if you are truly interested in this guy, take the high road, and break it off with the guy you are seeing.  Then perhaps pursue this other guy.  Show the guy you're with the respect he deserves. You can't have them both, so make a choice. I hope the choice is a wise one. 9

i like someone buti am afraid to tell my feelings because i might be rejectted... what should i do?  Has he shown any interest at all? If he has then you should be brave. When it comes to the matters of the heart, one should have courage... for cowardice knows no rewards and apathy is death. If you feel for him and you feel that he feels for you too, then be brave. Go about it in a subtle way. You don't have to go up to him and say it straight to his face without any warning, that might freak him out. Do it with finesse. Hint at it, mildly at first, if he's slow in the pick up, do it a little more boldly. If he really feels for you he'll grab the opening at the slightest hint you may give. Good Luck!!!!=) 9

use of wildcard characters in searches?  They are actually called "Operators" in searching.  Many hidden ways to do searching.  In the link I provide look at the first section called Operator Examples.  You can mix them too.  Lets say you were searching for info about Ben Roethlisberger you should type in "Ben Roethlisberger".  Why you may ask?  Well lets say during your search without the " it hits a page with a person named Ben Dover and another person called Jim Roethlisberger.  Well both words are contained in the search and it counts.  With the " around Ben Roethlisberger it finds all words together.  Although his name is sooo unusual you may not have to worry.  But a good example.  Try google with Jim Smith and look at the number of results returned, then try "Jim Smith" and see the number returned.  I did not search for it and I have not idea who Jim Smith is.  But I would bet the difference will be 30+ million.\n\nMost websites use the Operators that are in the link I gave below.  The rest on that page such as +,- and all the stuff after are fairly google specific right now but will soon become standard on many sites. 5

Why can't the Cubs get to the world series?  If they're given enough time, eventually they will, under the law of averages. It probably won't happen anytime in the extremely new future, but trades and talent can turn any franchise around. It's just that it's taking the Cubs longer than anyone to turn it around. Eventually, rest assured, it'll all even out. 6

Does anyone know if there are any other sequels/spinoffs to "My Neighbour Totoro"? My 2 boys love them and couldnt get enough of them.  So I am interested to know if there are any other sequels other than the movie "My Neighbour Totoro". There are no sequals to "Tonari no Totoro" (My Neighbor Totoro is the American title).  Any of the movies by Studio Gibli are great, though Princess Mononoke is a little grisly for younger children (at one point, a man gets his arm chopped off).  I was not a big fan of the most recent one, Howl's Moving Castle.  However, any of the other ones are absolutely enchanting with great animation and stories.  My children love Castle in the Sky, as well.  Trust me, you can't go wrong with any of them.  (Totoro is my personal favorite, too.) 8
Should people who sit by the window be forced to keep the blinds open? We have a small office so not many people get to sit by a window. Those who do get windows, keep the blinds drawn because the sun creates a glare on their computer screens. This makes the office seeem as if there are no windows at all- any solutions? What do you think? Yes, especially if they REFUSE to switch places with someone that would want to sit by the window, and that would keep the blinds open.  What's the point of having windows if you cannot see out of them? 1

How to prove 1+1=2? How? There is a set of mathematical rules that are in place that do not have proofs.  They are postulates.  They are thoughts that are accepted as true, because everything beyond that is based off it.\n\nThe base 10 numbering system has a set of rules in place (as does other numbering systems)  They dont need proof because the rules that govern the system are part of the system itself.  for example, in base 2 system (or binary) it is a postulate that 1+1=10 for base 16, it is a postulate that 1+1=2 and 9+1=A\n\nProving for a base 10 system that 1+1=2 is like asking someone to prove that a minimum of two points are needed to make a line.  It cant be proven, because it is already at the most basic of levels, and everything else is based off of that.\n\nAs for the answers above, understand that a true proof can not use what you are trying to prove as part of the proof 2
How do you become an NFL referee?  Short answer....referee for a looooooooong time.\n\nLonger answer.  You have to work your way up.  If you are really serious, look around for your local youth football program and get on as a ref.  Most of them are hurting for them and many offer pay (however, in most cases you will need to insure yourself so this may offset your pay).  Do this long enough and you can perhaps get on as a high school ref.  Work your way up from there.  Remember, however, refs don't make a whole lot of money.  Many of the NFL refs have professions outside of the NFL.  There are many lawyers and there is one PGA golf pro as well. 6

what is the negative and positive effects on global warming? no spam Global warming is a plot devised by scientists of the world to dominate the planet !!!\n\nYou see if we accept this theory as fact from then on scientists will be able to control everything that we do based on the complex interactions, almost unfathomably complex, between consumption and global warming effects -- thus, scientists will be allow to make educated guesses if they like, which will almost always certainly result in politically correct and repressive conclusions that forward the goals of this neo-imperialism.\n\n\nThe bottom line for this question is that the LONGEST historical charts showing the temperatures on Earth show that we are currently quite COLD !!!  In fact we are currently tied for the coldest period ever on the long term charts, the entire period if life on Earth. Thus, odds are very good that temperatures will raise no matter what we do so over the very long term scientists will be found to be correct that the Earth is indeed warming up. And I am sure they will continue to blame the heating on human activity and they will continue to try to use this to gain control over the free peoples of the world. Although since this trend that shows the Earth being currently quite cold is a very long term trend, in the million of years, so this is a long term gamble for the scientists a lot can happen between now and when the longer term trend is likely to kick in.\n\nBut the idea that this heating is unnatural or some how damaging to the Earth is silly because the long term charts show that the Earth is usually much warmer, during the last 542 million years, the entire period of time that life has existed on Earth.\n\nEvery classroom and library show have a large poster on the wall to show the temperature record of the Phanerozoic period, the last 542 million years, to remind people of the absurd conclusions science can reach from time to time.\n\nIsn't it interesting that 542 million years shows that we are currently tied for the coldest temps EVER !!!\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Phanerozoic_Climate_Change.png\n\n"The Phanerozoic (occasionally Phaenerozoic) Eon is the period of geologic time during which abundant animal life has existed. It covers roughly 545 million years and goes back to the time when diverse hard-shelled animals first appeared. The Phanerozoic eon is still ongoing." \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phanerozoic\n\nIf you look at the chart of Holocene temperature variation we are not hotter, on the average we are cooler -- notice the long term cooling trend or downward slope of the chart.\nHolocene Temperature Variations ...\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Holocene_Temperature_Variations.png\n\nFrom this chart it looks like we are currently on the top of an upward swing that started with the mini-ice-age in the 1600s and that we are currently topping out.\n\nThis is probably why scientist are currently predicting in the future, both, much HOTTER weather, and a new ice-age, it is because it is time for a new long term downward trend -- well, that is on the short term chart showing the thousands of years, yes in terms of millions of years we are still currently VERY cold !\n\nAnd 5 million years of temps changes shows we are cooler, but fluctuating ...\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Five_Myr_Climate_Change.png\n\nAnd 65 million years of temps changes shows we are\ncooler, but fluctuating ...\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:65_Myr_Climate_Change.png\n\nIsn't it interesting that 542 million years shows that\nwe are currently tied for the coldest EVER !!!\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Phanerozoic_Climate_Change.png\n\nSo I think the scientists that know about this LONG term temperature change believe we will get hotter no matter what, so they can't loose even if the current theories of Global Warming turn out to be BULL of planetary proportions !!!\n\nThe ice-age temps shows our current temps to be fairly typical, notice the other peaks were HIGHER and sh 2
can i further study to be a pilot in an American uni with finacial support? where? i'm a high school student in thailand now. Attending a university with financial aid is not the same as getting grants or scholarships to attend one. Not sure which you are looking for.

what do you think with the trades going on with the timberwolves, pacers kings and celtics? the timberwolves are giving up wally for ricky davis\nand the pacers finally got rid of ron artest for peja Kings get the better end in their deal. Peja is currently performing at his worst in the scoring department since 2000. Ron Artest is one of the best defensive players out there.\n\nThe T'Wolves will probably regret this trade. Wally is the glue that keeps Minny together. Although injuries have plagued him recently, he still has plenty of talent to offer. Ricky Davis will help KG down low, but the loss of Wally really damages the perimeter shooting game. 6

Any one knows what causes the northern lights?  The sun gives off high-energy charged particles (also called ions) that travel out into space at speeds of 300 to 1200 kilometres per second. A cloud of such particles is called a plasma. The stream of plasma coming from the sun is known as the solar wind. As the solar wind interacts with the edge of the earth's magnetic field, some of the particles are trapped by it and they follow the lines of magnetic force down into the ionosphere, the section of the earth's atmosphere that extends from about 60 to 600 kilometres above the earth's surface. When the particles collide with the gases in the ionosphere they start to glow, producing the spectacle that we know as the auroras, northern and southern. The array of colours consists of red, green, blue and violet. 2

Virtual Administrative Assistant/Answering Service? Has anyone worked with a Virtual Assistant? Would you pay for the service? I am thinking of starting this serv\nA Virtual Admin. I am thinking of starting a small business as an virtual admin. asst. setting up  video-conferences for different companies using my software and camera. As well as projects that any Admin. Asst. would do. I have worked with Polycom, and Breeze Presenter/PowerPoint. Does anyone think they would have a use for this. My rates would go around 25-50 an hr depending on the type of services your looking for.\nVideo conferences would be a bit more just because of the cost I would have to eat. Let me know what anyone thinks. Starting as a virtual assistant is a great idea. (I know, I started that way several years ago.) I do recommend that any of those new to the industry consider your best areas of service before launching and specialize from the start.\n\nUnless you are planning on doing the video conferencing locally, I think you may find that to be a bit difficult to pull off. Not because it can't be done, but because you would need to work with clients that are able to set up the hardware and software on their own sites. Usually, people hire you to solve problems -- and the video conferencing has a serious potential to CREATE problems, especially long distance.\n\nBefore you launch a VA practice, research the name you plan to use for the business (an Internet search is a great place to begin) because you don't want to use a name that's already in use (and possibly trademark protected).\n\nThen consider your strengths and weaknesses. Do an honest self-assessment to determine what services you can offer that will benefit your clients while emphasising your skills, background and education without requiring you to delve into areas that are not your best.\n\nIf you are going to be a VA, a website is essential. If creating a good website isn't your strength -- hire it out or barter services with someone else who can create an effective site.\n\nMarket yourself everywhere you go (business cards at the ready). And, always look for opportunities to talk about what you do -- this is most easily achieved by asking others about their own work (they will usually return the favor). Although Virtual Assistance is a known term in many circles, it still seems to create a bit of interest in casual conversation -- use that to your advantage by begin able to answer questions about the industry in general and your own business in particular.\n\nRead articles by others on the topic of running your own VA business.\n\nBe sure you are willing to put in the hours required to start and run a business. It's not as simple as announcing and starting to work. You will need to research your market, talk with people in the business, talk with people in your target industry/industries, read, research on the web and... PLAN.\n\nBest wishes to you as you begin your endeavor. It's a great career option brought to you by this age of technology! 7

what is thrush? i think i may have it :( because one of the sympoms are white tonge?\n\nIs thrush a bad thing? what cause it? and what can it turn into? Oral thrush is most common in infants and toddlers, in the elderly, and in people who are debilitated or whose immune system has been suppressed by disease or medical treatments. \n\nThrush in infants is common and is usually not associated with other diseases. Infant thrush that resists treatment or recurs frequently should raise suspicions for an underlying disorder. \n\nIn adolescents, young adults, and middle age adults, an oral Candida infection should always be viewed as a possible symptom of an underlying medical problem, such as diabetes or HIV infection, and should be evaluated. \n\nThe goal of treatment is to control the growth of Candida. Antifungal medications (such as nystatin, clotrimazole, and miconazole) are given for 5 to 10 days. They are administered in the mouth (swallowing the medicine after "swishing" it around). \n\nA single-dose oral medicine called Diflucan is available if these treatments do not work. Underlying conditions/disorders should be identified and treated. 3

How can I lose weight if i am a vegetarian and I have a thyroid problem? i'm a vegetarian with a thyroid condition which makes me gain weight. my diet includes lots of protein and fiber and I still cannot lose any weight. I'm assuming you're hypothyroid? That's the most common thyroid condition resulting in weight gain.  First off it takes a couple months for thyroid levels to even out after you start taking synthetic thyroid hormone.  Secondly, you'll need to start an exercise program in order to boost your metabolic rate.  You'll also need to consume enough calories to fuel your body, and vary the sources from which you're getting your proteins.  Are you vegan, or will you eat lacto/ovo?  Following a vegetarian diet can be dangerous with a thyroid condition - there may be certain nutrients that you cannot metabolize due to your thyroid - for example, you may not be able to convert betacarotene into Vit A.(the only sources of true Vit A are animal).  The previous poster was correct in stating that you should seek the advice of a nutritionist; I would also suggest a visit to an endocrinologist. 3
Does anyone believe in intelligent design theory?  No. In fact, the whole point of Intelligent Design is merely to cause a public debate on evolution. The fact is that Intelligent Design starts with a conclusion (Creationism), then works out a package which was designed to be school-friendly, and provide "evidence" which might trick people who are unfamiliar with the real science of the situation. The ID movement's claims that ID is intended to be non-specific in its creator is revealed by the Wedge document to be a lie. 2

When was the last time you stole something?  Why haven't you stolen anything since then? I stole a little hair thing from a store on a boardwalk when I was about 12 years old.  I was so scared and then afterwards felt so horrible.  I remember thinking it was only a little bit of money (change) and I had the change in my pocket.  Why didn't I just pay for it?  I didn't make any sense to me & it didn't feel good wearing it b/c I didn't earn it.  I NEVER EVER stole again & would never do that again. I admit that I have a very criminal mind when it comes to stealing.  I have taken things as small as packs of gum when I was 4, to my mom's checkbook when I was 17.  Unfortunately, the turning point for me was when I was 18 and charged with two gas drive offs.  I believe there are three types of people in this world: those who never steal because they know it is wrong, those that steal constantly without thinking about it, and (the biggest group, I think) those who don't steal because they are afraid to get caught. 1

where can i find high resolution scans of classic movie stars other then at doctormarco?

did he get cold feet? My fiancee and I have been engaged for over a year now with no clear cut wedding date in sight. well yesterday i stepped up and picked out a wedding date for next year, him i would have been together for 3 years and engaged for 2 by that time. but when i told him this he started to act weird and get real quick and everytime i tried to talk about wedding plans he blew them off...so what does this mean? does he not want to marry me afterall? am i rushing things? i am so hurt and confused by this. Find out how he feels.  Find a comfortable time for both of you to talk about your feelings.  If he is not interested in getting married, you will have to make a decision to wait for him (for years maybe) or find someone else.  My sister in law waited for 18 years before my brother proposed.  They got married in 9 months after the proposal.  Do you want to wait that long? 9

Are raw eggs really bad for you?  Any alternatives? I used to make shakes with raw eggs in them to drink as breakfast drinks.  But now with all the information about salmonella, I am not sure if i should continue to do this.  Are there any alternatives? When you carefully analyze the risk of contracting salmonella from raw eggs, you will find that it is actually quite low. A study by the U.S. Department of Agriculture earlier this year showed that of the 69 billion eggs produced annually, only 2.3 million of them are contaminated with salmonella. So simple math suggests that only 0.003 percent of eggs are infected. The translation is that only one in every 30,000 eggs is contaminated with salmonella. Salmonella infections are usually present only in traditionally raised commercial hens. If you are purchasing your eggs from healthy chickens this infection risk reduces dramatically. Remember, only sick chickens lay salmonella-contaminated eggs. If you are obtaining high quality, cage-free, organically fed, omega-3 enhanced chicken eggs, the risk virtually disappears.\nGuidelines To Ensure That You Are Consuming Fresh High- Quality Eggs\n\nYou can go to the American Egg board for a great overview of eggs. \n\nAlways check the freshness of the egg right before you consume the yolk. \n\nIf you are uncertain about the freshness of an egg, don't eat it. This is one of the best safeguards against salmonella infection. \n\nIf there is a crack in the shell, don't eat it. You can easily check for this by immersing the egg in a pan of cool, salted water. If the egg emits a tiny stream of bubbles, don't consume it as the shell is porous/contains a hole.\n\nIf you are getting your eggs fresh from a farmer it is best to not refrigerate them. This is the way most of the world stores their eggs; they do not refrigerate them. To properly judge the freshness of an egg, its contents need to be at room temperature. Eggs that are stored in the fridge and opened immediately after taking them out will seem fresher than they actually are. Eggs that you want to check the freshness of should be kept outside the fridge for at least an hour prior to opening them.\n\nFirst, check all the eggs by rolling them across a flat surface. Only consume them if they roll wobbly.\n\nOpen the egg. If the egg white is watery instead of gel-like, don't consume the egg. If the egg yolk is not convex and firm, don't consume the egg. If the egg yolk easily bursts, don't consume the egg.\n\nAfter opening the egg you can put it up to your nose and smell it. If it smells foul you will certainly not want to consume it. 3

why my mother likes my sister better than me she talks bad about me and talk good about her im very unhappy?  What you need to know is that this just tells you a lot about your mother and nothing about you. This is a personality defect of your mothers, not yours. It can be very painful waiting for a mothers approval that you may never receive. Learn that the only opinion about yourself that counts is yours! 7

where can i take a CPR class for free? I need to take a CPR class for work  ASAP but i cant afford to pay for it or the certificate so I was wandering where I could go to do it for free Assuming that you need a lay rescuer card (your not working as a nusre, paramedic, ect) you can probaly find a class via your local fire department or hospital.  If they don't offer one they should be able to help you find one.   If your needing a healthcare provider card I would also check with the same places although your chances of finding a free class are not as good.\n\nIf they are not able to help you you can check out the American Heart Assoc website (link below) to find training centers in your area.  Just start calling.  You can also check out the rescue breather site for a listing of instructors in your area.  (they however mostly work for proffit)\n\nPlease let me know where you live and I will see if I can find one for you\n\nJay 4

Do men really care if women wear make-up? I've always wondered if men really enjoy looking at women who seem to load on cosmetics with a putty knife. Does it really make them look all that much better? I myself only wear eyeliner, and it's only sometimes that I do. Alot of the girls in my highschool load on makeup to cover their acne, which really doesn't look that bad anyway. Does it really matter to men wether your skin looks perfectly clear or not? No, I don't agree in Make-up. Make up not only spoils your skin, it lowers you self-esteem, increasing your dependency on some stupid clown paste to look good. Why can't a woman just feel great without putting on a ton of rubbish and chemicals on her face?\nA woman's natural beauty, even if she's not the most beautiful woman in the world, or has a nose bigger than Jackie Chan, as an inner beauty. Why put on makeup just because not enough men are looking? What kind of men are they looking to attract anyway? Any guy who judges a woman on looks alone isn't even worth dating.\nA simple lip balm is simple enough for me. My face is clear, bright, my cheeks are rosier, people are surprised when they see me and realise i'm not wearing make up but I don't look horrible.\nAnd I've had guys who appreciated the honesty and confidence I have in my own character, personality and intelligence rather than relying on some wax, cream and icing layer on my face to strike up an intelligent, interesting conversation!\nI don't even have pierced ears. It's a choice, for me, I'd rather show the world my true face, standing up proud of myself, than hide behind a veil of pretence and beauty.\nMany men marry a woman who's beautiful and realise behind that beauty, isn't at all what the beauty signified or hinted at...\nMany women make the mistake of thinking to be confident (because of all those darn advertisements) and beautiful she has to put on a thick layer of foundation, curl her eyelashes 24/7 (no objections if she's doing this for a special occasion once in a while), thick coat of blood-red lipstick.\nAnd NATURAL make up? That's an oxy moron!\n\nA guy who cares about your make-up more than your personality and inner beauty isn't worth your time, period. 1

How do I save audio file after adjusting speed? (Using Windows Media Player 10)?  The speed adjustment in WMP is a playback effect, and can't actually be saved, as WMP is just a player. You need some kind of sound editing program for it to save. You can use Windows Sound Recorder, depending on it's format. However, you will have better luck with a program like Sony Sound Forge. (Sound forge might actually be made by a subsidiary of Sony, so it might not actually say Sony, I just know it by that name) 5
I have bought a new laptop ...it is wifi compliant!what sort of card should i buy to have wireless experience? Can anyone let me know the name of company and cost of card in euros !! Are you saying that the laptop does not already have a wireless card in it.  Most new laptops sold are already equipped with 802.11g (aka 54g) wireless cards.  I would check your manual or specs to make sure that it doesn't already have a card in it.  If it doesn't read on.\n\nIf you want to use WiFi in your home then you will need a router.  My personal favorite is anything by Netgear but any basic WiFi router should serve your needs.\n\nAs I said above if your laptop doesn't already have a WiFi card, then you will need to get a PCMCIA or USB wireless adapter.\n\nI would bet though, that the new laptop does already have a WiFi adapter in it. 5

space missions Why are we spending so much money on space when we do not have a decent health insurance to all the public? You also need to consider the economic effects of funding basic research.  The moon missions of the 60's inspired an entire generation and helped to move many kids toward careers in science and engineering.  As a result, the US was well poised to take advantage of the huge boom in information technology in the last few decades.  The net effect of these engineers in the workforce could be see has a pretty impressive return on investment for the cost of those missions. 2

Why do we say "The door is 'open.'" but say "The door is 'closed'"?

i am currently in high school, but i am impatient. Is there any way i could enter college now,not finshedhighs  It depends on where you are. In some states  community colleges allow concurrent enrollment for students in high school. North Carolina, for example, does; you can take some college classes along with some high school classes. See here for an example: \nhttp://www.catawba.k12.nc.us/Pages/BOEman/ch3/37500.AP.htm\n\nhttp://www.cpcc.cc.nc.us/hsprograms/concurrentenrollment/2004-2005.htm\n\nThere is also an initiative underway to provide an "early college high school" where students earn the first two years of college credit while finishing high school. See here: http://www.earlycolleges.org/\n\nI agree with the earlier posters, though, in that you should not drop out of high school. If you can't find a concurrent enrollment program then focus on taking AP credits which will give you advanced content and will count toward college credit.\n\nI would also suggest that you seriously consider your reasons to hurry things up. Impatience isn't necessarily a good reason to move ahead. It is often good to spend time enjoying your life right now rather than trying to hurry it up. Focus more on activities that will help you feel more accomplished in your life--volunteer, work part-time, create something. \n\nGood luck to you! 4

whats the process involve in order to produce coconut oil?  The method we use to practice at home for making coconut oil is - first select mature coconuts fresh or dried. Then remove the outermost cover including the fibrous part. Split the coconut into halves and let it dry in bright sun. The process of drying continues until the moisture in the coconut flesh disappears and also the coconut gets separated from the shell by it self.Once the coconuts are completely dried they are chopped to small pieces and grinded to extract oil. The extracted oil is then collected after filtration. Also the remainings of the coconut  after extraction is used as a food for the cattle. 2

Why are muslim martryrs rewarded 72 virgins?  55:72: "Maidens restrained [as to their glances], in [goodly] pavilions."\n\nHoly Qur'an\n\n\n\nIn his commentary on Surah 55:72, Ibn Kathir (d. 1373 CE) stated: "The Prophet Muhammad was heard saying: 'The smallest reward for the people of paradise is an abode where there are 80,000 servants and 72 wives, over which stands a dome decorated with pearls, aquamarine, and ruby, as wide as the distance from Al-Jabiyyah [a Damascus suburb] to Sana'a [Yemen]'." \n\nany muslim that goes to heaven will get this number of wives, its not neccessary that they are women from this life, almighty Allah will create them for every muslim beleiver "that enters heaven" because almighty Allah knows how much each man desires women and nothing can fill his needs ever except 72 wives.\n\nMoreover, No 72 is not a figure number its a real number, prophet Muhammad(PBUH) is inspired from almighty Allah he does'nt say figures just for making it look big, if he said something he is always right and correct with no doubt, i dont care what Diane Soyer said ... she knows nothing rather than taking video of women that are face covered only :) 1
Is mastribution good for health?  It is held in many mental health circles that masturbation can relieve depression and lead to a higher sense of self-worth. Masturbation can also be particularly useful in relationships where one partner wants more sex than the other — in which case masturbation provides a balancing effect and thus a more harmonious relationship.\n\nBoth from the standpoint of avoiding unwanted pregnancy and that of avoiding sexually transmitted diseases, masturbation is the safest of sexual practices. There is no credible scientific or medical evidence that manual masturbation is damaging to either one's mental or physical health.\n\nOn 2003-07-16, an Australian research team led by Graham Giles of The Cancer Council published a medical study which concluded that frequent masturbation by males may help prevent the development of prostate cancer. The study also indicated that this would be more helpful than ejaculation through sexual intercourse because intercourse can transmit diseases that may increase the risk of cancer instead. Another study came to similar conclusions in April 2004. 2

Can anybody interpret dreams? Should we really likeeee awww listen to them? If they tell us NO...should we really say no if we come up with a similar scenario in real life? I did...& I think it's OK listening 2 my instinct...but I wonder what would have happend If i did the opposite? sed YES??? Would I felt bad? or disapointed? hmmm this is the first time I really listen to my instinct & dreams...is it the right way? \n\nby da way... leisa_wilkie  - 10x 4 the good answer! :) Dreams are your subconcious mind still working on problems that occurred while you were awake.  Don't bother buying a book on interpretting dreams.  Only you know what the dream means to you.  For example, last night I dreamt that my 93 year old grandmother came to me as an angel and asked me to bring my kids to visit her.  Just yesterday, I had been thinking about how old she is and what if she dies.  I visit her often, but prefer not to take the kids.  That is something that I sometimes feel bad about.  Sometimes they are more complex, especially if you are dealing with something that is difficult for you to handle emotionally.  Just look at how the dream relates to your own life.  Good luck. 1

do ghosts exist?  I think the idea is really, really interesting. When I was younger, I read a LOT about ghosts and hauntings . And you can't prove that they don't exist because you can't prove a negative.\n\nHowever, as much as I would love for ghosts to exist, the more I know the more I realize that evidence for ghostly manifestations is probably explainable by non-ghostly, real, but ephemeral phenomena.\n\nFor example, I had a book on ghostly hauntings in England. There were more scent "hauntings" than any other type, meaning that you would experience the haunting by getting a whiff of pipe smoke or bacon. This can be explained by the fact that scents can be absorbed by porous materials such as wood and plaster. After they are absorbed, they will disappear until meteorological conditions, like high humidity, cause the scent to become airborne and be smellable again. Given a very porous wall and a long-standing habit like pipe-smoking and you can get whiffs of smoke for geneartions. 2
where is the roll center height on a vehicle with no suspension? is it the same as the CGH?  That sounds right to me.  Since the car's only means of suspension is the deformation of the tires themselves, the CG would dictate the roll center. 2

How can I make it hurt less when I don't get a valentine from anyone? Or am i just hopless? I never get any valentines not even from the guy that likes me because he's embarassed that he likes me. I'm already alone at school and that brings my self asteem down even lower when this time of the year comes around. I feel like the biggest loser because I don't have anyone to talk to or be around at school and i need alot of help. Yep, send yourself a valentine. Since you know it can feel bad not getting one, try sending them to some other people also who you think deserve one though you know they might not get any. 1

Why do you never see stars in pictures taken in space?  This was one of the claims made in a effort to debunk the moon landings. Here is an explanation on why no stars are seen in pictures taken in space.\n\n"The black sky should be full of stars, yet none are visible in any of the Apollo photographs. \n\nThis claim is one I hear frequently, and is one of the easiest to refute. The answer is very simple: they are too faint. The Apollo photos are of brightly lit objects on the surface of the Moon, for which fast exposure settings were required. The fast exposures simply did not allow enough starlight into the camera to record an image on the film. For the same reason, images of the Earth taken from orbit also lack stars. The stars are there; they just don't appear in the pictures. The hoax advocates often argue that stars should be visible, and some of their claims are valid, however they fail to recognize the difference between "seeing" stars and "photographing" stars. The astronauts could have recorded star images in their photos by increasing exposures, but they were not there to take star pictures. The purpose of the photos was to record the astronauts' activities on the surface of the Moon. \n\nBill Kaysing claims that NASA has perpetrated the lie that stars cannot be seen in space to validate the lack of stars in the Apollo photos. This assertion is utterly ridiculous; in fact, NASA has released many photos in which stars are visible. Common among these are long-exposure nighttime photographs of aurora taken by space shuttle astronauts. This example [see photo] is a four-second exposure taken from the flight deck of the shuttle Endeavour" 2

i need basic information about volcanoes in general like where are they mostly located and i dont know stuff l  ...And the ring of fire is located around the Pacific.  \n\nVolcanoes can also be found in Iceland, where it lies above a hot spot and a Mid Ocean Ridge.  They also tend to coincide with mantle plumes surging from the core mantle boundary as well as plate convergent (subduction) and divergent (rifts and MOR) settings, but further details can be found in various websites --> search on google.\n\nWikipedia or the United States Geologic Survey (usgs.gov?) websites may have some useful info about volcanoes. 2

Who holds the single season rushing yards in NFL?  While it is true that Eric Dickerson holds the single season *total* rushing yards record, he accomplished this in a 16-game season. On the other hand, O.J. Simpson is the only player in NFL history to break the 2,000 yard barrier in a single 14-game season. O.J. Simpson gained 143 yards per game in his record-breaking season, while Dickerson only gained 131 yards per game in his. So, the answer depends on whether you are interested in total yards or yards per game. 6
What do you think of the Seattle Mariner's team and coaches this year?  I, being an Angels' fan, am very familiar with the M's.  I thought last year was a total fluke.  I think the M's have the lineup to put up some runs and now that they've obtained some pitching (Washburn), they may be back in the hunt for the West.  I am upset my Halos haven't done much in the offseason besides letting go of two big contributors (Molina, Washburn) so hopefully they have a good plan with the farm system.  I still think the M's lineup is probably better than the Angels'.  But then again, what's on paper doesnt count. Play ball! 6
what do you give 12mth olds for constipation?  If you ask your child's doctor... You can give a baby an ounce of prune juiceor apple juice by bottle.

Also you can exercise the babys legs in a bicycle like motion to help the baby pass the bowel movement better.  I hope this helps you with the problem. 3

pinched nerve in neck...any ideas on accelerating the healing? i have a pinched nerve in my neck that is referring pain from my right shoulder blade, up over my delt through my pec to my tricep through my elbow and down to my index finger (which is numb at the tip).  \n\npain is acute and throbbing when the nerve is aggravated (which, as far as i can tell, is happening when tucking my chin in or back and other similar movements). \n\nalready taking motrin and have recently started phys therapy, though not seeing noticeable improvements yet.  any ideas?

My wife suffered a pretty severe neck injury in a car accident and feels that the treatment she received was nothing but good.\n\nIt's non-invasive and covered by most health insurance plans.

WHY IS IT REQ TO HAVE MSDS,S AT WORK BUT NOT REQ AT HOME ? this is a question my boss has  asked me to find th  Material Safety Data Sheets are required by local, city, county, state and the federal government so that employees can learn if they are using dangerous materials.\n\nThe company must tell the employees if they are using dangerous chemicals or products.\n\nAny contractor working at your home also has to provide you with this information.\n\nAnd if you are working with chemicals at home, it is required that the company that sells you the product have the information available. For instance if you buy a wallpaper remover chemical at a paint store, you can ask for the safety sheet when you buy it.\n\nIf you have a business in your home, you may be required to keep safety sheets on file, even if you are the only employee.\n\nIf you are an artist working with dangerous chemicals, you may need a permit from a local or other government agency, and you will be required to show these documents.\n\nBest wishes. 4

Is internet poker illegal under federal law? What law would specifically make internet poker playing illegal? It is not illegal under federal law, but in most states it is illegal to bet on any game of chance, and it doesn't matter how the betting is done, it is illegal.

How did the ideal view of BEAUTY become so limited? In society today i'm sure you all have noticed that beauty is light skin,light eyes,lengthy straight hair, thin bodies,big breast,and thin noses. I have witnessed beauty in all shapes sizes and colors but why does the world find Angelina Jolie to be a sex symbol and not Monique of the Parkers? I find both women equally beautiful!!!!!!!! Because people in the media have no imagination, and people outside the media decide that what is shown in the media must be the "IDEAL VIEW OF BEAUTY".\n\nBut it's BS.  What you see in on TV is the lowest common denominator, not the ideal.  Make-up?  They are designed to appeal to women's concept of what they want to look at when they look in the mirror.  Models?  My Mom told me that she wouldn't buy something that made the model look fat.  Models are chosen to make clothes look good so that clothes sell, not on any ideal of beauty.\n\nEven suggesting that there is a beauty "ideal" is limiting.  That says that there is only one way to be beautiful.  And you and I know that isn't true at all. 1

why does boiling water temperature stay the same for a while once its starts boiling? how are boiling and evaporation the same , and how are they different Boiling is very rapid evaporation starting at the bottom of a container of water.\n\nEvaporation occurs fastest where there is the most heat (energy).  When we heat water to make it boil we heat it from the bottom so the evaporation occurs at the bottom of the pot.  As a result, large  bubbles of water vapor form at the bottom and rise to the surface in the boiling action.  If we applied the same heat to the top surface of the water it would evaporate just as quickly but we would not call it boiling because the bubbles would not form and rise to the surface.\n\nNormally evaporation occurs at a much slower rate than boiling because most evaporation occurs with room temperature water.\n\nEvaporation-is the escape of molecules from the liquid state to the gas or vapor state. In evaporation, molecules of higher-than-average kinetic energy escape from a liquid, leaving it cooler than it was before they escaped.\n\nBoiling-is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of a liquid is equal to the \nexternal pressure above the liquid.  When we give the boiling point of a liquid, we \nneed also to state the pressure. 2

if ethonol is a fuel why is there no mad rush to produce it on a large scale? is there an ethonol combustion engine able to ride the freeways here in America? if yes why arnt we doing some thing about it Yes, there are several ethonal engines available. The reason more ethonal is not produced, however, is supply and demand. There a few ethonal motors on the road, so there is a small demand. It would take a complete phaze-out of gasoline engines in order to fully convert to ethonal, meaning everyone would be required to trade in their cars for the newest model. Since not everyone can afford this, there would still be a need for gasoline.\nAlso, ethonal engines do not get the same power as gasoline engines, which is a deterrent to many. And since ethonal is not currently available everywhere, few are willing to take that extra step on finding out where to buy ethonal fuel.\nCombined with this is the fact that many government officials have a financial interest in the oil economy, and would stand to lose a great deal of money if the country converted to an alternative fuel source. 10

how are we using our resourses?  Here's a better answer than the one provided above, and a site that will provide the answer(s) you are looking for.\n\nHumans are using up natural resources at a great rate and at a great cost to the health of the natural environment and life on Earth.\n\nIt is not the natural resources by themselves that harm the Earth's environment -  it is what humans do with the natural resources that cause the problems to the environment and to the health of living things, including other human beings.\n\nThe burning of fossil fuels in factories to make products and power, and the fuels used by trucks, automobiles and jet planes have caused acid rain and a great increase in carbon dioxide and pollution in the atmosphere.   And forests have been destroyed which used to absorb carbon dioxide.  Carbon dioxide traps heat in our lower atmosphere.\n\nScientists believe that human activities such as these have led to global warming. 2
what caused New Englands poor soil and why were so many factories built in the appalachain mountains.?  New England soil is basically glacial till composed of sand, gravel and rounded boulders.  It was very difficult to cultivate.  There were large stone fences surrounding farmland that were built when boulders were removed from the land being cleared.  When the glaciers swept over the land they scrapped away any fertile loom and when they retreated they left behind pulverized rock and stones rounded by the flow of melt water.  Cape Cod, MA represents the remains left by a retreating glacier and was once much thicker in the arm and elbow, but has since eroded away leaving extensive fine sand dunes. \n\nFactories were often built in locations that provided abundant water used to power water wheels.  Also abundant wood was used for fuel. 4

how do i confront a guy i thought was being honest with me?  If you have some way of "proving" his deceit, engage him in conversation and see how deep he'll dig his hole before you confront him.  This is best done in a group, or at least with someone else around.  Sometimes you can teach someone like that a lesson, or at least let his peers know of his true colors. 9
How do you get over a person that you may think you love? Especially if they really don't like you back? The person is really urging you to get over them, what should you do?  If you have been trying to get over them ever since you found out that they don't like you  the same way back, how do you just "drop" your feelings about the person? YOu don't just drop feelings. It is like trying to just drop ten pounds. You have to work it off. Feelings are emotions: E Motions. They are Energy in Motion and energy has to go somewhere or do something. \n\nYou have lost a dream. You need to let yourself feel sad, cry, be angry whatever. Let all that stuff out and then you will can move on. \n\nGood luck. Try telling an older person who you trust to listen and not try to fix you. Talking about feelings is usually helpful. \n\nGood Luck 9

Why are they getting rid of Monday Night Football on ABC and moving it to ESPN?  It's all about money. The contracts the networks had signed with the NFL expired after this season, so they renegotiated at the beginning of the season.\n\nSunday Night Football is moving to ESPN because ABC (a sister station to ESPN as both are owned by Disney) wants to open its Monday Night Lineup to other "regular" TV shows, especially with the success of "Boston Legal", "Gray's Anatomy" and "Desperate Housewives." \n\nStarting next year, NBC is going to broadcast the Sunday Night Football games since they haven't had any successful primetime Sunday shows for quite some time. 6
What is the chemical cocktail used for lethal injection? I'm personally against the death penalty, and am wondering what chemicals are used.  How can this not be considered cruel and unusual? Usually these three:\nSodium thiopental\nPancuronium/Tubocurarine\nPotassium Chloride\n\nThey get around the 'cruel and unusual' rap because the sodium pentathol (common name) is supposed to knock you right out.  They really have no proof whether it's entirely effective since no one, once the injection has been initiated, has lived.  But I imagine it hurts quite a bit if you're not unconscious by the time your diaphragm collapses and you start to asphyxiate. 2

Anal bleeding???? Sometimes when i use the bathroom and i excrete (# 2) i see bleeding when i whipe...it hurts to come out, so i really dont't know if i'm bleeding because of the pain or what? what could this be???? HELP Well my dear,If you are constantly constipated and not on a healthy diet,the situation you describe could be haemorrhoids..Whilst trying to evacuate,by being constipated,your blood vessels close to the anal sphincter are being stretched to the maximum and therefore,if you continue being constipated,they possibly could break open and there you have what you have describing..Visit a doctor and get him to sort you out.If you do not see a doctor,I'm afraid the problem will escalate and get really really bad and you may need surgery.Better see him soon to get rid of this situation..Hurry n get better...Take good care of yaself and Best wishes 3

_______carries information from DNA in the nucleus out into the cytoplasm of the cell?  mRNA  \nCapped messenger RNA is produced directly from your plasmid that contains a T7 or SP6 promoter. It is purified by our proprietary PUREmessenger™ technology. PUREmessenger™ is a chromatography that not only eliminates traces of DNA and proteins but also allows the selective recovery of the mRNA of the correct size. Shorter abortive transcripts as well as longer contaminating mRNA that are produced during in vitro transcription are eliminated. Capped mRNA will be purified by PUREmessenger™, quantified, re-suspended at 1mg/ml (except if otherwise specified) and aliquoted at 50 µl/aliquot (except if otherwise specified) in sterile conditions. It will be sent to you on cooling blocks together with its documentation: formaldehyde/agarose gel documentation picture. The capped mRNA that is sent to you ready-to-use (dissolved in water or the buffer of your choice) is 100% of your mRNA molecule of interest.\n\nCapped mRNA is produced in clean room facilities for research or clinical applications.\nYour benefit\nHighly purified, efficiently capped mRNA that has a superior efficacy compared to standard mRNA produced with in vitro transcription kits and simply purified by precipitation thus contaminated with alternative transcripts and traces of proteins and DNA fragments. The high quality of mRNA is reproduced from batch to batch. This guarantees the consistency of your results. Capped mRNA can be produced for research or for clinical utilisation: "documented" to be used as Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient or GMP-certified. 2
Does he already love me? I have been dating this guy for a couple months and a couple time under his breath it sounded like he said I love you. Last time we were together he asked if I would have his children and he said "If I asked you to be my wife, would you?" He says he would want to married before we had children. I have feelings but I fear being hurt. Does he mean what he is saying? It  depends  on  how  faithfull  you  are  to  him  and  viceversa. 9
when a female has a baby, do they get tired of the baby daddy's sex?  It is totally dependant upon your relationship with the daddy. \n\nJust think of it this way, do you ever stop loving your parents, your brother or sister? Do you ever stop loving your best friend?\n\nThe bonding is eternal, and it is natural -what you two do together really depends upon the quality of your relationship.\n\nThis relationship is, like the pyramid/heirarchy of needs is elementary for all humans (Food, Shelter, Clothing, Sex). What makes the difference whether you enjoy an intimate relationship or not is a state of mind and how you feel towards that person.\n\nObviously, if the person has played his role well as a father and is committed, then you will feel right about him too. \n\nOne of the things that make us different from God's other creations is the fact that we can relate, associate and endure. I beleive strongly that anything that touches your life so intensely is worth saving up for (both parties), worth waiting, worth sacrificing, worth enduring. As life is not a full metalled road but dirt track wherein we must follow someone's footsteps and perhaps make a few tracks of our own too so that other can follow and you can share what you have learnt. 9
generally anode is marked '+' but in dry cell,cathode is marked '+'.Why?  At anode the reaction taking place is oxidation\nthat is loss of electrons and therefore it gains + charge,wheras at the cathode reduction takes place and hence it gains -ve charge.But in a dry cell,the polarity indicates the terminals to which the cell needs to be  connected.That is cathode to the +ve\nand the anode to the -ve terminal. 4
What are the best treatments for blemishes ?  Don't over-wash your face or use too many anti-blemish products: if you strip away all of your skin's natural oils, it will start producing them like crazy, leading to clogged pores. \n\nI have had super results using Origin's Spot Remover - clears up the occasional blemish faster than anything I have ever tried! 3
Can  name some good universities that offer MBA without the work-ex criterion,provided i have a gud GMAT score  MBA is a practical, career-oriented degree and having work experience, especially management experience, is essential to doing well in the program.  It would be very difficult to understand and relate to the course material, often case studies, if you lack the work experience.\n\nWith that said, depending how great of a GMAT score you have, you probably have a good shot at getting into an MBA program.  Most second and third tier schools will overlook the lack of experience with a good GMAT score.  I don't know if first tier schools will overlook that. 4

What is happening in countries other than the USA in the creation/evolution debate arena?  Reporting from Argentina :-)\nThere is no such debate here. I work as a teacher and I've been both in public and private colleges, and also in a religious (catholic) one. \nEvolution is accepted and taught everywhere that I'm aware of. \nAlso, the only creationists I know belong to christian evangelist minorities. Two of my best friends are creationists and we've never argued over the matter.\nCatholics here are not intransigent or bigoted; I'm sure there are some who believe in a litteral interpretation of the Bible, but they keep to themselves. \nI'm aware of the debate in the USA, mostly because  in the Evolution course I took we used US textbooks and they had whole chapters about it. We skipped those ;)\nI think it's very sad. 2

Is the diesel locomotive has gear box?  If you mean a gear box to drive the wheels of the locomotive, the answer is no.\n\nThe diesel engine in modern locomotives does not directly drive the wheels of the locomotive.  The diesel engine drives an electric generator.  The electricity is transferred to an electric traction engine that drives the wheels of the locomotive.  The traction engine generates far more torque than would be possible if the diesel engine was directly attached to the drive wheels. 2

why do people that like the color black always seem to be punk or gothic? do they worship the devil and go to h*ll ( hell) i dont like saying it but its a true question. You do realize that most of the clergy wears black, don't you?  Maybe those who you perceive as goth or punk are just very pious.  I don't think that's the reason, but just something to think about.\n\nWearing certain clothes or being punk or gothic does not say anything about your morality or religious beliefs.  Many goths and punks are devout Christians, Jews, ect.  Don't judge a book by it's cover, and don't judge lest ye be judged. 1

I was diognosed to be HIV positive three years back and was put on antiretrovirols [ from that time,? I have been taking combivir and stocrine, I have never suffered from any oportunistc infection all along. I am a married man and my spouse knows this and we always have protected sex I am 40yrs old. My main problem is that my libido has gone so low that I normaly just force myself to have sex, I never feel like doing it andmy spouse is realy having it rough. Could this be due to this drugs or what could be happening to me? Any time I go back for the tests, my viral load is always undetectable and my immune system is quite okey I am even told by my doctor that I can fathter another child at this time. What could be the reason to this low sex desire ? my docter tells me that he has no evidence that the drugs affect sex life.Could osmeone help, because my marriage is on the rocks due to this problem. Is there a solution and which one is it? Have your doc order some blood tests to get your testosterone levels checked.\n\nOnce a guy hits his mid 30's, the T level can go down significantly, to the point where libido, as well as other things that testosterone controls, goes to pot.\n\nIt's a starting point. 7
how do I secure my wireless router?  After you log in to the administration console as listed by the other answers above (no need to repeat them), 3 items that you can do to protect your wireless router (all described in detail in your admin manual):\n1) Hide your SSID - if you don't broadcast your SSID, then most people won't even know that it is there\n2) Enable encryption - use WEP or whatever encryption your solution offers\n3) Bind to your MAC address - This means only your wireless machine can connect to the router. To find out your MAC address in windows, go to start>RUN, then type cmd, then type ipconfig /all. You will see an entry for 'Physical Address' that is your MAC address to enter into your admin screen.\n\nThese three items should sufficiently lock down your wireless setup. 5

guys, this is for my thesis.. do you agree that it is a prob when ur folks hav a diffrnt choice of career 4 u?  Substantial amounts of research have shown that people are only happy in a career if (1) it matches their interests, or (2) if they have modified the usual way of doing their job to match their interests.\n\nTo learn about this, research Holland Codes.\n\nIf your parents choose a career that matches your interests, you would probably be happy in it.  If they don't, you would probably be unhappy, no matter how much of a family tradition it is, or how much money you make, or how successful you are.\n\n\n\nCircumplex models may resemble factorial or type models but further specify a relationship between the different types or factors. Typically, some types or factors are more related than others and can be presented on a polygon. John L. Holland's RIASEC or Holland Codes (see below) may be the best-known example of this type of theory. Correlations of personality scores should resemble a simplex form where opposing types have low correlation and close types have a high correlation.\n\nWikipedia knows all. 4

Why's watching Television so addictive? Whereas reading books isn't in general (no doubt there are some avid readers but  I am talking about the majority). I'd say that TV is more popular than books because it is multimedia and much more closely matches how we normally take in information. TV is video and audio. You can see and hear it and thus more information can be squeezed into a short amount of time while also giving a much richer experience. Next time you're watching TV, consider how much you would have to write just to completely describe a single frame.\nLast, TV is also much easier because it's a passive medium. Reading requires your brain to work harder to both read the words and then interpret them into visuals. TV is already visual and can be watched with much less focus & energy. 2

How do you stop loving your ex? Just wondering if anyone has had success with this one....I just want to feel better. It takes time.  First you have to get yourself busy.  If you don't have a full time job, get one now. \nJoin a church or community group and become active there too. Make some new friends along the way. Take some classes at community college. Volunteer at a hospital, home for neglected and abused children, humane society...there are many places needing volunteer help.\n\nIn other words, make yourself a new life.  Become a different person........and in no time at all, you'll find you're happy just being with the person you have become.  Other people are drawn to that and you'll have more friends than you ever dreamed.  \n\nSince you have an ex, I assume you want to have a happier, more secure relationship. It begins with yourself and your way of viewing the world.  Become positive and be willing to try some new things.  \n\nDancing or piano lessons? Do something for yourself that you always kind of wanted to do.\n\nTime and distance help too - but living a full life is really the best answer.\n\nGood luck.  It will happen. 9

how come we are the only planet sustaining  life?  we are the only planet sustaining life for myriad reasons.  first there is the distance from the earth to the sun.  if you were to increase the distance by only a few hundred miles. the earth would be to cold to suport life.  same thing the other way if you decreased the DX (distance) the earth would be way too HOT.  not to mention the increase in solar radiation UV and otherwise. so at least in this solarsystem a habitable planet would have to be about the same distance away from the sun.  and they have sent deep space probes out to verify that there isnt another planet in syncronusrotation to earth on the other side of the sun.  \n\nthere are other reasons some to complicated to mention and the rest, well... sorry but i just couldnt be bothered right now to list. things like the speed of the rotation of the planets, atmospheric conditions, lack of atmosphere,  gravity effects. etc etc etc....\n\nbut the most important reason that there are no other planets capable of suporting life is because Thats the way GOD made things.  \n\nnow potential exists for man to make habitable environments on 1 or 2 of the other planets in the solar system (mars possably venus) but that wouldn't be the planet sustaining life there. it would be technology sustaining life there. 2

what happens to a body when, as they say,"gets the wind knocked out of them"?  When your torso (chest, abdomen) receives significant force by a blow (fist, toso hitting the ground after a fall, etc), the reflex reaction is for the muscles of the torso to tense up.  This includes your abdominal muscles, muscles between your ribs (intercostals), neck, etc.  This forces the air out, and your diaphram can not overcome these muscles to inflate the lungs (when your diaphragm contracts, it causes the lungs to fill with air).  So for the second or two that you're torso muscles are in "spasm", you can't take in a breath.  They spasm as a reflex, that mother nature has built in to protect from another forceful blow that could damage your internal organs. 2

Does eating a noble metal have any health implications? I was offered an Indian treat recently which was topped with silver leaf.  I suspect that eating this has not negative affect on your health, but wanted to see if there were any health or chemistry experts that had additional comments on the matter. who b8r than an indian to answer this question?\n\nok...the silver u have eaten is about 10^-6 m thin, that is 0.000006m, and if u want 1gm of silver this way u would have to eat about 10,000 sweets, so...the amount of metal you ate will not cause any significant change in your body. so, dont worry and i hope u enjoyed your sweet.    \n\nps: i have eaten loads of such sweets without ny problem to my health, but if u still wanna b completely sure, just pull off the layer of silver bfr u eat, its quite easy to do so, and as much fun as popping the bubbles in bubble wrap. :) 2
how do i know if my husband is cheating? what are some signs?  In having been/recently been cheated on.I've learned many way of the tell tale sings.There's one's as to being distant,taking shower's after going out and coming home,not being able to concentrate on relationship issue's as normal,attitude change's,together time isn't important anymore,extra attention/affection,new past times/hobbies that seem to be done at odd times,apperance changes,sudden intrest in telling stories of or about another woman from work or had just met,sexual changes such as tring different things or disintrest or wanting more,changes in behavior,depression,anxious,needing space,arguements about unimportant little things,or when your in need of conformation of why things change they get irritated and say that it's all in your head,relationship lifestyle changes,and all i can say is trust your gut instinct.usually if you are close spiritually,emotionally,intellectually,and know every little thing about each other you can get a wierd feeling when it happens.Sometime's they buy you things when they go out and have no answer to as where they were.They take intrest in buying little things that you like to collect or that they know will distract you from being suspicious of them.Alot of extra reassurance of devotion and wanting to change the way things run in the relationship. 9

How often does one have sex after marriage over the years?  Sex in marriage is sweet but it isn't truly the point! It matters little how frequent or little. What matters is the heart and soul of the relationship and what it is founded upon. I agree sex is a need in marriage, but other issues and aspects are far more important and over the years sex becomes less and less important next to the other far more important areas involved in a marriage. yes sex is important and desperatly needed but at times. Only you can answer this between yourself and your spouce. 9
Is it really all that difficult for a female to be elected US president? With Geena Davis acting recently in Commander-in-Chief and almost no fiction (excepting maybe When Spirits Beckon at Amazon.com), it's surprising that there's very little discussion on the prospects of either Condi Rice or Hillary Clinton becoming the 1st female president. Even if the right supports Condi in the Presidential Cabinet, I really doubt their support would run all of the way to the Presidency. There are far to many in the "religion right" that would have a ideological problem with a woman being President. \n\nAs for Hillary, I think she could get a lot of support from the more liberal left, but still not enough to be elected. Not to mention there is A LOT of dirt on her. The realities of who she is would turn away all but the most liberal minded. \n\nSo yes, I think it is difficult for a female to be elected. I wouldn't rule it out for the future, but for now I find it highly unlikely it could be accomplished. 10

what is pyloric antrum? in anatomy yloric antrum is initial portion of the pyloric part of the stomach. It is near the bottom of the stomach on the lateral side of the pyloric sphincter, which separates the stomach and the small intestine. It may temporarily become partially or completely shut off from the remainder of the stomach during digestion by peristaltic contraction of the prepyloric sphincter; it is demarcated, sometimes, from the second part of the pyloric part of the stomach (pyloric canal) by a slight groove. The pyloric antrum is the location of several important endocrine cells including Gastrin-producing G Cells (stimulate acid production) and the luminal-pH-sensitive population of somatostatin producing of D cells (responsible for shutting off acid secretion. There is a second hormone-sensitive population near the fundus.)\n\nSynonym: antrum pyloricum, antrum, lesser cul-de-sac.\n\nSources:\n\n    * William F Ganong. "Review of Medical Physiology, 22nd Edition."\n\nOr in easier terms: The bulging part of the lower end of the stomach\n\nAdd on hey you are the MSA person....I happened to anser both your med questions!

What are some hands on activities for improving the retelling of stories for children on a 3rd grade level?  Use graphic organizers to help you.  You can create a KWL chart.  You divide a piece of paper into 3 sections.  At the top of each column you write K  (what you KNOW)  W (what you WANT to learn) and L  (what your LEARNED).  This of course is if you are reading an expository text.\nIf you are want to do an organized retell of a story try reciprocal teaching.  You can check my explanation of reciprocal teaching in the following link.  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AsorCAyXs_lbpOpc2uXPkqDsy6IX?qid=1006021303860\n\nIt gets the students going and thinking about the text\nYou can also try TEXT CODING\nAs the students read you have different post-it notes they can use.  Each post it has the following symbols\n! = WOW, I like this part of the story\n? = I don't understand what happened or this word\n* = this reminds me of.....\nYou can even make up your own\nHope this helps :) 4

Are Europeans losing their will to fight, to defend their culture and even their will to live ?  Definitely not. As a European I can tell that. But maybe there is a small change in what methodes we use. Traditionally it has been with weapons, and we have bad experiences with that. Now, I think, most Europeans try to fight with arguments and solve problems peacefully rather than with violence.\nMaybe in the end it will turn out to be better, who knows... 1

Why were the two theives who hung beside Jesus crucified? Was stealing a capitol offence?  Q1:  In the big picture, it seems God wanted to contrast the attitudes of the criminals.  One had a hardened heart, as we all do in our natural state, and hurled insults at Jesus while scoffing Him.  The other feared God and acknowledged Him as King and Savior.\n\nIt also (obviously?) affirms Jesus was punished under the same sentence as criminals, and to His last moments was regarded as sinless.\n\nTheologically, God used it signally; namely, this story stands out describing how Faith Alone in Christ Alone saves.  This criminal who apparently did no good thing (beyond the fruit of his confession) was to be saved (into paradise) by faith in Christ. \n\nQ2: the (Luke 23:41) response of the criminal seems to indicate the punishment justly fit their crimes. 1

Is it true that doctors prescribe antibiotics for bacterial base illnesses for profit despite its uselessness?  Antibiotics are used to combat bacterial base illnesses it is viral one the antibiotics do not work with. \nDoctor will sometimes prescribe pill for patients for a placebo effect meaning that if the patient think the pill will work then it will. \nI doubt profit has anything to do with it because a doctor makes the same whether they prescribe anything or not. 3

Practice treading water without using your hands and practice submerging underwater. Running on the sand is great. If you weight train, cut it out until you're done with your certification. Good luck. 6

HOW TO OPEN .JSP FILES?  To open them for editing, you can use any standard text editor. I like JCreator, but anything from Notepad to Dreamweaver will work.\n\nTo open them for viewing, you'll need a browser, but you can't just open it directly or it will look strange. It has to be served to your browser via a "servlet container." A servlet container translates JavaServer Pages (JSP) code into straight HTML that the browser can render.\n\nApache Tomcat is the reference implementation of a servlet container. You can download it for free at tomcat.apache.org. 5
why can I not control how much I eat? Sometimes I get out of control and eat like i've been without food for days.  I know in my head that i've ate too much food, but i still keep eating until my stomach is full to the point of bursting and i can't even walk up straight. I usually crave on bread or potatoes. Why is this? Try to eat untily you are not hungry anymore, not until you can't eat anymore. I used to stuff myself until my stomach hurt, which was pointless because I wasn't even hungry anymore.\n\nAlso, eat on plates and bowls. You will eat far less if you put some chips on a plate than to take the whole bag and sit down because you won't stop.\n\nAlso, use a smaller plate for larger portions. It will appear that you are eating a lot.\n\nIt's all a mind game, so use your mind to an advantage. 3

why does it shows 10:10 on new watches?  10:10 became the standard in advertising photography for watches with hands and the tradition continues.  The hands in this position are well separated and clear to see.  Both are pointing upwards which is thought to be more appealing than the opposing position of 8:20.  As a side note, photographers will often times break the crystal on a watch to get a clearer image of the hands and face, without the interference of the glass. 7

Could someone explain this problem in dial up for me? I have 2 dial up a/cs, 1 for my home & the other is my company a/c.Both connect using my phoneline, it was all ok, when yesterday, i could not access my home a/c but was able to connect using the office a/c with no probs, so i called up the service provider & enquired abt this situation & he asked for my landline number & said it will be alrite within 5 minutes, but no use, i cant access my home a/c, the error comes\n\n " Access was denied because the username and/or password was invalid on the domain",\n\nI am using this a/c for mails for my parents as they provide this address for communication, so what bothers me is that all the a/cs while using dial up use the landline and connect to the remote server thru the ISP number, so what does this have to do with the phone line number,only if it is disconnected only i can get the no dial tone, the phone number and line are ok. Could someone explain me where the problem lies, in my opinion it is with the ISP provider. As you well know, your access was denied due to an incorrect username and password. It is not the ISPs fault, you have entered an incorrect username/password. This is very EASY to fix, provided, of course, that you ARE the appropriate user. Call your ISP up, give them the information they ask for to validate you, then change your password with them on the line. Don't hang up until you can connect to the internet using their service. (Call from another phone line, cell phone, etc.)\nGood Luck. 5

How can you increase your intelligence?  I think the definition of intelligence you are looking for is:\n# The capacity to acquire and apply knowledge.\n# The faculty of thought and reason.\n# Superior powers of mind.\n\nThe simplist way to do this is to read, study, and remember things.\n\nThe reading the more you read the more information you will take in.  The more you read the better you will get at it and the fast you will read too.\n\nStudy the things you want to get more intelligent on.  If it's world affairs then study what's happening in the world, the politics, the history, and read the paper.\n\nRemembering things for some can be the hardest part.  If you have trouble remembering things then there are books and courses on remembering things.  Learn and practice the techniques they teach.\n\nThe more you know, the more knowledge you have to apply to a situation.\n\nThe mind is like a musscle, the more you use it the stronger it will get.\n\nA couple things of note:\n"It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it." - Aristotle\n\nIf you keep an open mind people will throw a lot of garbage in.\n\nThe idea is that not everything you will learn is the truth and not everyone is right.  With learning a lot one needs to also lean how to distinguish truth and garbage in what is learned. 3

How do I convert a video tap segment that lasts 4 min onto the web? I have a VHS tape and I need to put the TV news segments on the web.  Also, we need for news producers to be able to use the downloads as b-roll for future news segments VHS is a pain to put online.  You will need an analog-to-digital video converter, which you can get for a couple of hundred bucks or less; I have one from Pinnacle which seems to work pretty well, and comes with Pinnacle Studio for video editing.  I recommend getting a digital camcorder to do any future recordings, though - it will eliminate one arduous step from your production process. 5

Why are no airlines profitable? It seems like all the airlines have gone bankrupt at one point or another, and FlyI just announced that they would be selling the company next week. We obviously use the services of the airline, and you certainly pay for the seats, but why does it seem that none of the companies make any money? And if they don't, why would you even start an airline in the first place? Lots of prestige in owning your own airline.\n\nYou may discover a profitable route that is available for you to service. (Your can run an airline with only one plane and only one route)\n\nOn the other hand,\n\nCrafts are EXTREMELY expensive to run/maintain/service\n\nFuel is extremely EXPENSIVE.\n\nPilots wages are EXTREMEMLY expensive.\n\nPolitics and newspaper headlines can SEVERELY DAMAGE your airline business. eg 9/11. \n\nThe industry is EXTREMELY competitive.\n\n\nMajority of your business is from holiday makers/vaccationers every summer and is NEVER guaranteed. 7

what is the high fiber diet? is it healthy. does it work. what do you eat? Pineapple is my favorite high fiber diet!!\nFor this reason, they can help correct disorders of the large intestine (colon), and keep it functioning normally.\n\nPurpose\nDietary fiber is the part of a plant that provides and maintains the plant's structure. Cellulose, hemicellulose, polysaccharides, pectins, gums, mucilages, and lignins are dietary fibers. These fibers are unrelated chemically, however, they all have one thing in common -- they can't be digested by the human body. For this reason, they can help correct disorders of the large intestine (colon), and keep it functioning normally. Therefore, it is important to increase the amount of fiber in the diet. \n\nFunction of The Colon\nThe main job of the colon is to complete the digestion process. This occurs by removing excess water from food wastes entering from the small intestine. When wastes pass through the intestines too quickly, not enough water is absorbed. Watery stools and diarrhea are the result. In contrast, if the passage of waste is too slow, too much water is absorbed. This results in hard stools and constipation, which often leads to straining. These simple problems occasionally lead to more serious disorders. \n\nThe Importance of Dietary Fiber\nFiber (also called roughage or bulk) promotes the wavelike contractions that keep food moving through the intestine. Also, high-fiber foods expand the inside walls of the colon. This eases the passage of waste. Fibrous substances pass through the intestine undigested. They also absorb many times their weight in water, resulting in softer, bulkier stools. \n\nStudies show that rural Africans, who eat diets high in fiber, eliminate food waste in one-third the time it takes people from urban westernized cultures. Their stools are larger and softer. Because of the greater bulk and speed of foods through the digestive tract, it is believed that harmful substances are also swept out before they can cause problems. In fact, these rural people have fewer of the digestive tract diseases that plague Western man. It is thought that this may be related to the nature of their diet. \n\nA high-fiber diet causes a large, soft, bulky stool that passes through the bowel easily and quickly. Because of this action, some digestive tract disorders may be avoided, halted, or even reversed simply by following a high-fiber diet. A softer, larger stool helps prevent constipation and straining. This can help avoid or relieve hemorrhoids. More bulk means less pressure in the colon, which is important in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome and diverticulosis (defects in the weakened walls of the colon). In addition, fiber appears to be important in treating diabetes, elevated cholesterol, colon polyps, and cancer of the colon. \n\nNutrition Facts\nAs long as a balanced selection of foods from each of the basic food groups is chosen, the High Fiber Diet is nutritionally adequate. Some studies indicate that excessive intake of certain dietary fiber sources may bind and interfere with the absorption of the following minerals: calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, selenium, and zinc. However, there appears to be no problem for those adults who follow a balanced, regular diet. Occasionally, a physician may prescribe supplements. \n\nThe Use of Fiber in the Irritable Bowel\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common disorders of the lower digestive tract. There is no disease present with IBS, but it creates bothersome symptoms such as altered bowel habits -- constipation, diarrhea, or both alternately. There may also be bloating, abdominal pain, cramping, and spasm. An attack of IBS can be triggered by emotional tension and anxiety, poor dietary habits, and certain medications. Increased amounts of fiber in the diet can help relieve the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome by producing soft, bulky stools. This helps to normalize the time it takes for the stool to pass through the colon. Liquids help to soften the stool.  3

Is blood cancer curable ? I want to know whether blood cancer is curable, if it is identified in the beginning stage itself.\n\nWhat about hereditary blood cancer ? Is this curable or only death is the end ? Short answer: After treatment, blood cancer can go away for a long time and possibly never come back.  When this happens, patients may say they are cured.    \n\nLong answer:\nLeukemia may be the most widely known blood cancer, but there are other major blood cancers such as Hodgkins and Non-Hodgkins lymphoma and multiple myeloma. Cancer patients undergo treatments (chemotherapy, radiation, alternative therapy etc) so that they can put their cancer into remission.  Remission means that the disease has disappeared or is no longer growing. After remission cancer can come back, but this varies from case to case.  Some cancers are called "very curable" because they respond well to treatment and often stay away after remission.  Once cancer has been in remission for a long time, many patients will say they are cured.  Doctors usually avoid saying that cancer is "cured" because they don't want to promise that the cancer will never come back.  However, according to one radiologist, the longer a cancer is in remission the less likely it will gome back.\n\nIn cases where cancer is believed to be hereditary, cancer can still be put into long term or permanent remission.  The biggest factors are the type of cancer, the stage and agressiveness of one's particular cancer, and one's overall health. 3

If someone was born at 10:18pm on the west cost and moves to the east cost would the day of birth change?  Wherever a baby is born, the date and time of the birth is entered on the birth certificate, which is issued in the state or county in which the baby is born.  Regardless of where a baby is taken afterwards, the birth certificate will have recorded the legal date and time of birth. Besides, a baby rarely leaves a hospital until at least a day or two after birth.\n\nIf you're referring to a baby born outside of a hospital, I don't really know what the procedure for obtaining a birth certificate in that situation would be.  But the date and time the baby is born still pertains to the place it was born. 7

Is the new scoring system for Figure Skating effective? or do all routines seem to routine now? Is it making them work harder? That's a good question. These Winter Olympics in Turin are the first I've seen of the new scoring system and it seems to be working fine. Correct me if I'm wrong but wasn't this new system designed more to prevent the ugly cheating scandal involving the French and Russian judges at the pairs competition during the 2002 Games in Salt Lake City? If it's made that sort of rubbish impossible to be repeated, then I think it's a big step forward. 6

who invented golf?  Golf as we know it emerged in Scotland. The Scots were playing golf in its very basic form - take a club, swing it at a ball, move ball from starting point to finishing hole in as few strokes as possible - by at least the mid-15th Century.\n\nIn fact, the earliest known reference to golf comes from King James II of Scotland, who, in 1457, issued a ban on the playing of golf and football (soccer). Those games, James complained, were keeping his archers from their practice.\n\nJames III in 1471 and James IV in 1491 each re-issued the ban on golf.\n\nBut the game continued to develop in Scotland over the decades and centuries, until 1744 when the first-known rules of golf were put down in writing in Edinburgh. Golf as it was then played would be easily recognized by any modern golfer.\n\nBut can it be said that the Scots "invented" golf? Not quite, because there's strong evidence that the Scots were influenced themselves by even earlier versions of games that were similar in nature.\n\nHere's what the USGA Museum says about the issue: "While many Scots firmly maintain that golf evolved from a family of stick-and-ball games widely practiced throughout the British Isles during the Middle Ages, considerable evidence suggests that the game derived from stick-and-ball games that were played in France, Germany and the Low Countries."\n\nPart of that evidence is the etymology of the word "golf" itself. "Golf" derives from the Old Scots terms "golve" or "goff," which themselves evolved from the medieval Dutch term "kolf."\n\nThe medieval Dutch term "kolf" meant "club," and the Dutch were playing games (mostly on ice) at least by the 14th Century in which balls were struck by sticks that were curved at the bottom until they were moved from Point A to Point B. Sounds a lot like hockey, doesn't it? Except that it sort of sounds like golf, too (except for that ice part).\n\nThe Dutch and Scots were trading partners, and the fact that the word "golf" evolved after being transported by the Dutch to the Scots lends credence to the idea that the game itself may have been adapted by the Scots from the earlier Dutch game.\n\nSomething else that lends credence to that idea: Although the Scots played their game on parkland (rather than ice), they (or least some of them) were using balls they acquired in trade from ... Holland.\n\nAnd the Dutch game wasn't the only similar game of the Middle Ages. Going back even farther, the Romans brought their own stick-and-ball game into the British Isles.\n\nSo does that mean that the Dutch (or someone else other than that Scots) invented golf? No, it means that golf grew out of games that were played in different parts of Europe.\n\nBut we're not trying to deny the Scots their place in golf history. The Scots made a singular improvement to all the games that came before: They dug a hole in the ground, and made getting the ball into that hole the object of the game. 6

how can i get organized?  Organizing what? If you mean your time/life, there's a large "movement" on the Internet who are getting into a system called "Getting Things Done" or GTD for short. If you search for this you'll find lots of useful suggestions.\n\nThe basic theory is that you get all of the things you're thinking about, need to do, etc, transcribed down into a system you can rely on (say, a notebook, a computer program, whatever).. and then you note down "next actions" for those things. You can then refer back to this to always push your actions on a step at a time. Search for "getting things done". 7

What is the difference in having sex and making love? I know my opnion im just curious of what other people think. Making love is when you are trying to please the person you are with out of your own heart, like you're trying to get inside of them so they feel how you feel for them.  Sex is just a way of expressing it and it's probably the best way.\n\nHaving sex is sort of like relieving yourself, you just want to get inside of them (or opposite for women) for the physical gratification, and you wake up the next day wondering why you bothered and hoping you don't have a disease. 9
In need of some "guy" advice...? I am considered s prep. But I am dating someone outside of that social circle. He is in some of my classes at school, he is  kind of a dorky, but he is so sweet, and for a "dork" he is pretty cute. He had the guts to actually come up to me, in front of my friends, gave me a flower, told me that I was the most beautiful girl he has ever seen, and he wanted to take me out. I cannot turn someone down that would do that (for me especially), it must have took him a whole to do that. And I give him props. But my friends dont think that he is right for me. They say it isn't because of his looks. I know thats why. They say he just doesn't go with me. I actually really like this guy. My friends are important to me, but this guy really likes me, not just because I have a nice ass, he told me that he loves everything about me, and that he would really like to have chance with me. What should I do? girl, you are so right. if you like him and he is good to you and good for you, go for it. chance are, your "friends" are just jealous 'cause this guy is crazy over you. you true friends will want to see you happy. the rest will just fuss cause he doesn't fit in to their click. you are being more mature than your friends and it's nice to see everybody doesn't base everything on looks alone! good for you! good luck! 9

My Girl Frind Thinks that She's Not Fit For ME.... But I love her Very Much. What Should i do ??  Sounds like there's a communication problem going on.  She might be saying something that you're not understanding.  I'd try to do a lot of listenening, and ask her what she means by what she says.  But you need to be really patient and understanding.  Don't try to defend yourself.  Don't try telling her where she's wrong.  Just try to understand what she's feeling and what you can do about it.  That could be a good start. 9

If the speed of light is the fastest we can ever go, then what is the point of traveling in space? I mean the closest planet is mars and it takes us 8 months to get there.  The closest solar system is 4 light years away.  So why even bother with investigating space if we are so sure taht we can't get to anywhere that we want to go. Light travels roughly 186,000 miles per second. Einstein once said that nothing can move faster than light, and this previously was an accepted truth because visible light was considered to be just a wave of energy. However, when studying how light reacts to strong gravitational pulls, such as one from a black hole, we can see that it bends under gravity. This indicates that it shares some characteristics with matter. It could even have a minute amount of mass. If light shares characterisitcs with matter, then we can harness it and use it the same way we do air in a jet engine. Can we not go faster than the wind naturally blows with a jet engine? Yes. Then I do not see why we can't go faster than light when harnessing light itself as energy.  There have been several questions like this, and I really feel that traveling faster than lightspeed is only decades away. 2

can we run on the treadmill with an aircond / fan on? can walking only make us slim? and lose fat? Most gyms have fans on their treadmills or near them so definitely. You will burn more calories by the effort. Walking will definitely make you thin but most importantly is calories in versus calories used. You have to create a calorie deficit to loose weight. 3
how come I have wetter orgasms on some says more than others..Is it my diet?  A lot of it may be how well hydrated you are. It's hard to drink too much water and easy to drink too little, so drink often! Women often vary wildly around the times of their periods; many women become very dry just before or right at the start of their period. Some of it may be mood, too. If you're not super into it or aren't feeling it (maybe you woke up on the wrong side of the bed) you're not likely to be as wet as when you're at 100%. 9

Who was the 17th president?  Andrew Johnson, U.S. President \n\nBorn: 29 December 1808 \nBirthplace: Raleigh, North Carolina \nDied: 31 July 1875 \nBest Known As: President of the United States, 1865-1869 \n\nAndrew Johnson was a poor tailor in Tennessee whose wife taught him to read and write. A fast learner with a flair for oratory, he worked his way up to the U.S. Senate. In the Civil War he was the only Southern Democrat to support Abraham Lincoln, and was chosen for the vice-presidency in 1864. When Lincoln was assassinated in 1865, Johnson became President, but clashed with Radical Republicans, who held a majority in congress. They passed the Tenure of Office Act in 1867, restricting presidential powers, and when Johnson defied them, he was impeached in 1868. A few months later the Senate acquitted him by one vote. He was succeeded in office by Ulysses S. Grant. 10

How does Physical Education contributes to, Physical Social & Economial development of a country? Phycical Education, Physical Education provides physical benefits because of the exercise involved.  In addition, students learn the importance of nutrition and fitness.  Social skills are developed through lessons that involve teamwork, cooperation, and confidence building.  Finally, the economy can improve because of the added health benefits of an active community.

Why is there hate towards different religions in people? Some people hate you just because you r from different releigon or even sect that he is from. Cant we all leave  the religon as a private matter? I wish they would. I think each person has their own path and a right to that path and if it makes them a better person who are we to try and judge them or convert them. I think if people really lived according to the basis of most religions they would respect others and love their neighbor without prejudice. It would be a wonderful world if we all would seek first to understand, then to be understood. Not have to insist on being right or seeing their way as the only way or others seeing people of other religions as a threat or some sort of abomination to their religion. I find it quite hypocritical and ironic. 1

If there's a real name listed on the site then you should be able to do an online white pages search to find an address. Other than that, you'd have to contact the website host to see who owns the account, and most providers will not give out that information. If there's not an address listed on the page, chances are you won't find anything on it. 5

Do you consider the bask. tactic of holding the ball 30+ secs. every possession before shooting  "chicken"?  Holding the ball is a way of controlling the tempo of the game. If you're playing a run and gun team, you want to get them out of their normal game by slowing it down. Usually running teams dont have as good of half court offense. If you control the tempo, the better chance you have of beating your opponent. Also, moving the ball around for 30 seconds and getting a good shot allows for your defense to get back and force the opponent into the half court. 6

See, it's like this first you go make plans on Monday morning with all six of them, then the first is on Monday, the second is on Tuesday, granted the monday doesn't sleep in(some do, some don't), then, you have that Hump Date, you know, Wednesday that ones tricky, they are the fun ones, all stressed beccuase it's the middle of the week. then there's thursday, you know, the party starts early. Friday is fun as well as Saturday, only Saturday is the all day date type. now the trick is to keep them far apart from one another. See, keep them too close and you'll be caught, you know, like in the mall or something. also get them with different personalities, you know, the stay-at-home girl, the party chick, the scholar, the freak, the conversation all night type, the naive one. I've had a couple call me their boyfriend, but the naive one won't yet, waiting for me to do but hey, I won't be able to handle that yet, I'm in school so .......'m always busy, too busy to call them my girl or anything other than calling them. well, hope it helps, take care 7

30 second mystery...? A boy walks into a room alone and is taken to a seat by an older woman who is a stranger to the boy. He is strapped in and told he will not be able to communicate with his family for some time. He cries and begs to go, but is told be quiet and sit still. Hours later the boy is freed and is told to leave the room. He doubts that he will ever see the older woman again.\n\nThe Mystery\nWhere is the boy and who is the woman???\n\nClue: IMHO, the word "room" is loosely used... Probably a boy flying on an airplane alone. The woman is the stewardess. 8
what is the slope of the line with equation 2x + y = 6?  The “slope” of a line is the change in one variable with respect to the change in the other variable.  For example: rise over run.  \n\nThe change in Y with respect to X is indeed -2.  As X increases by one Y will decrease by two.\n\nHowever you may also be interested to know the change in X with respect to Y is: -1/2.  As Y increases by one X will decrease by ½. 2

why dont women want to date you after you tell them you have kids? I've been single for almost a year now, have been looking to meet a special lady. Everytime i start talking to one they end up leaving me alone after I tell them I have 2 kids that live with me. my sons are good children. They're still young (6 & 3) but its not as if I'm looking for a mother for them, I'd just enjoy the company of a woman sometime, possibly dinner & a movie or something. How can I let women know that I'm ok being a single father, & just by asking them on a date, it doesnt mean i want them to be a mother-figure for my kids? please help!! Some people just dont want to deal with other peoples kids----I think that it would be better to find someone that already has kids--they will understand u better than a person that dont have kids.  And also the fact that the kids live with you--alot of women are bothered by that.  \nBut the best advice I can give is that--u obviously havent meet that special person--because if you had--she will love you and accept you even if you had 10 kids---so just keep looking--you will find that person.\nGood luck. 9
Why are African American black, and why do Asians have different eyes?  AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE BLACK BEACUE THE HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF A CHEMICAL CALLED MELANIN BUILT UP INTO THEIR SKIN. THIS CHEMICAL CAUSES THE SKIN TO BE RESISTANT TO THE ULTRA VIOLET RAYS OF THE SUN; OR IN OTHER WORDS SO THEY CAN STAY IN THE SUN LONGER AND BE MORE RESISTANT TO BURNING. THIS IS THE SAME CHEMICAL THAT CAUSES YOU TO BROWN AFTER TANNING. IT IS A GENETIC TRAIT THAT ADAPTED LONG AGO SO THAT THEY COULD SURVIVE AND BE HAPPIER ON THE HOT VERY, VERY SUNNY AFRICAN PLAINS.\n\nASIANS HAVE EYES THAT HAVE A SMALL FLAP OF SKIN AT THE SIDES OF THEIR EYES THAT GIVES THEM A LONGER SLIGHTLY SLANTED APPEARANCE. THIS IS MERELY A GENETIC TRAIT THAT THAT PARTICULAR GROUP OF PEOPLE SHARES. THERE IS NO FUNCTION TFOR IT. 1

What do you mean by the hindi word Abhyuday?  अभ्युदय:: means Progress\nIs that your name\n\nThis name is inherent to harmonious, good-natured and reliable people. They are wonderful family men, faithful friends and honest-minded and sometimes too credulous people, whose natures are indispensable. They open themselves up and blossom only in a circle of their close friends. Sometimes they are self-satisfied, conservative and devoid of magnificence. Although they are talented and diligent toilers, they lack a real thirst for work. 1

Has anyone here passed the milk challenge? This is drinking a gallon of milk in an hour. Yes when I was preganant at age 19yrs., awhile ago.

who like harry potter fanfiction?  I enjoy Harry Potter fanfiction in small bits, I don't like to read extensive novels about Harry Potter written by the fans due to the fact that I like to remember the content that I read in order to discuss theories with other fans. So, I may read shorter fan fictions but, not the novel-sized fan fictions. 7
what kind of romantic gift can i make for my boyfriend? Valentine's day is coming up and I want to do something romantic and sweet since I don't have a whole lot of cash this year. buy a clay flower pot from a craft store and paint it a solid color and then decorate it with either hearts or quotes or key words from special times you shared together- then buy some flower foam (also from the craft store) and stuff it in the pot- cover the foam with tissue paper or moss- Then bake him his favorite cookies and bake them with popsicle sticks in them- when they are done, you could glue fake leaves on the sticks so that the cookies look like flowers with leaves (I guess you could even paint the popsicle sticks green with something that is safe to ingest- food coloring?)- when you're done you have a pot of cookie flowers! 1

what is a blog?  blog is a website in which journal entries are posted on a regular basis and displayed in reverse chronological order. The term blog is a shortened form of weblog or web log. Authoring a blog, maintaining a blog or adding an article to an existing blog is called "blogging". Individual articles on a blog are called "blog posts," "posts" or "entries". A person who posts these entries is called a "blogger". A blog comprises hypertext, images, and links (to other webpages and to video, audio and other files). Blogs use a conversational style of documentation. Often blogs focus on a particular "area of interest", such as Washington, D.C.'s political goings-on. Some blogs discuss personal experiences.\n\nBlogs can be hosted by dedicated blog hosting services, or they can be run using blog software on regular web hosting services. In the early 21st Century, blogging has quickly emerged as a popular and important means of communication. 5
Y faith is so sounder than reason, although reason can go so far.?  Faith does not rely on reality. It is a willingness, even desire, to believe in that which cannot be proven to exist. You can literally create any reality you want to, and if you have enough faith in it, that reality will appear solid and indisputable, to you, regardless of how unrealistic it is, or how little sense it makes. A lot of religious people don't really grasp this concept. 9
why do people act so stupid?  People act stupid becuase they are only thinking of themselves when they do stuff that is idoitic to the rest of us.

I still have feelings for my ex, and we've kept in contact. Does this mean we could get back together? My ex and I were seeing eachoter for about 2 and a half months. I felt very strong feelings for him, and I know he cared for me very much. But because of a drunk night he kissed another woman. That is what initally caused the fight, but we continued to argue about other things as well.  But recently we've been talking alot. I run track and have been very nervous about qualifying for conference and nationals. He has been very supportive and relaxing because he has this great way of making jokes about things that freak me out. It just comforts me knowing that he still cares. I love being friends with him, but i loved what we had before even more. Right now i feel like me being friends with him is the only way i'll be close to him. Is this the wrong reason to be friends, because i know if we aren't then there will be no way we'll ever get back together. you have accepted the fact that you wouldnt make back with him and the only way for you to be in contact with him is if he's your friend.\n\nyet you have feelings for him, my dear why dont you speak to him and see where his emotion lies. you seem to have a good relationship going with him.he may very well have feelings for you, but if you are waiting on him and he's waiting on you, nothing would happen.make the first move. 9
can i have lots of facts about the element krypton?  Krypton is a chemical element with the symbol Kr and atomic number 36. A colorless noble gas, krypton occurs in trace amounts in the atmosphere, is isolated by fractionating liquefied air, and is often used with other rare gases in fluorescent lamps. Krypton is inert for most practical purposes but it is known to form compounds with fluorine. Krypton can also form clathrates with water when atoms of it are trapped in a lattice of the water molecules. 4

How can I crack the user password on a Win2000 account? We have here at our church a donated computer on which a user account has expired. The donor, the original administrator, does not remember his password unfortunately... There are quite some important files behind this user account.

I have used the Offline NT Password & Registry editor at work a few times after somebody forgot the admin password.\nIt works really well, just follow instruction on the link below, file download is near bottom of page.\nIt looks alot more complicated than it really is........trust me!\nAll you need is to unzip and write it to floppy disk using the bat file supplied in the zip file.\nAlthough it says NT it works on NT/2000/XP (looks into the computers SAM file which holds the passwords)\n\nHope this helps. 5

How to repair harddrives? I have a broken hard drive. When it boots, it seems that the hard drive has not enough power to rotate. It attempts to start rotation twice, then it becomes silent. Then, the green LED on the harddrive board goes off. Is there anyway to restore my data? Thanks! Yes your data will always be there even if the computer is dead . The best way to check this out is go to Best Buy and bring your harddrive into Geek Squad because there pro's at that stuff. It only cost 60$ ( i think lol ) and they first run a diagnosis to find out what's really wrong with it. But yah it will still be there what you can also do if the computer is dead you can go back to best buy and get the Geek Squad to put your old info, or any thing that you want from your broken comp, to your new comp. Easy as that. 5
base pair in relation to the cell cycle.? how do you explain the significance of complementary base pair in relation to the cell cycle? I think what you're looking for has to do with replication. Every time the cell goes through mitosis to divide, it has to make an exact copy of all the DNA in the cell, so that there are two complete copies, one for each daughter cell. The process of replication and division is the cell cycle.\n\nIn replication, a complex of enzymes copies the DNA by unzipping the double helix to expose the single strands. Someone else mentioned A-T C-G bair pairing and that is correct. The four subunits in DNA are the bases, and they are abbreviated A,T,C and G. Just by the shape of the molecules, A will connect with T and C with G pretty much always (though there are exceptions that are beyond the scope of a general explanation). \n\nSo in replication, enzymes pull the two strands of the double helix apart in short regions, pulling apart the A-T C-G bair pairing. It is energetically unfavorable to have a single strand of DNA exposed and not base paired. Free nucleotides in the cell will come in and form hydrogen bonds with the exposed template strand (it will happen on both strands), and then enzymes will connect the newly deposited bases with phosphodiester linkages to form a new DNA molecule. This forms a new strand of what is called duplex DNA, meaning it is a new double helix. The complementarity of the base pairs drives replication to produce an exact copy of each part of the genetic code. The error rate is very low, but errors can and do occur, and there is proofreading machinery to check for mistakes and excise and replace incorrect base pairs.\n\nPictures are helpful...in the second link, scroll down to see the replication bubble. A replication fork and a replication bubble are essentially the same thing...it's the site where the double helix is open and replication is occurring. 2

It is the "Yahoo Skinning Object", needed by the Messenger.\n\nIf you do have it, it might have been corrupted (i have no idea what could have caused such a thing), so i suggest renaming it to something like "ybskin2.dll.backup", and getting the file from\n\nhttp://www.afreedll.com/dll/info/ybskin2_dll-1.html\n\nor an older version from\n\nhttp://www.afreedll.com/dll/info/ybskin2_dll.html 5

What are some good drills for 6th grade volleyball team?  A good foundation for most of the drills I use is the circle drill. A coaches tosses the ball to a passer, the ball is passed to a catcher who hands the ball off to the coach. The passer becomes the catcher, the catcher moves to the line to become the passer. Most volleyball teams use a similar format. This keeps the players involved in the drill and you don't have to chase balls.\n\nWith the foundation of the circle drill, you can practice other skills. \n - receiving: 3 players ready to receive a serve. Whom ever picks up the serve becomes the catcher. The space is filled by the next in line.\n - communication: two players standing in the middle of the court. When signaled the sprint to the sideline and return to pick up a tossed ball without banging into each other. Calling out the ball is necessary. Use circle drill foundation.\n - ball control/hand-eye coordination: Using circle drill, have the players pass the ball back to themselves. Bump the ball in the air but they must clap 5 times (spin around, whatever) and catch the ball before it lands.\n\nThere are numerous drills. The key is to correct before bad habits are formed. Good Luck! 6
What ever happened to the Smurfs?  The success of the Smurfs is truly planetary. As everyone who has worked on the series recognises, the Smurfs are successful largely because of their basic appeal. And that appeal stretches right across the board - from mini-tales to pop songs and on to the exciting world of multimedia. Smurf material is now available on video, on CD-Rom and CD-i. The video games regularly top the sales charts. Theatre productions tour Europe. Yet each adaptation offers new challenges, which must be faced without the help of Peyo who died in 1992. But how will the world of the Smurfs adapt to that of the 21st century? If the past is anything to go by, the answer must be: smurfingly! 8

in what ways can society influence the course of scientific research?  Society always influences the course of scientific research. Society either tolerates science, or opposes it. A good example is the resistance to human cloning. From a purely scientific view, this is a subject of interest. However, in most countries this is not something that society will allow. Society always makes a value judgement regarding science, which in my opinion is a good thing. Science divorced from the greater value structure of a society is madness. Think of Dr. Josef Mengele and his experiments.\n\nThere are some who believe that science should be independent of society's control, but I disagree. This is not to say that society is always right; remember Galileo and his discoveries, which challenged the prevailing view of things at the time. This is always bound to happen. Currently in the United States, the argument over evolution is such a situation where science has revealed a very inconvenient truth about our world that our value structure is unwilling to accept. Still, this dialectic between science and society is a needed restraint on the practice of science, and keeps us from going too far. 1
I finish college last year and I majored in Labor Relations, but I have a interest in Library Sciences.? I do not know if I should get my MBA or MLIS degree.

How can scientists know age by carbon tests when not knowing of all the variables that could be through time? Remember... the earth is flat... because they said so... If you don't agree... OFF WITH YOUR HEAD!\nSeems like truth goes through same steps; first hated, then spoken out against, then tried to be destroyed, then accepted by all (eventually). But this carbon dating was gladly accepted :) hmmm then how old is the moon? well, you are right.  the validity of radiocarbon dating depends on the assumption that the half-life of carbon-14 isotopes does not change with time.\n\nbut, one of the principles of most use in scientific investigations is occam's razor, which says that when presented with a choice, usually the simplest answer is the most correct.  so, it is -assumed- that the half-life was not different a thousand years ago.  however, it is possible.  \n\nbut radiocarbon dates have been validated by other methods (such as counting rings on big trees, for instance) and there is no evidence for any change in the half-life of carbon in the time that the method has been in use.  also, a time-invariant half-life fits in with the current understanding of nuclear decays, so it seems pretty unlikely that it would change over time.\n\nas for the moon, it is not a candidate for carbon dating, which only works on samples that were alive at some point - bones, trees, antlers etc.  the basic idea is that the living organism exchanges carbon with the environment while it's alive, and stops doing so when it dies.  since the proportion of radioactive carbon in the environment is fixed, then when the organism dies, it's decaying carbon-14 content stops being replenished by eating, breathing etc.  so since the moon is mostly rock, and no biological processes exist (that we know of) on the moon, carbon dating doesn't work there.\n\nso anyway, in general i agree that everyone should be a skeptic.  nobody should blindly accept something just because they are told "it is so" but should try to understand the whys and hows and come to understand it themselves!  these days science is treated with almost as much reverence as religion once was.  \n\nlong ago, if the pope said something was so, it was so - and now, if a scientist says something is so, people accept it as so!  unfortunately this is just one of the fundamental problems of human nature - we often accept what we are told because it's told to us by an authority.   so it makes me happy when someone asks questions that challenge the assumptions! 2

I'm a sagittarius! tell me about a leo and why a leo would be a good match for me?  Sagittarius and Leo\n\nWhen Leo and Sagittarius join together in a love match, the result is often fireworks! Both Signs are extremely dynamic and enjoy life to the fullest. This couple is full of life and fun to be around, with each person encouraging the other to aim high! Sagittarius's philosophical tendency warrants a distraction to Leo's obsession with the larger-than-life. The two will have genuine admiration and respect for one another. Both are warm, charismatic and charming; people enjoy being in the energy this couple radiates. \n\nBoth Signs can be impatient but endearing, and Leo may be annoyed by Sagittarius's flirting, but there's never a dull moment in their relationship. Sagittarius sees the world as a textbook they must study from, while Leo acts as the gracious host. Both are extremely social, but it is vitally important to Leo that they feel that they are in control of the conversation. Leo is the Lion, the leader, while Sagittarius is the Archer, slowly taking the time to survey their target and feel the nuances of difference in their approach. Both Signs are usually respected by others, and it's important that each remembers to treat the other with the utmost respect as well. \n\nLeo is ruled by the Sun and Sagittarius is ruled by the Planet Jupiter. Both are masculine energy archetypes, and together they make a good combination -- they understand one another because they are so similar. The Sun is about Self and Jupiter is about expansion and excess, together providing a personal and outward focus on themselves and the world, although sometimes they can overexert themselves. They're highly compatible with lots of energy, and can be a wonderful couple in any setting or situation. 8
what is a ADSL filter and what does it do?  It is very simple. ADSL uses non voice frequencies to transmit data over the same telephone lines that carry your voice to a remote caller. The voice frequencies are much lower and are called narrow band, whereas the frequencies above voice frequencies are used to transmit data. In order to separate these frequencies and prevent interference of data over voice frequencies, you use an ADSL filter to separate the two components. 5
Sugar a Mineral? can someone please help me with science?\nis sugar a mineral? why or why not No, it's an organic compound (C12H22O11).

why do we fart?  QUOTE: "Well, for starters, the gas that makes up a fart comes from two sources: more originates from the breakdown of food by the digestive system, and some is from swallowed air. In the first case, foodstuffs are broken down by enzymes, stomach acids, and intestinal bacteria in order for the energy in them to be made available to the body. Through the processes of digestion and fermentation, gases can be liberated from what's eaten. In the second case, air that a person swallows from eating, drinking, breathing, chewing gum, and being stressed, among other ways of entry, that's not expelled during a burp travels through the stomach and intestine, transforming into fart-ready mode. In either case, the gases flow down through the rest of the digestive tract and eventually exit the body - Poof! Ping! Pfft! Toot-toot! Kaboom! - expelled as a fart, or farts. And this silent or noisy expulsion of air can help bring about some relief and comfort from a buildup of gas within the lower part of the body." 3
how to apply for MBA program if you want to do from US?  There is no uniform way to do so.  One must find websites for each program of interest and contact each school directly.  Prior to doing so, however, most schools require the GMAT (Graduate Management Admissions Test) and an undergraduate (bachelors degree or equivalent).  The more competitive programs require at least five years of post-baccalaureate work experience.\n\nAll of the reputable programs will require an application fee, application, essay (or series of short essays), and transcripts from previous coursework (undergraduate and graduate school). 4
Are there quicker ways to tighten your abs other than situps?  Similar to Astro's answer, you can lay down on your back and have someone else stand with their feet behind your shoulders.  (Your head will be between their feet.)  Hold on to their ankles or legs and, while keeping your legs completely straight, lift your legs to their chest.  At that point, your friend will push your legs back down to the ground - but don't let your feet touch!  And keep doing it -- raise your legs/have them pushed down/raise your legs...It really works! 3

What ia an Algorithm? From where this word originated? What criteria an algoritm must satisfy?  An explicit step-by-step procedure for producing a solution to a given problem. Specifically, a mathematical equation typically executed using a computer program (or set of programs) that is designed to systematically solve a certain kind of problem. For example, in the field of meteorology, WSR-88D radars (NEXRAD) employ algorithms to analyze radar data and automatically determine storm motion, probability of hail, accumulated rainfall, and several other parameters.\n\n\n*  Originates from "algorism" with its ancient meaning, i.e., the process of doing arithmetic using Arabic numerals 5
How do you get your friend with benefits to become your official girlfriend? She doesn't have any emotional or financial need, she is a very strong and independent woman and although nice, she has specified that she only wants to take care of your "physical" needs. How do I make her realize the benefits of a commited, serious relationship that could end in marriage? One of my friends did it, and she says she didn't make it happen, it just did.  If you show intrest towards a relation ship, above friends with benefits, and she responds, it could turn out to your advantage.  Your not going to make it happen, it's just going to or not, all you can do is show her it's something you want! 9
what is the goal o human life.even animals are eating,sleeping,mating and defending.why is human intelligence? Human beings have been gifted with intelligence.But if they use their intelligence to do the same thing that the animals are doing(ie eating,sleeping,mating and defending),then what is the diffence between them and the animals.All the activities of people in materialistic life boils down to this 4 principles of eating sleeping mating and defending, just little more refined.That seems to be like misuse of human intelligence, as if someone is using a computer just as a door stopper!!!!!!!!!!!\nThink about it and please let me know if somebody can give an intelligent answer to it. Nowadays you are right because we are the dominant species. But 10.000 years ago we weren't that strong and we needed each other much more to do the 4 principels. And to do that we developed speach, for which we needed our intelligence 1

what are the biotechnology in the field of medicine?  What then is biotechnology? The term brings to mind many different things. Some think of developing new types of animals. Others dream of almost unlimited sources of human therapeutic drugs. Still others envision the possibility of growing crops that are more nutritious and naturally pest-resistant to feed a rapidly growing world population. This question elicits almost as many first-thought responses as there are people to whom the question can be posed. \n\nIn its purest form, the term "biotechnology" refers to the use of living organisms or their products to modify human health and the human environment. Prehistoric biotechnologists did this as they used yeast cells to raise bread dough and to ferment alcoholic beverages, and bacterial cells to make cheeses and yogurts and as they bred their strong, productive animals to make even stronger and more productive offspring. 2

Is it difficult study in USA? I'm a undergraduate student in Turkey and I want to graduate in USA. Is it difficult? Education, life, economy etc. ? The most difficult thing about attending school in the USA is the peer pressure to do other things besides the actual schoolwork.  If you can overcome that, the schools are excellent and you should have no trouble getting a degree.  If you'd rather go out with your friends and drink, versus study for that exam, then your grades will likely reflect that choice. 4

Is there a known Cyst/Medical condition that shows these traits? I have a large growth on my face that has been diagnosed as a Sebacious Cyst, but I want to make sure that's what it is.  It started on my face, to the side of my ear, then moved down to my jaw, where a piece of it split off and moved away toward my cheek, while origianl shrivled up and disappeared.  The second one then grew to be as large as the first.  After several months, the process repeated, but I had surgury to take both pieces out.  The doctor neglected to take out the second piece though, and it returned, moving down to my neck and growing larger then the others had been.  Then it Shroivled up and a piece broke off and grew just as large.\nThe mass has always been red ans a little bit warmer then the other parts of my face to the touch.  Has anyone ever heard of this?  I'm currently receiving injections of Cortisone, but they seem to have limited effect. I don't know if you have this disease or not, but most doctors do not see it enough or have never seen it to be able to recognize is. It is called Hidradenitis Suppurativa. It is a disease of the Apocrine glands (sweat glands) and can come up where ever there are apocrine glands. People get them in the groin, armpits, belly, legs, back, neck and face. The most common areas are the groin and armpit. The disease is considered "rare", but that is only because most people are misdiagnosed for years. 3

Is this a new beginning or an effort in vain as I would be the same person as I used to be! 'No matter where you go. There you are."\n\nIf you are REALLY looking for a new start and brand new life.

How to prove a number whose sum of its digits is divisible by 3 then it's divisible by 3 is true? For example: I know 93681 is divisible by 3 without doing the division computation. The sum of the digits in 93681 is 9+3+6+8+1=27. If 27 is divisible by 3, then 93681 is divisible by 3. In discrete math, there was a way to prove it. How to prove that for any number, if the sum of the digits in the number is divisible by 3, then the number is divisible 3? To show that if a natural number is divisible by three, then the sum of its digits is divisible by three, use inductive reasoning:\n\n(A)  Base case: 3 is divisible by 3, as any natural number is divisible by itself.  The sum of its digits is 3, which is, of course, divisible by 3.\n\n(B)  Assumption: Let k=d(n)d(n-1)...d(1) be a multiple of 3, where the d(i) is the ith digit from the right in k.  Assume that d(n)+d(n-1)+...+d(1) is divisible by 3.\n\n(C)  Induction: Now, consider k+3.  One of the following occurs:\n\n     (1)  3 is added to d(1) and no carries are involved.  The sum of the digits becomes d(n)+d(n-1)+...+d(1)+3, which is divisible by 3.\n\n     (2)  3 is added to d(1) and a carry to the tens place is involved.  After the carry, 10 is subtracted from d(1) and 1 is added to d(2).  Now, The sum of the digits becomes:\n\n  d(n)+d(n-1)+...+d(1)+3-10+1\n= d(n)+d(n-1)+...+d(1)-6,\n\nwhich is divisible by 3.\n\n     (3)  3 is added to d(1) and multiple carries are involved.  This occurs when a string of m-1 9s ending in the tens place exists.  After the carries, 10 is subtracted from d(1) and 1 is added to d(2) (making d(2) 10), 10 is subtracted from d(2) (making d(2) zero) and 1 is added to d(3), and so on, involving m carries.  Then, Now, The sum of the digits becomes\n\n  d(n)+d(n-1)+...+d(1)+3-10m+m\n= d(n)+d(n-1)+...+d(1)+9m-6,\n\n which is divisible by 3.\n\nHence, by induction, if a natural number is divisible by three, then the sum of its digits is divisible by three.  \n\nNow, you wanted the converse.  Similar proofs can show that for base cases 1 and 2, the sum of digits for k=3*p+1 and k=3*p+2 (where p is a natural number) will not be divisible by three, giving the proof that a natural number is divisible by three if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by three.

what is cdma?  Code division multiple access (CDMA) is (not a modulation scheme, but a form of multiplexing) a method of multiple access that does not divide up the channel by time (as in TDMA), or frequency (as in FDMA), but instead encodes data with a certain code associated with a channel and uses the constructive interference properties of the signal medium to perform the multiplexing. CDMA also refers to digital cellular telephony systems that makes use of this multiple access scheme, such as those pioneered by Qualcomm, or W-CDMA. 5

Should Christ's teachings in the Holy Bible be the sole reference of true Christian Religion? I believe so, but I wanted to know if everybody agrees or if there someone who could change my mind... thanks for answering Christ's teachings came directly from him (Gospels)aswell as other people like Paul (Whom Jesus spoke to after he went to take his place at the right hand side of God. \n\nSo I would have to say no. But you also have to treat things not written in the Bible with a lot of sceptisism. 1
how to get a good score in volley ball? please answer Draw a line on gym wall the same height as volleyball net topline.  Practice 20 minutes every day with team mate(s), two at a time (you and one team mate) hitting the ball above the line, the other person has to return the bounce off (you are trying to get it in his area).  Every five minutes increase the distance from the wall, but not further than for normal volleyball.  That is exercise #1.\n\nNumber 2 Exercise:  Your friend stands on opposite side of net and loft balls for you to slam dunk.  Practice from all standard first line positions and different types of incoming.  Try four different types for five minutes each.  Good to have some non-participatory helpers to get the ball(s) back to your helper.\n\nNumber 3 Exercise:  Play lots of actual volleyball games, even if you only have two people for each side.\n\nNumber 4 Exercise:  Practice hard serves for a difficult return but limit this to 10 minutes per day so you don't hurt your arms.\n\nReal games enable team work with others and this team work is a big factor in winning.  You need to discuss this with other team mates and any pro observer(s).  When good teamwork becomes automatic, your chances of winning are greatly increased.\n\nPractice, practice, practice.\n\nMake sure your ball has the official pressure! 6

What snow ski should I buy? Looking to buy skis.  Not sure where to start. Speaking from someone that currently owns 5 pair of skis...  Ski selection is a personal choice.  It really depends on two things.  \n\nFirst, is your skiing ability.  An example of this would be for a beginner skier, a softer, or more flexible ski might aid you in learning to ski better.  Traditionally a stiffer ski for more expert or advanced skiing.  Of course, just like everything their are caveats to this rule of thumb for specialized skis.\n\nSecondly, you need to think about where, or better what type of skier you are.  If you love powder skiing and live in the west you might want a wide ski with a decent flex.  If you are a groomer rider, a ski that has a decent sidecut.  Sidecut of the ski is the difference between the front / back parabolic measurement versus the measurement under the foot.\n\nYour best answer, because the answer can't be written down in chart form, is go to a ski shop where ever you plan to ski most and answer these questions to a ski technician.  They will charge you a little more for the ski, but will know how to fit you.  You can always rent for the day before putting your dollars on the counter.  Good Luck! 6
Why do we see only one side of the moon?  The moon spins about an axis. The axis  is almost perpendicular to the plane of the moons orbit around the earth. The period of spin (time to complete one rotation about the spin axis) is equal to the period of one revolution around the earth.\n  The result is we see one side of the moon.\nFor many people this answer is not suffice to understand.\nImagine a cubical building in a plain ground. The four vertical walls are marked A,B,C,D.  Imagine the building to be the moon and we are standing infront of the wall marked A. Let us go round the building to see the other walls in the order of ABCD. When we have finished quarter round we can have the full view of the wall B. But imagine  that the building rotates itself such that when we finished quarter round it also has rotated quarter round about itself. We will see only the wall A. If the things continue like this we can never see the other walls.When we complete one round the building completes one round so always we see only the wall A.\n Due to librations actually we can see 59% of the moon instead of 50% 2
What is the meaning behind the Holiday Kwanzaa?  Kwanzaa is an African-American holiday about the festival of the first harvest of the crops. It begins on December 26, and lasts for seven days.

How is this day and age can one successful meet a person and successful date them? I AM ON SEVERAL DATING NETWORKS MOST PEOPLE UNFORTUNATLEY LIE, DON'T LOOK IN THE MORROR OR ARE TOO JUDGEMENTAL, HOW DOES ONE FIND ANOTHER I guess the best thing to do to meet somebody is to stop looking. Honestly! It seems that when you are least expecting it, that is when good things happen. I agree... on the internet is not the beat place to meet somebody. It seems that all of a sudden everybody on here becomes somebody else. Actually, I don't have much good advice for you... I bet my other 1/2 at a bar. And we are doing great and have been together ever since. So there is no wrong or right place to meet somebody. Whether you meet somebody or not is up to you, if you see somebody that catches your eye then say hello and try to start a conversation. Just pray and wait it out and when you least expect it you will meet somebody. I can tell you like my grandma used to  say,"go to church to meet somebody!" 1
Is there any way to advertise and sell stock to accredited investors without public registration? I had a quick question which I am hoping has a simple answer yet I doubt it does. I have owned many companies ranging from manufacturing to software. I have always found the financing part confusing with regards to one issue: Is it possible to do a private placement to raise funds from accredited investors without utilizing a broker dealer? For example,...can a company take a 2 step approach such as the following: 1) create a general ad campaign dispersed to the general public and then "filter out" accredited investors 2) once the accredited investors have been qualified they are then presented the opportunity by employees of the actual company raising the money. I ask this question because of my last company. I started the company with $1200, and in a few years grew it into cash flow of $10MM, and yet still was unable to attract VC financing. I did not want to go the public route yet still wanted the ability to raise funds for additional growth. Any help/direction would be appreciated rule 501 regulation d of 1933 sec act provides for limited sales to accrdited investors.  General solicitation may be your problem here.  There are limitations to the solicitation you are using. you would still be subject to state blue sky laws. see http://www.law.uc.edu/CCL/33ActRls/rule501.html for a start.  However it is actually pretty easy. 7
The 5 members of the SC decides to vote against the Nuclear ambitions of Iran. Are you think it  is justice?  An open Resolution would have to come from the General Assembly, the Security Council has veto power over those resolutions.\n\nIt is not just the members of the Security Council that think that Iran should not be allowed to expand their Nuclear Program Unchecked there are many other countries on board with it as well.  If Iran just wanted to proceed with it's program of developing Nuclear Power for the peaceful electricity then it is felt by most Nations of the World that if that was the case Iran would allow inspectors in to calm the rest of the world about their intentions.  Opposition to such inspectors by Iran can only lead to the the feeling that they are in fact hiding something.  There is nothing that I will be able to say to make you understand why the U.S. needs to keep ours, however we keep our as a deterant to keep other Nations with Nuclear Power in check and not using theirs.  While you see this issue as completely Black and White it is in fact a very Gray issue. 10

What is average speed ? You can determine the speed of the car by measuring the time it takes to travel between mile markers on a highway. \nHow many seconds should elapse between two consecutive mile markers if the car's average speed is 65 mi/hr? \nWhat is the car's average speed if it takes 65 s to travel between the mile markers? Without really going into formulae and calculations one can say that the answer for the first question is - a little less than one minute. For the second question - a little less than 60miles an hour. 2
how do you stop a community treatment order?  It depends on the following.\n\nThere are two basic CTO models: diversionary and preventive. In the diversionary model, the criteria for a CTO are identical to the criteria for inpatient committal. The diversionary CTO can be viewed as an alternative to involuntary admission requiring that the person follow a treatment plan but enabling him or her to remain in the community. The diversionary model thus permits treatment in the least restrictive setting: an important principle guiding the structure of mental health legislation (4,5). An example of the diversionary model is the New Zealand Mental Health Act, which directs that the court must ”make a community treatment order unless the Court considers that the patient cannot be treated adequately as an outpatient, in which case the Court shall make an inpatient order” (6). In contrast to the diversionary model, a patient can be placed on a preventive CTO even though he or she has not deteriorated to the point of meeting the jurisdiction’s criteria for involuntary admission. However, many jurisdictions require that, before a person can be placed on a preventive CTO, he or she must have an established pattern of repeated admissions. Thus, the legal eligibility criteria for a preventive CTO often include a requirement that the person has met a threshold for the amount of prior involuntary hospitalization. 3

Who gives Israel the right to exist? Israel didn't exist before 1948, still, I find most of the people refuse to refer to Israel is a colonising country. Well, ironicly, Israel is recognised by the U.N. but Israel doesn't really care about what the U.N. says (ignoring Security Council resolutions). Some are saying that Israel is given the right to exist by God; God-given right? Has that happened before? Doesn't that sound hilarious, at least to people who have brains?\n\nI am talking here about the moral/ethical aspect of the issue. Do you think it is morally right to let Israel exist in the land of Palestine? If America is so supportive of giving land to people who were killed in masses by an oppressive government than why haven't they given blacks their 40 acres and a mule yet? They coukld use all the money our government gives in Isael's miltary under the table to purchase the land. Israel recieved more money from the US than any other country and the US military baking them is why they have the right to exist. That and the fact they can have an Atomic weapon but no country around them that they threaten to use it on can. 10

why people belief in the term 'marriage'?  Beacuse it is a Sacrament between a man and  a woman that was instituted by God...as are all sacraments. Its purpose is to demonstrate, in the flesh, God's love for us and the creation of children that usually result from that love within the Sacrament. It is permanent and cannot be undone. (An annulment is the term used to decide that a Sacramental Marriage was never valid…it’s not a divorce.)\n\nOr you may be asking about a civil or legal marriage. That's just a legal institution invented by govenments for various legal purposes throughout history. It changes with the winds of politics and the fickleness of governments. It's a completely different thing from the Sacrament of Marriage, although many people assume that they are the same thing. 4

I just installed a new Kidpix, and it won't let my kids play it because it says that another program is occupying the audio device, however I don't have any programs running.  I am currently running Windows 98.  Any Help? What version of Kid Pix are you running?\n\nKid Pix® Deluxe 4 for Schools says it requires to run on Win 98se, Me, 2000, XP. The processor needs to be at least 300MHz with 128MB of available RAM. 600MB free disk space and CD Rom drive to install.\n\nMy personal past expience with Windows 98 is that sometimes the sound card and drivers maybe arcane.\n\nSo two possible fixes: Update sound card drivers if possible. Update the sound card if you think its feesible and worth it.\n\nIf the two are not an option, then it just may not be compatiable with your system. 5
How do I set up a wifi network?  I could answer this in several ways, based on your level of technical expertise.\n\nSimply put, you need a wireless router or access point.  This will provide the "link" between your network and any wireless cards that are in your PCs.  The PCs to be attached to the network are called clients.\n\nYou can have either a Wireless B, Wireless G, or Wireless A network.  G is backward compatible with B (meaning you can, if the router is set to "mixed mode") run a Wireless B laptop in a Wireless G network ... it will just run slower.\n\nThere is also MIMO or 802.11n wireless, but this standard has NOT been ratified yet.  You can run 802.11b or g clients with it as well MIMO clients.\n\nAdditionally, it's 100% necessary to use some sort of encryption in your network.  Otherwise people will be able to monitor your network traffic and pick up passwords, account numbers, etc.  Obviously this is not likely to happen, but you can use either WEP or WPA and it's fairly painless.  Note the word fairly.\n\nI'm going to give you a bunch of links in the Sources section that will help you in more detail. 5

how is lithium helpful to us in life? how is how is lithium helpful to us in life? here is one reason:\n\nLithium salts such as lithium carbonate (Li2CO3), lithium citrate, and lithium orotate are mood stabilizers used in the treatment of bipolar disorder, since unlike most other mood altering drugs, they counteract both mania and depression. Lithium can also be used to augment other antidepressant drugs. Useful amounts of Lithium for this use are only slightly lower than toxic amounts, so the blood levels of Lithium have to be carefully monitored during such a treatment. 2

How do I protect myself from falling so easily for guys that I know are crap? Essentially I will meet someone cute and decent, then realize some major flaws, but I will KNOWINGLY lie to myself and cover for their flaws, excusing them rather. How do I stop myself from doing this? (I know a real decent guy will never come along though, and yes in case you're wondering, I am a guy too...) I know one option would be a psychologist but maybe we have one in the room? Does anyone have any real, true advice on how maybe I can stop doing this to myself? I have relatively good self confidence and I am fairly cute but good guys never work out. I am kind of like Susan from Desperate Housewives, except I'm some crazy fun loving but mature 18 year old? Ok, answer away, thanks! If you KNOW that you don't need to be with these guys, then when you meet them you need to not let it go any farther.  I know it is hard when you are attracted to them, but in the long run it is better to not put yourself through the same thing over and over again.  I know it is hard being single for a long time, I'm in the same boat, but in the end it is better than getting your heart broken over and over again by guys that you know are going to do it.  Just hang out with your single friends, enjoy being 18 and having fun, and the right person will come along eventually (going out with nothing but couples will end up making you feel worse and like a huge third wheel, trust me on that one).  Good luck, let me know how things go, and email me if you have any more problems, greeneyeddevl@yahoo.com. 3

What is the physics behind  walking of insects on water surface?Explain please.?  Surface tension, or the attraction of water molecules sideways and inwards at the surface of the water, cause water to act like an elastic trampoline. This lets the animal float without breaking the surface.\n\nTo propel itself forward, the insect's feet must push water backward (for every action of the bug there is an equal and opposite reaction on the water). The rowing action of the legs produces miniature vortices (whirlpools) which move backward from the bug's feet. 2

School bullies are terrorists! Why doesn't the education system do something about them???? You remember or still bear the presence of these delinquents in ALL kinds of schools. But it seems like nobody else see them. The answers to your question is very uncomfortable, because it casts this culture (and others that tolerate it) in a very bad light.\n\n1. For one, I hate to say it but in some ways bullying is seen as socially acceptable. If you listen to some adults (especially those whose children are accused of being bullies), they will say things like "Bullying is good, because it teaches the weak how to defend themselves." Or they'll say that bullying teaches good *social skills*, because it prepares children for the Real World, which is harsh and cruel. In other words, what I'm saying is that the educational system in some way condones this type of behavior, since many people in some ways hold these beliefs (even teachers and faculty).\n\n2. Adults continue to insist that bullying is a cute, harmless activity amongst children. You know the old saw-- "kids will be kids." So when they see bullying, they don't see harrassment, torture, stalking, cruelty and torment. They see boys displaying their *crushes* on girls; they see *roughhousing.* They see friendly teasing. It's like adults still live in this time warp where all boys are doing are dipping girls' pigtails into inkwells, and all girls are doing are sticking their tongues out at each other. Since adults form the educational system, they literally turn a blind eye to it all and pretend that it's simply harmless teasing.\n\n3. Many bullies are such master manipulators, that they are able to convince teachers and administrators that they are the nicest kids on the planet.\n\n4. Adults feel that bullying is a *natural phase* of childhood. So why do anything about it?\n\n5. Lastly, when bullying happens, the school faculty takes this stance that it's none of its business if children are harassed. It's job is to merely just *teach.* Anything else that happens under their nose is the child's problem. As a result, nothing is done about it.\n\nSad to say, but it's true. 4

would we have a efficient working structure in our schools if there was no peer pressure? I am doing a study on the effects on teens with peer pressure, both good and bad, I am trying to find some answers, and maybe even some questions. Removing peer pressure would not provide for an effective working structure.  Here is my thoughts on why...\n\nThe two types of peer pressure are negative and postiive.  Negative seems to be the primairy one that is discussed and that is peer pressure that tears people and situations down.  Removing this, although impossible, would be a benefit.  Even limiting it would be a bonus for students.\n\nThere is also positive peer pressure and this is one of the things that gives students drive to accomplish things.  This is also one of the primairy things that helps adults to innovate.  Positive peer pressure is part of competition. Peer pressure to do better and excel.  Often, we limit ourselves in what we do while what we can do it greater.  positive peer pressure helps overcome the limitations we put on ourselves.\n\nThis is also a big thing for boys.  Since, boys are by nature more agressive than women (multiple studies have shown this to be true at a basic biological level), positive peer pressure helps to feed that and mold it for good purposes.\n\nmy 2 cents. 1
How much do people from the Middle East realy Know about Americans? Hello.  I have read several comments about how People from the Middle East hate Americans and it saddens me.  Just as in ALL countries, there are good and there are bad people. Dont believe everything you hear from the Media.  The majority of us are very loving and accepting people.  We do not believe we are the only intelegent people on the planet.  Yes, we are raised to be proud of our selves and our country...but arnt you raised to believe the same about your home? Most of us want the same things you want...PEACE and HAPPINESS.  If more people would stop the hating and start the learning and communicating, then maybe this world could be a peacful one. We need to work together and learn from each other to end the violence. People in the middle east are loving to all nations and love all human kinds. The only problem they have is the governments, people hate governments not the people. And the hate of government is because of bad policies western governments have had towards the mid east 1
Is the plural of timeout "timeouts" or "times out"? (As in a football timeout)? We're dying to know.  Please provide a source if you can. It's timeouts.  The word is one word, not two - as in, timeout, not time out.  So hence, following English rules, the plural form would have the s at the end of the single word.  Plus, if you check out the closed captioning in football games, you'd hear (and read!) the announcers say timeouts several times in the closing minutes of each half. 6
how much wood could a wood chuck chuck if a wood chuck could chuck wood?  A wood chuck could chuck two to eleven pounds of wood, if a woodchuck could chuck its own weight.\n\nAccording to a Wall Street Journal article, Richard Thomas, a wildlife expert from New York, estimated that a woodchuck moves about 700 pounds of dirt in building its burrow...so, he estimated that over that same time and effort, a woodchuck could chuck 700 pounds of wood if a woodchuck could chuck wood. 7
Got a lot of debts, Im drowning in it.? help pls. I cant live my normal life anymore. People shouts outside my gate. They started humiliating me in public. What should I do. Please give me advices First thing you need to do is to find a debt management company for help.  Please stay away from debt consolidation loans or anything similar.  Find a debt management company only.  What they will do is, they will contact every creditors and make a deal, such as lowering your APR.  Then they make promise to pay certain amount every month.  They will take certain amount from your bank account every month and distribute to your creditors.  \n\nIf you go this route, you don't have to worry about getting threathend by the creditors.  Also, this helps with your credit score.\n\nFor a typical company they charge you anywhere between $20-$50 per month for this service, but it's well worth it because they also provide good financial advice for free.\n\nOne of the company I recommend is called Amerix Corporation.  They helped me get out of debt when I was in debt.  Good luck. 7
are pimpled girls turning the boys off???please give some tips on preventing it...?  My wife had some acne issues when I met her 7 years ago.  She still has some to this day.  I see the other amazing things about her, and I don't feel that her acne marrs her beauty (how could something so small completely negate the entirety of her image?).  Find a man who could marry you for all the other wonderful things about you without being distracted by your acne.\n\nTo address the acne issue: wash your face with a nice face wash in the morning and at night.  You can try acne treatments, which will be available at your local drug store.  If none of that works, you can see a dermatologist who can prescribe other things for you.  My younger brother had a prescription that seemed to work miracles for him. 3

It is okay to talk about your new boyfriend to your best friend friend who use to like him? My best friend use to talk to this guy that she liked but was not giving all her attention and time too, she didnt really want a boyfriend and he didnt want a girlfriend, but they were pretty close. He would always do special things for her like make dinner ect.. she would never show up or call, so he stopped calling her answering the phone when she called because she always would blow him off.  About almost a month later him and i were hanging and got the talking about how he really wants to be with me and how much he cares about me, because when they were together i would also be there, at first i said no i cannot do that to my best friend but as time went on I really felt like i could trust him.  I was really scared to tell my best friend and after i did tell her she was upset for awhile but she is over it now, but i have noone really to talk to about him, so i want to know if its appropriate to talk to her about hm, the good and the bad. Ask her how she feels about talking about him.  Tell her that she is your best friend and care about her feelings.  Ask for her support and that you need her advise on the relationship. 9

NEWSPAPERS, BOOK PUBLISHERS-CREATE A RECURRING CHARACTER TO ILLISTRATE STORIES OR ANIMATED SITCOM MATERIAL, COPYRIGHT IT WHICH IS EASY ENOUGH TO DO, THEN SHOP AROUND FOR WRITERS, PUBLISHERS, OR EDITORS.  THAT MIGHT GET THE BALL ROLLING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BASED ON HOW WELL YOU DO WITH COLD CALLS AND ARE WILLING TO CHECK OUT INDUSTRY EVENTS. 8
What is the most political correct term: Hispanic, Latino or Mexican?  This is actually a pretty touchy topic.\nMexican is what everyone else has mentioned...for Mexican nationals.  This does not include Mexican-American folks because they are actually American as in U.S.A.\nHispanic was the term used by the "white" man as in inclusive word for all central and south Americans...including Brazil.  Hispanic for "hispano" which was a word in the spanish language.  Hispano meaning from Spanish as in Spain descent.\nLatino was the word to sort of rebel from the Hispanic word because it was more pertaining to the central and south Americans.  Latino because those parts of the world many considered to be Latin America and their spanish is considerably different from the castilian spanish from Spain.\nIn order to answer your question, to whom are you referring?  If you know where the people or person is from, use their nationality term (peruvian, venezuelan, etc).  If you don't, use Hispanic or latino, they are used interchangably and most folks are used to both terms.  But I think most would prefer Latino. 1

whats the best way to get people to come to passion parties? i am a consultant of passion parties and new and looking to get people to come to my parties. Should i advertize in the newspaper or just get it out by word of mouth. Sure could use some information on this. I love the products and information that people can really benefit from having a party. Some people get older and need a little more in their lives to help them in their marriage and i am willing to go out and help to let people know there is help for them. Its fun and ladies can get out of the house and enjoy asking questions without anyone saying anything to anybody about what they ask. That is a wonderful thing about this kind of thing So please feel free to let me know the best ideas you have on getting it out to the public thanks. My 86 year old grandmother went to one of those thinking it was going to be a sex party. She showed up in red lacy lingerie and when she noticed everybody else was fully clothed she just acted like she was demented and had wandered away from home. Anyway..the point is just be sure when you advertise to make sure people know there isn't going to be any funny stuff going on. 3

How economics help to abolished the slave trade ?  This is a tricky question. Economics is a broad topic, and this is a narrow application. One interesting observation that I've heard is that slavery is non-existent in post-agrarian societies! Once a culture starts to move toward an industrial age, slavery simply melts away. The assertion is that capitalism is incompatible with slavery.\n\nKen Wilber has related this to developmental stages in human cultures. It is dangerous to assume a cause and effect relationship here. It might just be that once a culture has matured enough to have a robust decentralized economic system like modern capitalism, the culture likewise matures sufficiently to find reprehensible the levels of coercion that slavery requires. 4

is 'String s="" equivalent to String s=new String("")' in Java;if Yes,consider the following code String s1="java";\nString s2="java";\nif(s1==s2)\n   System.out.println("equal");\nString s3=new String("java");\nif(s1==s3)\n   System.out.println("equal");\nelse\n   System.out.println("Unequal");\n \nOutput :\nequal\nUnequal \n\nwhy i m getting "equal,Unequal" as output instead of "equal,equal" ? can anyone explain this ? It's all about the references.\n\ns1 = "java"- the constant string between "" is stored in one address in memory and s1 and s2 will referance that memory - so when comparing s1==s2 you're not comparing the strings but the pointers in memory.\ns3 = new String("java") obviously creates new object in memory and s3 points to a different address that's why it says not equal with s1\n\nyou need to use s1.CompareTo(s3) for comparing the string instead of address 5

You are not a horrible person but just make sure you discuss every option (and there are alot out there) with your doctor and the baby's father but don't let anyone force your decision. Good luck. 3

what do you think about time travel? is it possible to travel in time?  Actually, yes. traveling forward in time is definately possible, but we're not sure about back. \n\nVelocity distorts time. The faster you go, the slower time goes for you. This effect is negligable unless you are going very close to the speed of light. In fact the formula is:\nt'= t/sqrt(1-v^2/c^2)\nwhere t' is the time that has passed for a stationary observer, t is the time that has passed for you, sqrt means square root and ^2 means squared. As you can notice, when v is small, since c^2 is so huge, you get a miniscule decimal, and 1 minus that number is basically as small as .999999999999999 or something very very close to one, and so t' stays basically the same as t and time is not really affected. As v gets larger(it can never be the speed of light, then the denomonator would be zero) that fraction becomes closer to 1, so when you subtract it from one, the denomonator gets smaller and smaller, meaning t gets smaller(in order for t' to remain constant) this means that time slows down for the object moving at such velocities! time slows down, so it would feel like lets sayThis formula is correct, it is part of Einstein's theory of relativity, and I have had to derive it myself from ordinary mechanics formulas. \n\nThis proves the formula:\nAccording to the same factor, length also contracts. It has been observed in certain tiny particles coming to the earth's surface. These particles have a certain lifespan before they become unstable and decay. They are also moving at a certain speed. (which is very fast; close to the speed of light.) You should simply be able to calculate v=d/t (velocity=distance/time) to find out how far they would travel. However, they somehow travel farther than that. When this calculated distance is put into that formula, we come up with the correct distance they actually travel! \n\nSo yes, as you get faster and faster, since time slows down for you, theoretically, you could be moving at these speeds for a short time and time will seem to be moving normally for you, but have years and years pass for everyone else, thus traveling forward in time. 2

wot do u do when you love someone deeeeeeply and the person is misbehaving just cus he knows ur not leaving .?  Your love obviously isn't being returned.  This person is using you and you don't deserve that.  By letting them get away with misbehaving you are just telling them that what they are doing is ok.  You need to put an end to what ever this behaviour is even if it means ending the relationship.  If you give your love to someone then you deserve to have it returned properly and if they can't do that then you need to find someone who will. 9

Any economists out there?  Student who needs help!!? I'm in college, & need help with my macroeconomics class. I took a quiz, and got 5 questions wrong. My teacher is disputing that they're wrong, but I say they're right!! Thank you in advance for your help. The questions are: The ability-to-pay tax principle can't be applied to: (she said the correct answer was welfare). The ability to pay tax principle states that: Those with a greater ability to pay (such as those with a higher income, or those who own more property)should pay more taxes.  I don't see how welfare (or her other choices of post office, & highway) fit into this principle.  Yes, we as users of the highway & post offices pay taxes,(these services are supplied by the government) but people that use welfare also pay taxes. The only way I can see this to be a part of it, is that highways can make money by tolls & post offices by postage, & welfare is giving money away to citizens.  Thank you, and I have 4 more, but no space to post, so I'm going to do individual questions. Welfare is essentially a negative tax, which goes right in hand with the ability-to-pay tax principle. They so lack an ability to pay that they are instead paid by the Social Security Insurance tax that everyone who can pay does. 10

How do you explain 99.5% accuracy when comparing 5,000 New Testament manuscripts?  88.3% of statistics are made up on the spot, including yours.\n\nThe NT is nowhere near accurate.

If you claim that Jesus was only one of these three choices:::\n\n1) A lunatic (for claiming to be God in the flesh)\n2) A liar (for claiming to be God in the flesh)\n3) Exactly who He said He was (God in the flesh)\n\nthen you give me no choice but to say he was a liar.\n\nHowever, there are a lot more possibilities than the few three you give.\n\nJesus could have been one of the many people thought to have been the messiah, but that were proven wrong by time. Even the book of Acts in the Christian's New Testament lists two such false messiahs, Judah the Galilean and Theudas. \n\n          Act 5:36-37  For before these days rose \n          up Theudas, boasting himself to be \n          somebody; to whom a number of men, about \n          four hundred, joined themselves: who was \n          slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, \n          were scattered, and brought to nought. \n          37  After this man rose up Judas of \n          Galilee in the days of the taxing, and \n          drew away much people after him: he also \n          perished; and all, even as many as obeyed \n          him, were dispersed. \n\nWhat if the followers of Theudas or Judah the Galilean said the same thing, that either they were who they said they were, or they were lunatics or liars, or the messiah, with no other choice?\n\nAnd the reason they say that Jesus was only a good man and not Gd, is because we have Gd's promise in Hosea 11:9, where He said, "..for I am Gd and not a man." We have the same thing in Numbers 23:19 \n\n          Numbers 23:19 "Gd is not a man, that he \n          should lie; neither the son of man, that \n          he should repent: hath he said, and shall \n          he not do it? or hath he spoken, and \n          shall he not make it good?" \n\nwhich means IF Gd were a man, He would be a liar, since all men lie. IF Gd were a man he would need to repent, since all men sin.\n\nGd becoming a human, or a human becoming Gd, is the hallmark of the pagan faiths, where the stories of children of a god and a human mother, or the incarnation of a god, were told. Pharaoh thought he was a god, and the emporers of ancient empires were thought to have been gods, or the children of gods. 1

how do I burn more than 1 movies on a blank dvd using windows xp proffesional?  If you use WinAVI, you'll be able to convert any movie to DVD, and to choose the number of DVD's to fit on. Just go to www.winavi.com and you'll see that the program will allow you to convert any type of file. Of course, you'll need to have some codecs installed on your computer. But it works very fast, and it will also put the subtitles, if any (using VobSub). I tested many programs but this is the best one yet, and it's easy to use. Good luck 5
Why are almost everyone in or asscociatedd with the UN such pansies? Is it because they have friend members or is it because they are mostly European, or is it something else? No people are in the UN, only countries.

is carbon monoxide heavier than air? when considering placement of a co detector, we follow the manufacturers recommendations, however there has been some discussion about he density of co To be precise, the answer is no. Do u noe why? The mean mol wt of air is 29 whereas that of CO is 28.\n\nlet me show u how i get these answers:\nC=12,O=16,mol wt of O2=32g/gmol,mol wt of N2=28g/gmol\nmol wt of CO = 12+16\n             =28\nas for air, by common sense, we know that air is made up of O2,N2, and other gases,rite? As the mol composition of other gases are very negligible(<1%), we assume air is only made up of O2 and N2. Air consists of 21mol% O2 and 79mol% N2.\n\nlet's take a basis of 100gmol(or 100mol)\nmoles of O2=21gmol\nmoles of N2=79gmol\nmass of O2=21X 32g/gmol\n          =672g\nmass of N2=79X28g/gmol\n          =2212g\ntotal mass= 2212+672\n          = 2884g\naverage mol wt of air=total mass/total moles\n                     =2884g/100gmol\n                     =28.84g/gmol\n                     =29g/gmol(whole no.)\n\nsince the ave mol wt of air is greater than that of CO, so aCO is not heavier than air,instead,slightly lighter than air.\n\nDoes it answer ur question? 2

what is best remide for throat infection?  What causes a sore throat? \nA sore throat can have many causes. Some of these are listed below:\n\nMany common viruses, and even the viruses that cause mononucleosis (mono) and the flu, can cause a sore throat. Some of the viruses that cause a sore throat can produce blisters in the mouth and throat ("aphthous stomatitis"). \nBreathing through the mouth can produce throat dryness and soreness. \nSinus drainage may cause a sore throat. \nA sore throat can also be caused by bacteria. The two most common bacteria to cause as sore throat are Streptococcus (which causes strep throat) and Arcanobacterium haemolyticum. Arcanobacterium causes sore throats mainly in young adults and is sometimes associated with a fine red rash. \nA sore throat that lasts for more than 2 weeks can be a sign of a serious illness, such as throat cancer or AIDS. \n\n\nThe treatment of pharyngitis will vary according to the cause.\n\nLozenges (cough medicine) are often used for short-term pain relief. \nAntibiotics are only helpful when a bacterial infection is the cause of the sore throat. For bacterial sore throats, antibiotics have been shown to only affect the degree of pain by day 4 and shorten the average natural duration by 16 hours overall (14 people need be treated for a week to reduce the duration by one day)[6]. \nGargling with warm salty water is a popular household remedy, although there is only anecdotal evidence this gives other than temporary relief and likewise for the use of aspirin gargles. \nWarm tea can help temporarily alleviate the pain of a sore throat. 3

does he love me???? my friend asked me if i was ever going to get married i told her not until im 50 my boyfriend was there and he said i cant wait that long.. is this a show of love or just being smart mouth I think that the answer to this question would be depending on how long you and him have been dating.  If you have been dating for years and he's getting pretty serious than he is just saying that he loves you, but he does not want to be without commitment until you are that old.  But, if you have only been dating for a little while than he was probably just being a smart mouth.  I personally think that expecting someone to wait until your fifty would be asking too much of that person, but that is just my teenage intuition talking. 9

iam 23 yrs old ...and my height is 5.1,want to grow tall.. but how? want some efective ways to grow tall? with out side effects, very safe .. but guarantee growth At 23 you have finished growing naturally.\n\nThere are no totally safe methods to make you grow.\n\nWhat is so wrong with being petite?  Taller won't make you any better than you are right now.\n\nDon't think for a second that guys will find you more attractive if you are taller.  The right guy will not care how you look, he'll only care about how you are inside.\n\n(Most movie and tv stars are petite - shorter people look better on screen).\n\nIf you want to be tall to be a fashion model, then think again.  Tall is only one of the features required.  You also need endless patience and to get used to being permanently hungry.\n\nMy advice is to relax and enjoy how you are. 3
Will the New York Rangers make the playoffs this year?  it's a close run for every position, but mostly for a playoff spot.\n\nit's indeed a bit early in the season and there are many factors that can make a difference including injuries but also a slump for only 5-6 games can make a huge difference when it is this close.\n\nBut it seems that the rangers will make the playoffs for the first time in many years...with the least amount of stars and therefore with the smallest payroll!\n\nIt shows that money doesn't always buy a championship! 6

Young women, what is more important for you to date a guy, for him being rich or physically attractive? Choose  Based on a comprehensive research study I just completed- it proves that the number one trait women look for most when they are searching for a mate is financial stability and social status- physical attractiveness is further down on the list- HOWEVER, for males, it is opposite- the number one quality men look for in women is physical attractiveness\n\nI am not sure how young you are talking when you say "young women" but I am 22 and financial security is more important to me than physcial attractiveness, which as I said above, falls into the norm\n\nThe one stipulation to this rule of thumb is what kind of relationship one is looking for- if a female is looking for a lifetime mate, the above remains true- however younger girls (pre-teen, teen) may not fall into that norm- Also if a person is looking only for a casual, sexual relationship, in that case physical attractiveness is more important 9

Many campgrounds offer free WIFI - what kind of card do I need for my laptop in order to access this service?  You need a IEEE 802.11 b/g card for accessing wireless Internet.  Most of today's laptops already have it internally.  You can verify it by going to Start > Control panel > System > Hardware > Device Manager > Network Adapters.  Check if a wireless card is specified (like the Intel network adapter).  If no wireless card is specified, you can get an external PCMCIA-interface wireless internet card.  The following link gives you a bunch of info on wireless cards based on the PCMCIA interface.  All laptops usually have the PCMCIA slot. 5

How do I install a second hard drive onto my Windows 98 SE computer? What steps do I have to follow in order to have an extra working hard drive on my computer? Most USB devices require special drivers to use on Win98.  If you want to purchase an external drive, make sure it include Win98 drivers.\n\nOtherwise, you need to pop open your case, and install an internal drive.  Before installing, make sure you have an extra connection on the cable leading to the existing hard drive.  If not, you'll need to purchase a new IDE cable.  Make sure you purchase an 80-pin IDE cable (as opposed to 40-pin) as your drive can only achieve it's best performance with an 80-pin IDE cable\n\nMost cases have the space to add an extra drive internally.  There are two types of drive bays - 5.25" and 3.5".  Since all desktop hard drives are 3.5" use one of these if possible.  Otherwise you can purchase a rail kit to adapt a 3.5" drive to 5.25".\n\nNext comes the drive settings.  Your current drive may either be set for Master or Cable Select.  Usually there are a series of jumpers next to where the drive connects to the power cord (4-pin) and/or cable leading to the controller (on the motherboard).  On some drives, they're marked MA, SL, or CS.  If not it may indicate on the top of the drive.  If the drive is MA(ster), you need to set your new drive for SL(ave).  If it's CS (cable select), set yours for CS.  Plug your drive into the empty connector on the same cable that connects to your hard drive.\n\nI would recommend connecting hard drives in series instead of putting a hard drive on the same cable as your CD/DVD drive.  IDE can only perform as well as the slowest device on the cable.  Since CD/DVD drives are typically slower than hard drives, your new drive won't be able to achieve it's maximum performance.\n\nThat's usually it.  Your system BIOS should automatically detect the drive.  You can either use Windows to partition and format the drive, or, if your new drive included a setup utility, use the disk that came with the drive.  Since you're using Windows98 you must setup the drive to use a FAT32 partition as Win98 does not support NTFS, and FAT has a limit of 2GB. 5
What is a girl to do? My mom my dad and my ggrandparents are all calling me a hoe because i have boys calling my phone. They think Im having sex with my boyfriend, his brother and his best friend. Im not that type of person at all. Relationshiip wise Im known to talk to older men but Im still a virgin. All u can do is tell them that ur not doing anything at all. The only person u really have to be accoutable to is urself(and God,if ur religious). I know it's hard to ignore all the gossip and rumors, but that is where fresh air comes into play. It's always good to clear ur head. IF it's possible, let ur parents know where u go when ur not at home(if it won't get u in trouble). When u are out of the house, and on ur own(especially if u get hitched), that kind of gossip will stop(I assume).\n\nMy own relatives think I'm a skank(In my culture, dating isn't allowed), and my parents believe a lot of what they hear. The only advice I get from people is to go on with my life and deal with it. People who gossip are bored, and they want exitement and drama in their own lives, so ur the scapegoat. Others are miserable in their own lives and want company. I know it's hard, but try to be happy no matter what, and one day, God will see ur pain and deliver u from it. Good Luck! 9

Have you made someone's day today? You know, life works in the weirdest ways. We really do have "angels" that appear right when needed. Someone just reached out to me when I really needed it most and it moved me to no end. When I think that such a small gesture can go such a long way, I wonder if I ever have that kind of impact on another. lol I venture to guess that I don't always make the effort to. So I thought that maybe I really really would make a conscious effort to do so. \n\nSo now I ask you.....have you done something today that you know made someone feel just a little bit better? Yes, I have. There is also another angel out there who makes my day everyday without even trying. \n    She is what was left in Pandora's box. She is hope.\nShe just doesn't realize how special she really is.\n     You do realize that someone believes in you now. You don't have to take on the world alone because you have help when you need it.\n     You are a one in a million. The largest diamond in the world could never equal your value. \n      Never doubt yourself or your abilities because I don't. I believe in you. 1

How do I get windows to stop giving two options for selecting an operating system at startup? I just purchased a used computer and had them remove the partition on the hard drive prior to taking it home. When I start the computer it gives me two options (two Windows XP's) and asks which operating system I would like to use. It gives 20 seconds to choose or it chooses for you. Everything works well enough, but I am concerned. Is this indicative of a larger problem and how do I get it to stop? Click Start, then choose Run.  Enter 'msconfig' without the quotes at the prompt, and the System Configuration Utility will boot.  The tabs allow you to control startup options, boot programs and edit various system config files.  Just set the timer to 0 and you won't get a wait during startup.  Also try pressing Windows key and Pause/Break.  Then choose Advanced, System Startup. 5

how does one solve the quadratic formula?  There are few ways of solving for the unknown in a quadratic equation.\n\nIn general, a quadratic equation is of the form:\n   a*x^2 + b*x + c = 0, a != 0    --- (1)\nDividing (1) by "a" through out, we get,\n   x^2 + (b/a)*x + (c/a) = 0  --- (2)\n\nOne way of solving is to really guess the solution. It works like this:\nAssume we have (somehow) factorised (2) into a form like:\n   (x - p)(x - q) = 0   --- (3)\n(3) can also be written as (by mutiplying term by term),\n   x^2 - (p+q)*x + p*q = 0   --- (4)\nComparing (2) and (4),\n   p + q = -b/a\n   p*q   = c/a\nSo, if the equation is written like in (2), the sum of roots is negative of x co-efficient, and the product is the constant. A "root" is a value of x that satisfies the given equation (1).\n\nFor e.g, given,\n   x^2 - 6*x + 5 = 0,\nthe sum of roots must be 6 and the product must be 5. So (we guess), the roots must be 1 and 5. Easy!\n\nBut "guessing" is not always possible :(\n\nLook at this equation:\n   x^2 - 6*x + 10 = 0\nThe roots of this are 3 + i and 3 - i. Not easy to guess right?\n\nA generic way of solving is called "completing the square". And it is a very clever piece of work! It works like this:\nEquation (2) again:\n   x^2 + (b/a)*x + (c/a) = 0\nThe aim is to get the equation into a form that looks like:\n   (x + something)^2 = somethingelse\nThen we can solve for x easily.\n\nLet us first get rid of the constant term to the other side:\n   x^2 + (b/a)*x = -(c/a)\nLet us re-write this again like:\n   x^2 + 2*(b/2a)*x = -(c/a) --- (6)\nLook at the left hand side (LHS) of the equation.. it is looking like: x^2 + 2*something*x. If only we have something^2, then we can put it in the form we want. So we'll add that term:\n   x^2 + 2*(b/2a)*x + (b/2a)^2 = -(c/a) + (b/2a)^2\nWe've got it! We now have,\n   ( x + (b/2a) )^2 = -(c/a) + (b/2a)^2\n\nWe can solve for x quite easily from here (left as exercise to the reader).\n\nThe "magic" equation (-b plus or minus sqare-root of etc...) is really derived by completing the square. 2

How does the Divergence Theorem relate to Stokes's Theorem? Alright! I'm pulling out all the stops for this one.  How does the Divergency Theorem relate to Stokes's Theorem?  Is is possible to link theme togeather?  If so, how?  If not, why not? \n\n(Note: This is a Calc III level question.  If you head is hurting, that would be your brain thinking.  If you feel pain, suck it up!) In 1931, P. A. M. Dirac suggested that the existence of magnetic monopoles would explain the quantization of electric charge, the fact that it appears only in units of the electronic charge e (fractional charges appear in certain theories, but are not observed in nature). This article is not about these monopoles, so if the reader should refer to Jackson if interested in them, or to the article Energy Loss of Charged Particles, where the stopping of Dirac monopoles by matter is discussed. Here we will talk about magnetic charges, or isolated poles, or monopoles as an aid in understanding electricity and magnetism by analogy between electric and magnetic fields. We'll also discuss the systems of electromagnetic units, especially those things not appearing in current texts, and how it all hangs together.\n\nThe magnetic field of the earth does not exceed about 1 ørsted, which shows that there is no great amount of unbalanced magnetic charge in its makeup. In fact, isolated magnetic poles have never been observed, and are not accounted for in Maxwell's equations. Magnetic fields are all created by currents, either macroscopic ones or microscopic ones, just as electric fields are created by free or bound charges. Relativity indicates that E and B are the fundamental electromagnetic fields that describe the macroscopic interactions of electromagnetism and are associated in a field tensor that has different expressions in different inertial frames.\n\nThe original concept of electromagnetism was that of "action at a distance" evidenced by the mutual forces exerted by charges or currents at different locations on each other. Faraday's concept was that the influence was transmitted through a medium in which the charges or currents were immersed, and this concept was expressed mathematically by Maxwell, who based the theory on fields satisfying certain differential equations. A source charge created a field, which then acted upon the charge that was influenced. He searched in vain for a suitable medium, which became the famous "luminiferous ether" of pre-relativistic days, and for a suitable mechanism for the propagation of the influence. All attempts to detect the medium failed, and it was replaced by the concepts of relativity, in which there are still fields, but immaterial ones. This was at least a partial return to the earlier ideas, and the "reality" of electromagnetic fields can be a subject of discussion. It appears that the potentials are what travels at the speed of light, and the fields are derived from them. Whatever conclusion may be drawn, they do describe the physics very well indeed.\n\nIn the early days of Maxwell's theory, the equations D = κE and B = μH were thought of as relating a stress (E or H) to a strain (D or B). These four fields D, E, B and H were called displacement, electric intensity, induction and magnetic intensity, respectively. Their units were the familiar absolute electrostatic (esu) or absolute electromagnetic (emu) units. Practical workers, for their part, had arbitrarily defined units of electrical pressure and resistance, and from them derived the units of charge and current. The unit of electrical pressure was that of the Daniell cell, and that of resistance was a mercury column 1 sq. mm. in cross-section and 1 m long.\n\nIt was discovered, by an investigator named Giorgi, that by a certain choice of the units of mass, length and time quantities very close to the practical units could be brought into a consistent and absolute system of units. A consistent system of units is one in which the units are determined by the defining equations for the quantities, and not by arbitrary choice. An absolute system is one in which all units are derived from a set of basic units. The emu and esu were consistent absolute systems based on the centimeter-gram-second (cgs) mechanical units. Giorgi found that simply taking the meter-kilogram-second (mks) as fundam 2

Where does the phrase "The Whole 9 Yards come from">?  I answered this question a few days back with this information:\n\n This phrase is of unknown origin and is the subject of some debate. At issue is to what does nine yards refer. The meaning is clearly the entirety or everything, but nine yards is not a significant measure of anything. All we know about its origin is that the phrase cannot be traced any earlier than the mid-1960s and that it is American in origin.\n\nPerhaps the most common assumption is that it is from American football, but the canonical distance in that game is ten, not nine, yards. Also common are explanations based on length of cloth, but there is no standard length for a bolt of cloth (which measure anywhere from twenty to twenty-five yards), and nine yards is not a significant measure for any type of garment (a man's suit uses about seven yards of a thirty-inch bolt, double folded; sarongs, saris, kilts, kimonos, bridal veils and any number of other garments have been suggested, none with any accompanying evidence).\n\nThe explanation that is currently circulating around the internet most frequently is that nine yards was the length of a belt of machine gun ammunition carried by a WWII fighter plane. To "give it the whole nine yards" was to expend all of one's ammo. This explanation is almost certainly false. For one thing, the type of fighter varies with the teller, sometimes Spitfires in the Battle of Britain, sometimes varying American fighters in the South Pacific. Another reason to doubt it is that ammunition is either counted in rounds or by weight. It is never measured in length of a belt. Chapman points to an origin in the Army and Air Force, which fits in with the post-WWII-era origin, but is otherwise unexplained. 1
Excluding computer matches, how does a single older woman find a compatible partner? I'm looking for an honest, hard-working man who will treat me with respect and not expect me to jump into the sack on the first date. To find a man to give you respect, you have to find a man who has been taught the meaning of respect. If a man wants sex right away, it just proves that they don't see you as a potential partner.\nGood men are hard to find and good quality women are hard to find. If I were you I would find a congregation somewhere that was large with some quality single men in it. A christian man would treat you with more respect. 9

What should I do to train to get in to my sophomore high school wrestling team&what do you do during practice? If you weight train then tell what muscles and how strong they should be. Be specific please the practice ; how much do you run, lift weights, and pratice wrestling. It's not always about muscles, but you should work out your arm and leg muscles...run up and down stairs that will get you strong leg muslces and about lifting weights just lift as much as you can and gradually add more wieght.  Also practice shooting, and arm-bars because i have seen many wrestlers get really good because of those two moves.  Good Luck 6
my quation is about HIV/AIDs? is it true that mosquitos cant transmited HIV to a healthy person? While it is possible it's virtually nonexistent. The mosquito would have to bite a person with HIV. This person would also have to be in a stage of infection when HIV particles are in the blood. The blood taken by the mosquito would have to have HIV particles in it. These HIV particles would have to somehow get into the saliva of the mosquito, and then be transferred to a new person. So it's really minimum. 3

Which way do you swing? Republican or Democrat?  Republican usually, the Democrats have never in my voting life time had anybody worth voting for in an election.  There might be a local democratic candidate from time to time I will vote for if it makes sense.  Not all Republicans are good and not all Democrats are bad it just depends on what needs to get done at the local level.  Nationally though I seem to like the Republican's agendas better. \n\nOh and by the way the Democrat is not the working mans politician.  They are full of **** to get your votes.  Joe Kennedy taught his kids to speak with a Boston accent in order to get the working man's votes.  And things like unions actually hurt our economy not help.  Once again votes not solutions.  Many working class people, especially self-employed, get great tax benefits from Republicans, just not $35/hr. \n\nI guess we could bring back Clinton and have creative accounting, false stock reports, etc... that really worked.

Engl. Paper. please help. Why do illegal mexicans come to America? Please help fast. Thanks to whoever helps? Hi. Im doing a reserach paper. And i have to write a fictional story about a man and his wife who come to america illegaly and the problems that they face and why they come in the first place. im totally stumped can you please help. or give me ideas. thank you to whoever helps me. "Illegal Mexicans" come to America for the same reasons that your ancestors came to America.  America is the land of oppurtunity and unlike many other countries, America is somewhat of a meritocracy.  America is a beacon of light that advertises itself as the land of the free and the home of the brave.  \n\nYou shouldn't call them "illegal Mexicans."  They have every right to be here as you do.  Unless you are 100% Native American, somebody in your family was an immigrant.  Even if your family came over on the Mayflower, your ancestors were once "illegal  XXXXXX" as well.  Who are you to say that you are "legal" and some others are "illegal"? 4

what are the death rituals in Pakistan?  There are different rituals depending on your religion.  Two major religions practiced in Pakistan are Islam and Hinduism.\n\nWhen a Muslim is near death, those around him or her are called upon to give comfort, and reminders of God's mercy and forgiveness. They may recite verses from the Qur'an, give physical comfort, and encourage the dying one to recite words of remembrance and prayer. It is recommended, if at all possible, for a Muslim's last words to be the declaration of faith: "I bear witness that there is no god but Allah."\n\nUpon death, those with the deceased are encouraged to remain calm, pray for the departed, and begin preparations for burial. \n\nThe eyes of the deceased should be closed, and the body covered temporarily with a clean sheet. It is forbidden for those in mourning to excessively wail, scream, or thrash about. Grief is normal when one has lost a loved one, and it is natural and permitted to cry. When the Prophet Muhammad's own son died, he said: "The eyes shed tears and the heart is grieved, but we will not say anything except which pleases our Lord." One should strive to be patient, and remember that Allah is the One who gives life and takes it away, at a time appointed by Him. It is not for us to question His wisdom.\n\nMuslims strive to bury the deceased as soon as possible after death, avoiding the need for embalming or otherwise disturbing the body of the deceased. An autopsy may be performed, if necessary, but should be done with the utmost respect for the dead.\n\nWashing and Shrouding\nIn preparation for burial, the family or other members of the community will wash and shroud the body. (If the deceased was killed as a martyr, this step is not performed; martyrs are buried in the clothes they died in.) The deceased will be washed respectfully, with clean and scented water, in a manner similar to how Muslims make ablutions for prayer. The body will then be wrapped in sheets of clean, white cloth (called the kafan).\n\nFuneral Prayers\nThe deceased is then transported to the site of the funeral prayers (salat-l-janazah). These prayers are commonly held outdoors, in a courtyard or public square, not inside the mosque. The community gathers, and the imam (prayer leader) stands in front of the deceased, facing away from the worshippers. The funeral prayer is similar in structure to the five daily prayers, with a few variations. (For example, there is no bowing or prostration, and the entire prayer is said silently but for a few words.)\n\nBurial\nThe deceased is then taken to the cemetery for burial (al-dafin). While all members of the community attend the funeral prayers, only the men of the community accompany the body to the gravesite. It is preferred for a Muslim to be buried where he or she died, and not be transported to another location or country (which may cause delays or require embalming the body). If available, a cemetery (or section of one) set aside for Muslims is preferred. The deceased is laid in the grave (without a coffin if permitted by local law) on his or her right side, facing Mecca. At the gravesite, it is discouraged for people to erect tombstones, elaborate markers, or put flowers or other momentos. Rather, one should humbly remember Allah and His mercy, and pray for the deceased.\n\nMourning\nLoved ones and relatives are to observe a 3-day mourning period. Mourning is observed in Islam by increased devotion, receiving visitors and condolences, and avoiding decorative clothing and jewelry. Widows observe an extended mourning period (iddah), 4 months and 10 days long, in accordance with the Qur'an 2:234. During this time, she is not to remarry, move from her home, or wear decorative clothing or jewelry.\n\nWhen one dies, everything in this earthly life is left behind, and there are no more opportunities to perform acts of righteousness and faith. The Prophet Muhammad once said that there are three things, however, which may continue  10

How can I get rid of my lower back pain?  The right answer depends on why you have the pain - is it a nerve, a muscle, a disc, etc.  If it is a muscular pain, the answer is probably stretching,  particularly the hamstrings.  Your musculature is all connected, and if one large muscle is wound tight, it will impact your entire body.  THis happens to me a lot, and stretching is always the answer. 3

What drives the plates?  Hi Rams, The simple answer is heat, produced by radioactive decay within the Earth. In effect the mantle is a vast heat engine. However, the details have been controversial over the years. Now a picture is emerging, produced by a geophysical technique called seismic tomography. This has imaged subducting slabs of cold dense lithosphere drooping all the way down to the core-mantle boundary. This represents a return flow for convection, affecting the entire mantle. The mantle cools however principally by passive upwelling at mid-ocean ridges. So the mantle contains convection cells. The convection is very slow but relentless, driving the plates at a few cm a year. In essence the plates are just a stiff outer skin, pulled by the subducted slabs. So it is the nature of the outer, cool part of the Earth that organises the convection in the deep Earth. The core-mantle boundary becomes the graveyard of the plates. But plate tectonics only accounts for about 90% of the current Earth heat engine. The other 10% drives from mantle plumes that originate from the core-mantle boundary. Plumes are lava-lamp-like upwellings, although they can take about 100 million years to reach the upper mantle. Plumes are represented on the Earth's surface as "hot-spots" - sites of apparently anomalous volcanic activity such as are found on the Hawaiian islands.\n\nFollowing are links to some excellent resources that answer your query, along with some illustrations :\n\nhttp://pubs.usgs.gov/publications/text/unanswered.html\nhttp://element.ess.ucla.edu/publications/1998_Earth2/1998_Earth2.htm\nhttp://geology.com/plate-tectonics/\n\nMerry Christmas! 2

what is intelligent systems?  Intelligent systems or expert systems are grouped under the category of "Machine Learning" or in the fuzzy realm of AI.  \n\nAll of these systems are given a training set which allows them to callibrate on providing a particular action or judgment when presented with new data.  Using feedback loops these systems become better and better at determining the right answer (in effect they "learn").\n\nOne example of these systems is neural networks, highly connected systems that are "trained" to do certain tasks.  Your brain for instance is a very complicated neural network with thousands of nodes and billions of connections where the connections get stronger or weaker depending on your life learnings and experience. 2

It is an American opinion that Arabs hate them, not an Arab one. first off, i am not american\n\nsecond off, i don't think it matters that i am not american anyways\n\nthird off, maybe it is the media giving the impressions that arabs hate americans, there is a lot of propoganda out there so americans stay pro war, and it could lead to misjudged ideas of how the arabs actually feel\n\nfourth off, if you want to change americans minds, then speak out for yourself and let people know you are not hateful of them and know that there are reasons to keep peace!!!!\n\nfifth off, not all americans may feel bad towards arabs. but there is a lot of hatred out there and it is wrong! just because of a bunch of extremists, millions of others are blamed! 10

is a virus alive or not?  Are viruses alive? \nAnyone with a cold or the flu virus feels as if they are under attack by some organism. But in the scientific community it's still an open-ended question. This is why viruses do not belong to a kingdom of living things. Just because a virus seems alive doesn't mean it is alive. After all, it's not even a single-celled organism.\n\nA virus is little more than a strand of DNA or RNA covered by a protein coating. Viruses are a thousand times smaller than bacteria and come in a wide range of shapes. Some look like weird, tall spiders whereas others look like prickly porcupinelike soccer balls.\n\n...\n\nAs humans, we like to classify things because it helps us understand the physical world. Viruses must have a host cell to live and reproduce. Outside of the host cell, viruses are pieces of genetic molecules that can do nothing by themselves. Viruses are right on the border between living and nonliving. Some biologists currently see the virus as a nonliving infectious particle. Other biologists disagree and suggest they are alive because of what happens inside the host cell. \n\nGetting a definite answer if viruses are alive or not may never happen. \n\nBut hey, that's life. 2

Can someone tell me what happened in Buffy's series finale? I had to work and missed the ending. The gang makes an attack on the First's army, aided by Willow, who performs a powerful spell to imbue all of the Potentials with Slayer powers. Meanwhile, wearing the amulet that Angel brought, Spike becomes the decisive factor in the victory, and Sunnydale is eradicated. Buffy and the gang look back on what's left of Sunnydale, deciding what to do next...\n--but more importantly, there will no longer be any slaying in Sunnydale, or is that Sunnyvale.... 8

making this short, he likes me he's dating her i like him he likes me more then her but is afraid of "us" why? okay he and i liked eachother openly from when we first met 2 months ago but then he said that he wanted to get to know me better before he did anything about it and that he didnt know what he wanted, then this guy that i had liked for 3 years asked me out and i said yes but in the 2 weeks we were dating we didnt get along and are now not friends but the guy in question started talkign to one of my best friends that he had breefly met 3 years ago and and right after me and the BF broke up he started dating her, he says that he wants to be with me but that the amount of guy's i've been with bothers him and he's not sure how to get past it. true i've been with a lot of guy but i would do anything for him and he knows that and beleves it. why is it he cant take the chance and be with me? Well I think that if he really loves you than he wouldn't care about what people say or do, and would only focus on only being with you...so if he loves you as he says then  why is he with another one? \nand doing anything for each other does not come from one side it comes from both sides of the relationship.(which is you and him) 9
what is the order of the magnitude of the power of a light source so that the photons can knock me over?  To Skully:\nI often jump too quickly to answer a question, but it's a bad habit.  Solar sails and radiometers:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_sail\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crookes_radiometer\n\nIn fact, light is responsible for the motion of all electrons.\n\nAs for the original question, I'm going to assume that you're a two meter long (rather tall, actually) 65 kilogram plank.  Your center of gravity would have to be displaced about .25 meters (off your feet) to tip you over.  Gravity exerts a maximum torque of about 80 N*m on you.  At the top of your head, that torque produces 40 newtons.  When it's reflected, light exerts a "pressure" of 2*I/c where I is the intensity of light (in watts per meter^2).  Multiplying both sides by area and plugging this into my calculator produces about 6 billion watts (and remember, that's if you wear a reflective surface on your head and it's only enough to tip you over, not actually knock you down).  I'd say you're pretty safe from sudden "light gusts". 2

using asp, how do I include a file from another website? I'm looking for something similar to the PHP include("http://www.yahoo.com") and I know about the include file="" in asp, but it doesn't work for pages from other sites. you would have to query the other website, get its output and write out to the RESPONSE part.\nBasically you would create something like a HTTPWebRequest which would request the page from the server, and then return to client, however please note that this might cause a delay in response as each request will go to the other server from your server before returning the response to the client. 5

I have always wanted to get a handgun.  What do I need to do? Last time I went shooting was with my dad about 10 years ago.  I want to get one, but I want to know how to use it.  Which should I do first: go to a shooting range (do I need a weapon to go) and learn to shoot, or buy a gun (how do I know which one I want or will like)? Call the local ranges in your area and find one that rents guns. Shoot a few until you find one you like, talk to the guys there about what you'll be using it for and how often you'll shoot. They will give you a good idea as to what you should buy. Make sure you get an appropriate caliber for your purposes, shooting .357 ammo gets expensive quick but you can shoot 9mm ammo all day. 6

is there a list for the crew of PT109?  If you look for the crew just click this site\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/36/PT-109_crew.jpg\n\nPT-109 was a PT boat commanded by lieutenant John F. Kennedy (later United States President) in the Pacific Theater during World War II. Kennedy's actions after the sinking of the PT-109 both solidified his "war hero" status in his political career, and may have contributed to his long-term back problems.\n\nKennedy's boat was rammed by the Japanese destroyer Amagiri on August 2, 1943 in the Blackett Strait between Kolombangara and Arundel in the Solomon Islands, cutting it in half and killing two of his men. Kennedy led the survivors, clinging to the wreckage of the boat, to safety on the deserted Plum Pudding Island. An article about the experience was printed in Reader's Digest just before Kennedy's first Congressional run, and the campaign reproduced the article and distributed it to potential voters.\n\nThough Kennedy emerged a hero (awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal) a few in the military including Douglas MacArthur thought he should have faced a court-martial for losing his boat in such a manner.\n\nIn addition to the book mentioned below, the episode was also made into a 1963 movie PT 109, starring Cliff Robertson. The island was renamed to Kennedy Island.\n\nThe wreckage of PT-109 may have been located; a May 2002 a National Geographic expedition headed by Dr. Robert Ballard found wreckage matching the description and location of Kennedy's vessel in the Solomon Islands [1]. However, under current Navy policy, the wreckage site is a gravesite and may not be disturbed.\n\nGerald Zinser, the last survivor of the PT-109, died in 2003. 4

Couples superbowl  betting for prizes ( sex- chores)? As a humorous way of teaching a friend about the game of football I suggested placing awards on team stats. Her fiance is taking Pitt she's taking Seattle  ( I warned her about her picka already). ANYWAY>>  Need increasing suggestions for "prizes" for points.\nRough theory- \nInterception or Fumble with loss of ball = 5 minute neck rub\nQB sacked- loser does a shot\nFieldgoal - 15 minute oral to player whos team got the points.\nTouchdown- 30 minutes of playing slave to the other person.\nExtra point - other person makes dinner.\nand so on..\nNeed ideas from couples.He wants sex prizes, she wants houshold duty prizes.\nHelp me even this out a bit. if seattle wins by say 14 or something he should clean the house for 2 weeks 1 point = 1 day chores\n\nif Pittsburgh wins by 14 she should give him like 10 min. oral per point so 14 points = 140 mins. = 2hr. 20 min. b-l-o-w-j-o-b 6
Why do I get"oe removed access to following unsafe attachments in your' mail I am using Outlook Express? I think I must have a restriction that is set too tightly? Outlook automatically blocks files with certain extensions based on the fact that they MIGHT contain viruses. This is a real pain in the butt for me because I teach intro to computers and my students can't send me their database assignments because Outlook blocks them as potentially unsafe. To unblock them, you have to tweak a Windows registry setting. I wish I were kidding about that. 5
Last night I saw a really bright star to the west that was really low.  What star or planet is this? This star was so much brighter and seemed larger than all the other stars and was very low to the horizon, almost due West.  I have not noticed it before until last night.  I wonder what it is and why I am just noticing it. The brightest star in the sky is Sirius (aka the Dog Star) and it is sort of bluish, and iridescent.  It flashes so many colors that I have many times had people convinced it was a plane and bet me money it wasn't a star, only to see it sitting quite still among the stars for hours.  THis star would have probably been on the western horizon pretty late, like around 2 or 3 am (it's usually rather high in the south when I go to work at 10pm).\n\nMars, being rather red, is also quite visible recently, and would be hovering near the horizon also quite late.  Mercury is always near the sun, and is likely to be seen in the west just after sunset (but I can't say for sure, since I haven't seen it recently--it's usually already set by the time I wake up for work).  And it seems like I recently saw Venus being quite right, and it should be setting a few hours after sunset.\n\nIf you give the color and the time, I could give you a better answer. 2

I am interested to know the definition of "Dollar" - and where does this word come from?  From Wikipedia:\n\nThe name is related to the historic currencies Tolar in Bohemia, Thaler or Taler in Germany, Daalder in the Netherlands and Daler in Sweden, Denmark, and Norway. The name thaler (from Thal, or nowadays usually Tal, "valley") originally came from the German Guldengroschen ("great gulden", being of silver but equal in value to a gold gulden) coins minted from the silver from a rich mine at Joachimsthal (St. Joachim's Valley) in Bohemia (then part of the Habsburg Empire). The name "Spanish dollar" was used for a Spanish silver coin, the peso, an eight-real coin, which was widely circulated during the 18th century in the Spanish colonies in the New World. The use of the Spanish dollar and the Maria Theresa thaler as legal tender for the early United States is the reason for the name of the nation's currency. The word dollar was in use in the English language for the thaler for about 200 years before the American Revolution. Spanish dollars, or "pieces of eight" as they were called, were in circulation in the Thirteen Colonies that became the United States, and were legal tender in Virginia.\n\nThe dollar was also in use in Scotland during the 17th century, and there is a claim that it was invented at the University of St Andrews.\n\nUntil decimalisation in 1971 a half crown coin in the United Kingdom was popularly refered to as half a dollar doubtlessly stemming from the similarity of a crown (issued latterly only as a commemerative coin) resembling a US silver dollar in size and also in value for a number of years. 7

Who's the better Qb?  Michael Vick or Marcus?  Peyton Manning or Eli Manning?  Michael Vick is easily the better quarterback, as hes had more years to develop and Marcus, thanks to his legal escapes, might not reach the NFL or get any more time to develop. Peyton at the moment is better than Eli for the same reason although I believe they will both do very well over time. 6
what is flash nand memory?  Flash memory is one type of the two main storage methods - hard drives and flash.

The flash memory for iPod Nano's is provided by Samsung.\n\nFlash memory cannot be rewritten as often as hard drives. 5

Why don't people stand upside down when standing on the South Pole?  If you define up as the direction towards the sky, and down as the direction a ball will fall when dropped, then there is no difference when you stand on the north pole, south pole or anywhere in between.\n\nThe Earth is spherical so Earth's gravity pulls in the same relative direction no matter where you are, down towards the center of the planet, so that makes down always towards your feet.\n\nAnd also since the Earth is spherical the sky will always be above your head, up. \n\nSo there is no difference in upside down or right-side up based on where you are on the Earth. 2

Also, I would prefer an answer from someone who is currently doing this.\n\nThank you for any help and guidance you can provide! If you wish to invest in stocks, study FA (Fundamental Analysis) to determine the financial qualities of a company and TA (Technical Analysis) to determine investor sentiment about the company.  Investopedia.com has a wealth of information including a dictonary for terms and acronyms and tutorials to get started.  Do your own Due Diligence and invest only in companies you thoroughly understand.  Invest only money you can afford to lose, not rent and food money.  Never stop learning about the stock market and you may gain 10-20% monthly; or lose even more.  Good luck.  Bye the way, you can set up your stock portfolio and follow it under Yahoo Finance and even create a dummy portfolio to "paper trade" stocks without using real money until you learn the ropes.  But the best lessons will come from using real money.  Always analyze good and bad trades to learn even more.  Best of luck. 7

does pineapple juice help you burn fat?  Not really,it is good for digestion though because of the enzyme bromelin.It is high in calories and sugar,and should be portion controlled,you should use the whole fruit rather then the juice,because it is extremely high in sugar content.It does not have any magic fat burning properties.Stick to veggie juices instead. 3
how to sell more item?  There are many ways to sell more products than before. Here are few that I could think of -\n\n1: Plan - Be sure that have done your paperwork and know all the information about the product you are going to sell. You need to know what kind of audience you are going to target and to findout what is the best way to approach them.\n\n2: Market, From step one, once you have the information about who you are going to target, you need to find a way to approach them. In our everyday life, the most common ways are flyers, local newspapers and word of mouth.\n\n3: Great service - Be sure to provide the best service possible. People love to return to someone who treated them more than just a customer. Not only that, they are rocommend you to others they know as well. \n\nThese are few points that I have learned in my journey to run my own business and thankfully, my small business did a gross of $2.5Mil this year so far. 7

So tell all about your name and what it means to u? Do u think names tell who a person is Well I think that you mean our real names. not our screen names. Well My name is very unique. it is my mothers maiden name and it means a lot to me to have it. My naem is dirived from a french town named Daubigny. Over time it was shortened to Dabney. There are not alot of Dabney's in the world so when you meet them it is like finding gold. There are two sets of Dabneys, black Dabney and white dabney. The white Dabneys are mainly in Virginia and the black Dabney are in Louisiana wher my family is from. I didn't like my name at first but i feel that I have become a Dabney because of my family and my history. I love my name! 1
Is there a natural cure for menstrual cramps? What causes menstrual cramps?\n\n\n\nHow can you cure menstrual cramps with things form nature? People have been unable to identify a single cause of PMS. Theories range from hormonal and chemical to nutritional and psychological. Women whose mother or sisters have PMS are more likely to have it, so there may be a genetic component. A combination of genetic, physiological, and environmental causes are likely. Making dietary adjustments starting about 14 days before a period may help some women with certain mild menstrual disorders, such as cramping.\nGood luck with that.  I used to have them too.  However my mother told me that they get better afyter you have a baby.  I am not sure about that.  I am pregnant.  Please don't take the advices too closely to heart.  i am not saying get pregnant, every woman is different.  Try drinking chamomile tea. It relaxes the muscles and take a hot bath, as hot as you can stand it, but not for too long or you might pass out.\nGood Luck, we all go through that stuff. 3

what is "autocapture" in geomorphology?  Imagine you have a drainage network of rivers, tributaries, and streams.  Now imagine one particular path of drainage, from head waters to delta.  If somehow (erosion, for example) somewhere along this path the water found a new shortcut to another part of the drainge system, then that water would have been "autocaptured".\n\nGet out a map of Illinois and the surrounding area.  The Illinos Waterway goes from Lake Michigan at Chicago to the Mississippi river at St. Louis.  The Mississipi river flows along the western border of Illinois.  Now look at the area between LaSalle, Ill. (on the Waterway) and Davenport, Iowa (by the Mississippi).  There is a set of streams in this area.  If they managed to link together and cause the Mississippi to be diverted near Davenport to LaSalle, then the Illinois Waterway would have captured the Mississippi.  Since these are part of the same drainage system, it would be called an autocapture.\n\nThe link below may explain better with illustrations. Look at pages 9 and 10:\nhttp://www.geography.wisc.edu/classes/geog320/network_and_basin.pdf 2
Why does asparagus make your pee smell funny?  And the funny thing about this is that some people say that asparagus doesn't make their pee smell. It turns out that some people just genetically lack the ability to *smell* the smell that their pee gives off after they eat asparagus.\n\nThat's one of the weirdest bits of trivia I know. And now you know it too. 2

Should Catholic priests be allowed to marry?  Yes.  The current ban on marrage for priests stems from when individual priests held important political power in there local communities, and also held the right to land owned by the church.  This power and wealth would often find its way to his wife and children.\n\nToday this is not much of a issue in major christian based faiths. 1
what do you think is the influence of temperature on protein structure of the enzyme to affect its activity?  Prozymes (protein portion of the enzyme) require a spacific temperature range to operate properly.  At both ends of this spacific operating range there are laten temperature ranges.  These ranges render the prozyme ineffective but still redeemible. Even further from the spacific temp range, outside the laten temp ranges are denaturation temps.  These are the temps where the prozyme is damaged to the point where it can never again function properly.  The heating methode of denaturation is usually used only when pH of the resulting supernatant will be measured.  Otherwise one could simplely titrate to the desired pH using a more effective methode. \n\nAs not to disperce the debriss of denaturation into your solution the Acid coagulum methode is perhaps the best way.  This can be achieved by adding to the solution just enough glaceral acitic acid untill the protein stops gelling.  The solution should actually become less turbit.  Finally, use ETOH to counter titrate to the desired pH.  Remember countertitration makes water (H2O) in your solution so don't add excessive acid to begin with. E-mail me with your results.  I am interested. 2

where does berilum come from?  roito..  i'm no scientist, but the way i see it, since so many of our other elements have been hypothesized to be formed in a solar furnace, i'd take berilium to be no exception.  it's probably just left over from the nebula that produced our solar system.  However, astral bodies that collide with the earth also carry with them certain chemicals, so the source of berilium on this planet can also be attributed to some degree to those, as well.  \nhere's a neat factoid for ye..  protein strains that are slammed into the earth at those fantastic speeds known to meteors, upon impact, form amino acids...  if i can recall that episode of NOVA i saw on m'local PBS station correctly.  ;) 7

Why do people lie when they know the truth,  When you questioned. Why people don't care on how you feel. ????? Can we get along when things go wrong, why do we fight if we can sought it out. Can we try to think positive and not negative. Questions they are so may questions to asked. Can the whole world answer all of the questions. Are we alone in this world. Why it's so hard to find a friend to trust and to love.  Do we all show love in God and Jesus Christ. Can we find the source to our problem. can we solve other people problems.  Do we have the power to stop the war.  Can we seek into the truth.  what is meaning of life if it blind's us.  can we seek into the light.  what does it feel to fall in love.  How are you sure if the person is right for you. when we make love to our mate, how do we know if there feeling the passion. many questions to ask and not many answers. You have alot of questions and alot of feelings.  Yes, there are people who care. Not everyone is a jerk. We can find answers if we thoughtfully seek them out and ask God for help.  It sounds like you need to find someone to help you find the answers, and someone to talk to and share your life.  Be patient, things will be OK , and the answers will come.....and so will the best companion for you... 1

how do you hit al lower golf shot with an iron, like keep it a lower trajectory?  This is really easy, let's take a shot from 150 yards as an example. Normally I would hit a 9 iron from this distance. Now if I wanted to hit it lower I would take out a 7-iron and take my normal stance, but I would grip down on the handle of the club about 1.5 inches, then I would make my normal swing, the shot should come out lower and with less spin, so it will cut through the wind and run a bit when it hits the ground. \n\nHope this helps! 6

Over 2685.970518 megabytes (and counting) of free storage so you'll never need to delete another message.\nWE SEE THOS ON GMAIL SIGNIN PAGE.\n\nwhat would this actually imply? No, no one gets 10 GB of space, unless they have multiple accounts.  The counter tells you how much space is in each active account at the moment the number appears.  As you probably noticed, the number steadily increases.  This is meant to say that the amount of space allowed to Gmail users is constantly increasing.  If it continues at its current pace, it will be a long time before anyone gets 10 GB of space. 5

Is Jeter a very good shortstop or great one?  Jeter is a very good shortstop.  He is probably a bit stronger on the offensive side than defense contributing to him being "very good."  \n\nHe is a good leadoff type hitter offensively as far as power and speed.  His numbers on the defensive side are about average for his position.\n\nHe has done this consistently over the last 10 seasons which adds to his his legacy.  He will definitely go down in history as one of the better shortstops.\n\nSee the stats link below for supporting data. 6

What is Dark Matter in Space made of?  So far science doesn't know what so-called dark matter is. Dark matter is the name for some exotic type of mass that is required to explain the motions of large structures in space, like galaxies, clusters of galaxies, etc.,. At this time, we think that dark matter accounts for about 23% of the universe's mass, while regular matter can only account for about 4%. The remaining 73% is thought to be what's called 'dark energy,' the totally unknown feature that is causing the universe's expansion rate to speed up. 2

How do you get rid of a nagging cough? Sinus drainage gets it started and it just continues from then on. There are several potential causes.  First, depends on how long its been a problem.  Potential causes are : gastro-esophageal reflux; chronic sinusitis with resultant post-nasal drip, an ENT specialist should be sought to see if the sinus drainage is caused my mucosal irritation due to a nasal or sinus polyp which should be surgically removed if found.  Also, some anti-hypertensive medications can cause chronic cough - such as ACE inhibitors ( a very common cause of chronic cough) 3

Which film depicted a fake (Christian) healer, who managed to create a real miracle? I saw this film about 7 years ago. It chronicled the work of a fraud who would put on elaborate spectacles and claim to heal people of their disabilities by working through Jesus. However it was painstakingly faked, and the people in wheelchairs were actually completely healthy. \n\nHowever, one day someone was brought up with a real disability, but when it came to the final event he was actually healed! The fraud couldn't face the fact that the miracle was real this time, that he'd actually cured someone. \n\nDoes anyone remember the name of this film? I'd really love to watch it again. leap of faith starring steve martin.  he was first a fake healer who by twist of fate turned out to be a faith healer. 8

is programming competency necessary for design competency? is programming competency necessary for design competency? Absolutely.  Design almost always involve a careful balance between simplicity for users of an abstraction and complexity for implementors.  To understand this tradeoff on both sides, you need to be a good programmer.\n\nWhile programming competency is a necessary condition for design competency, it's NOT sufficient.  Indeed, the most prodigious programmers are often the worse designers.  I have a hypothesis on this: the most prodigious programmers have the ability to keep huge numbers of details in their head AT THE SAME TIME.  These people don't need abstractions: they are able to see all the details at once.  These people often see abstractions as getting in the way.\n\nFor us mere mortals, abstractions are needed to help us mentally understand the whole in terms of its parts.  For people who NEED abstractions in this way are in a better position to produce them. 5

What do you think Angelina Jolie's Tattoo (on her belly) means to her? It reads..."quod me nutrit me destruit" it means, “what nourishes me also destroys me". I just wanted to see what others might perceive the interpretation as. Since she got it "pre-baby" I was thinking in terms of her "life"  Life nourishes us through experiences and relationship but every day that we live we are that much cloesr to death/destruction.\n \nOn a more literal note I was also thinking:  Her job financially provides for her nourishment (food, activities, materials items) but being an actress also destroys her in that it chip away at her being as she morphs into this 'thing' for tabloid fodder with each move she makes being braodcast around the world.  \n\nOK, so that was probably more of an answer than you were looking for. 8

Is there any equality in race, sex & how far have we actually come?  There is still many inequalities between race and sex especially in the less developed world. These is not a condemnation because such practices and believes have been ingrained in cultural practices and will be hard to eliminate. Most of the time abuses occur when people are poor and lack education, wifes and children are mistreated in patriarchal families for example very little pretext is needed if a female in Afghanistan and many middle eastern countries is accused by a male counterpart for being 'loose' which could be as little as staring at an unknown male. Certain extent it is even the families themselves that kills the lady for the sake of honor. Elsewhere women still fills most of the roles of servant with income earning and taking care of the household and have very little rights in the eyes of society much less the law. Racial violence is still a constant occurence, recent flares during the Sept 11 incident increased hatred and fear from the Muslim community and given undue prejudice for the work of several fundamentalists. However all is not too bleak, in many major countries where the standard of living is rising and barriers are being broken down, many equalities have been attained for the races and sex especially in the US. Yet for the world as a whole much is yet to be done. 1

Doesn't determination and stubborness mean the same thing? I think they do. It's odd how one is negative and the other positive. No they do not always mean the same thing.  Determination is striving for a goal even when it is difficult.  Stubborness can mean not accepting the truth.  One can be too stubborn to see the truth even when it is obvious, so being stubborn can be a form of spiritual blindness.  Determination is seeing the truth, acknowledging it, but deciding to overcome it anyway.  The two terms can mean the same thing, but stubborn can be positive or negative, determination is always seen as a positive.  By the way your critics will see as stubborn until you succeed.  Then they will praise your determination.  If we had lost the Revolutionary War we would be known as those stubborn colonials instead of those determined Americans. 4

What is "Critical Mass"?  Depends on the context in which you use it...\n\nGenerally it means:\n\nAn amount or level needed for a specific result or new action to occur:\n\nIn investing it means:\n\nThe size at which a business or market undergoes a fundamental change in regard to operations. An example of such a change is a company's achievement of increasing returns to scale. \n\nIn Physics\n\nThe smallest mass of a fissionable material that will sustain a nuclear chain reaction at a constant level. \n\nor\n\nThe amount of matter needed to generate sufficient gravitational force to halt the current expansion of the universe. 2

It is the cornerstone of one of the four corners of the religious construction. It can be recognized instantly due to its prominent surrounding silver band. 2

David Irving against the jews Terror !  how HOLOCAUST became A death line ? and why ?? YOU MAY NOT KNOW WHY AND HOW ..\n\nBUT \n\nYOU COULD HELP A FREE AND A GREAT MAN DEFEND HIS CAREER AND REPUTATION.\nYOU COULD HELP DEFEND FREEDOM AGAINST TERROR ..\n\nFROM HERE \n\nhttp://www.fpp.co.uk/Legal/Penguin/index.html David Irving is not only a great historian of the Nazis but a great Nazi historian.  He is probably the single best educated, best-informed and most careful reasearcher working to distort, invent and torture the truth on behalf of the Nazi cause.  I would trust him with the Nazi propaganda apparatus of any Nazi nation on earth (especially Germany circa 1943). \n\nShould Holocaust denial be a crime?  Should its statute of limitations be longer than 17 years?  I don't know.  But I'm sure the Nazi party will get him free just as soon as they return to power in Austria which should be, oh, never. 10
What sort of practical applications are there for knowing visual basic? Can you tell me what sorts of projects that people design in a real job? Visual Basic, or any programming language for that matter is extremely useful for a variety of uses.\n\nWhen I was starting off programming, I mostly wrote small utilities to make my, and my co-workers' jobs easier.  Early on, when I worked for a PC configuration company, I wrote a VB-based database application that used barcode scanners to track systems that went through the configuration center.  Prior to this, the process was done manually.  \n\nLater, as a desktop support tech, I wrote utilites to parse text files, backup common files when re-installing, or upgrading a user's PC, automatic virus updates on servers, etc.  Any manual data recording tasks (filling out forms, paper filing, etc.) can be enhanced, or replace by software.  Repetitive tasks can be replaced by automated utilities.  Even simple games to entertain during long stretches (like airplane flights) can be written (professional graphics not necessary). 5

What exactly is a hickup? Is there a way to prevent them?  Hiccups occur when a spasm contracts the diaphragm, a large sheet of muscle that separates the chest cavity from the abdominal cavity. This spasm causes an intake of breath that is suddenly stopped by the closure of the vocal cords (glottis). This closure causes the characteristic "hiccup" sound. A very full stomach can cause bouts of hiccups that go away on their own. Full stomach can be caused by: eating too much too fast, drinking too much alcohol, swallowing too much air, smoking, sudden change in stomach temperature, such as drinking a hot beverage and then a cold beverage, and emotional stress or excitement. Hiccups that last longer than 48 hours are called persistent hiccups. Hiccups that last longer than a month are called intractable hiccups.  Both persistent and intractable hiccups may be a sign of a more serious health problem and require an exam by a health professional. There really is no way to prevent them. 3

Where can I find out what my classic Gretsch hollow-body guitar is worth?  Usually music/guitar stores carry an instrument blue book. They usually give you a pretty good idea or starting point.

what's the best remedy for bad breath?  Best remedy is to visit your dentist. Possible treatments that the dentist will do is cleaning or the so called oral prophylaxis (to elimate calcular deposits which cause bad breath) then restoration or filling of decayed teeth. The dentist may also advise you to use a mouthwash. Any mouthwash available in the market will do. But personally, i prefer using Betadine Oral Antiseptic. Usually after these procedures you'll find an improvement. If after all these you still have bad breath it's best if you consult with a physician for a check up coz you may have an underlying disease which causes bad breath or HALITOSIS. 3

Where can I buy a star?  The place which advertises the most is the International Star Registry (linked below), but frankly you are better off spending your money on something else. The "name" that you give the star will not have any real legal or scientific meaning, so essentially you are paying a lot of money for just a slip of paper. \n\nNote this disclaimer from the small print on their site: "International Star Registry star naming is not recognized by the scientific community. \nYour star’s name is reserved in International Star Registry records only." In other words, they publish a book with the names that their customers have paid for, but frankly anyone could publish a book with any list of names in it. It has no real meaning.\n\nNaming stars is basically a scam. 2
HOW do you tell a guy you like him?

why is the Pacific Ocean so cold all the time? the atlantic ocean is so warm, and the other ocean, the PACIFIC, is so cold. why? In the southern half of the ocean the Humboldt Current flows north along the coast of South America. The cold mineral rich waters support many millions of small fish, which are eaten by larger fish and seabirds.\nAt regular intervals a huge area of the Pacific becomes warmer. Because warm water rises above cold, the sea-level increases. This change in temperature and level causes an alteration in the pattern of the winds. The warm water travels across the Pacific at 100 kms a day. This phenomenon, known as El Nino, deflects the Humboldt Current. 1997 saw the highest temperature recorded of this warm water during the last 150 years. 4
Why are people considered racist if they don't want illegal Mexicans in america even if they are ok withlegals People are often dubbed Racist if they support tougher immigration laws.If someone is angry at illegal Mexicans but ok with legal ones the are not racist.Lets face facts people at least 70% of illegal immigration comes from Mexico.Those who propose tougher border laws are not big bad bigots,they are patriots wishing to protect this country and its economy and security. What exactly is "handed off" to illegal immigrants?\nThe general assumption that illegal immigrants are here to take what's rightfully yours is as racist as it is ignorant.\nImmigrants (legal or not) come here looking for better opportunities and quality of life.\nIllegal immigrants are faced with hardships you couldn't understand unless you became one.  They are forced to work two and three different jobs making less than minimum wage and are taken advantage of because of their legal status.\nWhat's ironic is that they pay taxes just like you and me.\nSo... they work harder for less money and on top of that pay taxes that pay the salaries of those politicians so thirsty to kick them out of the country.\n\nGoing back to the original question; those that don't want illegal mexicans in this country are not racists.  They just find it hypocritical that a group of people braking the law (a federal one at that) are protected by some politicians just to gain popular acceptance.\n\nTo those of you that share the asker's opinion that illegal immigrants are a threat to "this country and its economy and security", I ask - how has illegal immigration affected you directly?  Did anybody get your dream job because they would do it for less money?  Did anybody get the low rent apartment you wanted?\n\n\n******  stoop_fer_lyfe ******\nI DO KNOW what I'm talking about.  I also live in a community riddled with illegal immigrants and am very close to many of them.\nWhat you fail to understand is that they buy new cars, buy houses or apartments and have credit cards - all things that need a credit report.  Banks have changed credit requirements to accommodate them because financial institutions are not immigration officers, they are in business to make money and are not braking any law by lending money to someone that can provide Income Tax Returns.  It may also be hard for you to believe that the government - regardless of the red flags it raises - accepts those Tax Returns and turns a blind eye to the migration legality of the issuer; again, the IRS is not responsible for policing immigration laws.\nMaybe you have never filed a tax return, but you don't need an employer to report and pay taxes for you.  You are then 'Self-Employed', and you don't necessarily need to report all your income since it can't be proved.\nIllegal immigrants know they can live very 'normal' lives as long as they don't break any laws other than immigration laws.\nIt seems to me you are the one that DOES NOT KNOW what you are talking about and are merely commenting on what is fed to you by alarmist media.\n\n**************\n\nI actually enjoy these friendly exchanges.\nI realized why we are talking about two different illegal immigrants.  You are talking about those that cross over illegally (sneak in the country) and I'm talking about those that came here on a visa (any kind) and overstayed.\nThe Social Security Administration used to provide SSN cards/numbers to people on temporary visas; they were stamped with a big 'Not for employment use'.  I don't have to tell you how easy those cards were to duplicate.  I even saw a used car salesman photocopy one, remove those words and photocopy again until he ended with a 'clean' copy before submitting the loan.\nOn the subject of taxes... during my college years I worked as a computer consultant, doing odd jobs that payed under $550 at a time, that way my 'employer' did not have to submit a 1099 for professional services.  I stayed under the radar and expensed every pencil, calculator, computer part, tool, etc. that I bought during those years.  Completely legal.\n\n**************\nDude... you had me at Hello.\nWell said.  I actually liked your latest update better; it didn't show a lingering anger.\nIn the words of Judge Chamberlain Haller (the late Fred Gwynne) in My Cousin Vinny; “that is a lucid, intelligent,  10

Why do you think the USA is so preoccupied with other countries problems when there are so many here? Problems such as homelessness,poverty, non-affordable housing, a lack of proper healthcare for all, racism, adult-illiteracy, etc. plague our society. Yet the "all mighty George W. is obsessed with war. Why? Because he's an idiot who has rich friends who profit from wars. We should impeach the moron. Do you remember what Clinton always said. Are you doing better now since I took office or worse. You won't hear George W say that. JFK said ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country you .... sure wasn't heard in New Orleans except we heard give me give me give me 10
Why don't people seem to be able to carry on civil conversations about politics? Everyone has their own views.  You aren't going to change someone's mind about their view on politics.  It is what it is.  So why don't people undertand that?  Why can't they listen to your views and you to their's and agree to disagree?  This is especially frustrating when the person arguing with you has no idea what they are talking about, and are arguing based on incorrect facts.  You might say "Just don't talk to them about it", but that doesn't always work.  For example:  I was talking to a coworker about George Bush today and another person butts in on my conversation and starts arguing with me.  I didn't ask for their opinion.  Why can't people butt out or agree to disagree? Its very simple, political beliefs are just like other beliefs, most of them are learned from parents, friends, and peers.  Many people don't even understand all of the facts surrounding and issue before forming an opinion on it.  In most cases becoming fully informed would take too much time.  Politics, like religion, become a core to our identities, and people feel that an attack on their political beliefs is an attack on themselves.  Its easy to become defensive when this happens. 10

Why do people fear dentists so much?  I hate dentists.  I hate needles.  I hate the smell of a dentists office.  Im not a hateful person either.  I think people hate dentists so much is because when they go in there, they anticipate pain.  Most only go to the dentist when something is really wrong so that scares them more.  The list goes on and on.  Thankfully my dentist saw all this in me and fully explains what she is going to do before I am even in the chair.  Now I actually like going to her which is a first for me.  But I still hate needles.  lol 1

can yoga make you taller? No joke, I swear I have grown about an inch since I started practicing yoga.  And I'm well beyond the age where I should still be growing. Yes, any exercise that can loosen muscles helps to prevent "shrinking" and may even promote growth.  Shrinkage can be caused by compacted cartilage and/or gravity. If your muscles are tense it aides gravity in compacting your spine and joints. By stretching (doing yoga) your spine, joints, and muscles are relaxed and does not compact your body and may allow your body to expand. This is the same reason why you are taller in the morning than in the evening. When you are lying down gravity is not impacting you body in the same way as when you are standing, your relaxed body is allowed to expand. 6

Don’t you find it weird we teach our kids: scrub a dub dub, three men in a tub?  Now that you mention it I do find it a little odd, but then again most of our nursery rhymes and fairy tales are pretty grim and creepy. Take for instance....\n                        Ring around the Rosies\n                        Pocket fill of posies\n                        Ashes. Ashes. We all fall down.\n\nThis rhyme supposedly refers to the scarlette fever,and other fatal diseases of the time. When people where sick and starting to smell of decay and sickness they put the flower petals in their pockets to mask the stinch. Then of course you die and turn to ash. Wonderful nursery rhyme for children, huh? 4

Why is it called a "fungo" bat?  The thin light bat allows you to better control when hitting pop-ups/grounders to individual players.

My first wedding anniversary is approaching in April.  What should I get for my wife?  Something "paper"??? I've heard that the first anniversary is "paper", but what does that mean? don't go by that. (the paper thing that is) The best gifts I've gotten from my husband are from his heart, something he takes the time to prepare himself, that is unique. Buy her a single rose, go with yellow because everyone gets red or pink, and write her a poem or letter telling you why you love her and what she means to you, actually write it yourself, don't do it on the pc!, then cook her her favorite meal. Give her the rose and your letter or poem at dinner. That will mean more to her than any store bought item, I guarantee it! Good luck, and happy anniversary! 9
muscle sorness? i heard from a basketball coach once that if you take a bath and put asprin caplets in the water it will help reduce soreness the next morning. is it true? Forget the aspirin tablets! Take a mineral salt bath! Better yet take a bath with a 1/2 cup baking soda and 1/2 cup sea salt.(available at health food stores or the health section of your local grocer.)You can find an array of pre-mixed bath salts to ease sore muscles. Don't forget about meditating and breathing deep to re-oxiginate muscles. Most important drink all your daily 8 glasses of h20 a day! Namaste. 3

How can you have sell out crowds in the same staduim but yet attandence is always different?  Sellout reflects that all the tickets have been sold.  Attendance in the NFL is actual bodies at the stadium. . some people may have a ticket and not shown up.\n\nMajor League Baseball (at least the National League) used to use a turnstile count (bodies).  Now their "attendance" is up by using tickets sold instead. 6
China and India will be the richest nations by 2035 followed by united sates and United Kingdom.? What do you think about this? Unlikely, because as these two countries become more industrialized the growing strain on workd esources will snap and send us into a nasty depression. \n\n  The price of steel is astronomical right now, making it difficult on the oil companies, pushing up the price of oil. With all of the new construction in India and China, what other possible outcome is there? Perhaps a world war to stay off global starvation? 1
what is an exciter do in A.C. generators ?  The exciter is used to provide current for the electromagnets in the rotor.

how to file late payments on someone's credit report.? have tenants almost 3mths behind and would like to file deliquent payments on their credit report. A person is not able to place information on payment history on another person's credit report unless they are a business or corporation of some sort.  This is because to be able to report information on a credit report you must subscribe to the credit bureau to be able to do so, and the fee for subscription is costly.  If you are a landlord for a few houses then you are better off evicting the tenants and then placing their unpaid rent to a collection agency.  The collection agency would be able to place the information about the past due rent on the tenants credit report for you, plus attempt to get the money back to you for the unpaid rent. 7

What causes a charlie horse in your leg to last over a month and a half?  Two things come to mind, nerve damage or poor blood circulation due to damaged, clogged or clotted viens and or arteries.  I get charlie horses in my legs periodically when I am sleeping due to nerve damage from having disc surgery over 30 years ago.  I would say however that something lasting for a month and a half requires medical attention as soon as possible.  A blood clot in your leg can move to your heart or lungs and possibly become fatal.  Please see a doctor soon. 3

what is the main cause why computer gets a virus?  As the other responders suggest, people don't practice safe computing.  Anti-virus, anti-spyware, firewall...all good and necessary.\n\nStill, most of us think that if we have the software (or hardware) protecting us, then we must be completely safe and we can go happily on our merry way.  I assure you, this is a false sense of security.  Do not trust the hardware or software to do the whole job for you.\n\nI believe the primary reason why computers get a virus is a lack of common sense.  To wit...\n- Be skeptical of anything you receive in e-mail that was not solicited, especially if it has an attachment.\n- Think twice before downloading that freeware.\n- Avoid Kazaa and the like.\n- Do review website certificates to satisfy yourself that the site you're heading for is really the site you wanted to go to.\n- Make sure you download and install every security patch your OS vendor provides.  You should manually review your vendor at least weekly...even if you have an automatic update feature.\n\nA few minutes spent on satisfying yourself that you've done everything you can do will provide you with peace of mind. 5

Is actively trying to convert another justified? I'm not picking on Christians, because i know Islam tries to convert as well...but why does someone have to come to my door every month to tell me about Christianity and how I will burn in hell unless I convert? Why can't we be more tolerant? For example, Hindus and Buddhists have become major religions, not through conversion but through the strength of their teachings. I'm a Hindu and i was just wondering.... They do that because it is one of the doctrines in their faith... "to go and spread the word (good news)". Which they take to mean as "tell everyone about Christianity". 1

Sphere vs: Disk? Which gets to the bottom of a hill first, a sphere or a disk? If you assume that the sphere and the disk have the same mass and radius, the sphere wins.\n\nYou have to work out the acceleration of the two objects taking in to account the difference in their rotational inertia.\n\nThe short answer is that more of the mass of the sphere is closer to the axis of rotation than is the case with the disk (a short cylinder).\n\nFor a solid sphere, I=(2MR^2)/5, for a disk I = (MR^2)/2. If you have a unit mass and a unit radius, the ratio is 2/5:1/2. 2
When did people start calling each other "dude"?  The original meaning of this American-born word is still its first definition today, 'a man excessively concerned with his clothes, grooming and manners'. I thought that dude was an old word, but I thought wrong. I guess it's because the word sounds vaguely like duke, and all those titles of royalty are fairly ancient. But dude first appeared in print in 1878. The Random House Historical Dictionary of American Slang cites an 1877 reference in a letter--not published, however, until 1988--from the painter and sculptor Frederick Remington: "Don't send me any more [drawings of] women or any more dudes." By 1883, dude was in wider circulation. In June of that year, its popularity was noted by Massachusetts’ North Adams Transcript: "The new coined word 'dude'...has travelled over the country with a great deal of rapidity since but two months ago it grew into general use in New York." By 1885, it had established a strong enough foothold to appear in Ulysses S. Grant's Personal Memoirs: "Before the car I was in had started, a dapper little fellow--he would be called a dude at this day--stepped in."\n\nFairly soon, a dude came to mean an Easterner or a city slicker, and especially someone who vacations on a ranch--thus dude ranch.\n\nDude also spawned quite a few odd derivatives, such as dudedom, dudeness, dudery, dudism, dudish, dudess and dudine--the last two meaning 'female dudes'. None of these is in general use today. I thought dudess might have had a revival as part of the surfer culture; however, Malia Alani of Surfer Magazine said no. She e-mailed me that "I don't think there is a feminine word for dude. A traditional Hawaiian word used commonly for women surfers is wahine." (Note: following the appearance of the column, several readers have informed me that dudette is the feminine form of dude. A quick search of Nexis confirms the word is, in fact, current. Thanks, everyone.)\n\nThe meaning of the word as 'a male person' has been in wide use since the 1960's. This is from a 1968 book called College Drug Scene: "And I got into symbolic logic and semantics with a cat who had studied with Korzybski and electronics from a dude who had an Associate of Arts degree in anthropology from 1941." The use of dude in direct address to a male began much earlier. This is from a 1945 book called Silversides: "Hey, dude, there's a ship out here!"\n\nThe origin of dude is uncertain. There are a few speculations, the most interesting of which, to my mind, is from A Dictionary of Slang by Eric Partridge. He says that it may have come from the word dud--which, at the time, meant 'a delicate weakling'--"influenced by attitude." 1

"Cute as a button?" Is that supposed to be a compliment? Since when are buttons cute? Hmm? Well, check it out at Answers.com:\n"Also, cute as a bug's ear. Pretty or attractive in a dainty way, as in That baby is cute as a button. Cute originally was a shortening of acute, for “sharp-witted and clever,” but in the early 1800s it also took on its current meaning. Other than that buttons and bug's hearing organs can be small, there is no good explanation for these similes" 1
who invented sudoku?  The puzzle was designed by Howard Garns, a retired architect and freelance puzzle constructor, and first published in 1979. Most likely inspired by the Latin square invention of Leonhard Euler, Garns added a third dimension (the regional restriction) to the mathematical construct and (unlike Euler) presented the creation as a puzzle, providing a partially-completed grid and requiring the solver to fill in the rest. The puzzle was first published in New York by the specialist puzzle publisher Dell Magazines in its magazine Dell Pencil Puzzles and Word Games, under the title Number Place (which we can only assume Garns named it).\n\nIt was popularized by Nikoli in Japan, who gave it the current name of "Sudoku. 4
What forces in the external enviornment would you believe to have the greatest potential impact on my success? I have examined several different aspects of my startup business.  What forces in the external enviornment (competition, political/legal, economic, social/cultural, and technological) would you believe to have the greatest potential impact on my sucess? Why? Depending on which industry you are in, legal and regulatory risks can have a major impact on your success or failure.  For example, with identity theft cases increasing, states are enacting new laws that force businesses to dislose information security breaches that affect customers' personal information, or else face stiff penalties.  With more companies becoming "information-based", I think this is a risk that most businesses need to understand. 7

What is a great natural small venue for an elopement - just bride, groom, minister and witnesses? Want to get married in Seattle on August 27 while we are vacationing there. We want to just have us (he's 47, I'm 39) an officiant and required witnesses, in some natural setting. I've looked at several venues, but they are all for actual weddings with guests, caterers, etc. All I want is photographer to take some pics, a great bouquet and place to go after for dinner/dancing/partying. Any suggestions? We are outdoorsy, artsy, not formal, dress and rings are vintage, prefer natural/historical/unusual setting to make it memorable and seems like we shouldn't have to pay to rent a venue as we have no guests. Suggestions/comments welcome! What about a bed and breakfast? If you are staying there while vacationing than I would see no reason for them to say no. It would probably be good for business too, if you gave them a picture to use in a brochure. Or you could try a Seattle park, I'm not sure about the fees, since it is such a small wedding, you might not even need a permit. Calling the scheduling office couldn't hurt. Hope it helps. Good Luck. 9
Is my fav. player, Chris Webber a Hall of Famer?  Sorry Nancy but the answer is no. Webber has HOF talent but injuries and other issues have led him to an inconsistent career. Looking at his stats he's NEVER played an entire 82 games on the schedule. This is why Gary Payton will make it, yet Webber won't. 6

How keygen is created?  If you are referring to key generators that create valid "keys" for unlocking copy-protected applications, then the following would apply to your question:\n\nTypically a person with knowledge of assembly language and the use of a debugger would examine the behavior of a running application using a valid key and watch how the application responds.  The same process would usually be done with an invalid key in order to determine the other path the application would take.\n\nThe individual would then examine the steps that are used to validate the key and reverse engineer the algorithm so that keys with different values would be processed by the algorithm and considered by the application to be 'good' when it is validated.\n\nSometimes the algorithm itself is duplicated in the application which generates the keys and keys are then randomly or sequentially generated and tested with the algorithm to see if it takes the code path of a 'good' key or a 'bad' key.  Only those considered good keys are then presented as valid.\n\nThis process is typically known as 'cracking' and is generally frowned upon by commercial application publishers, as it is considered a violation of most commercial software licenses (reverse engineering) and allows other people to use their products without paying for them. 5

In the rock band W.A.S.P. What exactly does the phrase white anglo saxon protestant really means?  I don't know about the band, but here's what the phrase means.\nWhite: Caucasian ethnicity. Pale skin color.\nAnglo-Saxon: Of English descent.\nProtestant: Member of a Protestant (non-Catholic Christian) church.\n\nCalling people WASPs also usually implies that they're rich or middle-class and that they're uptight and snobbish. It can also imply that they're racist or prejudiced. It's generally considered a derogatory term. 8
Women & Chin Hairs -- is it common? I'm 31 and fair skinned.  In the last few years, I've discovered about 10 "thicker" dark chin and jawline hairs -- I pluck them religiously, but it kinda freaks me out.  I'm otherwise fairly non-hairy (i.e. upper lip and arms are just fine).  Is this chin-hair thing common?  If you are a woman -- do you have chin hair? How many? At what age?  Please answer even if you have never had a chin hair in your life -- I'm trying to guage if this is common enough that I shouldn't freak out. yes it's common... chin hair growth usually starts around perimenopause when a woman's hormone levels are starting to go through yet another change. during this time, estrogen levels start to wane, leaving more testosterone to run wild, creating such things as coarse, dark hair on a woman's chin. click on link by source to read more about it... good luck! 3
What is the most progressive and liveable country in the world? For a senior software engineer/architect with a family looking to move to a country with reasonable job outlook and progressive (i.e. left wing politics). The U.S. is definitely NOT a liberal country! As a matter of fact 'liberal' is pretty much a swear-word these days. So, please forget all the patriotic opinionating of the previous posts. \n\nCanada is fairly liberal (at least in comparison to the U.S.), even with their newly elected conservative government, and there are decent jobs available. It's pretty easy to get an immigration visa, too - we just got ours last summer:)\n\nOther than that I would go with the Scandinavian countries or the Netherlands. All of which are on the left politically and have a high standards of living. I believe Norway has repeatedly been awarded as most desirable country to live in by the U.N. (don't quote me on that one though).\n\nFor a liberal the U.S. is definitely one of the least desirable places to live in, unless you move to San Francisco:) 10

The average national first time pass rate for the Bar Exam is? ..78%. Is that a good thing. Is there any reason why a larger percentage would not pass the first time? That's a really high national pass rate. Are you sure that % is right? In California, the pass rate is usually a little below 50%. So 78% is a great thing and means you have a good chance of passing as long as you do the basic studying and treat Bar exam studying as a full time job. It can't get much higher than 78% pass rate. That figure makes it seem like the Bar is too easy, at least when you compare it to California's Bar. 4
What is ready to vanish in Hebrews 8:13, and shall vanish in 1Corinthians 13:8? Mirror thing, about 13:8 and 8:13?\nAt a mirror, Your 'right' is Their 'left'.\n"Their part" vs "Your part" ever resolved?\n"Contrary part": their 'left' is your 'right'.\nSo, "turn away", for "their part" to "vanish"?\nMerlin movie: real magic at end, re-formation?\n\n2Timothy 3:5 "from such turn away"\nSuch: having form-ation, but not re-formation. Hebrews 8:13 In speaking of an old covenant which is to vanish, that is the covenat he had mad with the israelites,he now makes a new covenant, the first one is now obsolete. And what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away.\n\n1Corinthians 13:8 looked forward to the perfect word of God, after which time prophecies, tongues, and words of nowledge would pass away. 1
when sexing I can take less than half a minute for the first ejaculation.how can I avoid that for the enjoy?  I am not a man, so the best thing I can tell you is this.  If you want to go longer without using some gadget to help you.  When you feel that orgasim coming on, pull out better yet make love for just a little bit then stop.  Notice her breast and neck?  pay close attention to it. Kiss her neck and suck on her breast. Do this over and over until she tells you that she is ready for you to come back inside. When both of you are in the heat of the moment, more than likely you will both come at the same time and pleasure will be for you both. 9

how do i meet chicks?  First off, most girls do NOT like being referred to as Chicks.Other than that, meeting women involves risk and alot of trial and error. Get out more! Go to where girls/women are likely to be and always ask your friends if they know female friends who would like to meet someone.Saying Hi to a random girl is a good way to start a conversation. Avoid pickup lines, fancy outfits, and bar scenes and just be yourself. Being confident about yourself and curious about other people is very appealing to most women(at least in my experience). Don't see rejection for a date as failure, simply move on and accept advice from your rejector if she gives you any. 9

If tides are caused by the pull of moon and sun, how come there are tides on the opposite side of the earth?  So the tides are caused by the graviational pull of the sun and the moon.  The moon is a lot closer, so it's pull is much stronger (even though it's the smaller body) and the position of the sun relative to the moon determines how big the difference between high and low tide is (it's bigger when they're lined up).  The moon pulls all the water on the Earth towards it (actually it pulls on everything, but because water is fluid it's the only thing that moves noticeably in response).  So the there's more water on one side of the Earth than the other, so one side has high tide because there's a whole bunch of extra water over there, and the other side has low tide because of all that water that was pulled to the other side.  As the Earth rotates, a different part will be closest to the Moon and the bulge of water will shift.\n\nThe actual mechanics of tides are a bit more complicated than that (I didn't account for the effect of the Earth's rotation, among other things), but that's the general principle that allows there to be tides on both sides. 2

what are your thoughts on space exploration? should we spend billions to go to space, or should we use that money to fight wars and wipe ourselves of the face of the earth (i know the money can be used for better things, but for arguement sake...)\n\nshould we come to together as a human race, one people and explore this huge space around us, pushing our civilazation, thought process, philosophies, ideologies (but to name a few) to the very edge of space as we know it, helping us evolve once again as a people or should we be content with earth, continually fighting over natural reources that if managed well might be enuf to go around \n\nlets discuss I say we spend billions in space.  Here is my reasoning, "Idle hands are the devils playthings", and if we're not doing constructive we're going to do something terribly stupid like blow ourselves off the face of the earth.\nSecondly, the survival of the human race depends on reaching out to space and colonizing other planets.  Whether it can be done or not is another question, but waiting for ourlseves to blow ourselves to kingdom come isn't a option I'm interested in taking.  As for evolving, thats entirely correct, because if we push out to somewhere new we can leave behind the things that we could never get over at home (like trivial matters of me being black or you being white, etc).  Some humans just wont let things go foward, and if thats the case why not leave them behind?  Its what America was about when it started, except there isn't anywhere else to go except up now days.  Otherwise we're just recycling ourselves on this planet, with one government falling so another can rise up which thinks its infallable.  Still, despite all that, we've got to be practical about space travel instead of believing we'll get there in 10 to 20 years.  Just because it wont have for us isn't a reason not to do it either, making others miserable just because your miserable is no way to go through life, even if the people your making miserable are five generations down the line. 2

getting hits from a search engine?  Long answer short : Follow three steps :\n\n(1) Put good content on your site\n(2) Register it to search engines\n(3) Convince other sites to link more.\n\nExplaination :\n\nI could have gone on lenght on answering your query.  At the first part, one need's to understand the meaning of page rank. You can study a detailed article on it at http://www.webworkshop.net/pagerank.html\n\nIn short, here's an example. There's an election and several candidates have stood up. Its natural that the guy with the most votes wins. Analogously, whenever a external page links to your website, it casts a vote for your website. So, when you search for a relevant keyword for your pages, the results come as per the no of links that you have collected.\n\nTo get more links, you can ask some of your friends who have website to put link to your website. The more the links, the higher is your rank in google results. An alternative is to start your own blog on 3-4 websites, and in each blog, put a link to your website. Indeed, if your site has quality content, mpressed visitors start linking you, specially the blogging community.\n\nAnother important part is that who links you. For example, if you get a link from a website which already has a high page rank, you automatically get a better rank. For example, if you get a link from microsoft.com or cnet.com, which have a highest page ranks, your rank shoots up automatically.\n\nGoogle rank is composed of many other factors, but the only factor it misses out is the popularity by visitors who go to the links directly. Yahoo does a good job by keeping that into account. If you carefully see the link that are seen in the Yahoo search results, a similar vote is also casted by clicking on the link in the search results. It could be possible that your website has huge no. of visitors who come through searches, but small number of links. Then its Yahoo rank would be high (more accurate), but google rank would be low. There have been many such interesting cases, so don't just consider google as your only target. Why google does not keep this 'click popularity' feature is because it takes a certain delay of time( for registering of vote on Yahoo and forwarding to the actual link), which Google does not want to take.\n\nThings You Should Never Do In Life:\nNever try to promote your site commercially from spamsters. Some of their sites are banned from google database. And if they give a link to your website, your page rank drops down drastically, and even might get removed from the search results. Also, do not link to their websites.\n\nThis is the solution to crux of your problem. You can read further on such search engine optimizations at the following sites :\nhttp://wolfram.org/writing/howto/3.html\nhttp://www.ssw.com.au/SSW/Standards/Rules/RulestoBetterGoogleRankings.aspx\nhttp://www.netmechanic.com/news/vol3/promo_no16.htm\nhttp://us.ecademy.com/node.php?id=58077\nhttp://www.paramountwebmasters.com/improve_my_rankings_on_google.php\nhttp://www.graphic-design.com/Web/increase_rank.html 5

Does anybody know why The Apprentice doesn't air on CNBC in Canada? Why doesn't The Apprentice 4 and The Apprentice: Martha Stewart air on CNBC in Canada when they are scheduled on their lineup? This really doesn't make sense, since other shows, like Everybody Loves Raymond that airs on The Comedy Network (Canada) and TBS (US), can air on other stations, but not The Apprentice show. This is much different than the Olympics (which CNBC and MSNBC cannot air in Canada) because this is a network show, not a sporting event. Can anybody explain what is going on here? you guys are lucky, id rather not watch it 8
Proper amout of time? What is the proper amount of time to hold on the phone before hanging up? Gauge it based on who exactly you're talking to.\n\n1. If you get a call from a recorded voice saying "I have an important call for you...please hold.", that's grounds for an immediate hang-up.\n\n2. If it's a legitimate business that called you and you want to speak with them and they put you on hold, I'd wait no more than 5 minutes on hold.\n\n3. If it's a business you called and they put you on hold, wait as long as is appropriate given the importance of the call.  For example, if you're doing a phone interview for a job, I would not hang up.\n\n4. A personal call from a friend or relative warrants no hang-up at all. 1

20/20 Stupid in America? Do you believe it to be true? Looking for opinions of those who saw 20/20 Friday saying that American kids are way behind the rest of the world. And that money won't solve the problem it's the unions and systems fault for letting bad teachers stay on. Personally I'm convinced and want to open up a private school now. Any thoughts? Is America's educational system poor?  Yes.\n\nIs it the fault of the teachers' unions? No.\n\nThere are a lot of factors taht come into play, but a recent study that was down shows that all attempts by states to ensure teacher quality (e.g. requiring degrees, tests, etc.) actually correspond to DOWNWARD trends in student performance. 4

I don't have custody of my 15 year old son. How can I stop my EX from moving him out of state?  Most of the time they can move out of state for a job. Most of the time they have to prove the work part. This only applies when you have vistiation rights and are paying child support. The move must be work related. We just can't pick up and move because we feel like it. There are so many options and all states have different rules. I would always seek legal advice concerning these matters. The legal world is where you will find the best answer. 10
does handphone emmits radioactive rays?  No they donot.\n\nUsing headphones at a sufficiently high volume level causes temporary or permanent hearing impairment or deafness. Other risks arise from the reduced awareness of external sounds — some jurisdictions regulate the use of headphones while driving vehicles. Also, most European countries have imposed high penalties since 2002 on drivers not using a headset while operating a mobile phone in a car, to ensure that drivers keep their hands on the vehicle's controls.\n\nusing them for a long time might cause bacterial growth in the ears 7

how can u be sure if he likes u back??? help Girls have a tendency to just "know" when a guy likes her...but the major signs are: acting or saying goofy things, lookin' down at their feet, acting embarrased, fidgeting, constantly staring at you but looking away in embarrasement when you catch them.  They also tend to have a sparkle or lust in their eyes.  They may ask your girlfriends questions about you to learn what you like, don't like and if you're single or not. \n\n-Also a side note (hopefully you're okay receiving this info)-  What I've learned is that if you want a guy to approach you, then you gotta make and keep the eye contact, smile and tilt your head a little to the side (as if embarrased).  Maybe play w/your hair a little bit.  But if you keep a stiff face, posture and no smile...he'll think you're not interested, maybe a snob or just plain mean.  Men have fragile egos...they need to know that we won't chew them up and spit them out.  \n\nHope this helps....good luck. 9
Suggestions for staying awake in the afternoon? I get very sleepy in the afternoon, about an hour after lunch. Any suggestions for staying awake without using caffeine? Getting up and walking around helps a lot.  Drink some water.  Find a diversion that can keep you engaged for a minute or so when you get sleepy.  Sometimes when I get really tired in the afternoon I do math problems in my head or try to remember arcane facts about cars.  Q&A is also a good way to keep your mind alert... 3

what are the chemical reactions?  GO to wikipedia.com and type in chemical reaction.  That is kind of a tough definition, so I will help to break it down a little for you.  Basically, you got something, and it changes into a whole new a different thing.  That is a chemical reaction.  It could be 2 things coming together to make 1 thing, or vice versa.  Or two things could lead to 2 new things.  The most important part of a chemical reaction is that substances change to NEW substances that have serperate properties and characteristics from the original.\nOn wikipedia there is a link to an IUPAC definition.  IUPAC is pretty much in charge of defining stuff in chemistry, so their definition is the one you're looking for, however, it might be a little complicated.  If this didn't help, maybe you should repost your question. 4
Will Iraq be the next Vietnam? Can the allies expect to win this war when they have failed to win the hearts and minds of the civillians of iraq and the muslim world?? they only have to win the "hearts and minds" of the Sunnis now, the Shittes and Kurds are peaceful, so far all of the bombings occour in the Sunni area (they account for 20% of Iraq's population) the US is also planning to withdraw 50,000 soldiers by the end of next year since the new government is in place and some Iraqi security forces have been trained.\n\nThere is no clearly defined victory in this case, we could (techinically) declare victory and leave but if we did that Iraq would be left in a state of turmoil which would hit the popularity level of the US more than if we stayed. The only way out is to get the people over there to work togeather, then we can leave them alone(until they start killing again).\n\nIraq cannot be compared to Vietnam since Vietnam had a clearly defined enemy that was clearly being defeated when media images of death and destruction reached the US. When we left all that was left defending Vietnam was a 1 million strong South Vietnamnese military(although corrupt could have won the war with US support within a month of the first US withdrawals) We in essensce abandoned South Vietnam when North Vietnam forces were weak and gave the communists enough time to recuperate and finally take down the corrupt South Vietnamnese military.\n\nPeople have no confidence in the US military, although the Generals did not have everything they wanted going into this war we can still bring "victory" this war isnt something we can pull out from easily because no matter what we do there are adverse effects. Although it wasnt very smart to fight in the first place, we are forced to go through with it. 10

Groups... How do you get tech support to help??? I can't get the Yahoo "Help" desk (what a misnomer) to help me... heck, I don't even know how to contact them anymore!  Therefore, although I realize this is not the tech support dept, I'm resorting to any means of contact I can... I hate Yahoo's new help system.\n\n(01/17/06, 4:45pm cst)  I can't access Yahoo GROUPS... I've been getting a "The page cannot be displayed" error message since yesterday. I've not made ANY changes to my pc nor my internet connection, and I'm able to access other Yahoo sites (mail, etc) so I'm assuming the groups server is down. I've tried reporting the problem to Yahoo, but they've changed their helpdesk access and now submitting a specific question to a REAL PERSON is nearly impossible (grrr!), so I have no idea if my complaint went through or if they are aware of the problem at all. *sigh* Working just fine from here.\nIf it's a particular group that you can't access, Y may have shut it down (for reasons that are often hard to fathom)\nIf it's the whole groups front-end (groups.yahoo.com), then the problem may be local to you...  try flushing the cache on your browser, in case there's been a problem or change that got cached. 5

Where do i look to see what kind of video card my pc has and how do I know how good it is? My friend has a dell computer that he bought last year.  For the upcoming Christmas season he wanted to know if he had a good enough video card to play any of the new video games.  I would like to know if his is good enough to do so. Assuming he has windows XP, Rick click on a blank area of the desktop and select Properties from the menu. in the window that opens find the tab on the top called settings, it is the leftmost tab. In this section click the button called advanced,in the resulting window click the tab at the top called Adapter. The information is about your video card, Chip Type will tell you who made the chipset of the card and what type it is, Memory size is also listed. To know if it is sufficient for your games read the information supplied with the game, if the memory on your card is lower that whaqt the game recommends it is probably insufficient. If you cant figure it out from there write the information down and take it to your local computer shop or best buy and consult one of their representatives, typically they will be able to assist you, although they will usually attempt to sell you the most expensive high end card they have if you talk to them they will usually in the end make a reasonable recommednation on what you need. 5

When she was older I liked to tell embarrasing stories about when she was little to her boyfriends. We are close, but as I say we like to give each other a hard time. It wasn't to try to steal the boyfriend away. 7
what is the calculation to determine market share of a company. (or market price)?  market share is how much a company takes in per dollar spent on a specific industry.  So, if Dunkin Donut's market share is 77% of the market, that means that out of every dollar spent on coffee, 77 cents belongs to Dunkin Donuts. 7
What colors can a flame have?  no it cant be black unless it is producing an extremely incomplete combustion but here is what you can do to color a flame through the use of chemical compounds/elements:\nRED FLAME=lithium (CAUTION PRODUCES STONG REACTION WITH WATER) , strontium chloride, or calcium carbonate\nYELLOW FLAME=sodium(CAUTION PRODUCES STONG REACTION WITH WATER)\nWHITE=zincwill produce a slightly greenish white flame(CAUTION PRODUCES TOXIC FUMES)\nGREEN=anything with copper except for its salts or phosphates when moistened with undilluted sulphuric acid(CAUTION PRODUCES TOXIC FUMES), antimony or barium\nBLUE=arsenic(CAUTION TOXIC), lead(CAUTION TOXIC), selenium(CAUTION TOXIC), or bismuth(CAUTION TOXIC), one nontoxic compound is antimony or ammonium compounds if done in a well ventilates place.\nPURPLE=Potassium(CAUTION REACTS STRONGLY WITH WATER) except for borates, phosphates and silicates,or mix of strontium and copper\nAs noted some of thes produce toxic fumes or are toxic themselves so be careful 2

What is the process of the Milling Operation for a mine in canada for any type of product; gold, copper, etc.? Information is strictly on the Milling Operation(Concentrator).  Any other information is not applicable.  The mine can be Open Pit or Underground. There is an explanation for many mines in Canada at this website: http://www.mining-technology.com/projects/#North_America\n\nAn example from the Campbell Gold Mine in Ontario:\nThe run-of-mine ore is crushed in the mine and lifted out, re-crushed to less than 10 mm size and ground by a rod mill, ball mill, and cyclone mill series. They then use a gravity separation using Knelson concentrators. Shaking tables then separate much of the sulphides from free gold, and then a flotation process is used before autoclaving. The resulting solids are treated to convert sulphides and arsenic. It is then neutralized with lime and leached in an eight stage cyanide process. Finally a zinc precipitation sytem is used to recover the gold and it is refined on site. There are more details on the website. 4
If reincarnation is not true.....then how come some people relate themselves with their past lives? There have been many instances where young boys and girls have told all about their past lives.like where they used to live.what their names were and the people they knew....What explaination can be given for this kind of illusive behaviour? Young people are exposed to a great deal of information, thanks to television, radio and the overall level of our society's common culture.  Also, being human beings -- a creature marked by its ability to synthesize new ideas from existing knowledge -- they are then able to frabricate new information (and stories) with their limited knowledge of 'the past'.  Add this to a human's ability to logically sequence together disjointed information (aka 'fill in the gaps') and you've got yourself a past life.  Not to mention reincarnation doesn't make much practical sense.   For one thing, there has never been 6 billion people, so where are all of these 'souls' coming from? Even if there were reincarnation, several billion of them would have just been floating around aimlessly for a great deal of time. 1
define "torts".?  A tort is a breach of an agreement that was entered into involuntarily.\nFor example, if your dog bites your neighbor, you never had an express contract that your dog would not bite her, but you are still responsible if the dog does.  That would be a tort.\n\nAmerican Heritage Dictionary says:\n"injury, or a wrongful act done willfully, negligently, or in circumstances involving strict liability, but not involving breach of contract, for which a civil suit can be brought" 10
How do you trust someone after they've lied to you? My boyfriend of a 1 1/2 years has this "friend" that lives in Poland. He used to live in Germany and had a sexual relationship with this girl while he was there and it continued on up until we got together.  I had been told that they were just friends and nothing more was wanted from either one of them. I just recently discovered that wasn't true. He flew her down here to see him right after we first started dating. Even though we weren't "exclusive", he told me he wasn't seeing anyone else.  They slept together during that time as well.  He was also sleeping with me! We broke up shortly after that for a few months and during that time he flew her out here again. Shortly after she went back home we got back together and have been together since. (1 yr)  He told me he stopped talking to her. I just found out that they've still been talking, she's actually in love with him, and she had been trying to convince him to dump me. He's NOW ended it with her. How do I trust him now? It hurts!!! 1) He lied to you more than once.\n\n2) He is stringing along two women.\n\nThere is an old saying that goes, \n\n"Fool me once, shame on you.\nFool me twice, shame on me."\n\nLove is hard, but it becomes even harder when sex clouds your judgement. Only you can really know what is best for you. If it were me, I would let him go. Obviously he needs to get something out of his system. WHile he is doing so though, he is also putting you at risk for a broken heart and possibly an STD. Perhaps he needs to see what life would be like without you. I would not exactly be sitting by the phone while he took the time to find out what he wanted out of life either. It is true, maybe now he is ready to change. On the flip, he could also be trying to see how far he can really go with both of you. If both of you keep giving in, he can always have his cake and eat it too.\n\n"If you love something, let it go.\nIf it comes back to you, it is yours forever.\nIf it doesn't, it was never yours to begin with . . ."\n\nJust something to think about . . . 9

Do you know a good surgeon for adult male circumcision (San Francisco Bay Area)?  I would advise you to think twice about doing this. I was circumcised as an adult and regret my decision very much. Your sexual experiences will be greatly degraded. Mine were, and my circumcision was done quite perfectly.\n\nThere might be good reasons to be circumcised - but consider the need carefully. Remember, the number one reason it is done is to reduce (a word that is censored on these discussion boards, but that means pleasuring oneself), i.e. physical pleasure. Check out the link. 3
Describe the ideal woman.? (please state also if you are male or female and your age) I am female.  I say the perfect woman is one who bases her happiness on herself and does not depend on others to measure her worth.  She is at peace both with her gifts and her flaws.  She does not need to change the world in order to be comfortable in it.  She does not need a man in her life to be complete and because of that, men are comfortable with her.  She accepts responsibilty for her actions and her emotions.  She sings off key and dances like no one is watching. She is not always happy and is ok with that.\nShe is independant. 1

what is the best and fastest way to loose weight?  Decrease your calorie intake (eat less) and increase your calorie usage (exercise).\n\nDiet pills, diet plans, etc. all basically revolve around those two concepts.  If they don't, they usually are not going to lead to a healthy body. \n\nThere is another element you should consider with the eating less part which is proper nutrition.  Eating a balanced, and small portion of food (but more frequently eating) can help with cravings.  Still you are aiming to decrease the amount of calories you take in.\n\nIf you are looking for a drastic amount of weight loss (100 lbs or more) then you need to see a doctor and get onto a regulated plan, which will still include a reduction in calories and exercise.  However in that case it'll be more dramatic and should be supervised. 3
Do you know the formula how to calculated compound interest? Let said, I have $5,000 dollars invested in mutual fund. Within 5 years, it turn in $21,000 dollars.  In what percent do I gain per year. Compound Interest= Principal Amount{1+(rate of intersest/100)^Numebr of years}\nFor you it will be\n21000=5000*(1+r/100)^5\n=>4.2=(1+r/100)^5\n=>1.33=1+r*0.01\n=>r=33% 2
Who do you think is going to win the Super Bowl and why do you think that team is going to win ?  I say Pittsburgh will win. They have became road warriors and becoming the first 6 seed team to make the big show. Plus this is probably the bus’s last game so that makes the team want to win it for him. \n\nI think Seahawks will choke in the big game. What happen to Carolina? They should have won that game!\n\nBig Ben is a great qb to only be in the NFL for two years. He will be big in the Super Bowl. 6

What is marijuana's greatest influence on US culture?  I'll go out on a limb and say that its influence is how it acts as a gateway drug to other substances. Yes, it would be nice to sugar-coat my answer by saying pot's influence lays with the hippy revolution of the 60's, their music, and art in general, but that wouldn't do enough justice to the people who have suffered at the hands of this incredibly toxic and destructive drug. So, that's my answer. Marijuana can lead to further drug abuse and thus it's influencing the US culture by creating more and more junkies day in and day out. This is happening all over the world by the way. I've based my answer on America however to keep this on topic. Have a nice day. 1

how many fundamental particles are known?  Good question. It depends on whether you count exchange particles (ie particles associated with the fundemental forces of nature), if you count antiparticles, and which particle physics model you are using.\n\nIn the "Standard Model" of particle physics there are the follwing fundemental particles (the word's in CAPTIALS are the type of particle):\n\nLEPTONS:\nelectron, muon, tau.\nelectron neutrino, muon neutrino, tau neutrino.\n\nQUARKS:\nup, charmed, top.\ndown, strange, bottom.\n\nGAUGE BOSONS:\nphoton, W+, W-, Z0 (note the +, - and 0 are superscripts)\n8 different gluons.\n\nand finally... the Higgs Boson (still undiscovered).\n\nThis doesn't count antiparticles, of which there are 12 (6 anti-leptons and 6 anti-quarks).\n\n\nSome theories introduce a whole host of new particles, but none of these extra particles have been discovered either. 2

what is the best way to remove dandruff?  Shampoos with coal tar (Neutrogena T/gel is one example) and Nizoral work very well.Both are available over the counter. Usual method is to shampoo with the medicated shampoo every day until the flakes come under control then once or twice per week to keep them under control. \n\nListerine, the mouthwash, has been used for dandruff for years (and used to be advertised for this purpose). Massage it full-strength onto your scalp every day. Supposed to get rid of dandruff in a few days. You can also apply a dilute vinegar rinse to your hair before using regular shampoo. 3

Are the Seattle Seahawks for real? They overcame adversity after they lost Shaun Alexander due to a concussion. Can they go all the way. Don't supply just a "yes" or "no" answer. Tell me the reason for your answer. Yes the Seahawks are in it to win it.  They are going to take it all the way home and they deserve it.  They have an awsome team this year, they comunicate so well, both their offense and defense have it all together, and the fact that they won the game last night without Alexander just goes to shoiw how strong the Whole team is.\n\nGO HAWKS! 6

A lot of times they are people to whom he owes favors, such as people who worked hard for him on his campaign.  Then the Senate must approve them.  They hold hearings and conduct investigations, and pay a lot of attention to what the media says, and what they perceive their party members want.  Then they vote whether or not to confirm the cabinet member. 10

Why the wind cannot be seen, light cannot be touched, smell has no color and sound has no shape?  txgurl, I am going to have to disagree with the question itself, and, as a result, answer your question.\n#1, you say that wind cannot be seen.  The real statement would be that wind cannot be seen with the naked eye.  Wind is the dramatic passage of air molecules from an area of high pressure to an area of low pressure.  This means, that wind is actually air particles zooming past you.  If you were to pause the wind mid-stride and put part of it under a microscope, you would see millions of molecules and tiny particles.  That is what wind is.  So, it can be seen and has been seen, just not with the naked eye, because it's elements are too small.\n#2, Light cannot be touched.  Acutally, scientists believe that light is made up of photons, which are mass-less particle with a standing wavelength of energy inside.  When these particles strike your hand, the outer shell breaks appart, and the energy is released into your hand in the form of energy, both visible and thermal.  So, for the brief second that the photon is in contact with your hand before the shell dissolves, the light can be touched.  It is just so tine (mass-less in fact) and there are so many of them, that our physical senses cannot detect them.\n#3, Smell has no color.  It is believed that all the senses are interrelated.  This means that light has smell and feel and taste, that color has a taste smell and feel, etc.  How is it that some insects are attracted to red flowers and yet they are color blind?  It is because they can smell the color.  Each color has a place in the smell spectrum as well as in the light spectrum.  But, to answer your question, we cannot smell it because, like out eyes can only detect a small range of light, out noses can only smell a small portion of the odor spectrum.\n#4, Sound has no shape.  Actually, sound is in the shape of a sphere.  Once again, just like wind, there would be no sound in a vacuum.  When a sound is made, the sound waves oscillate out from the source from every direction.  Sound travels though solids faster than through gases.  This is how they detect earthquakes.  They have instruments that pick up and map the sound impulses through the gound.  This makes a picture on a map, and they can thus tell the direction and power of the earthquake.  have you ever seen a jet break the sound barrior?  At the moment of the break, a cloud of moisture is formed in a cone shape around the jet.  This cone shape can be demonstrated by blowing up a balloon part of the way.  Then poke your finger hard into one side of the balloon.  The balloon will become shaped like a distorted cone.  Now, this is like the sound.  Keep pushing and the baloon will pop.  Kinda like the sonic boom caused when the jet breaks the sound barrier.  This is the shape of sound.  Again, our sences are too finite to be able to detect the individual molecules and thus, we cannot see the shape.  But a microscope could and computers can detect and generate images of what we could see, if only our sences were more powerful.  Hope this is of some assistance to you. 2

Can a woman still breastfeed if she has breast implants? I was watching Dr. 90210, and it just made me wonder. In most cases you can.\nThere are different ways the procedure is done.  They have what is called "overs," which is over the muscle, and "unders,"  which is, of course, under.  It is more likely to be able to nurse if the implant is put under the muscle.\nAlso, depending on where you have your incision can play a role in this.  If the incision is say in the crease, or in the armpit, you are less like to cause damage to the milk ducts, than say if you have the areola incision.\n\nThis is a great website that answers a lot of questions on breast augmentation:  http://allaboutplasticsurgery.com/ 3

What are some of the particles in the nucleus of an atom other than the proton and neutron?  Protons and neutrons are the primary constituents of atomic nuclei, but these bits of matter can be further divided into quarks.  Quark come in six types, or "flavors:" up, down, strange, charm, top and bottom (or, if you prefer, truth and beauty.) Quarks are never observed by themselves, but are instead found in groups of two (mesons) or three (baryons). Nuclear particles are baryons -- neutrons are composed of two down quarks and an up quark (ddu), while protons are two up quarks and a down quark (uud).  The other four types of quarks are less stable, and tend to be observed only as components of high-energy, short-lived particles inside supercolliders, bubble chambers, and the like.\n\nProtons and neutrons are thus the only directly observable particles within the nucleus.  However, they are bound together by another type of particle, not directly detectable that appropriately enough is known as a gluon.  Gluons, like photons, are force-carrier particles, and they are the intermediary for the transmission of the weak nuclear force, which binds the positively charged protons and electrically neutral neutrons. 2

does putting a minor on a credit account as an authorized user help them establish credit? i thought that minor could not establish credit under any circumstances and that authorized users are simply that-authorized.  they simply have permission to use the account and they have no responsibility. it will merely show as on the bureau once they are of age as they are an authorized user - and should not affect the bureau one way or the other. Yes it does! Its a great way to help young people establish credit. My parents did it for me, and my 3 yr old already has a platinum.  This is also a good way to help people with not so good credit to make it better. Still probably a good idea to be the one who physically has the credit card, until the minor is mature and responsible enough.\nKeep in mind that its a double edged sword, the authorized user of the account can also harm anyone whos on the account, such as if they have poor late payments or declare bankruptcy that can affect the minor with bad credit as well. 7
I click Anti-Spy & get new browser: "You will need to upgrade to obtain the latest version of Yahoo! Anti-Spy" I have installed Yahoo toolbar on Firefox more than six times, now, maybe more than ten. Yahoo! Anti-Spy will not run from my Firefox browser. My Firefox is version 1.5. Any ideas what the problem is or might be? Edit: Please ignore the previous reply from me. \n\nActually this is a known issue with FF 1.5\n\n"FF 1.5 has a different API for accessing the Windows Registry. As usual, they did not bother with backward compatibility. \n\nThe YTFF cannot retrieve the installation path for Anti-Spy, so it cannot launch it. You can launch it directly the RUN box, a command prompt or a shortcut. Search your Program Files for YSPR.EXE, "\n\nYou will have to run anti-spy directly. 5

Do u think America is loosing to China? if china becomes a World powere do u think the world will a fair one?  The emergence of China as a world power would (in the long run) augur well for the world's Balance of Power.\nThe present Unipolarity that is been experienced would change to Multipolarism with the emergence of other super powers.\nI dont really beleive that China is practising the true tenets of communism. Am sure the "gods" of communism wont be happy with the nature of comunism being practised there!!!\nChina, I believe, is tending more towards capitalism & that would in the long run help the global economy develop faster. 10

what do lutherans believe?  Lutherans are Christians, so they believe that Jesus Christ was the Son of God who died to save the world from their sins.  What sets Lutherans apart from Catholics is the doctrines of Holy Communion, Baptism,  Purgatory, and several other teachings.  Catholics believe in seven sacraments, and Lutherans believe in two, Holy Communion and Baptism.  Lutheranism was started by Martin Luther in the 1500s when he nailed the 95 theses on the door of the church in Wittenburg, that challenged many teachings of the Roman Catholic church that were created by priests, and were not found in the bible, such as purgatory and indulgences.  To sum it up, Lutherans rely more on the Bible for its teachings, and Roman Catholics add many of their own teachings to abide by and consider the Pope as as close to God as you can get. 1
I like the way I smell after I work out, is that gross?

Ladies on the pill, have you noticed a decrease in your sex drive? I have recently heard a study concerning some women noticed a decline in sexual drive while on and even after taking "the pill." My wife's sex drive has been going downhill for the last couple of years following the birth of our child. Please don't tell me to try romance, getaways, etc. Been there done that. Bottom line is ... it ain't me. Also, she is in her mid 40's if this means anything. Anyone in the same situation or any comments, suggestions? The pill does effect your sex drive so do some other medicines.  Is she taking anything else?  I don't know what medicines exactly but read the labels.  Prozac effects your sex drive, etc.  \n\nIt could just be because she is tired from your child.  Children are extremely energetic and the moms have to keep up with them, making her more tired & having less energy.  \n\nYour eating habbits especially effect your sex drive.  The healthier you eat the better your sex drive.  Has she gained any weight lately?  Be careful with this subject, it is very touchy, but losing only 10 pounds can have a great effect on your sex drive (in a positive way.)\n\nTalk to her about why her sex drive has decreased and that you miss the way you used to be.  Try setting a schedule/ appointment with each other.  I know it sounds ridiculous BUT if she has a certain day/ time to look forward to she will actually prepare to mentally be there and not waste her energy on other things.  In these hectic times, scheduling helps.  Maybe, every Wednesday night, find a babysitter & have date night.  Go out, relax her mind and then come home when the kids are sleeping and continue the date.\n\nIf you don't figure something out, try talking to a counselor.  They will be full of suggestions that will work. 9

why does the moon turn orange?  The moon can appear orange when it is near the horizon.  The light from the moon (reflected light from the Sun) passes through a much longer path though the Earth atmosphere than when it is overhead.  Light that passes through the atmosphere is scatter by particles in the atmosphere but not in the same way for all wavelengths.  Blue light scatters more easily than red light.  When the near-white light from the moon passes through the atmopshere blue light is scattered away more that red light.  Removing more blue light makes the red light appear stronger.  The combined effect produces a red-orange hue.  This also explain with the sky is blue.  The blue is the scattered light. 2

should best friends of 6 years cross the line and start a relationship?  You have to evaluate your friendship.

The difference between a friendship and a relationship is razor thin and yet a world appart so becareful. 9

What is the physical purpose of a yawn?  The dictionary tells us that yawning is caused by being fatigued, drowsy or bored, scientists are discovering that there is more to yawning than what most people think. Not much is known about why we yawn or if it serves any useful function, and very little research has been done on the subject. However, there are several theories about why we yawn.\nThe Physiological Theory -- Our bodies induce yawning to drawn in more oxygen or remove a build-up of carbon dioxide. This theory helps explain why we yawn in groups. Larger groups produce more carbon dioxide, which means our bodies would act to draw in more oxygen and get rid of the excess carbon dioxide. However, if our bodies make us yawn to drawn in needed oxygen, wouldn't we yawn during exercise? Robert Provine, a psychologist at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, and a leading expert on yawning, has tested this theory. Giving people additional oxygen didn't decrease yawning and decreasing the amount of carbon dioxide in a subject's environment also didn't prevent yawning. \nThe Evolution Theory -- Some think that yawning is something that began with our ancestors, who used yawning to show their teeth and intimidate others. An offshoot of this theory is the idea that yawning developed from early man as a signal for us to change activities. \nThe Boredom Theory -- In the dictionary, yawning is said to be caused by boredom, fatigue or drowsiness. Although we do tend to yawn when bored or tired. 2

Where did the whole idea of Santa Claus come from?  Well Santa Claus isn't an idea. He's real, he was born into a wealthy family in Italy, and his name was Saint Nicholas, when he was born his mother died in birth. and he lived with his father. His father died when he was a teenager, and from then he would travel Europe spreading Peace and joy, back in his home town in Italy, he heard about this man that was going to put his daughters into prostitution to pay for taxes. So on every night of Hanukah(not sure about the spelling) he take a bag of money and toss it through the window of this man house. On the first night the man was curious of who was giving him the money, so on every nighthe would wait u for the bag then try to see who through the in the window, until the night when  he saw Saint Nicholas and thanked him dearly for  the money. And when Saint Nicholas died they put his remains in a tomb in Bary(i think thats the proper name) which is in Turkey. And also thew Blood of Saint Nicholas still runs in some of us. So right now we dont Know if He lives in Greenland at the North Pole or if he's still in Italy you never Know. Like my question i just askes about 15 minutes ago ; Where did god come from, what was before god? , trust me it's tricky, but only some questions can be answered. 1
Was Einstein right? If Einstein was right what was he right about? Einsteins theories and the related mathematical equations seemed to have held up to experimental data for both special and general relativity. In that way, it seems he was at least right in the way he described reality. It may turn out that there is a theory out there somewhere that is even righter.\n\nWhat he may not have been right about is calling the Cosmological Constant his "biggest blunder". It now seems that it is in fact needed in GR.\n\nThere is a theory circulating the internet currently that Einsteins Special Relativity may have mathematical inconsistencies, but I have not verified this. 2

WHY do people KILL babies when they can use the stem cells of adults and get real results?  What bothers me more is that so many are pushing for Fetal Stem Cells, and not Umbilical Stem Cells.\n\nUmbilical Stem Cells are benificial, and do not carry any of the stigma of the Fetal Stem Cells.  And at this time, they are simply thrown away.\n\nI would like to see more research on Umbilical Stem Cells.  Once the techniques are perfected, then Fetal ones can be looked at for the problems that Umbilical Stem Cells can not cure. 10
how to block application download in internet thru registry settings? restriction of application download thru registry settings This article describes how and where Internet Explorer security zones and privacy settings are stored and managed in the registry. You can use Group Policy or the Microsoft Internet Explorer Administration Kit (IEAK) to set security zones and privacy settings. If you are using Group Policy or IEAK on a Microsoft Windows 2000-based computer, you may have to install several hotfixes to set security zones and privacy settings.\n\n\nIf the Security Zones: Use only machine settings setting in Group Policy is enabled, or if the Security_HKLM_only DWORD value is present and has a value of 1 in the following registry key, only local computer settings are used and all users have the same security settings: \nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE&#92;Software&#92;Policies&#92;Microsoft&#92;Windows&#92;CurrentVersion&#92;Internet Settings\nWith the Security_HKLM_only policy enabled, HKLM values will be used by Internet Explorer, but the HKCU values will still be displayed in the zone settings on the Security tab in Internet Explorer. This is by design and there are no plans to change this functionality.\n\nIf the Security Zones: Use only machine settings setting is not enabled in Group Policy, or if the Security_HKLM_only DWORD value does not exist or is set to 0, computer settings are used along with user settings. However, only user settings appear in the Internet Options. For example, when this DWORD value does not exist or is set to 0, HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE settings are read along with HKEY_CURRENT_USER settings, but only HKEY_CURRENT_USER settings appear in the Internet Options.\nNote With the Security_HKLM_only policy enabled, HKLM values will be used by Internet Explorer, but the HKCU values will still be displayed in the zone setting tab within the Internet Explorer Interface. This is by design, and there are no plans to change this functionality at this time. \nTemplatePolicies\nThe TemplatePolicies key determines the settings of the default security zone levels (Low, Medium Low, Medium, and High). You can change the security level settings from the default settings. However, you cannot add additional security levels. The keys contain values that determine the setting for the security zone. Each key contains a Description string value and a Display Name string value that determine the text that appears on the Security tab for each security level. \nZoneMap\nThe ZoneMap key contains the following keys: • Domains \n• ProtocolDefaults \n• Ranges \nThe Domains key contains domains and protocols that have been added to change their behavior from the default behavior. When a domain is added, a key is added to the Domains key. Subdomains appear as keys under the domain where they belong. Each key that lists a domain contains a DWORD with a value name of the affected protocol. The value of the DWORD is the same as the numeric value of the security zone where the domain is added.\n\nThe ProtocolDefaults key specifies the default security zone that is used for a particular protocol (ftp, http, https). To change the default setting, you can either add a protocol to a security zone by clicking Add Sites on the Security tab, or you can add a DWORD value under the Domains key. The name of the DWORD value must match the protocol name, and it must not contain any colons (:) or slashes (/). \n\nThe ProtocolDefaults key also contains DWORD values that specify the default security zones where a protocol is used. You cannot use the controls on the Security tab to change these values. This setting is used when a particular Web site does not fall in a security zone. \n\nThe Ranges key contains ranges of TCP/IP addresses. Each TCP/IP range that you specify appears in an arbitrarily named key. This key contains a string value (:Range) that contains the specified TCP/IP range. For each protocol, a DWORD value is added that contains the numeric value of the security zone for the specified IP range. \n\nWhen the Urlmon.dll file uses the MapUrlToZone public function to re 5

what causes dew to fall? why does the sea containe salt water\nwhy aren't all clouds the same&#92;\nwhy are some tree tops bare&#92;\nwhere do scorpions go when its cold As others have said, it doesn't fall, it condenses onto cool surfaces when the humidity is very high.  Since humidity is relative to air temperature, you get dew in the early hours of the morning when it is coldest.  \n\nThe sea contains salt water because salt is very common in the earth's top crust and rain washes the salt seawards.  In areas where rivers can't get to the sea, you will get salt lakes, such as in Utah.\n\nDeciduous trees lose their leaves in the fall by drawing whatever water they can into the tree's trunk and using sugars and salts as a natural antifreeze.  The leaves die off with the lack of water.\n\n"where do scorpions go when its cold?"  I don't know, and I don't wanna know.  However, if you are worried about it, they do flouresce under black light! 2

Is the Trinity "one person"?  "Trinity" is a term that is not found in the Bible but a word used to describe what is apparent about God in the Scriptures. The Bible clearly speaks of God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ), and God the Holy Spirit...and also clearly presents that there is only one God. Thus the term: "Tri" meaning three, and "Unity" meaning one, Tri+Unity = Trinity. It is a way of acknowledging what the Bible reveals to us about God, that God is yet three "Persons" who have the same essence of deity.\nSome have tried to give human illustrations for the Trinity, such as H2O being water, ice and steam (all different forms, but all are H2O). Another illustration is an egg having a shell, egg yolk and egg white, but this egg illustration shows that there would be "parts" to God, which isn't the case.\n\nGod the Son (Jesus) is fully, completely God. God the Father is fully, completely God. And God the Holy Spirit is fully, completely God. Yet there is only one God. In our world, with our limited human experience, it's tough to understand the Trinity. But from the beginning we see God this way in Scripture. Notice the plural pronouns "us" and "our" in Genesis 1:26 -- Then God said, "Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground."\n\nThough not a complete list, here is some other Scripture that shows God is one, in Trinity: \n\n"Hear, O Israel! The LORD is our God, the LORD is one!" (Deut. 6:4)\n\n"I am the LORD, and there is no other; Besides Me there is no God." (Isa. 45:5)\n\nThere is no God but one. (1Cor. 8:4)\n\nAnd after being baptized, Jesus went up immediately from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon Him, and behold, a voice out of the heavens, saying, "This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well-pleased." (Matt. 3:16-17)\n\n"Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit." (Matt. 28:19)\n\nJesus said: "I and the Father are one." (John 10:30)\n\n"He who has seen Me has seen the Father." (John 14:9)\n\n"He who beholds Me beholds the One who sent Me." (John 12:45)\n\nIf anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Him. (Rom. 8:9)\n\n"Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife; for that which has been conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit." (Matt. 1:20)\n\nAnd the angel answered and said to her [Mary], "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; and for that reason the holy offspring shall be called the Son of God." (Luke 1:35)\n\n[Jesus speaking to His disciples] "And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Helper, that He may be with you forever; the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him, but you know Him because He abides with you, and will be in you." ... "If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him, and make Our abode with him." (John 14:16-17, 23) 1

how can i get a divorce for free or cheap in newyork state?  I do not think that is possible, there are people who can do the paperwork for you and you do all the filing yourself,then show up for the court date. but this only works if it is uncontested by your spouse and no question of who gets custody of the kids. I got my divorce this way, but it is not free, way cheaper than getting a lawyer tho. If you see advertisements for DIVORCE!! 198.00!! this is one of those people. you just have to look for those advertisements, most of them are not under divorce or attorneys in the yellow pages. good luck. 10

who invented baseball? the game I found this article I hope it helps ya. or are quizzing us. ;)\n\nPittsfield uncovers earliest written reference to gameAssociated Press\n\n\nPITTSFIELD, Mass. -- Officials and historians in this western Massachusetts city released a 213-year-old document Tuesday that they believe is the earliest written reference to baseball.\n\nThe evidence comes in a 1791 bylaw that aims to protect the windows in Pittsfield's new meeting house by prohibiting anyone from playing baseball within 80 yards of the building.\n\nThat bylaw would have been produced well before Abner Doubleday is said to have written the rules for the game in 1839.\n\nHistorian John Thorn was doing research on the origins of baseball when he found a reference to the bylaw in an 1869 book on Pittsfield's history.\n\nHe shared his find with former major leaguer and area resident Jim Bouton, who told city officials about the ordinance.\n\nA librarian found the actual document in a vault at the Berkshire Athenaeum library. Its age was authenticated by researchers at the Williamstown Art Conservation Center.\n\n"It's clear that not only was baseball played here in 1791, but it was rampant," Thorn said. "It was rampant enough to have an ordinance against it."\n\nThe long-accepted story of baseball's origins centers around Cooperstown, N.Y., where Doubleday is said to have come up with the rules for the modern game.\n\nThat legend long legitimized the Baseball Hall of Fame's presence in Cooperstown, although later evidence pointed to the first real game being played in Hoboken, N.J., in 1846.\n\nIn 2001, a librarian at New York University came across two newspaper articles published on April 25, 1823, that show an organized form of a game called "base ball" was being played in Manhattan.\n\nThe Pittsfield group hopes their find puts to rest the debate about the game's origins.\n\n"Pittsfield is baseball's Garden of Eden," Mayor James Ruberto said.\n\nBut experts say it may be impossible to say exactly where and when baseball was created because it evolved from earlier games, such as cricket and rounders, another English game played with a bat and ball.\n\n"There's no way of pinpointing where the game was first played," said Jeff Idelson, a spokesman for the Hall of Fame. "Baseball wasn't really born anywhere."\n\nStill, Idelson said if the Pittsfield group's document is authentic, it would be "incredibly monumental."\n\nPittsfield might be a sensible home for the sport. Some historians have documented "the Massachusetts game" as a precursor to modern baseball, where runners were thrown out if they were hit by a ball.\n\nBouton, whose decade-long career as a pitcher included stints with the New York Yankees and Houston Astros, lives in nearby Egremont and is helping to restore Pittsfield's Wahconah Park, the former home of several minor league teams. He hopes the discovery helps bring attention to the project.\n\n"We thought this was a lucky stroke," said Bouton, whose 1970 book "Ball Four" offered a scandalous look behind the scenes of professional baseball. "I'm sure Pittsfield will live off this for a while."\n\nFor now, the document will be kept in a vault until city officials figure out how to properly display it. A copy will be hung at Wahconah Park, one of the nation's oldest ballparks. 6

Do you think we need another Amendment to the Constitution? If so, for what? Yes. Privacy rights should be the subject of the next amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  I recognize, of course, that several landmark cases have made privacy a "fundamental" right under the U.S. Supreme Court's interpretation of the U.S. Constitution, but I do not feel safe given the progressively more conservative orientation of the Court.  If and when Judge Alito joins the Court, silenced will be the voice of Justice O'Connor, an important voice of reason on the subject of privacy.  An amendment could explicitly enumerate what privacy rights are protected and inviolable. 10

what kind of treatments can you use to help alleviate phenylketonuria (pku)?  The only way to 'alleviate' PKU is to strictly adhere to the diet plan provided by a specialized nutritionist. My daughter has PKU, and cannot tolerate any more PHE daily than is contained in one teaspoon of peanut butter. The student MD is partially correct in supplementing tyrosine. Protien consists of several amino acids, all of which the body needs to function normally. Phenylalenine, however, will build up phenylpyruvic acid that will attack the brain and nervous system. The body needs the rest to function normally. As a result, PKU patients need a dietary supplement, usually in the form of a powdered drink, to fortify the body with the remaining amino acids that the body doesn't get because the patient eats so little protien. 3

How should I gain an American accent?  I've been told by Germans that Americans sound like they've got potatoes in their mouths when they're talking.  You could try that - if your mouth is big enough :).  Otherwise, it's very difficult to acquire an American accent, even if you've lived in the US for several years (although I know of a Lithuanian who has an American accent and he only lived in the US for two years).  I would say just make sure you enunciate well and be happy with your interesting accent. 1

how are sand dunes formed?  The sand is wind blown, as it flows over the surface irregularities in the surface, or eddies in the wind slow it down in places and the sand is deposited ontoi the ground, this causes further flow disturbance and the sand pile expands upwards (in height).  The mini dune will have sloping sides, the side into the wind being longer and less steep than the leward side, and there is a limit for the steepness of the slope which is maintainable with dry sand(not sure what it is but look it up).  If the slope is greater than the limit, the sand will roll down hill spreading the dune along the ground (in the direction the wind is going).  This fills in the gap in front of the dune and raises the surface level, allowing more sand to build up on top, which then begins to move forward in a repeating cycle. 2

why did GIs wear dog tags in WWII?  For identification.  Blood types, allergies too.  If a soldier was killed in the field, they took one of the two tags, and sent it back to HQ.  Those not wearing DT's, were doing "special" work not "officially" recognized by the government.  The DT's were to arrange coordination of the burial place of the person (or the "kill spot") for the family.\n\nNever leave someone behind.  If you must, always identify their place of rest.\n\nGod bless our troops; past and now.\n\nHelp you? 4

What all did Abraham Lincoln do in his life? I have to do a school report and I needed some information about him.E-mail me at caylaellis@yahoo.com Though he lost 17 of the 19 elections he took part in, the two that he did win, were for Congress and the Presidency...He epitomized determination!\n\nAmong many of his priceless quotations, he said:\n\n"I may be slow, but at least I don't walk backwards"...\n\nHe was considered quite homely, and when he was accused of being two-faced during a debate with his opponent Steven Douglas, he replied,"If I had another face, do you think I would be wearing this one?"...(The crowd loved it!)\n\nWhen his best General, Ulysses S. Grant, who at the time, was the only General winning any battles, was accused by his peers of being drunk all the time, he replied, "Well, find out what he's drinking, and send him another case of it, on me!"...\n\nLastly, he said, "If I had one hour to cut down a tree, I would spend 45 minutes sharpening my axe"...\n\nAdditionally, he had to bear the responsibilty of being at the center of our country's most terrible War...\n\nHe wrote one, of what are considered to be the two greatest speeches in recorded history, the "Gettysberg Address". The other was written by the Greek statesman Pericles, in the 4th Century B.C. Both were delivered while soldiers layed dead in the field. Lincoln wrote his on the back of a plain white envelope, on the train, as he was approaching Gettysberg... 4

How do I get my gf to stop partying and staying out all night? she always goes to bars and clubs and wakes me up in the middle of the night, its been an issue for a while, but i love her so much How about asking her if you can accompany her? When its getting late, suggest you both go home and spend some time together. Perhaps she'll see that spending time with you is loads more fun than partying with just her friends and seeing you afterwards. If this is a part of her life, become a part of it. Yet, influence it with suggestions for time and consideration. As it works, perhaps going to bars will take a backseat to activities YOU enjoy doing, or just staying home and cuddling on the sofa watching a movie. Take part......and see if this is somethning that could work for you both. 9

can someone explain standard deviation of the mean to me?  Standard deviation tells you how spread out a set of numbers is.  A small standard deviation means that the numbers are close together.  A large one says that they're far apart.\n\nIt's often used as a measure of distance away from the mean.  In a normal distribution, about 68% of numbers are within one standard deviation from the mean.  For example, if you have a normal distribution with a mean of 50 and a standard dev of 10, then about 68% of the numbers are between 40 and 60.

when are oral contracts in the US enforceable by law?  In Black’s Law Dictionary an Oral Contract is defined as:\n\nOne which is partly in writing and partly depends on spoken words, or none of which is in writing; one which, so far as it has been reduced to writing, is incomplete or expresses only part of what is intended, but is completed by spoken words; or one which, originally written, has afterwards been changed orally.\n\nIn short, such a contractual dispute would go before the law (court, mediator, magistrate, etc.) and that which could be proven as agreement between the parties to the contract )written or oral) would be the rule.  There are other factors , but if you can demonstrate to the court that there was a “meeting of the minds” it can be inforced. 10

Are we able to creat a BlackHole... or how it's created? http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AknyFs177KHp_elI6fLZFU_sy6IX?qid=1005121704508 yes!!\n\nBlack holes are predictions of Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity. In particular, they occur in the Schwarzschild metric, one of the earliest and simplest solutions to Einstein's equations, found by Karl Schwarzschild in 1915. This solution describes the curvature of spacetime in the vicinity of a static and spherically symmetric object, where the metric is\n\n    ds^2 = - c^2 &#92;left( 1 - {2Gm &#92;over c^2 r} &#92;right) dt^2 + &#92;left( 1 - {2Gm &#92;over c^2 r} &#92;right)^{-1} dr^2 + r^2 d&#92;Omega^2,\n\nwhere d&#92;Omega^2 = d&#92;theta^2 + &#92;sin^2&#92;theta&#92;; d&#92;phi^2 is a standard element of solid angle.\n\nAccording to Schwarzschild's solution, a gravitating object will collapse into a black hole if its radius is smaller than a characteristic distance, known as the Schwarzschild radius. Below this radius, spacetime is so strongly curved that any light ray emitted in this region, regardless of the direction in which it is emitted, will travel towards the center of the system. Because relativity forbids anything from travelling faster than light, anything below the Schwarzschild radius – including the constituent particles of the gravitating object – will collapse into the center. A gravitational singularity, a region of theoretically infinite density, forms at this point. Because not even light can escape from within the Schwarzschild radius, a classical black hole would truly appear black.\n\nThe Schwarzschild radius is given by\n\n    r_s = {2&#92;,Gm &#92;over c^2}\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, m is the mass of the object, and c is the speed of light. For an object with the mass of the Earth, the Schwarzschild radius is a mere 9 millimeters — about the size of a marble.\n\nThe mean density inside the Schwarzschild radius decreases as the mass of the black hole increases, so while an earth-mass black hole would have a density of 2 × 1030 kg/m3, a supermassive black hole of 109 solar masses has a density of around 20 kg/m3, less than water! The mean density is given by\n\n    &#92;rho=&#92;frac{3&#92;,c^6}{32&#92;pi m^2G^3}\n\nSince the Earth has a mean radius of 6371 km, its volume would have to be reduced 4 × 1026 times to collapse into a black hole. For an object with the mass of the Sun, the Schwarzschild radius is approximately 3 km, much smaller than the Sun's current radius of about 700,000 km. It is also significantly smaller than the radius to which the Sun will ultimately shrink after exhausting its nuclear fuel, which is several thousand kilometers. More massive stars can collapse into black holes at the end of their lifetimes.\n\nMore general black holes are also predicted by other solutions to Einstein's equations, such as the Kerr metric for a rotating black hole, which possesses a ring singularity. Then we have the Reissner-Nordström metric for charged black holes. Last the Kerr-Newman metric is for the case of a charged and rotating black hole.\n\nThere is also the Black Hole Entropy formula:\n\nS = &#92;frac{Akc^3}{4&#92;hbar G}\n\nWhere A is the area of the event horizon of the black hole, &#92;hbar is Dirac's constant (the "reduced Planck constant"), k is the Boltzmann constant, G is the gravitational constant, c is the speed of light and S is the entropy. 2

what is hard disk formatting?  A hard drive consist of one or more magnetic media platters on which digital data can be written and erased magnetically.\n\nWhen you buy a new hard drive, the manufacturer does not what operating system you are going to use, therefore they leave the platters unformated.\n\nThen the user formats, or magnetically prepares the disk to receive data. Once the disk is formated, data can be written on it.\n\nIf you format a hard drive, you will bring it back to its "new" state, deleting all the information that once was written on it. During formating, bad sectors can be detected and they will be marked so no data will be written on them.\n\nThere are two kinds of formating, logical and  physical format.\n\nPhysical or low-level format is a process that prepares the disk dividing it into tracks, sectors and cylinders.\n\nLogical format:is a process in which a file system is placed on the disk. (most likely to be the format of your question =) ) 5
Trying to set up Instant Rails - Get this error - Apache port(80) is used by "" (inetinfo.exe)! Any ideas? The Instant Rails download worked well, and I had no trouble starting Instant Rails. The GUI is great. One spooky thing about the Instant Rails tool is that it seems to be able to watch the file system. I ended up trying to edit the Apache config file, and Instant Rails knew every time I saved a change from Notepad. It's funny to be using hi-tech stuff like Notepad when working with Rails.\n\nUnfortunately, I have run straight into a problem. I am trying to set this up on a work laptop, and I get the following error:\n\n    Apache port(80) is used by "" (inetinfo.exe)! \n\nI am trying to do this on a work laptop, which is running MS Windows XP Sounds like you've got IIS (or one of its tools) running.

Who has the best DSL connection? Best pricing\nBest service\nBest overall connection and surfing speed Depends on where you live and who offers DSL service in your area.  But, at my grandparents house I pratically forced them to switch from AOL dial-up to the AOL Verizon DSL package for the same price at $23 per month.  That's just the basic DSL 768k package.  But you don't need the AOL part.  You can just get Verizon 768k DSL for $15 per month.  Can't beat it if you ask me.  And right now for new subscribers to Verizon DSL, online orders get the first month free when you order online.\n\nYou might want to check out whoever offers high speed Cable in your area too.  Most Cable providers will give you a discount on a high speed connection if you are already a subscriber to their cable TV service.\n\nThere is no difference between a wired and wireless connection in regards to speed and quality.  But you will need to get a wireless router (I like Netgear and Linksys but D-Links are one sale right now for $21 after rebate).  If you have a laptop, it probably already has a WiFi card in it.  If you have a desktop you will need to get either a USB WiFi adapater (easier to install) or a PCI WiFi card.  Of course that doesn't matter if the PC is in the same room as the DSL modem.\n\nCheck out the links below for routers and adapters and how to install a WiFi network.  If you set up a Wireless network you should enable either WEP 128-bit encryption or WPA encryption and possibly mac address filtering, step by step instructions are located at Cnet, see the last link. 5

How long does it take to heal a toe amputation when the patient has very limited blood circulation?  The time it takes to heal any wound depends on several things. Good circulation to the area helps with healing. It brings nutrients and oxygen that are needed to heal. You can't let your blood sugar levels be too high. If someones blood sugar is too high then basically they may never heal the wound. Also make sure that you are getting enough protein in your diet. Protein is what your body uses to repair skin.\nYou may want to consider visiting a wound care clinic. We have one in our area. On certain patients they are able to put them in a bariatric chamber which saturates the body with oxygen to promote healing. Hope this helps! 3

what are the pros and cons of fixed term mortgages? what are term mortgages and their pros and cons?\nwhat are balloon mortgages and their pros and cons? fixed:\npros - your mortgage payment stays the same no matter what the market does.\ncons - your mortgage payment stays the same no matter what the market does.\n\nIf the interest rates go sky high, you are safe with your relatively low payment.\nIf the interest rates fall through the floor, you are now paying a relatively high amount.  This is when you refinance.\n\nWith a balloon (aka arm) mortgage:\npro - you pay less per month for the term of the arm (1 year, 3 year, 5 year, 7 year, or 10 year), with a lower percentage APR with the lower year arms.\ncon - after that year time is up, the rate can jump as much as 2 percentage points PER YEAR.  Your low 4.3% loan can become 6.3% overnight...and 8.3% the next year!  Suddenly, you're swamped!\n\nIf you are buying a house and KNOW you will sell it in 5 years, get the 5 or 7 year arm.  You'll pay less per month, so you can save up for the next house (either via deposit or overpay the mortgage to get equity).\n\nHope this helps! 4

why do computers use Binery and humans generally use Decimal #'s?  Today, much of the humans on earth use decimal (base 10) numbering because we have 10 fingers and because it is a convenient numbering system for representing numbers.\n\nBut humans haven't always used decimal representation.  The Romans had their "Roman Numeral" system for counting numbers.  The Chinese and Japanese used ideograms (pictures) to represent different numbers.  So did most cultures.  These numbering systems are not Decimal or Base 10.\n\nThe decimal system we use almost universally on earth today was developed by the arab peoples and is refered to as arabic numeral system or arabic numerals.  Decimal (Base 10) was adopted over the other numeral systems because it is so much easier to do computations in than the other numeral systems. For instance, just try to "carry the one" in Roman Numerals.\n\nComputers use Binary (base 2) number system because it is too difficult to represent multiple states or levels in a transistor or memory device.  For this to work, multiple voltage levels would have to be used and as the electricity flows from circuit to circuit, the voltage level could be affected and change, thus making the numbers unreliable. Computers called analog computers make use of varying voltage levels to represent many values of numbers rather than digital computers which use binary.\n\nIt is easy, however, to represent two states (0 and 1) with two extreme voltage values "on" and "off". Even if they degrade and get some noise introduced, making "off" have some small voltage or "on" have lower voltage, the voltages will still be sufficiently different as to be able to recreate the correct value later in the circuit.\n\nRelying on this system of binary representation has allowed humans to mass produce electronic circuits so small and reliable that you and I can communicate about this over long distances and listen.  So, computer scientists and engineers tend not to mess with this good thing of binary unless there is an economic advantage to doing so.\n\nContrary to what poster said, binary numbers existed before the advent of the computer so they were not made only for computers.  See the wikipedia article on Binary Numeral System below. 5

how do you tell a guy you dont love him? I have this dude i really loved and we started a distant relationship. I think i really showed him how much i loved him because he stopped calling except for a few times and writing me but would visit like 1 or 2 times a year. He still claims he loves me and wants to marry me as soon as he gets a good job, which he did some months back.  The truth is that i dont love him as much as i do, and i dont want the relationship to continue. We just clocked 4 years this month. What do i do? I would be honest with him. The longer it goes ther harder it will be. Only seeing you 1 or 2 times a year is kind of odd for someone who claims they care so much for you. Just be honest, who knows, you both might feel the same way, but are scared of what the other will say. 9

What is a blog?  blog\nDefinition\nblog \nA frequent, chronological publication of personal thoughts and Web links. \nInformation\nA blog is often a mixture of what is happening in a person's life and what is happening on the Web, a kind of hybrid diary/guide site, although there are as many unique types of blogs as there are people.\n\nPeople maintained blogs long before the term was coined, but the trend gained momentum with the introduction of automated published systems, most notably Blogger at blogger.com. Thousands of people use services such as Blogger to simplify and accelerate the publishing process. \n\nBlogs are alternatively called web logs or weblogs. However, "blog" seems less likely to cause confusion, as "web log" can also mean a server's log files.\n\nBlogs have taken the Internet by storm, and they're the easiest way to publish your brilliant thoughts. Basically, a Blog (short for "Weblog") is an interactive, personalized Web journal for posting your views, art, rants, raves, reviews, pictures, music-anything that you want to share with the teaming masses (or a private group). You can make entries ("posts" or "updates") to your Weblog any time you want-like a what's new page or a journal-from news updates, to humor, insights, enrages, outrages, loves, hates, true and fictional stories. Whatever you want. It's up to you. Okay, not everyone posts entries to their Blogs in their underwear, but they probably should (hey, you're already baring your soul?!) 5
Why do republicans or bush lovers think he is perfect??? It seems like everytime I talk to someone in favor of Bush they act as if everything he does it right. They never want to acknowledge that maybe he made a bad decision. Nobody is perfect and that includes the president. While if it was a Democrat or someone from a different party they would be ripping them apart. They try to point the finger at Clinton, but I see more things Bush did wrong. Frist I like to say that people are people, and people make misstakes, and 2nd you should never takes on a side of a "party". Some people who like Bush do not think he is perfect[like me]. But people get binded, ther think that if they say that someone that they subport does wrong that there will look like a fool too. No one like to look that way, so we put on a front. That is why peole piont on Clinton so we do not look so bad. 10
What is your philosophy of education? How do you think our youth would learn the most efficiently? \n\nWhy? Well, in my opinion, success in school usually depends on the enviornment that you are taught in.  Friends, relationships, and trying to fit in are a couple of examples of why one person might not do as good as another.\n\nI wouldn't put all blame on the teacher if one person is not doing as good as the rest, I wouldn't even put all the blame on the parents.  That's just the way life is.\n\nAs for how kids could learn more efficiently.  I could throw an idea up.  Categorize all the teacher's teaching methods, such as verbal, written, computer based, etc...   Then when the kid registers they can take a questionaire to see what teacher best fits their learning style.  Of course there will never be enough teachers to fit everyone of the students.  But...hey...just an idea.\n\nI went to a night school program, and I found that a text book and computer based training worked better then having a teacher at all.  I did have an advisor, and he was cool but didn't know much when it came to teaching.  This worked for me because that is the way I like to learn.  It would not work for everyone though.\n\nGood Question!!! 4
What is solid waste management? What is a solid waste management in the philippines Disposal methods also vary widely. In Australia, the most common method of disposal of solid waste is to landfills, because it is a large country with a low-density population. By contrast, in Japan it is more common for waste to be incinerated, because the country is smaller and land is scarce.\n\nMany local authorities (especially in urban areas) have found it difficult to establish new landfills, due to opposition from adjacent landowners. Few people want a landfill in their local neighbourhood. As a result, solid waste disposal in these areas has become more expensive as material must be transported further away for disposal. 4

who won the case Marbury vs Madison?  Marbury lost and the government won in the personage of Madison.\n\nIn 1804 a judicial decision was handed down by the U.S. Supreme Court in a case known as Marbury v. Madison. The case was started because President Jefferson did not like one of the appointments made by his predecessor in the Presidency, John Adams. The appointment, made in the last few hours of Adams' administration in 1801, elevated a man named William Marbury to the position of justice of the peace. Jefferson asked his Secretary of State, James Madison, to dismiss Marbury, and Marbury sued the government in the person of Madison so that he might be reinstated in his job. The case went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which dismissed Marbury's suit, stating that the court lacked jurisdiction in the case. More importantly, the Supreme Court declared that a section of the Judiciary Act of 1789 was unconstitutional. This was the first time that the Supreme Court declared an act of Congress invalid, which opened a new role for the court, eventually gaining for it an important place as the third, co-equal branch of government, along with the Congress and the Executive. 10

Where can I do my lab work for CS 241?  Best Option: Go to the SPARC lab.\nIf you need help finding the labs the CEC home page has all the needed information. Check out "What's New?" and "Labs and Schedules"\n\n2nd Best Option: Go to the Pentium PC lab. Log ontothe PC and choose wither "eXceed 4 rooted window" or "eXceed 4 local window from the "Sessions" folder. The rooted window will open a window just like an X-term, and the local window willmx X clients with PC windows --- Try them both. For more information on starting a unix session from a PC look at the PC section on the CEC Frequently Asked Questions page. \n\nLast Option: Go to the MAC lab. Note that if you are going to use the debugger then you need to start a MacX session (which is not even currently available). Furthermore, the debugger differentiates between the three mouse buttons and the Macs just have a single mouse button. They are also slower than the other options. \n\n\nNOTE: If you are having trouble copying files directly from the WEB (e.g. if you are on a MAC), you are best copying the provided files using the unix copy (cp) command as described on the Unix help page. Even if you are working in the SPARC or Xterm lab, I think you'll find it faster to use this option. 7
about how many balloons do you need to make an arch?  It depends on a few things.  How long do you want the strand to create your arch?  How many balloons will you use in each cluster to create your strand?  The typical clusters are made of either three or four balloons.  It also depends on the size of balloon you use.  Most arches are made with 11" balloons.  \n12 x 3' \n\nI prefer to use 11" balloons in clusters of 3.  The typical length of the strands I do is about 24'.  I can usually plan on about 12 balloons for every 3' of the strand.  So a 24' strand takes around 96 balloons.  I would round that up to about 120 to account for poppage and damaged balloons.  \n\nIf you're looking to have one done I would rcommend you call a party supply store that sells balloons.  If they don't do it, they will have the best recommendations and references for you.  I've also included a site below that sells the instructions on how to make one.  Good luck and have a happy balloon day! 9
Can eye doctors screw up your vision by giving you stronger contact lenses?  Stronger contact lenses won't damage your eyes, but it will make them work harder.

in your simplest words, can you tell me anything about yyterium?  Hi, there is a mispelling, but the previous answer did not spot it correctly.\nyyterium is not correct. The correct version is Ytterium. \nAlso the previous answer referred to Ytterbium (element symbol Yb), which is not the element you are asking for... You are asking for Ytterium or Yttrium (both are synonyms, and the element symbol is Y). \n\nYtterbium (Yb)\nYtterbium is a bivalent or trivalent metallic element of the rare-earth elements that resembles yttrium and occurs with it and related elements in several minerals such as gadolinite. It has the symbol Yb.\n\nYtterium (Y)\nYtterium is a trivalent metallic element usually included among the rare earth elements which it resembles chemically and with which it occurs in minerals. It has the symbol Y.\n\nYttrium (Y)\nYttrium is a metal element with the symbol Y.\n\nNote: \nYtterium = Yttrium  (element symbol: Y)\nYtterbium (element symbol is Yb) 2
Do you celebrate Kwanzaa? How come television shows, the news, etc. don't really acknowledge Kwanzaa?  I don't celebrate Kwanzaa because I really don't know that much about it.  I have noticed that Kwanzaa has gotten more press than Yule.  I celebrate Yule as a Wiccan.  That is part of being in a minority culture.  Whether it be race, nationality or religion, if its not mainstream its hard to get recognized in the media.  I hope someday the media realizes that there is more to the holiday season than Xmas and Hannukah. 1

Right/Wrong or just "point of view".? There is nothing "Right or Wrong" in this world. Everything is just a "Point of View".\n\nIs the above statement correct ? All is point of view, however Right and Wrong are judgments of action based upon point of view.\nA psychopath has no conception of Right or Wrong.  A human who is not a psychopath as some conception of what is Right and what is Wrong, but these may not be relative.\nAlmost every culture of humans believes that it is Wrong to hurt another human on purpose.  Does that make not hurting another Right?\nKeep in mind, no matter what your religious background, Divinity is the only real judge.  All judgments made by humans might be in error and will probably cause you to be judged. 7

What information did Yahoo give up to the government? Have they disclosed this information, or are we left to guess?\nPlease don't answer if you don't know specifically. According to news sources, it seems that the kind of information given to the Government under subpoena was a sample of search queries without any individual user identifying information.\n\nI would guess that it is the kind of information disclosed by Yahoo and Google popular search queries only including all kinds of queries, just not popular queries.\n\nhttp://buzz.yahoo.com/\nhttp://www.google.com/press/zeitgeist.html\n\nHere is Yahoo's privacy policy:\n\nhttp://privacy.yahoo.com/privacy/us/ 5
what's 1:24:43 minus 1:22:05 ? please explain because i don't understand.?  Are those times?  As in, one hour, 24 minutes, and 43 seconds?  In that case, I would say that 1:24:43 minus 1:22:05 is 0:02:38.  You come up with this answer by subtracting the first numbers (1-1), then the second numbers (24-22), and then the third numbers (43-05).  This way, you're subtracting hours from hours, minutes from minutes, and seconds from seconds - they have to match up. 4

Why is Money Green? Just Ponderint this . Not all paper money is green, of course. Many countries use different colors for different denominations. But the reason for using green exclusively for U.S. bills is not known for certain.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Printing and Engraving, which prints those greenbacks, green is used because that pigment was readily available in large quantities, the color has a relatively high resistance to chemical and physical changes, and it is psychologically identified with strength and stability. 2

What is the best Email Service? What email service do you preffer? I prefer gmail.  It has some really unique features that make it stand out from others.  The main one being that when you are conversing back and forth with somebody, all the messages are stored as one "conversation" so you can see it all at once, in one place, and don't have your inbox clogged up with tons of messages that are really all replies about the same thing.  Also, most e-mail services let you store messages in folders, but Gmail calls them "labels" and you can apply more than one label to a message, kind of like cross-referencing them.  It's the best! 5

What is the name of the first star (not planet) visible at dusk in the night sky in the Northern Hemisphere? Are there different stars for winter vs. summer? It varies place to place and even month to month.\n\nWhat one needs to consider are three things: which are the brightest stars in the sky (as these are going to be the first to be seen as the sky darkens), what times of year are these stars visible RIGHT AT DUSK, and from which parts of the globe are they visible?\n\nThe brightest star in the night sky is Sirius.  Siruis is located in the southern sky, but is visible from the vast majority of the Northern hemisphere because it isn't too far south.  If you're in a part of the world where Sirius can be seen (all but Canada, Alaska, Russia, Scandanavia, etc), and at a time of year when it is in the sky right at dusk (mid winter to early spring), then Sirius (also called the Dog Star) will be the first to be visible.\n\nOther bright stars:\n\nCanopus (visible primarily from the southern hemisphere and the tropics or subtropics)\n\nArcturus (visible throughout the Northern hemisphere, would be in evening sky probably from spring to mid summer)\n\nAlpha Centauri (the closest of all stars, visible primarily from the southern hemisphere and the tropics or subtropics)\n\nVega (the one in the movie Contact, visible throughout the northern hemisphere, in evening sky around late summer through autumn)\n\nCapella (visible throughout the Northern hemisphere, probably in evening sky around winter into early spring) 2

a primary difference between constitutional and absoulute moarchies is that.......?  Absolute and Constitutional monarchies are radically different forms of government, each with its own positives and negatives. In a Constitutional monarchy, power is shared between the monarch and Parliament. This is a positive because the greed and desire for power of a monarch will be offset by the Parliament. In an absolute monarchy this is quite different. A monarch in this form of government is able to use his position for personal gain to the detriment of his countrymen. This can have a negative affect on the country’s status. Also citizens in countries with a Constitutional monarchy have more rights and freedoms, whereas citizens in countries with absolute monarchies often have restricted personal freedoms like Religious intolerance, which can cause internal instability.\n\nDuring the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries several European countries experimented with new forms of government. Two of these were absolutism and Constitutional monarchies. Absolutism is a government in which a king or queen rules with total power. The initiation of absolutism was made possible because countries were experiencing turmoil under existing governments. Religious wars, the decline of the church, and a growing middle class created a situation that demanded a leader to rule with complete power so as to restore order. Under absolutism the monarchs that ruled a country had total control because they believed they had a “divine right”. They believed that right was given them by God and bestowed upon them the power to control the county totally. They often defended their abuse of power by saying that it was God’s will for them rule. Also in an absolute monarchy the monarch makes all economic decisions. For example, Louis XIV of France abused his control of money by spending it on his Palace of Versailles.\n\nA Constitutional monarchy is a form of government in which a king or queen rules with limits to their power along with a governing body (i.e. Parliament). A Constitutional monarchy was able to form in England because there was a lack of strong leadership. 4
Anyone have tips on controlling anger? Better than counting to 10?  Anger is not a real emotion. It is a defense mechanism to hide a deeper emotion. \n     \nFor example...\n     If you find out your significant other is having an affair, you would think you are angry, but you are not. You are in fact, SAD. Sad that you were cheated on and you are using anger to cover it up.\n     Although sadness is usually the emotion anger covers up, there are others (fear, surprise, shock etc.)\n\n\nThe best way to handle anger is to recognize anger as a cover and instead act on the true emotion hidden underneath. \n     I.E. If you recognize that you are not angry but sad, you are less likely to say or do things you will regret. 3

I recently read that forensic science should not be done as an undergraduate course. What should i do?

It's a really interesting and worthwhile field, but you do need that background of a bachelor's in anthropology before you start on it.

why are teenagers dating adults? i think that some teenagers in today world need some guidens. i think they ne someone to show them some help. Its an epidemic,and I think its directly related to the lack of moral guidance in the homes.In most homes both parents are working so kids come home to an empty house,many teens come from broken homes where either or both parents are non-existent.There needs to be an emphasis on raising teens with self-esteem and training in morality,if Kids new they were loved and got enough of it in the home in the first place,they wouldnt feel this much need to find it elsewhere.You can see this desperation evident in cases where young boys go after older women seeking to fulfill the emptiness for a mothers love,and vice versa for young girls,looking for Daddy in an older man.Its seriously sad,and something needs to be done about it. 9
Linkin Park: The best? Is it the best band or the worst?? No matter how much of a LP fan(atic) I am, I can't say that they are the best. Wonderfully creative music videos and cool lyrics. But, Chesters vocals can be a little over-the-top (by over-the-top, I mean he screaches, but that's my favorite part), and Mike's rap parts aren't for everybody. Drums could use a little work, but great musicians otherwise. On a scale of 1-20 I give them an overall...ugh...13. You have no idea how much that killed my to type. 8

why are people influence by physical appearance?  It's not just people you know.  ever see a peacock? Physical attraction is animal instinct.  But, it's not the same for everyone.  I know a girl who would be called a supermodel may not be as physically attractive to me as someone average looking who, for whatever reason, really sparks my interest.  So attraction isn't all "by the book".  There are other attributes that contribute to the attraction. 1
do you wanna help? me and my boyfriend are alwayz talking on the phone but we never see each other...and i think i love him but when i go to school and talk to all these other guys its like i forget about my bf and my feelings change but then wheni get home and hear his voice over the phone it is then that i kno i love him...wat should i do? It kind of sounds to me that you are more lonely than in love with your boyfriend. You seem to be happy when you are talking to guys in general, not just when you are talking to your boyfriend, so that would lead me to believe that you are lonely when you are on your own. If this is the case then maybe you should be on your own and just make sure that you spend a lot of time with your friends, and when you have met the right person then you will know. 9

How many different versions of the English language is used in America.? How can we as true Americans keep God in our Schools, government biuldings. Our country was founded on God, and i think anyone that does not like this should leave the country or shut-up! How can we as believers in God believe that God is not in our schools simply because the government does not try to force children to believe what the government says. (You understand that the government runs the public schools, and if you want religion in school, what you want is the government telling us what kind of religion to practice. Right?)\n\nI recommend that you do study into American hisory -- the beliefs of the founders are mixed, and the principles founding the country are those of religious freedom from government more than government bsed on religion.\n\nAlso, out of curiosity -- what does your main question have to do with the rest of the question? 10
How do you become a judge on the Supreme Court? What are the necessary qualifications and the process to get on the high court? There are nine seats on the United States Supreme Court. You must be nominated by the President of the United States, and confirmed by a majority in the U.S. Senate. Justices are appointed for life (except in cases of retirement or impeachment).\nIt is not necessary for that person to have experience as a judge (George W. Bush's nomination of Harriet Miers http://news.search.yahoo.com/news/search?ei=UTF-8&fl=0&fr=slv5-&p=harriet+miers+%22supreme+court%22<br />\nis not the first time a non-judge has been nominated), just a solid legal mind. Generally when a President chooses a nominee, he will look for someone whose ideals and worldview match his own. Gerald Ford famously did not make an idealogical choice when he appointed John Paul Stevens (http://www.supremecourthistory.org/04_library/subs_volumes/04_c11_f.html) <br />\nand in subsequent years was rather disappointed at some of Stevens' decisions. \nThere is a lot more information at the official Supreme Court site: http://www.supremecourtus.gov/ 10

Is a low diastolic blood pressure reading dangerous? A consistent diastolic reading of 65 or less. It depends...What is the systolic reading?  Do you have negative symptoms like dizzyness?  Joggers, athletes...people who do arobic exercise may indeed have lower BPs compared to standard and this is good.  The "mean" blood pressure" is the systolic and diastolic added together and divided by two.  BP of 120/80 has a MBP of 100.  The average acceptable MBP is 100, however the healthy normal for some may well be lower.  The best way to answer your question has much to do with your own medical history and the incclusion of possible negative symptoms. 3
What is HIV?  HIV is a virus that causes AIDS sickness.\n\nHuman immunodeficiency virus, commonly known by the initialism HIV, is a retrovirus that primarily infects vital components of the human immune system such as CD4+ T cells, macrophages and dendritic cells. It also directly and indirectly destroys CD4+ T cells. As CD4+ T cells are required for the proper functioning of the immune system, when enough CD4+ T cells have been destroyed by HIV, the immune system functions poorly, leading to the syndrome known as AIDS. HIV also directly attacks organs, such as the kidneys, the heart and the brain leading to acute renal failure, cardiomyopathy, dementia and encephalopathy. Many of the problems faced by people infected with HIV result from failure of the immune system to protect from opportunistic infections and cancers.\n\nHIV is transmitted through direct contact of a mucous membrane with a bodily fluid containing the HIV virus (such as blood, semen, vaginal fluid or breast milk). This transmission can come in the form of: penetrative (anal or vaginal) sex; oral sex; blood transfusion; contaminated needles; exchange between mother and infant during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding; or other exposure to one of the above bodily fluids 3
can anybody prove to me that 1=0? proof to me that 1=0? this is a common "proof" that is often bandied about, even though it's wrong.  \n\nLet a=b. \n\nmultiply by a:\na^2 = ab\n\nsubtract b^2:\na^2 - b^2 = ab - b^2\n\nfactor both sides:\n(a+b)(a-b) = (a-b)b\n\ncancel (a-b)\n(a+b) = b\n\nsubstitute a=b from the first step:\n2b = b\n\ndivide by b:\n2=1\n\nsubtract 1 from both sides\n1=0\n\n\nfortunately sanity is saved when you realize that the step where you cancel (b-a) from both sides is actually dividing by zero, since you specify beforehand that b=a.  this is not so much a proof as a mathematical fallacy.  see the link below for another, more complicated version of the same thing. 2

My mom's BP is not that high but every medication she takes makes her have a dry cough. Is there a natural alternative or anything she can try? Preferably herbal? First and foremost, relax. Proper relaxation ritual, is very important. Also she should probably cut down on stimulants such as caffiene, and keep a healthy level of activity. Long walks and the like. 3

what is a paraban? I see paraban free face creams. what is a paraban? Parabens are preservatives that are used mainly by people who make homemade cosmetics and toiletries.  The reason you see "paraben free" nowadays is that about 2 years ago a study was published which found parabens in breast cancer tumors.  Based on the form found, it was believed that the parabens had to have been absorbed through the skin.\n\nThere was absolutely no proof that the parabens CAUSED the cancers and this was a very small study (fewer than 100 women) but the so-called "natural" world went absolutely nuts when the study was published. 3

Why doesn't Aqua Fresh Tooth Paste have the ADA seal of approval?  before the ADA can approve of a dentrifice, it should have gone through clinical trials and the FDA also has strict guidlines as far as ingredients and formulations before it can be accredited by the ADA.  Its a lot of politics and science and I guess Aquafresh is making enough  profit not to go through it.  I would stick to using toothpastes with the ADA seal of approval. 3
If u could have any celebrity as your relative who would it be? Name who and why. And how they'll be related 2 u!!! There are probably many who would make good relatives, but the first person that came to my mind is Bono from U2. Since we're close in age, I'd like to have him as a brother/cousin because I really admire him for his committment to helping the less fortunate and maybe he could be a positive role model for me and help me to be a little less apathetic. 9
what year was the full impact of the 14 admendment first felt?  You could say when it was implemented in 1868 since it never met Constitutional requirements for ratification.\n\nCertainly when supported by the United States Supreme Court in the case of Texas V. White in 1869. 10
Are crime scene investigators actually police officers or "civilian" employees? Like the CSI tv series, are the people that work these jobs actually cops?

Is emotional oversensitivity a symptom of any particular mental illness? Help me not care what others think!?  If you're suggesting that you might be mentally ill because you are emtionally sensitive, then NO, emotional oversensitivity is not a symptom of any particular mental illness.\n\nHowever, there are ways of overcoming your oversensitivity.  Basically, you need to learn how to stop taking things so personally.  You might have to discover on your own personal journey what it is that keeps you taking things so personally, but this is usually the cause of oversensitivity.  A good way to find out about yourself is to ask others who care about you, to provide input on how they experience you and how you relate to them. But be prepared for their honesty.  You may find that people perceive you as "fragile" at the same time when you think you're behaving as a strong person.  You need these outside perspective to help you grow. As you become of your own behavior, you'll make your own decisions on which behaviors to modify or mature and which ones are just part of who you are as a person.  For example, if someone tells you your laugh is terribly loud, it doesn't mean you have to change your laugh, perhaps you're just a loud laugher.  But if someone tells you that you're quick to defend your position, even when you're wrong, then you might consider why it's so hard for you to be wrong and why you're so committed to being right, even when you're wrong.  \n\nTreat your sensitivity as a personal journey that you must understand.  Just like someone with a learning disability improves their study skills.  I'm an over-talker, as you can see, so I work on trimming my talk to my exact points so I don't bore people.\n\nOn that note, adios and good luck in your honest pursuit. Many over-sensitive people are blind to their painful and victimized struggle. 3

Living a debt-free life? I'm a big fan of talk radio host Dave Ramsey (www.daveramsey.com). He teaches to get out of personal debt and stay out. The key to building wealth.\n\nYet 90%+ people get in debt and never get out and those same people have little to show for it in retirement.\n\nAre you living a debt-free lifestyle?  If not, what is keeping you from making that commitment? yes i'm essentially debt free. i have no car payments, no student loans, and only a single mortgage on my primary residence. we have several credit cards, but we use them as charge/debit cards, paying off the entire balance every month.\n\none of the best things we do is route money away from our primary spending bank accounts and auto debit as many bills, savings plans, etc. so that our primary bank account balances reflects what we can spend month to month.\n\nwhen we put together our plan to eliminate our debt, we listed out our monthly expenses and found we had money unaccounted for that presumably when to frivolous spending like eating out and small purchases. we consciously eliminated small expenses like opting to bring lunch to work as opposed to going out. we then diverted that money towards paying down the debt. of course, self control in not buying any more "toys" was a big part of it as well. 7

what is the scariest great lake?  I vote for Lake Erie. It causes the most snow. The fact that it is a long east-west running lake, and its depth cause this. Of course, all the Great Lakes produce lake effect snow, but Erie is deeper than Lake Ontario, and the effected city (Buffalo) is larger than other cities that get hit by lake effect snow from the other lakes (Watertown—Lake Ontario, Kalamazoo—Lake Michigan, and others). Having grown up just south of Buffalo, I can attest to the devastation of blizzards from lake effect snow. This was especially so on Jan. 29, 1977, when the infamous “Blizzard of ’77” hit. 2

can i have a good wife from U.S.A?  Yes but follow these rules:\n\n1. Check her teeth. Teeth are a dead give away.\n\n2. Ask if she worked in any hard labor. Hard labor takes its toll and sooner or later you end up having dead wife in your hands. Not cool.\n\n3. Make sure you get a guarantee and a receipt of purchase. If they sell you the wife "as is" ask them why. Accept no half truths. Remember you're having a wife, not a car or something.\n\n4. Make sure you get a test run, check the exhaust and the intake for flaws. Make sure you check both! It's very important. If you can not check it, I can help you with that.\n\n5. Always, always always make sure your wife knows how to cook. Most of the American wives come defected, they don't know how to cook. You shouldn't be the one to teach them.\n\n6. Don't get a wife from Utah. Utah is notorious for its second hand wife market. A lot of people have more than one wives in Utah, so they don't really look after their wives. However some are less used, come with few wear and tear. Don't miss out on those opportunities. Almost all of them will come with a stuppid religion but no problem. The religion is pretty weak, they can be easily brainwashed out of it.  \n\n7. Hymen Rollback. Many people thing hymens can't be rolled back. This is far from truth, hymens can and are rolledbacked even as we're speaking right now. Ask your future wife whether you're his first. If she says "You're my second" pass on that one.\n\n8. Salvaged Wives. Wives who have been in previous ownership with a divorce report on them are called salvage wives. Don't count on them since they carry the traces of those divorces. They tend to look exceptionally polished to hide the fact, make sure you investigate on that. They are known to create the most problems. Of course some salvaged wives get such a wonderful makeover that they may be better than new. But these are rare.\n\nAlso consider asking these questions to the seller:\n\nCall the seller, ask lots of questions\nThere's a lot of data you need before you can properly negotiate the price of the wife, so when you call the seller, ask these basic questions if you don't want to print out our full list of questions mentioned above:\n\n1) Why are you selling the wife? Put them in a defensive position and they must answer quick. If they hesitate, they have something to hide. Why do most people sell their wives? Maybe they lost their job, or there's too many things wrong with it and they don't want to fix it, they'd rather sell it to you. Maybe they bought a better new wife and are selling it themselves. If you have a wife that you love, you're not going to sell it.\n\n2) How many men were on it? The moment of truth for most sellers. This can really reduce the selling price if there's too much men. The standard is 12 men per year. If they have more than that, the pricing sites shown above have charts that deduct off the market value of the wife.\n\n3) Do they have all the maintenance records (facelifts etc), proof of tune ups (recent vacations, shopping receipts), and oil change receipts (liposuction)? You just nailed them with 3 defensive questions in a row. I'll bet no one will have this. I preach it to no end that everyone should. I had it for my previous wife, and I sold it to the first person that came to look at it. The seller might say "No one keeps that woman". Your reply will be "I do, everyone I know does", and without it, I have no validation that you properly maintained the your wife, and now you want me to pay all this money for it?" Tell them no one does their lipo changes on time. How many people change the lipo every 3-6 months?\n\n4) Have them describe the condition of the interior, the breasts, make sure the batty hole is not cracked, find out about the amount of face paint, belly, daily allowence, ask if her attitude runs cool. Is there any other known issues or ne 9
What is the origin of the word "toehead or towhead" for extremely blond people?  The word tow in towhead means 'the fiber of flax, hemp, or jute, prepared for spinning'. Such fibers are both light-colored and messy, and so towhead can refer to someone with light or messy hair. The word is very often used of children. \n\nThis tow is ultimately from an Old English word 'thread; something for spinning', and is related to other Germanic words in similar senses. Towhead is an Americanism from the nineteenth century. 4

How ants get pregnant?  They mate in large swarms and then females go off to look for a suitable place to start excavating a nest. Soon after matying the males die. Mated females may live and lay fertile eggs for many years after their single mating. Reproductive ants, at the time of mating, are easily told from workers -- they have wings! If you were designing an insect that lives in tunnels underground, would you give them wings? If you are one of the lucky few who watch ants enough, you'll get to see the ant solution to the problem wings impose for digging in the ground. 2
What language should I learn next? I am a high school sophomore and I currently take French, Spanish, and Italian.  I don't really have a problem with getting things mixed up, and I love learning new langugages... my school offers French, Spanish, German, and Latin, but I don't really want to take German or Latin.  What do you think?  What language should I learn next? Latin is an excelent language to learn if you are planning to work in the health-related fields, and you will have a greater understanding of current english words and how they cease to be.\n\nI'm assuming you want something that your school does not offer (since the only last two your school DOES offer do not interest you)I would like to recommend Greek or Japanese. 1

What is the purpose of the Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter?  From Wikipedia:\n\n"Fluorescent-activated cell sorting is a type of flow cytometry, a method for sorting a suspension of biologic cells into two or more containers, one cell at a time, based upon specific light scattering and fluorescent characteristics of each cell. FACS was the first flow cytometric technology.\n\nThe cell suspension is entrained in the center of a narrow, rapidly flowing stream of liquid. The flow is arranged so that there is a large separation between cells relative to their diameter. A vibrating mechanism causes the stream of cells to break into individual droplets. The system is adjusted so that there is a low probability of more than one cell being in a droplet. Just before the stream breaks into droplets the flow passes through a fluorescence measuring station where the fluorescent character of interest of each cell is measured. An electrical charging ring is placed just at the point where the stream breaks into droplets. A charge is placed on the ring based on the immediately prior fluorescence intensity measurement and the opposite charge is trapped on the droplet as it breaks from the stream. The charged droplets then fall through an electrostatic deflection system that diverts droplets into containers based upon their charge.\n\nFluorescent-activated cell sorting is used in the secretion assay process." 2

what do u think about  Gwantanmo ? if those who made gwantanmo r christians does that mean all christians r bad ,,i think answer is no,,in QURAN  ,ALLAH SAY\nNot all of them are alike; a party of the PEOPLE of the Scripture stand for the right, they recite the Verses of Allah during the hours of the night, prostrating themselves in prayer.  \n(  سورة آل عمران  , Aal-e-Imran, Chapter #3, Verse #113)\nBUT WHY WHEN EVER MUSLIM DO ANYTHING THEY SAY THAT ISLAM IS LIKE THAT WITH NO PROOFS BY THEM FROM QURAN AND SUNNA\nTHERE IS HUGE difrrent between GREAT ISLAM &muslims\n(((too many wear a title of a muslim but they dont practice ISLAM))\nREAD THIS\nthat if any one slew a person - unless it be FOR murder or FOR spreading mischief in the land - it would be as if he slew the whole people: and if any one saved a life, it would be as if he saved the life of the whole people. \nسورة المائدة  , Al-Maeda, Chapter #5, Verse #32) Actually, it's a dirty political game for bush & his group to justify his illegal work by raping Iraq, Afganistan, and recent choas in Middle East. What's happening in Gwantanmo is totally illegal & not ethical since all the prisoners there are innocenet even they do not know why they are receiving this. 1
How do you make things right?  Five thousand years of philosophy have not agreed on that idea, so your question certainly is profound.  But if you're talking about something you did wrong, a simple apology accomplishes two important goals: it shows you realized your mistake, and it opens the door to repair of a friendship. Once you do 'the right thing', it throws the onus of forgiveness onto the other party(s).  Which is a very 'judo' thing to do. 7

movie based on 3 brothers in prison & is a type of western where 1 brother is a butcher? the warden of the prison also helps them escape to do jobs for them It is the hard word\n\nFirst-time director Scott Roberts gets it pretty right with this inyaface Aussie crime caper about three brothers who are just too good.at what they love best: robbing banks.\n\nGuy Pearce leads the Twentyman brothers as sort of mastermind Dale. He’s in jail and Rachel Griffiths is his unlikely moll wife who seems to be in bed with conniving lawyer Frank (Robert Taylor). \n\nThe scam is simple. The boys get snuck out of jail to pull their heists and everyone from the cops to the prison governor are cut in. Until Frankie decides he wants it all, including the lady- and there’ll be no witnesses.\n\nIt’s funny, black and rather surreal. Naturalism buffs will not adore this as much as looser-limbed viewers. But it’s helter-skelter action and remarkably little violence. Strong language though as you’d expect from a writer whose other film was the batty Denis Hopper vehicle The American Way in 1987.\n\nOne lovely touch totally misunderstood by almost every critic so far is the family argot based on butcher’s slang which the lads use to keep their personal stuff, er, personal.\nIf you could handle Chopper you will like this and ignore the spoilsport bourgeois critics of the national press when they come to savage it! 8

Who has cheated death? By surviving a horrible accident/ beating cancer or other disease, or surviving a crime Technically I should have died when I was 19 in a horrible auto accident which took the lives of others involved. (I was a passenger)...it took God's Grace, 6 months of rehab before I gained use of my hand, and held off for over 25 years before I applied for a drivers license for myself. I was in an auto accident once where the car went off the road and flipped in the air.  Once I was airborn I thought that 'This is IT'.  I didn't feel my life go before my eyes or anything like that.  I felt cool and calm.  When I did clime back up to the road a passerby had stopped and was shocked to find out I was not hurt.\nI've allso tried suicide, and when I woke up the next day, I was really mad at not being successful, but life goes on. 3

At 45 I get a lot forgetful these days.Am I havin a memory loss.Someone help me.Its affecting me.What can I do  LOL. I am 54 and always thought I was "getting" more forgetful.  Until I watched my children and grandchildren and realized that we are all sometimes forgetful, regardless of the age.  Worrying about it probably only makes it worse.\n\nI think as we get older, we have more things we are interested in, need to know, think about, worry about.  I know I have the every day things, and many more interests.  I can remember amazing details on things that interest me or that I find fascinating.  Yet I have trouble calling my grandchildren by the wrong name or remembering a name that goes with a face.\n\nSpend some time with the younger generation - they are just as forgetful as we are.  Anything that I need to remember, I write down.  Don't apologize for anything you forget.  Life is full.  There is a lot to remember.

What is the difference between renting and leasing property?  The difference is that a lease is a contract to rent a given property for a set time and for a set amount. When you rent without a lease, there is no guarantee either way, and the renter can leave at will, and the landlord can evict you at will -- though laws vary, and even without a lease some states may make it difficult for a landlord to kick you out on a moment's notice if you're current with the rent.\n\nWith a lease, as the renter, you are guaranteed that the rent won't go up during the lease (unless the lease says it can) but, in turn, you are legally obligated to pay the full amount of the lease even if you move out before the lease is up. But many landlords will simply charge you a "lease break fee" to get out of a lease early. There's a little more to it than this, for example, if you do break a lease, the landlord is obligated to fill the apartment as quickly as possible, and charge you only for the time that the property was vacant and not for the full remainder of the lease.\n\nThere are also rental agreements that are not leases. Like a lease, it spells out the rules, what utilities are included with the rent, pets, etc., but doesn't obligate ether party for a long term agreement -- typically, requiring 2-weeks notice from either landlord or tenant. 7
Dennis Rodman Documentary? Anyone know of a Dennis Rodman documentary (video)?  I have been trying to find one for some time now.  I'll settle for a Chicago Bulls documentary if it has a decent segment on Rodman. I have yet to come across a video documentary of Dennis, but I know he has written a couple books about himself, (he just came out with a new one called "I should be dead by now" not long ago.)\n\nBut for video all iv ever seen him in is a couple movies(not about him, he just played in them)|"Double team" and "cutaway" Also he had a show on MTV about him and his friends going out on adventures and what not. 6

What's a regional reporter? I know that there are seven regions within the US but why is it made of those seven regions, like the pacific, atlantic, southern, etc. what's the meaning behind it, what is it suppose to represent? It doesn't represent anything other than the grouping chosen by the publisher.  A regional report is a publication an algamation of appellate decision from numerous states within a region as choosen by the publisher.  Law libraries will purchase these in lieu of buyer the official case reporters for each state. 10

WHAT IS THE EXACT HISTORY OF STEM CELL THERAPY  AND WHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF THIS THERAPY?  While I am a fan of the Cord Blood Registry (the link previously posted), I have to point out that they work with a subset of stem cells, the hematopoietic stem cells, and most of what is talked aobut in the media has to do with embryonic stem cells. Their web site does distinguish the two, but it's worth keeping the difference in mind.\n\nGood link nonetheless. 2

Is it legal for an employer to dock 30 minutes from your pay for being 1 minute late?  It depends on the state you live in, but most places it would be. You usually have to be paid for all the time you work. He could make you not work for 30 minutes, but if you actually work the 30 minutes, you need to be paid. If you tell us what your state, I could give a more detailed answer.\n\nEdit: It is definitely illegal. First, Nevada law says, "An employer shall pay to the employee wages for each hour the employee works." Further, it is illegal to "Pay a lower wage, salary or compensation to an employee than the amount earned by the employee when the work was performed." An employer can change the rate you are paid as a way to punish you, but that requires that they notify you in writing "Not less than 7 days before the employee performs any work at the decreased wage, salary or compensation." Finally, the employer can withold amounts for certain reasons like health insurance and such, but for any other reason, the employee has to voluntarily authorize the deduction in writing. Tell your boss all of this and ask for your back wages in writing. If he refuses, talk to a lawyer.\n\nEdit2: I forgot to add that the regulations specifically say "An employer may not use a blanket authorization that was made in advance by the employee to withhold any amount from the wages due the employee." The employee has to sign the authorization each time. 10

Do you think I should be concerned with having MS? I had a freaky thing happen to where my vision in one eye looked green for about 5-10 minutes, I went to a opthtlamic neurologist and he did a MRI on me and some kind of light field test and I passed both. I have some symptoms that also could be related to MS, occassionally I have bandlike feelings around my upper thigh if I have been standing in one spot for most of the day and tingling in my arms if I hold them up long or lay on them wrong. Should I worry about this? Or do you think it's more of poor circulation? Do you loose vision, the ability to talk, the ability to smell, feel, taste, or hear?  Do you loose control of any of your body parts, such as legs, arms, neck, waiste, ect?\n\nIf you answered yes to any of these, i would be concerned.  As of right now, though, if you answered no, i wouldn't be too concerned.  I would, hwoever, go in for a complete physical. 3

Does anyone know what the thing you put your bike on to make it stationary is called? I want to get something that you can attach a normal bike to to make it stationary. I need it for physical therapy and stuff. But I have no idea what it is called or where to buy it? Any info would be great. They are indeed called stationary trainers. Many manufaturers exist these days: Elite, Kinetic, Cycleops, Blackburn, etc. You can get them in versions with fan resistance, magnetic, or fluid resistance. The fan models tend to be the cheapest, though I don't think that many companies produce this type of trainer anymore. The fluid models are the quietest (wheras the fan can be quite noisy), but also the most expensive. Also of note, many of the magnetic and fluid models will also have a remote for the resistance adjustment that you can mount on your handlebars - rather than having to get off your bike to adjust the resistance on the unit itself.\n\nYou can purchase these at most bike shops, but I would call first. You can also purchase these online at practically all of the mail order outfits.\n\nhttp://www.coloradocyclist.com\nhttp://www.excelsports.com\nhttp://www.cbike.com\nhttp://www.performancebike.com\nhttp://www.supergo.com\nhttp://www.bikenashbar.com\n\nThose are some places to look. However, if you do buy online, make sure the company you buy from doesn't have a retail (brick and mortar) location in your state - if they do, you'll also get dinged with sales tax. Performance, Supergo, and Bike Nashbar are the same company, and have retail stores set up in a lot of states.\n\nGood luck. 6

How do you stop snoring?  Here are some tips.\nLosing weight. Many people who snore are overweight. Weight loss can help reduce the narrowing of the airway and possibly reduce or eliminate snoring. \nLimiting the use of alcohol and medications. Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol or taking certain medications, especially sleeping pills or tranquilizers, before sleep may worsen snoring. \nGoing to bed at the same time each night and getting plenty of sleep. Snoring may be more frequent when you have not had enough sleep. \nSleeping on your side. Sleeping on your side may eliminate snoring. Try sewing a pocket in the middle of the back of your pajama top, putting a tennis ball into the pocket, and stitching it closed. This will help keep you from sleeping on your back. \nPromptly treating breathing problems. Breathing problems caused by colds or allergies can disturb airflow, leading to snoring. \nUsing nasal strips. Nasal strips, such as Breathe Right, widen the nostrils and improve airflow. 3

Why is it that when we are humming and then we plug our nose, our humming stops? Do people really hum through their nose, or their mouths? the noise comes from the passage of air. The air has to escape either from your nose or from your mouth. If you close one and not the other.......the noise will continue, however, in a somewhat muffled different tone. Close both and the noise ceases. Again, this is because the noise occurs due to the vibrations caused by the passage of air. With the passages closed.......the air does not pass. 8

what's the best option for a golf vacation for 8-12 guys in Myrtle Beach and when is the best time of year?  There are bunches of on-line packages, but it's also pretty easy to find a decent deal on a block of rooms and then make your own golf tee times.  I've done both - the packages will save you a few bucks, but making your own reservations lets you choose exactly what courses you play.\n\nAnd FWIW, here are a bunch of random thoughts based on my experience:\n\nLate Winter and Spring are the busiest times in the Grand Strand, but you can play golf there all year long.  Mid-summer is generally not busy on the courses, but it can be brutally hot!\n\nCheapest golf rates are typically Dec-Jan and Jul-Aug.  Highest golf rates are Mar-May and Sep-Nov.  Room rates tend to follow the beach season more than the golf season.\n\nIf you want to play 36 a day, you probably need to make all tee times in advance and at nearby courses . . . unless you go in the summer -- otherwise, you will run out of daylight.  Myrtle Beach National, Legends, Wild Wing, and others have groupings of excellent courses that would permit playing 36 even on short days.  But beware of frost delays in the winter -- a very common occurrence especially in clear weather.\n\nIf you don't have afternoon tee times, you can stop in at one the big golf stores in the morning and ask who has after-12 specials going on, because the courses often call the stores to promote those specials and it's much easier than calling around to find them.  I have used this often to select an afternoon 18 and save big bucks.\n\nI've never been really disappointed at any of the courses there, but some of my favorites are The Witch, Mooreland, Man O' War, and Tidewater . . . my least favorites include Wicked Stick and Azalea Sands, but even those were good courses (just not as good as some of the others IMHO).\n\nAnd lastly, I can also heartily recommend Kiawah Island just south of Charleston.  More $$$ than Mrytle, but absolutely wonderful golf courses, accommodations, and packages.  The Ocean Course is one place everyone should play at least once.\n\nHope this helps! 6

what happens to light when it's refracted?  Light can pass through anything transparent, eg space, air, water, glass etc.  In a vacuum, light travels at 300,000,000 metres per second.  However, when light penetrates e.g. glass, it slows down since it finds it more difficult to travel through it.\nWhen light enters a boundary (e.g. the water's surface) at an angle which is not perpendicular to the surface, refraction - the bending of light - is observed.  One common occurence of this is the fact that a drinking straw looks bent in a glass of water.\n\nRefraction is governed by Snell's law which states that Refractive index = sine angle of incidence/sine angle of refraction.  The Refractive index 'n' is a ratio of the speed of light in a medium when compared to the speed of light in a vacuum. n = c/ c in medium.\nA similar effect is observed when water waves travel from deep to shallow water.  The waves slow down but increase in amplitude (height). 2

Are there other books in the BIBLE that should be included in today's version of the BIBLE? Ever heard of the BOOK of ENOCH and other books that were supposed to be SCRIPTURES of old but then were not included because of CANONISM? If God can protect the ARK of the COVENANT back in the OLD TESTAMENT DAYS (HE struck dead those who touch it or see it) can same be true today of THE BIBLE which is the WORD OF GOD from any alterations or deletions? Is CANONISM divinely inspired or mere assembly of men practicing THEOLOGY... how can we know other books claiming to be God's word were true or false...aka. when other religions (Islam, Mormons, etc.) add several books to THE BIBLE... \n\nI'm a little confused here. I'm glad you asked this question.\n\nThere are several "apocryphal" books. Apocryphal is the word used that means basically "books that aren't concidered divinely inspired". These books were not excepted as scripture for two main reasons.\n1) As far as Old Testament books are concerned, books like "The Book of Enoch," "The Assumption of Moses" and "Odes of Soloman" amongst others, were never excepted even in Jesus' time by the Jews.\n2) In the New Testament, Jesus never refers to them in His teachings.\n\nI have read these books and you really have to take them with a grain of salt. There fantastic stories, but you cannot take them as you would what's in the Bible. I know that in the book of Jude he refers to a couple of them. But you need to realize that these "apocryphal" books do have truths in them, but they cannot be excepted as truth as a whole. Does that make sence? Jude was just pointing out a universal "absolute" truth that was mentioned in one of them.\n\nNow, beware, there are many New Testament "apocryphal" books too. "The Gospel of Thomas", "The Gospel of Mary Magdaline" and many others that are considered "gnostic" gospels. They were written decades after the supposed time the book itself says it was written. Besides that, they don't line up with what IS canonical. You really have to read the introductions the translaters make before you deside to read them.\n\nI do, however, have a recommendation. It is truly safe and helpful to read the writting of the "Early Church Father". This includes saints like Justin Martyr, Ignatious of Antioch, 1 Clement, 2 Clememt, (my favorite) Polycarp, all of these men were the disciples of the disciples and they have really alot of encouraging and helpful things to say about how church was when it was still a baby. \n\nThere is so much more that I would like to relay on this subject but I'm afraid that I'm taking to much of your time.  There is one other thing, for a good, easy reading book on the subject that will answer all of your questions I recommend a book called, "How we got the Bible" by Neil Lightfoot. You can find it at any Christian bookstore, and many secular bookstores too. 1

why ( l e s b i a ns ) hate men?  Here's where I choose to start my answer:\n\nLESBIAN is not an obscene word and does not need to be written the way you did to be posted.\n\nHere is how I will finish answering your question: Lesbians are people. They have different likes and dislikes like you do. No one person could tell you how such a large and diverse group of people feel about one issue, let alone why (or if) any of them do hate men.\n\nAnd here is the soapbox I'll step up on:\nYour question is prejudiced. You make an assumption that fails the logic test but passes the lumping test. There might indeed be some lesbians that hate men. I don’t know.\n\nAll lesbians can hate some men all of the time, and some lesbians can hate all men some of the time, but not all lesbians can hate all men all of the time.\n\nYour question is silly. 9

how do I beat depression while in college?  I understand your desire to stay away from\n"sledgehammer" solutions that involve powerful,\nsometimes untested prescription medicines. When it\ncomes to your health, remedies that are stronger are\nnot always better. I have three things that have\ngotten me through times when I've been depressed, and\nthey're all gentle solutions that I think will suit an\nintelligent person like yourself. \n\n1 - The first is what Freud calls the "talking cure".\nHe insists that it must be performed by a\npsychoanalyst who you are paying for, but actually\nI've performed it by writing in a diary. The key is to\nbe very honest, and try to find connections that you\nmight otherwise be supressing, because these are the\nareas that need work. For example, what's the first\nthing that pops into your mind when you think of\n"depression"? If the answer is "flying a kite", then\nfollow the chain... What do you think of when you\nthink of "kite" and "flying"... You'll be surprised\nhow quickly this takes you right down to an event in\nyour childhood or an unresolved conflict that might\nhave happened a year ago.\n\n2 - Looking for lies. A chair cannot make you\ndepressed. A lampshade cannot make you depressed. Only\nanother person can make you depressed. I believe it is\nbecause a chair and a lampshade cannot lie. Only a\nperson can lie. Depression, it seems to me, comes from\nbelieving a lie. That conflict (between reality and\nthe lie) takes up so much mental energy to maintain,\nit drains you as a whole. You may find, after using\ntechnique #1, that it leads to you to this conclusion\n#2. For example, after free associating your way to an\nevent, you might find that it was when someone told\nyou that you weren't worth a hill of beans. The\nproblem is not that they insulted you, the problem is\nthat you believed the lie. Beware, giving up on a lie\nthat we've believed in for a long time is tougher than\nit sounds.\n\n3 - This one is going to sound goofy, especially after\nwading in deeply with the other two techniques. Get\nsome light to shine on the cells in the back of your\neyes. Go outside for an extended period of time\nwithout sunglasses (no need to stare at the sun or a\nlight-bulb, indirect light will do). Use one of those\ngentle light therapy products like www.everlyte.com .\nTake a trip on a sailboat. Spend a few hours in open\nfields on sunny days. It's those cells in the eyes\nthat produce much of the chemical that pills and\nherbal remedies seek to replace, but the cells in the\neyes put the chemicals where they are needed, in your\nbrain, and not in your stomach and everywhere else.\nThis third technique will help you with the other two,\nallowing you to think clearly, and get out from being\nstuck in a loop.\n\nI hope this "whole-istic" answer is as helpful to you\nas it has been to me over the years. A gentle look at\nthe whole picture is often better than a sledgehammer\nto just one piece of the problem. 3

uses of pythagoras in daily life?  Typically the 3-4-5 triangle method is used during contruction of some sort where you need to ensure a right angle.  You often know the length of one side of something and want to know where to place the other side so that it is at right angles.  I used this to frame our basement walls so they would be "square" for drywalling and laying the floor. 2

Because when you are with him everything feels right and nothing can seem to go wrong and whatever you go through you know you can count on him to be there no matter if its raining or shining if your right next to him or half way around the world... \n\nthat you know his friends \nhe doesn't pick up the fone becasue he is with his love\nhe knows what your favorite author is and if you love dogs\nhe knows your parents and is on a first name basis and that he is around you and would do anything\n\nbasicly the realiest reason you can tell if he is in love with you is by the way he looks into your eyes and he can see what no one else can deep into your soul and mind and that can make your knees weak... 1

How do I design tables in an Access database? I've seen lots of theory but not a whole lot of good examples on the web.  I'm interested in creating a databse that I can use to keep track of employees' hours, vendor hours, invoices, and so on.

What's the best way to turn analog cassette recordings into digital files to burn onto CD? I have a large collection of Cassette tape recordings that I would like to incorporate into my CD/digital library.  I have burned a few by sending them through the sound card on my computer, but the input is mono, and the recordings sound really bad- muffled, half the harmonies lost because the send wasn't stereo.  Can anyone out there offer suggestions? If your sound card only accepts mono you will need to upgrade the card. Try this program first. It will automatically detect your sound cards capabilities and configure itself for maximum performance:\nhttp://www.soundrecorder.net/ 5

Will the Texas Rangers ever entice good pitchers, given that their ballpark is hitter friendly?  Since the move to the Ballpark at Arlington, the Rangers have had pitchers selected to attend the All-Star game, which suggests it's not a question of pitchers' willingness to play there, but greater concerns about contracts or the future of the franchise.  Kenny Rogers, Jeff Zimmerman, Aaron Sele, Roger Pavlik, and John Wetteland were all excellent All-Star selections in spite of the "hitter friendly" park.  It's more about the team and management that keeps pitchers away, and less about the stadium. 6

should i get my associates degree before i get my bachelors degree?  An Associate's (of Arts or Science) is not necessary to get a Bachelors degree.\n\nLet me explain it this way...\nStudent "A" just graduated high school and is admitted as a student at a 4-year university.  This university does not give Associate degrees, but only Bachelors.  So, "A" takes his/her GEs and major courses and graduates with a B.A. or B.S.\n\nStudent "B" just graduated high school, and gets admitted to a Community College.  The community college is a two-year institution which in completion of their program gets you an A.A. or A.S. and then "B" transfers his/her GE credits to a 4-year university as a Junior, and completes his/her degree in two more years to get a B.A. or B.S.\n\nNow, what you need to understand is that getting an Associate's. is not necessary to get a Bachelor's.  However, if you get an Associate's there will be some classes that DO NOT qualify as a transferrable GE units to a four-year university.  Say you graduate with an A.A. with 60 units, however 56 can only be transferred by the university's agreement with the Community College.\n\nBasically, if your goal is a Bachelor's, then consider an Associate's as a little gift from the community college before you leave for the university.  Sure, you need to take an extra few classes for it, but it's just a nice gift. 4
Why are leaves green? Is this question better than all the times we've been asked why the sky is blue?!!!!

Everyone uses O.K. but what do the letters O.K. stand for? K.O. is short for knock out, but O.K.? The history (if not the spelling!) of the term OK is largely debated. Some claim its derivation from the Chocktaw affirmative okeh, the Greek ola kalla, the Latin hoc ille -- all historically verifiable usages -- amongst others. It is argued that the cause of the success of the term in the US (regardless of its origin) is due to a fad of using initialisms during the 1830s and '40s. This fad of initialisms (eg: "TGIF", "FYI", "DIY") even went so far as generating letter combinations of intentional misspellings; popular ones were: "K.G.," for "know go," "K.Y.," for "know yuse," and "O.W.," for "oll write". "O.K." naturally followed, standing for "oll korrect". "O.K." is the only one that survived through the years, thanks perhaps to the precedence of the aforementioned affirmatives, but more certainly to the sloganeering during the presidential election campaign of Martin Van Buren. Born in Kinderhook, New York, Van Buren was nicknamed "Old Kinderhook" -- echoing the "oll korrect" initialism -- early in his political career. "O.K." became the rallying cry of the Old Kinderhook Club, a political organization supporting Van Buren during the 1840 campaign. H. L. Mencken would later describe term as "the most shining and sucessful Americanism ever invented." 6

Why do microscopes revert images?  Optics - microscopes and telescopes all invert the image because if they didnt, it would mean that another lens had to be added, increasing money cost. A lens is convex on both sides. That means the middle is thicker than the edges. A microscope or telescope has two lenses (basically).\nThe objective lens (usually larger and closer to the specimen or object) which allows the image of the object to be reduced to a smaller workable image inside the scope. This image is inverted inside the scope. It is also too small to see with the eye, so you need another lens, the eyepiece.  The eyepiece focus's your eye on the image and magifies it so you can see it. Every lens has a focal length, the point at which the image is formed away from the surface of the lens. 2
who is califia?  Califia (or Calafia) is the name of a legendary Black Amazon warrior queen, associated with the mythical Island of California. The legend of Queen Califia appears to date back to the novel Las Sergas de Esplandian (The Adventures of Esplandian), written around 1510 by the Spanish writer Garci Rodríguez de Montalvo.\n\nThe U.S. state of California is named for her (see Origin of the name California). The writer Patrick Califia also adopted her name as his surname. 1
Is an organic substance marked by containing carbon? I have an idea, but not sure please explain, I'm not 100% sure about my answer.  Thank You Yes and No...\n\nAll Organic Compounds contain Carbon, but not all compounds containing Carbon are Organic.\n\nas quoted from my source, listed below...\n\n"An organic compound is any member of a large class of chemical compounds whose molecules contain carbon, with the exception of carbides, carbonates, carbon oxides and gases containing carbon.The study of organic compounds is termed organic chemistry. Many of these compounds, such as proteins, fats, and carbohydrates (sugars), are also of prime importance in biochemistry.\n\nThe dividing line between organic and inorganic is contended and historically arbitrary; generally speaking, however, organic compounds are defined as those compounds which have carbon-hydrogen bonds, and inorganic compounds, those without. Thus carbonic acid is inorganic, whereas formic acid, the first fatty acid, is organic, although it could as well be called "carbonous acid" and its anhydride, carbon monoxide, is inorganic" 4

Should Arnold Swartzanager be president of the U.S.?  NO\nHe shouldn't even be Governor of California, much less the President. \nHe is a very troubled individual. Of course he doesn't think so and many others wouldn't because of his fame and fortune. But he has serious mental problems.\nHis dad was in the SS, his mother married another SS officer after his dad died. He is racist, as bodybuilders of his time went public on. He's a nazi sympathizer. He supports Kurt Waldheim who is proven to have committed Nazi war crimes. He admires Hitler. He wants be a dictator and he looks down on people who aren't powerful. He's abused anabolic steroids which leads to delusions of grandeur and of course roid rage. He degrades and harrasses women.\nThe list goes on and on and on.\n\nTo those who continually say he CANT be because the constitution, he and his elite connections (like Karl Rove, Orrin Hatch and many others) are pushing everything they can to get the constitution amended for him to be able to run. 10
Where can i buy the cheapest Viewsonic flat panel monitor? Either 17 or 15 inch. Preferably the 17. i would like a black one, and this doesnt have to be all fancy or anything, just has to be able to display stuff on the screen. Check out any number of Viewsonic monitors at Newegg, the cheapest 17" Viewsonic is $210 which is only $3 more than the 15".  And since you aren't going to be doing any gaming a 12ms response time should be fine and even that will show fast moving graphics just fine.\n\nYou said you wanted Viewsonic but I love Samsung LCD monitors I currently have three and one of them is over 4 years old and is still working like new, they are a little more expensive starting at $230 but they have one of the best warranties in the industry. 5
How many distinct species of life exist on Earth today? I know this will be an estimate, as no one has counted them all.   But I'm looking for the best estimate we have that includes all life (plants, animals, bacteria, etc.) Since Linnaeus began his work in the mid-eighteenth century, ~1.7 million species have been identified and described to date.  However, many of them have become extinct now.  About 10 to 100 million species are not discovered yet. 2

Why do electrical outlets have 2 different sized sockets?  Wall sockets have AC voltages, so there is no positive and negative.  One of the two prongs has what is called "Hot", and the other is called "Neutral".  The Neutral is connected to ground back at a distribution center, while the Hot is 110 Volts AC (in the U.S.).  By the time it gets to your home, the Neutral is not quite ground anymore, but is still relatively safe- wheras the Hot is quite dangerous and potentially deadly.\n\nSome appliances are designed to have extra protection between the Hot and people.  For example, a light socket has the 'threads' (the easily touched part) connected to Neutral.  As another example, most appliances and the light switches disconnect the Hot when they are off.\n\nThe different sizes of the sockets prevent you from plugging an applicance in backwords.  If you did this, then the switch would disconnect the Neutral instead, and leave the Hot on- making the device less safe. 2

Why do Americans hate France? Is it because they have culture and class? Someting non-existant in the USA.?  Of course the writer understands that her statement is an exaggeration and a blanket statement.Its meant to be understood in that light.What it is specifically,is an indictment of American arrogance and even more so the American mentality that our way is the only way.Your either with us or against us thinking.Read your tocqueville,our need to conform,to see that all around us conform as well.We glorify in the means,and not the ends of a good purpose.Were not cognizent of the existence of multiple paths to reach said good purpose,in other words tremendously narrow minded,judgemental about others ways and behaviours that dont coincide with our way of looking at things.Were trememdously materialistic to the point that we have become a nation of robotic convenience oriented worker consumers,as the process has meant for it to be.Were apathetic when it comes to our politics,our libertys.We leave these things to our policy makers,who believe me know what their best interest are.And they on the other hand know what their purpose is and believe the means always justify the ends.want a few more things, how about our education level compared to that of europe, (on the whole)how about this lovely trend of political correctness weve engendered throughout the world (to some degree)and american sensibilities that seem almost effemine,oh theyre heavy smokers ,oh my god,be a man.oh and as far as class goes partner ill bet that little lady has more class and probably more guts than a lot of people,who are afraid to disagree with the status quo. 1

what is the advantages of win2003 over windows NT?  Besides being more stable and having more security features (like most services turned off by default), Windows 2003 is supported.  Windows NT, and I'm assuming you mean NT4, is no longer supported.  This means no critical security patches and no support from Microsoft if something goes wrong.  If you are using this in a business environment, I recommend upgrading as soon as possible. 5

Send Holiday card or pull from list? My Aunt hates me so every year I send a Christmas card with a picture of my beautiful family to show them how happy I am.  Would I be better off pulling her from my list, or is it ok to poke at her once in a while? I would continue sending the cards (as long as there is nothing hateful nor taunting written in 'em...).  \n\nRegardless of whether they bring a warm feeling in her heart or make her cringe, I'm guessing either reaction would bring a smile on your face - so, why not?  ;) 1

Which Pacific state os the US are called the sandwich islands?  Captain James Cook named the Hawaiian Islands the Sandwich Islands in 1778, in honor of his supporter,  the Earl of Sandwich. \n\nHowever, the name of Hawaii was probably well established before Captain Cook came along. Here is some information on the origin of that name:\nI quote:\n"The Maori of Aotearoa (New Zealand) refer to Hawaiki as their place of origin, which may be an actual place or may be the concept of origin, or both. It does not refer to the Hawaiian Islands, but it is likely that Hawaiki and Hawai'i come from the same word or concept. As Polynesians migrated throughout the Pacific, many of the same place names were used, either as a reference to where the first settlers came from or because the new land had similarities to the former home. Which leads to the other possible origin of Hawaii. One of the legends credits a fisherman named Hawaiiloa with the discovery of the Hawaiian Islands."\nSource: http://www.hawaiischoolreports.com/symbols/origins.htm 2

What was the principal type of worship action in judaism of old, generally in connection with an altar?  Sacrifice. But it might interest you to note two things. \n\nFirst, most sacrifices offered had nothing to do with sin. There were all sorts of other reasons to offer a sacrifice, free-will offerings, thanksgiving offerings, just to name two of them.\n\nSecond, please remember that there was no need to offer animal sacrifices, a blood sacrifice was not necessary for the forgiveness of sin:::\n\nThe Bible describes blood sacrifices for the forgiveness of sin in the Book of Leviticus. But it is in Leviticus itself, in the middle of the discussion of the sin sacrifices, that we are taught that we do not need a blood sacrifice to be forgiven for our sins. Offering a blood sacrifice was an expensive thing to do for the family offering the animal. Was forgiveness then, to be only for the rich? No, because if one could not afford a blood sacrifice then one who sins could bring flour, which has no blood and no life as their sacrifice, and Gd forgave them!\n\nLeviticus 5:11-13; But if he be not able to \nbring two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, \nthen he that sinned shall bring for his \noffering the tenth part of an ephah of fine \nflour for a sin offering; he shall put no oil \nupon it, neither shall he put any \nfrankincense thereon: for it is a sin \noffering.\n\nFurthermore, read the Book of Jonah. In Jonah, the People of Ninevah do three things in order to be forgiven by Gd. They fast, they pray for forgiveness, and they stop doing the Bad and start doing the Good, and Gd forgave them! This is exactly what we do on Yom Kippur, we fast, we pray for forgiveness, and, hopefully, we stop doing the Bad and start doing the Good, and Gd forgives us. And what book do we read on Yom Kippur afternoon? The Book of Jonah!\n\nJonah 3:7-10 And he caused it to be proclaimed \nand published through Ninevah, by the decree \nof the King and his nobles, saying, Let \nneither man nor beast, herd nor flock taste \nanything; let them not feed nor drink water; \nbut let man and beast be covered with \nsackcloth, and cry mightily unto Gd; yea, let \nthem turn every one from his evil way, and \nfrom the violence that is in their hands. Who \ncan tell if Gd will turn and repent, and turn \naway from his fierce anger that we perish not? \nAnd Gd saw their works, that they turned from \ntheir evil way; and Gd repented of the evil, \nthat he had said that he would do unto them; \nand he did not do it.\n\nPlease notice that Jonah tells us that Gd saw their WORKS, their deeds, how they turned from their evil ways, and Gd forgave them. It does not say that Gd saw their blood sacrifice, they never offered one. It does not say that Gd forgave them because they had the right faith, but rather it says that Gd forgave them because of their deeds!\n\nFurthermore, Where were the sacrifices to have taken place? In the Temple built by Solomon. And what did Solomon himself say at the dedication of this very Temple where these sacrifices were to take place?\n\n1 Kings 8:46-50 If they sin against thee, (for \nthere is no man that sinneth not,) and thou be \nangry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, \nso that they carry them away captives unto the \nland of the enemy, far or near; Yet if they \nshall bethink themselves in the land whither \nthey were carried captives, and repent, and make \nsupplication unto thee in the land of them that \ncarried them captives, saying, We have sinned, \nand have done perversely, we have committed \nwickedness; And so return unto thee with all \ntheir heart, and with all their soul, in the \nland of their enemies, which led them away \ncaptive, and pray unto thee toward their land, \nwhich thou gavest unto their fathers, the city \nwhich thou hast chosen, and the house which I \nhave built for thy name: Then hear thou their \nprayer and their supplication in heaven thy \ndwelling place, and maintain their cause, And \nforgive thy people that have sinned against \nthee, and all their transgressions wherein they \nhave transgressed  1
Can we use mouse in FREEDOS??? From internet, I know that DOS and FREEDOS are almost the same thing. I do not know how to use DOS or FREEDOS and I want to buy a particular COMPAQ PC which gives FREEDOES instead of Windows. I know I can install Windows later, but if I am going to spend Rs 35,000 for a PC, I do not want to pay for Windows separately. As I am not familiar with FREEDOS, should go for it or should I ask the dealer to get me windows. Yes, but only with dos programs that use a gui. 5
Why do woman always think that they are fat.?  Women are programmed from birth almost to be Barbie-like - Look at all the magazines, tv shows, etc.  No one is, in reality as they appear in printed materials.  Have you ever looked at a Barbie doll without her bathing suit?  She has huge breasts and an unrealistically small waist.  If you ever have the opportunity to watch tv talk shows like Tyra - flaws are airbrushed away.  No wonder we have such bad body images! 3

what is ping attack.how can i protect from cloaking?  Ping is an Internet function where you send a message to an IP address that basically says: "Are you there?" and the computer will respond.  If you do this many times in rapid succession, the Internet connection will become so clogged with trying to make so many responses to you, that the communication basically breaks down.  Because this is possible, many sites protect themselves from ping.  I don't know what "cloaking" is, so I don't know how to answer that part of the question. 5
how to maintain right discipline?  There is no magic answer.\nWhat is it that experienced teachers do to keep good order? It might be to do with thorough preparation and oganisation, praise, reward, engagement with pupils, talking with pupils rather than to pupils, listening, humour, quick response to signs of disorder, consistency, sparse use of punishment and clear boundaries, etc. The list is long!\nExperience is a major aspect as is working in the same place for some years.\nAnybody will get fed up and restless with a diet of uninteresting, meaningless, academic stuff - especially if they can't understand it.\nEverybody responds well to stuff they enjoy, do well at ,is interesting and is relevant. 4
how to get project management skills ?  The Best way to get technical PM skills such as scheduling, risk assessment, and human resource Management is to take courses. There is a company called ESI that is one of the best known and in truth best at delivering these 3-5 day classes. They offer a series of 7 claases which if passed will count as a Masters Certificate in Project Management in affiliation with George Washington University. \n\nThe best way to get practical PM skills is experience. In fact the best part of the aforementioned classes is hearing the anecdotes of the other PM's and instructors in the class as to how they handled specific instances of a common event.\n\nWhen conducting interviews, I am far more concerned with a person's experience and leadership skills than a piece of paper that says they are PMI certified (Please note this is not to knock PMI certification), but a fact of what history has shown me to be most important. There is truly no substitue for experience ... 4

How Can the United States be considered a democracy when less than half the population votes? Most other democracies (including mine) have compulsory voting. Isn't it obvious that this gives 'the people' more of a say in government? First of we are a federal Republic.  A democracy doesn't exist.  A republic is a representative form of government where the populace votes for people to represent their views in government.  \n\nDemocracy is where everyone has a say in every decision.  This would never and has never worked, even in ancient Greece because women, children, slaves and convicts never were allowed to vote.\n\nEven with the day to day decisions the ancient Greecians had a ruling council. 10

Is it valid a contract written in spanish language in Florida, usa?  Contracts that are legally binding by law are valid regardless of what language they are written in. There are other requirements for a contract to be binding (i.e., both parties must have consented, and have the ability to consent under the law) yet language doesn't affect the binding nature of valid contracts legally entered into by both parties.  Yet for them to be submitted to a court that would require that the contract meet any guidelines established by the Courts in the jurisdiction. This may be that they be in English. If that's the case they would have to be translated, and most the translation will have to be notarized. 10

I think what's most important in this equation is you...\n\nThink of all your interests & ask yourself if any of those could be expanded into a business. Just keep in mind...what's your expertise? What are your interests? What could you imagine yourself doing?\n\nThen, once you have some ideas, research, research, research. Check out the competition -- their business practices, pricing, customer service, etc. And also think about what you could offer to set yourself apart from these other companies.\n\nCheck the sources for some handy sites.\n\nPrior to investing your time, money & effort into a business name, it is strongly advised that comprehensive research be conducted to ensure that the name you're interested in is truly available. \n\nThis entails searching the pending & registered Federal and State trademark files as well as the US National Common-Law files. Then, if clear, you can decide if you would like to file for a Federal or a State trademark. \n\nResearch is needed to make sure your trade name is legally available, before opening, before expansion, before incorporation or before designing your logo. Similarities in sound, appearance and meaning affect you too!\n\nThere are 16+ million trade names in use in the United States. Similar names matter, if close in sound, appearance or meaning. Similar names in related classes, distribution channels and customer matter too. You are affected by Common Law use (14 million), State Trademarks (500,000) and Federal Trademarks (2 million). 7

Sheik Ahmed Al Maktoum of the United Arab Emirates has won the first ever Olympic medal for the gulf nation in winning the double trap shooting event.\n\nMaktoum finished tied for 18th in the same event at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, and earlier in the Athens Games had finished 4th in the single trap shooting event.\n\nThe forty year-old Maktoum, is a member of Dubai's ruling family, and was educated in the United States, at Western States University in Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nNewspapers in Australia after the 2000 Sydney games reported that as the Sheik went through the airport in Sydney, he was asked for his flight number by Australian customs. His short answer was reportedly "No number, no airline, my plane." Customs then asked for the registration number of his plane which he didn't have. He then told customs officials that he had five planes, and he just phoned for one of them to come pick him. A 747 showed up to take him home.\n\nUnited Arab Emirates medal history in various games. 6
I am looking for items to decorate for a fundraiser for a woman who has had ovarian cancer.?  Any party is better with a theme.  Just pick one - cancer roundup (western), luau for hope, etc. Also, I was at a breast cancer fundraiser once, and it didn't have a theme, but everything was pink (for breast cancer awareness)- carpets, tables, cups, plates, balloons, flamingos, etc.  It was really nice.  I was at another one where they collected the names of friends and family that have died of cancer when you came in, then they wrote all of the names on luminarias and lit them all while they were asking for money.  It was pretty cool.\n\nAnyway, you are a good person for being involved. 3

the bible.....? ... indicates two events that took place where Jesus seems to have 'lost faith'. once in the garden at mount olive where he asks God to " remove this cup ", then on the cross when he asks why he has been " forsaken ". is there another interpretation for this? I am not a theologian.  However, I see these two events separately.  In the garden, Jesus demonstrated that he was fully human when he asked to be spared what was coming.  It was not a lapse of faith; it was pure human desire to escape the cruel suffering and death ahead of him, which he foreknew as part of his divine nature.  I personally think it takes real faith to speak to God about our deepest fears rather than trying to hide them under a false facade of bravado in obedience.  Jesus did what had to be done as an expression of his faith, even though his humanity feared the pain and the misery.\nOn the cross, he felt forsaken, because at that moment all the sin of all the people lay on him.  God could not look at sin, and it was the first time in Jesus' life that God's presence was lost to him.  Who wouldn't cry out?  It is not a denial of his divine foreknowledge, but it does express the reality of what he did.  It wasn't a show.  He really took my sins and yours to the cross, and he bore the shame and punishment that should have been mine and yours.  The real punishment of hell is separation from God, and that moment of separation is what we refer to in the Apostles Creed when we say "he descended into hell." 1

Why is evolution so widely accepted when it hasn't been proven for fact and remains a theory?  Most people 'accept' the 'theory' of evolution as being the prevailing theory at the moment.  That does not say they believe in it 100%.  However, in a biting retort, I could go on to say that the answer to your question is probably the same longing to make order of the universe that drives us to believe in gods and spirits, the existence of whom has never been proven. 2
How long does it take for chlamydia to cause permanent damage? I was just diagnosed with chlamydia (I'm really embarassed) and I don't know how long I've had it. So I was wondering if I could have serious damage done and how do I find out? There's no need to be embarassed.  You got during unprotected sex from a partner who didn't know they were carrying the disease.  \nMales can be asymptomatic carriers and give it to everyone with whom they have sex.  Yes, you could have experienced permanent damage already.  The recommendations of a doctor visit for a hysterosalpingogram (x-ray with dye) or hysteroscopy, should you eventually suffer infertility, are warranted.  Unless you are trying to get pregnant now, don't worry about it now.  The damage done now will still be there later.  Tubes don't "unscar" themselves.  Tell all your partners that you have been infected so they can be treated also.  And for goodness sake, don't have unprotected sex unless you both have been tested and are negative for STDs. 3

Doing homework vs doing work in class? No more homework in school debate.?  I think you are asking whether or not children should be permitted to work on their homework during school hours.  If that is not your question, then please rephrase it.\n\nIt seems there is no good reason why a student should not work on their homework during school hours if they have a free study period, or during lunch hour if they choose, so as to have more free time after school.  Indeed, I am at a loss to understand what arguments might be raised on the other side.  Of course, if a student is doing homework from one class while sitting in another class, and therefore not paying attention to the class he is in, that is not right, and the teacher would be justified in insisting he put it away and pay attention. 4

How do I add muscle to my fingers? I have long skinny fingers that always jam when Im playing football with my friends. I have pretty good technigue so it cant be that, so the next logical conclussion is that I have weak fingers. Does anyone know how to add muscle to ones fingers? Tightly grasping a tennis ball is a great way to build strength in your hands. Another way used -- especially by my high school basketball coach -- is to do fingertip pushups. Holding yourself in the pushup position perched on your fingertips. Both of these are great exercises for building strength in your hands (increasing the strength of your grip). 6

can having sex in the annus cause a person to infect HIV?  An@l, Vaginal and/or Oral Sex can cause a person to be infected with the HIV virus.  In addition you may be infected with a large number of other Sexually Transmitted Diseases.\n\nI have included information from a web page of the Center for Disease Control.\n\n"Can I get HIV from anal sex?\n\nYes. In fact, unprotected (without a condom) anal sex (intercourse) is considered to be very risky behavior. It is possible for either sex partner to become infected with HIV during anal sex. HIV can be found in the blood, semen, pre-seminal fluid, or vaginal fluid of a person infected with the virus. In general, the person receiving the semen is at greater risk of getting HIV because the lining of the rectum is thin and may allow the virus to enter the body during anal sex. However, a person who inserts his penis into an infected partner also is at risk because HIV can enter through the urethra (the opening at the tip of the penis) or through small cuts, abrasions, or open sores on the penis.\n\nNot having (abstaining from) sex is the most effective way to avoid HIV. If people choose to have anal sex, they should use a latex condom. Most of the time, condoms work well. However, condoms are more likely to break during anal sex than during vaginal sex. Thus, even with a condom, anal sex can be risky. A person should use generous amounts of water-based lubricant in addition to the condom to reduce the chances of the condom breaking." 3

what is the releationship bitween math and the universe? ex. if we move the earth only 1 cm away from its orbit it will freez and if we get it only 1 cn near the sun it will burn (give me similar examples) The universe exists as real matter in nature.  Math is used to produce idealized models of the universe so that we can understand it better.  Moving the earth closer or further from the sun one cm will in fact have a negligible affect but math can calculate the negligible effect given a formula that actually works for large changes, if you carry the calculations to enough decimal places. 2
what is the best way to get rid of oily skin?  Different products work for different people.  Benzoyl peroxide is the obvious one to try.  Salicylic acid is another.  There is another product that few people seem to be aware of.  It's no longer generally available in drugstores, but is available from drugstore.com and other online drugstores, called Acnomel.  It's a sulfur and resorcinol product that has been a lifesaver for me.  If you have serious cystic acne, then you should investigate Accutane.  I would have killed myself without it, but it has some risks and may not be available much longer. 3

What happened in the case of Penry vs. Lynaugh; in 1989?'? I'm doing a paper on this case for my Law and Society class and it's been extremely hard for me to find any information on this case. Any help would be greatly appriciated. Thanks you "Penry held that the applicaiton of the death penalty to persons who are metnally retarded but not legally insane does not violate the Eighth Amendment against cruel and unusual punishments."\n\nThis decision was later overturned by Atkins v. Virginia (2002), which ruled that "Executions of mentally retarded criminals are 'cruel and unusual punnishments' prohibited by the Eighth Amendment." 10

.SINCE CUSTOMERS KNOWN THEIR NEED AND WANTS THERE IS NO NEED FOR MARKETING DISCUSS?  Lets assume customers know all the products available in the market place. \n\nMost often there exists similar or substitute products in the market for example the chocolate market, Cadburys vs Nestle or in the soft drinks market Coca Cola vs Pepsi Cola or the car market. How would a potential buyer choose what brand to buy since it’s the same product? To answer this question we must think in marketing terms such as the 4 p’s which are product, price, place and promotion. \n\nPrice communicates a lot about the product such as, expensive means that the product is of the highest quality. Or cheap which can say – buy lots of me but don’t give it to your loved ones as a birthday present. \n\nPromotion is used to get customers to hear about the product and get them to try it. Product promotion is a strategy used to increase sales, increase product/brand awareness or get rid of stock. A product promotion could be a BOGOF (buy one get one free), by one get second half price, money off coupons, etc. These strategies are used to get customers to buy more of your product or simply try it for the first time.\n\nMarketing is the process of exchanging products or the art of persuading people to buy your product. I said exchange because a customer will exchange money for the product they are buying, with so many me too products in the market place a business has to do all it can to convince customers that their product is better than the competition for whatever reason, that’s the art of Marketing. Coming up with the right products, setting the right prices, selling the product in the best and most convenient places (having the product available for purchase), communicating the product to the public and convincing customers that your product is better then the competition is the art of selling. 7

"Why does the five year old that i watch daily keep saying he wants to kill himself? I have no idea where he is getting this from.  I keep a close watch on him during the day and we don't watch anything that is inappropriate. Although the earlier answers may be correct--that the child is repeating something he or she heard, or saw on TV, it is important to know that contrary to what was posted earlier, five year olds do experience depression and can be at risk of harming themselves. So it is important to tell the child's parents and encourage them to discuss this with a health care provider that is familiar with working with young children. A pediatrician can be a good first source if that is who parents are comfortable talking with, although I would hope the pediatrician would make a referral to a psychologist or child psychiatrist. \n\nYou should keep an eye on the child in your care. You are to be commended for being aware of the child's behavior and caring enough to seek an answer to this concern. 3

What are your views on The Bible? I have argued this over and over with many friends, relatives, &co-workers. Is the Bible true? Now I know there will be die-hard christians very mad at this...but take a second to think about it. It is a book, written by man. Ok, you say they are Prophets. How do we know this? because they said they were? Men wrote a book with MANY different stories in it. Don't you remember the game in Kindergarden where you whispered a secret all around the circle? How many times did that end the same as it started? NEVER. That's what happens when people put their interperatations on things. They could have blown these stories out of proportions. Plus, did you know there were parts of the "Prophet's Stories" left out, then reserface in Egypt after the Bible was published? Are we as humans just looking for something to believe in b/c it's "right" in our society?Or are we following our OWN beliefs? I think the bible is a book. Printed on paper made by men, with ink made by men, and full of fables and folklore written by men for the purposes of men. \n\nMany Christians hold to that book as though it is their "idol". They believe it so blindly that even if God itself were to come down and tell them that even ONE verse in it was wrong they would side with the "idol/bible" over God itself. 1
is there any other scientist greater than Einstein?  In a poll of the scientists at London's Royal Society, Einstein came in second to Sir Isaac Newton. So based, on their opinion, yes there is another scientiest greater than Einstein.

What will 7mm magnum do to deer versus a 30-30, both at same distance of 50 yards?  There are two issues at hand.  One is energy.  The other is momentum transfer.  \n\nHere are some muzzle energy for factory loads of the two rounds.\n\n30-30 factory loads:\n150 grain round - 2,390 fps - 1,902 ft. lbs energy\n170 grain round - 2,200 fps - 1,827 ft. lbs energy\n\n7mm factory loads:\n140 grain round - 3,400 fps - 3,593 ft. lbs energy\n160 grain round - 3,200 fps - 3,637 ft. lbs energy\n\nThe 7mm clearly has the uupper hand here.  However, that energy needs to be delivered to the deer to be effective.  Or more correctly, the momentum of the round needs to be transfered to the deer. \n\nThis is where, for example, hollow points are preferable to full metal jackets.  The hollow point will cause the bullet to mushroom giving it better momentum transfer properties (and therefore knockdown power).  FMJ rounds tend to go straight through causing somewhat less damage because of less momentum transfer.\n\nYou want a careful balance here.  Too much energy in too small an animal will make things, let us say, much messier.  All you want is a clean take. 2
why isn't there number 7 in ncaa basketball?  In the NCAA and most high school athletic associations, no individual digit in a number that has to represented by more than one hand is allowed. \n\nThis is to make things easier for the refs when they have to signifiy numbers to the scorers table. This is important, especially when crowds can make vocal communications difficult.\n\nDouble digits are ok as long as they don't included a 6, 7, 8, or 9. Also, you'll realize that there are no tripple digit numbers, because that would take 3 hands to represent by the referees when calling numbers for fouls.\n\nThe NBA tries to hold by this rule, but it will allow exceptions. 6

In Illinois, can a townhome association prevent you from having a satellite dish, like Dish Network?  Most likely - you would have had to sign an agreement with the association when you purchased the townhome. It would have included a clause regarding the exterior appearance of your unit. A satellite dish mounted on the outside of your house would certainly effect the appearance, and thus would fall under the agreement. 10

how do you know its true love?  True Love ....\n\nIt's as mysterious as the stars it was written on, as elusive. It is everything it's hyped about to be. It's worth taking every risk, it's worth fighting for, and the problem is if you don't risk all then you risk even more. Love is kind of an elixir that lures us out of reality and into the realm of fantasy. It's like a drug creating an altered state of consciousness.\n\nLove is the moment when an unfavorable act becomes favorable, when you make excuses for some one else's mistakes, when you learn to tolerate, when you learn acceptance, when sacrificing becomes the beauty of life. \n\nIt's the courage to tell the truth especially when you believe its unspeakable.\n\nIt's the time when seeing some one, being seen by some one and thinking about some one feels good, when you learn to find happiness in the smallest of moments.\n\nThat's love--when you learn to put down your ego and love some one more than that.\n\nLove is forgetting your self and remembering some one else. \n\nLove is choosing your partner exactly as he is, and supporting him in his choices. It's honoring your partner's truth and wanting best for him.\n\nIt's not controlling or possessing but rather respecting and trusting.\n\nIt does not mean owning some one, getting some one, rather it means being happy in your loved one's happiness.\n\nLove means living without judgments. It means treasuring your beloved and never taking him for granted. \n\nLove means being able to forgive and learning to give more then you get. It means reaching out when you don't want to, communicating rather than assuming and asking questions rather than jumping to conclusions.\n\nIt means working things out rather than fighting, fighting rather than leaving, and staying through the hurts and disappointments, knowing that through commitment all can be healed. \n\nFalling in love is like being enveloped in a magical cloud. The air feels fresher, the flowers smell sweeter, food tastes more delectable, and the stars shine more brightly at night. You feel light and lofty as though you are floating through life, and your problems and challenges suddenly seem insignificant and easily surmountable. Your body feels alive, your skin tingles and you awaken in the morning with a smile on your face. You are suspended in a state of supreme delight.\n\nLove is a feeling and an action that arises from the most primal place within us. Making a relationship however, is a process that is learned. A relationship is the vessel that carries the precious cargo of love through time.\n\nRelationships are like a precious antique lamp; it takes a little polish and some effort to restore it to its valuable condition. A relationships love and luster will only improve with age if you continually give it the care that keeps it beautiful. But once you uncover its essential beauty it will bring you joy for years to come.\n\nAfter having said all this I want to say that you have to make the decision on your own, on one hand love is magic, on the other it's time tested relationship worked hard and furiously at. 9
Is it true that wikipedia equals the prestigious encyclopedia britannica? (in terms of quality)?  I think Wikipedia is the most recent encyclopedia there can ever be, and that is good for current-events quality. However, Wikipedia is increasingly prone to pranksters who manipulate entries for fun. For example, imagine what Bill Clinton-haters would do to change his biography in Wikipedia. Though quality overall is great for Wikipedia, the Encyclopedia Britannica is much more secure than a site everybody can edit. 4

what are some potenciol problems for the desert?  Some of the biggest problems facing the desert are habitat destruction, damage from excessive use and pollution.  As technology gets better, people are better able to have a comfortable life in the desert thus opening areas that have not previously been seen as valuable living space.  Despite appearing to be mostly dead, deserts are actually fragile ecosystems and something as simple as footsteps can cause damage that can take years to reverse. There are areas of the Mojave desert where the desert is still scarred from tank training in World War II.  Since deserts were seen as dead places in the past, they have long been used as a dumping ground for toxins which are now seeping into the environment. 2

How are dogs like skunks?  both creatures have anal glands that produce a strong smelling liquid. the difference is that skunks can spray from those sacks at will, while dogs generally have some come out every time they defecate, leaving a territorial marker for other animals to find.

how do i remove kazaa totally? end now pops up when logging on,also freezing up Kazaa puts little backup files all over your drives so it can still run when it gets deleted from the desktop. The best way I found to delete these programs is to go to search and enter in Kazaa. Look through the desktop and the drives. It is pretty madening work. Kazaa, Limewire and other downloads, find ways to put itself everywhere so it can run and downlaod and share when your not looking. Get it off the desktop first then go to search. Once you deleted it there, be sure to go to recycling bin and eliminate it off there! Kazaa is a pest! Next time, don't download these programs without the right information about it. Good Luck! 5

what is the correct definition for fruits and their differences against vegetables?  There are many ways of defining both "fruit" and "vegetable," but here's the critical relationship between the two: Some fruits are vegetables, but not all vegetables are fruits.\n\nA fuit is a particular part of a plant -- the fleshy, seedbearing body. Apples, bananas, and tomatoes are all fruits.\n\nA vegetable can be just about any edible part of a plant: the leaves (lettuce), buds (brussels sprouts), stem (celery), root (carrot), or fruit (tomato). Vegetables are usually savory, not sweet -- but not always (yams, for example). 4

Why are we not so worried about blue shifted stars and galaxies?  Blue shifting galaxies are ones that are headed more towards us than away. The spectrum we see from a galaxy is a combination of its more or less random speed relative to us due to interations with other galaxies, and the redshift from the expansion of the universe.\n\nUnless a galaxy is very close, the redshift expansion will dominate so that only redshifts are detected.\n\nThe big exception is the Andromeda galaxy, which is a spiral just like the Milky Way galaxy, and a "mere" 2.9 million light years away and is the closest big galaxy to ours. \n\nIn terms of being worried about it well...Andromeda is heading out way, and well collide with the Milky Way Galaxy in about 4 billion years or so.\n\nThat means is one were to stand on Earth or Mars the sky would be increasingly taken up by the fuzzy blog of Andromeda until suddenly (relativity speaking) the whole things is a huge explosion of stars.\n\nNot a literal explosions. Stars are very far apart from each other relative to their size, and about zero stars will actually collide. 2

Why are we having all the hoopla about the word Christmas versus holiday etc. No holiday without Christmas.?  As an evangelical Christian (speaking only for myself), I can honestly say that I think most people are getting way too worked up over this issue.\nThe reality is that much of what we associate with Christmas in America (trees, lights, shopping, Santa, etc), has little to do with Jesus or the Bible; and no, Dec 25th is not a Biblical date.\n\nUnfortunately, people (who might or might not be followers of Jesus Christ), tend to get very outspoken about their 'faith' when the issues involve tradition or political policies, but flatly ignore Jesus' commands to share the Gospel, help the poor, etc.\n\nI do think that much of the Christian community's public reaction to this issue is a result of frustration with our "political correctness"-obsessed society.  We are under increasing pressure to keep our beliefs to ourselves (although our God and our consciences clearly tell us to do the opposite).  We often feel that we're being asked to concede our 'free speech' rights in order to avoid offending someone, while also being asked to tolerate other people's statements that are very offensive to us.  All the frustration comes out in these highly-publicized and 'easy' issues.\n\nBottom line:\nIt's easier and less controversial to say "Jesus is the Reason for the Season", than to say "God came to earth as a man, died on the Cross in payment for your wrong-doing, and rose to life again so that you can have eternal life with God." 7

How do you change a decimal to a fraction in simplest for? I need the answer around today. A decimal is just a fraction over 100.  So 75% is the same as 75/100.  Then to reduce it to its simplest terms, you find the number (in this case 25) by which both numbers can be divided and have whole numbers as a result.  75 divided by 25 is 3; 100 divided by 25 is 4.  So my example is equal to 3/4.  Once I get that far, there are no further factors (even dividing numbers) that 3 and 4 have in common, so I have reduced the fraction to its lowest terms.  75% is therefore equal to 3/4.\n\nIf the decimal value includes further decimals (as in 37.5%) you start with enough extra zeros to cancel out the decimal.  So, in this example 375/1000.  Then reduce.  Go ahead; it won't bite you.\n\nOK.  You don't know what numbers to use.  Start with 5, because it will work:  75/200.  Well, now I see I can use 25 again:  3/8.  And we've once more gone as far as we can. 4

why hitler hates the jews? any1 know anything about that .. please help me Primarily because it was popular to do so at the time.  Hitler believed in a conspiracy theory that said the Jews wanted to take over the world.   Hitler wrote (well he dictated it and it was heavily edited) called Mein Kampf - My Struggle in English, that does shed some light on his anti-Semitism (hating of the Jewish people)  I've included some resources below that may help you in your research. \n\n(I am not Jewish, but in an effort to be unbiased I must disclose that I do have Jewish relatives. The links I provided I have found personally useful and I find their coverage of the Holocaust to almost universally accepted.  There are however small groups which feel that the Holocaust never happened.  You will have to draw your own conclusions.  I was not alive then but the historical records and primary source material I have consulted have convinced me of the horrible reality of the Holocaust or Shoah.) 4
What do the colors on Burundi's flag represent? Report due tomorrow plz help!!! Thanks!!!! The three stars in the centre of the flag officially refer to the three words in the national motto “Unité, Travail, Progrès” (French for “Unity, Work, Progress”). The three stars are also said to represent the three ethnic groups who live in Burundi: the Hutu, Tutsi and the Twa. Burundi has a similar ethnic mix to Rwanda and has similar problems. The Twa are a pigmy race. The red in the flag stands for the independence struggle, the green for hope and the white for peace.\nStuart Notholt, 12 Mar 1996 10
If the function y=2x+5 is changed to y=4x+5, what will be the effect on the graph?  Since the slope is higher, the line would be steeper. Y-intercept is still 5. X-intercept would change: the equation y=2x+5 has an x-intercept of -2.5, while the equation y=4x+5 has an x-intercept of -1.25. 2
why does a battery in the freezer have a higher voltage? i am comparing batteries which has a higher voltage in either inside,outside,fridge,and freezer Batteries are self-contained chemistry sets, and chilling a battery slows down the reactions within that are slowly breaking down the alkali fluid, thereby preserving the electrical charge longer.\n\nLet's learn about electricity. Electricity is energy released from electrons travelling between atoms. Electrons can travel through any medium (air = lightning, you = electrocution), but they like conductive metals like copper the best, where they travel in a circuit, or a giant circle, between their origin and their destination. Electrons are stored in a battery like a sponge holds excess moisture.\n\nWithin a battery is a chemical (usually an alkali or an isotope-based solution) that retains electrons within like a sponge. Let's just say that battery fluid has properties about it that make it great for retaining excess electrons.\n\nWhen you chill a battery, you slow down the breakdown of the chemical within the battery housing (it will eventually break down into water + a precipitate), thereby preserving the charge that stores electrons. \n\nAnd remember, electrons in motion = electricity. 2

Why is answers so addicting? Yahoo even knows it's addicting because they cut you off after ten questions or answers. Good news for you, get to higher level of points and you can answer more questions!  I think it is addicting because it is personal and interactive.  I used to spend hours looking at crap on ebay.  It was interesting, but not very enlightening.  It also could cost me money, because if you look long enough you find something you just gotta have.  I like answers because it involves me, not like watching televison.  It's fun, it's free, and sometimes if you try hard you get the feeling that you might have actually helped another human being.  Of course being silly is also fun.  Welcome to the community. 3
A 13th riddle again.? James ordered a fishing rod, priced at $3.56. Unfortunately, James is an Eskimo who lives in a very remote part of Greenland and the import rules there forbid any package longer than 4 feet to be imported. The fishing rod was 4 feet and 1 inch, just a little too long, so how can the fishing rod be mailed to James without breaking the rules? Ideally James would like the fishing rod to arrive in one piece! One possible solution:\n1.Make a box of 4 feet length.\n2.Put the rod in the box\n3.the rod will itself fit in the box if you will tilt it slightly upwards. 8

what is rar?  1. What is a RAR file\n\nRAR is the native format of WinRAR archiver. Like other archives, RAR files are data containers, they store one or several files in the compressed form. After you downloaded RAR file from Internet, you need to unpack its contents in order to use it. \n2. How to handle RAR files\n\nWinRAR provides the complete support for RAR files, so you may both create and unpack them. If you installed WinRAR on your computer and downloaded RAR file from Internet, you may double click on RAR file icon to open it in WinRAR, select all files, press "Extract To" button, enter a destination path and press "OK". Another way is to click on the RAR file in Explorer using the right mouse button. If you enabled "Shell integration" option when installing WinRAR, the file context menu will contain "Extract to ..." item. \n\nSome RAR files can be parts of multi-volume sequences. In WinRAR you can split a huge archive to a few smaller files, which are called volumes. They may have extensions .rar (the first volume), .r00, .r01, ..., or .part1.rar (the first volume), .part2.rar, ..., etc. If you need to unpack volumes, place all them to the same folder and start extraction from the first volume. \n3. RAR versus ZIP\n\nComparing to ZIP file format, RAR provides a number of advanced features: more convenient multipart (multivolume) archives, tight compression including special solid, multimedia and text modes, strong AES-128 encryption, recovery records helping to repair an archive even in case of physical data damage, Unicode support to process non-English file names and a lot more. 5

How would you interpret a soldier being "caught in the rift" during the Eisenhower term? I interviewed a lady for a school project who told me her husband was caught in the rift.  He was in the military out for 16 months and then went back in, not able to keep his same rank and previous time served did not count either and she explained this by him being "caught in the rift." when the numbers of the military are drawn down like after a war it's called a reduction in force "RIF" or slang "rift" 10
My can't the US drop a nuclear bomb on Iraq and end the war like they did in Japan?  first problem would be where to drop the Nuke, there is no center of activity for the terrorists, they move around, and there are many factions, one faction may be completely obliterated another may give themselves up but there are always more.\nSecond problem is that they dont have one leader, one person they will follow, in WWII there was a leader, the primeminister of Japan, he surrendered and the rest of the country did. In Iraq, Saddam is captured but they still fight, so this is obvious that they wont give up.\nThird, if you drop nukes on the offending areas (areas with insurgents) it will turn the Middle East's opinion against us(we would be dropping the bomb on Sunni areas and the majority of Middle Easterners are Sunni*) this would not be good at all for overall US policy in the area, the US would lose barganing power with any other Middle Eastern country\n\n*there are different factions of Muslims, Sunnis are the majority in the area, but Shittes are the majority in Iraq and the Shittes were oppressed by Saddam, that is why the Shitte areas are not violent as of now in Iraq 10

Are the fitness benefits of the YMCA worth the high cost of membership? I know the YMCA does a great job with charitable programs. As a social worker, I really appreciate their dedication to the communities in which they serve. I've never worked out in their gymns, so I'm not sure if the high cost of membership is, in purely fitness terms, a good deal. Is it? I agree that in comparison to other gyms, the YMCA is higher. But, I've found that unlike other gyms they have more programs for families. i.e. kids basketball, flag football, swimming programs, summer camps. They also are more community oriented in the respect that if you want to use their facilities for some type of gathering, they'll usually let you. Most other gyms are just that...gyms. If you have a family, you can really get your moneys worth, if you are just looking to workout, it might be better to join another gym. In all honesty, it boils down to personal preference. 3
Why are Gov. worried abt d no; of death 4rm smokin  & drinkin 4 adults but are not bottered  about abortion?  When you have an abortion, it generally only kills one being at a time.\n\nSmoking harms the health of everyone around you, and drinking to excess can kill one or many people at a time, depending who's abusing it and when.  \n\nIf you were on a trans-Atlantic flight, you wouldn't care if your pilot had an abortion; however, if she went on a drinking binge just before climbing into the cockpit, you'd be more than a little worried. 10
How do a MIRROR works ?  The basics...\n\nBackground:\nLight from the sun, light bulbs, etc. hit objects.  That light is reflected off but as a color which is a specific wavelength of light.  Our eyes get those reflect wavelengths and that's how we see.  Different color objects reflect light as different wavelengths.\n\nMirrors:\nMirrors reflect light off of them just like any other object.  The difference is mirrors reflect the same wavelength that hit them.\n\nSo, images seem to reflect when looking at a mirror.\n\nThere is a lot more too it but that is the basics. 2

As for a firewall program, use ZoneAlarm (free, www.zonelabs.com); in my opinion the best free program ever made. 5

Why are so many blacks calling each other the N-word when they hate it so much? Seems like a double standard.? Even the mayor of New Orleans called it a "chocolate" city. From my perspective, it has nothing to do with any one person or group finding a term "offensive."  It has everything to do with wanting POWER.\n\nOne form or POWER is the "double standard," in which one group of people can engage in some activity or speech which another group cannot.  \n\nThere have been double standards since the dawn of time, and to this day, you will hear women complain about the double-standards about men's sexual behavior and their general assertiveness as compared to that of women.  \n\nA newer incarnation of the double standard is political correctness, in which one group of people attempt to control and limit the words or thoughts of another.\n\nWhen one group can effectively limit the ability of of another to do the same, the first group "feels" a sense of control or power.  I say "feels" because any such quest for power, based in the desire to forbid another person from saying a particular 6-letter word is a misguided and inconsequential exertion of power.  it really changes nothing (at least in the short term).  About the only thing it accomplishes is inflicting a sense of guilt on the intended target.  If you're motivated by guilt, it has worked.  \n\nIn the scheme of things, it's minor.  You can choose to fight it if you want, but to do so involves incurring the wrath of a politcally-correct society, who has accepted, for whatever reason, the argument from the messenger that this restriction should be enforced, not legally, but socially, via scorn, derision and ostracization.  That may mean losing friends, losing your job, or quite possibly losing points on Yahoo Answers (or even your entire account).\n\nSo that's the way I see it.  And If the people who are trying to control the speech, be they black or female, or whatever, really look at it objectively, they can't help but admit that there's a grasp for a modicum of power involved. 1
I have a plan for running, please help!? I am in 8th grade and run a 26:06 5k. The cross country season is over this year. I need to think about the high school team. I know it is not a sport where you can get cut, but I want to be the best runner on the team. We will run 5k races. If now I have a 26:06 and during the summer break, (mid-June thru mid-September)I want to run 15k a day, 5k in morning, 5k in afternoon and 5k at night by mid-September how fast will I be able to run a 5k? Thank you for your help!!! Whoa! Slow down, there. It'd be awesome if you trained that much, but you've got to do some cross-training (some weights, some biking, some swimming) or you could get stress fractures from all that running. And you've got to gradually increase the distance you run. It's no good if you suddenly ramp up to 15k a day.\n\nIf you train consistently, though, and don't run into any problems (no pun intended), you might cut your time by 4 or 5 minutes. It's really hard to say, though. 6

What colors are most common (in order) on flags of the nations? Red, White and Blue seem popular.  But what colors are most popular? This was actually a question at the quiz night last week.  I was nearly certain it was white.  I was wrong.  The answer was red. \n\nBut, if you go to ivan sarajčić's flag identifier page and search the flags by color yeilds 611 with blue, 708 flags with red on them and 813 with white (those are the top 3).\n\nWorld Flags 101 has this to say:\n"Red is the most popular color being found on approximately 75 per cent of all national flags of the world. White is present on about 70 per cent of the flags and blue is common on approximately 50 per cent of the flags." 10

Is there any reason to keep the Electoral College, or is it an outdated part of government? I understand why we can't elect or vote solely on popular vote. I think it is completely outdated for an era in which information spreads so quickly and easily. THe Electoral College was envisioned for an agrarian society in which the masses were not "trustworthy" enough to select a president. The electors were supposed to actually select the president. Nowadays, the electoral college is a rubberstamp that could go awry. See also: Bush/Gore 2000 election 10

Is war wrong? I am against war. First of all, just becasuse natrually people are a jealous virus to this planet or get upset because of another country's doing, dosen't mean they should attack and kill hundreds! I mean, does anyone even care about the poeple on the other side. And, why does the people that win get to write the history. For example, if you are Texan you hear of Antonio de Santa Anna as a horrible person... but in Mexico he helped alot of people, and he invented gum. Second of all, it has been hundreds and hundreds of years since we have been here, so why do we still do war and other stupid things? Why can't we just get it in our tiny little peanuts-of-brains that war is almost all bad? The only thing it get's us is death, more death, freaked out people, more land that other people then try to take over or liberate, and destruction! When President Jimmy Carter won his second Nobel Peace Prize on the eve of War with Iraq he quoted some one else who said, “War is sometimes a necessary evil, but it is always evil.”\n\nSo war is evil, does that make it wrong?  If some one is exterminating people based on religion is that a cause enough for war?  If some one crashed four airplanes into a countries most strategic buildings is that enough reason to go to war? If a some breaks into your house is defending yourself reason enough to be war like?  War and war some acts are not wrong, necessarily. \n\nI’ve even seen a bumper sticker that says war never solved any thing but:  Nazism, salver, communism, oppression, and taxation without representation.\n\nSo short answer, no war is not wrong.  Starting a war is. 10

Will the Seahawks make it to the Superbowl? Are they underrated or overvalued? I would say yes.  Things to think about.  Seattle has been without #1 WR D. Jackson and thier passing attack had been hampered by that.  He might play this week giving him time to get back into the offense.  The Seahawks right now have a #2 WR( Bobby Engram)acting as #1 and #3 WR (Joe Jurevicius) acting as #2.  Add big TE Jeremy Stevens into the mix as the usual #4 he really has been the #3 since Jackson was out.  \nOn Defense the secondary must stay heathly with Herdon, Dyson, Howell, Hamlin, Sharper out they need the bye in the first round to mend some wounds.  Add in the best pass receiver and that will open the running attack and the Seahawks would not have to depend as much on the running game.  The D is young but is playing inspired in the red zone they are giving up yards but not many points.\n\nQwest field was a big home field advantage in the Giants game.  Look for the same in the playoffs. 6

I hate sports, football mostly, does that make me un-American? I have my reasons--mostly monetary, immature unprofessional celebrity status for childhood games players.  The olympics, now, THOSE are athletes.  Why support wife-beaters and jerks who are washed up when they are 40? Well at least it makes you uncapitalistic. Follow this line of logic. Wherever you have a need (in this case entertainment) you have people willing to spend money. So you hire people to support this need (athletes) and pay them a percentage. The NFL is a multi-billion dollar business. It's only fair that these athletes take their percentage.\nI think you are way over generalizing athletes. While there are certainly selfish immature players. There are also classy, generous, respectable athletes as well, It's just that the more immature players tend to stay in the public eye do to their hijinks.\nNow the olympics are a complete abomination. They secure television contracts, charge unGodly prices for seats, yet they don't even pay the participants that make the olympics a reality. How is that fair? \nIt's not wrong to be rich. To make the money you earned. It's wrong to be an child and a thug. But these two things aren't really even related. 6

do i have instant messages?  If you gotta ask...no. IMs work with a chat host eg: yahoo! Instant Messenger (IM) AOL (AIM) and the like. You download these applications and set them up with a screen name that you have to let other people know so they can "talk" to you online. The program automatically lets you know when someone has written you. Hence the term INSTANT message. If you gotta ask that question, the answer is no. 8

From getting the pole, to winning the race, a total of 4 drivers give you points race after race.\n\nNote:Only the races that count to the Nextel Cup standings are included in the fantasy league. 6

who the best ronaldo or beckham? and why? my mail is menoo_mony2005 You can't compare these guys, they play in different positions that need different abilities and skills, but theoretically I think Beckham is better and has more abilities and can be more effective.

How do you stop the veer out of the wishbone formation?  The veer is one of the nastiest plays to defend against because of the possibilities. However if you can stop it if you have fast lineman and your linebackers can make good quick tackles. Then its a matter of persuing them and having the far side end contain incase of a possible reverse (very unlikely but you never know) and the rest of the lineman shift down teh line to prevent a cut back, then teh lineback must stay in between the quarterback and the running backs running lane because this will force the quarterback to make a desicion to dump it off of keep it. However, because the defensive line is sliding down the line, the lineback can cheat a bit towards the running back because if the quarterback keeps it then the line will get him. If he dumps it off, the linebacker will be there to tackle him right away. They only flaw in this would be if the linebacker reads the play wrong and thinks the quarterback is just keeping it leaving the running back wide open. 6
Have you had any side effects from the anticonvulsant/mood stabilizer Depakote and how have you coped with it? Also please tell me how much you are taking and for how long. Thanks! I've taken 1500 mg of depakote daily for a while.  I'm not sure the exact time as we've been experimenting with doseages/meds for 14 months (since my diagnosis).  I currently take 500mg morning, noon, and night.  the three doses really help with stability and side effects.  I have also taken 1000mg (no effect for me), 1250 mg (made me cycle rapidly), and 1750 (made me depressed) in the past 14 months.\n\nSide effects:  I had stomach irritation and headaches (not severe) the first few weeks while first starting the medication.  I also experienced weight gain right away, but I can't accurately tell how much.  I started Depakote the same time as Zyprexa (big weight gainer) and gained a dozen pounds the first week.  After the first few weeks on this drug (and Zyprexa) the weight gain stopped, but I was not able to lose it even with diet/exercise.  It took getting rid of the Zyprexa to be able to actually lose a little of the weight, but it was hard.\n\nCheck out www.remedyfind.com  it has a great collection of people's experiences with different drugs 3
Do you think by expressing our opinions regarding Islam will put end to the sufferings? In old Europe, several died and killed, because they expressed their opinions toward Catholic christianity at that time, however after years, they got the fruits and were able to make peaceful societies, do you think this could succeed,if we applied it on Islam?  \nNOTE: I'm not saying Islam is bad, I'm saying some beliefs in Islam which cause sufferings to alot like me.  and please I'm talking about Islam not Muslims. I think what cause our suffering is fanaticism, if we can end fanaticism with any means it will surely end up some of our suffering.\nBut do you think expressing our opinions regarding Islam will end fanaticism?\nMaybe it will lighten up some dark parts of Islam and different versions of it, Islam of Saudi Arabia and Sufi people are not comparable, I mean according to Saudi Arabian definition maybe they are atheist. Even it can show how many peaceful muslims are around the world who can't hurt an insect.\nOn the other hand it may brings more hate, you must be careful(I don't mean in this forum, this is a simple Q&A and have a certain users which are mostly open minded people) but if you want to end suffering and not more suffering you should not hurt other people feelings. 1

What is the most dangerous thing you ever made? i've falled from 11m... ok, didn't end up making it because it would probably have burnt down my HS football field, but senior year in AP physics after the AP test was over we were told we were going to make rockets.  Then he tells us they're only water pressure rockets.  So my friend and I got pissed because we thought we were going to be able to make real rockets, so we decided we should make ours blow up in mid-air since we were seniors anyway, it was the end of the year, and we were already accepted to college. We wanted to go out with a bang :p  so after discussing it for awhile, we were going to fill up one of the bottles used for structure inside the water-pressure rocket with methane gas right out of the stove, and then put a remote-control car in there with it.  When the rocket was released and at its maximum height, we were going to press the accelerate button on the remote, causing the spark necessary to cause the gas to explode.  Bam, huge ball of flame over the football field.  We didn't do it, we got too scared that burning pieces would come down and land on someone, or burn down the football field, which is where we were testing the rockets. 7

my child has recently been diagnosed with a disability. where can i find information on financial help?  go to www.socialsecurity.gov and from there click on social security office locator. you can get up to $832 a month tax free money when you or your child or anyone have a disability. I have a disability and i get 832 a month. they pay ssi + social security disability. hope this helps! good luck. Hi also... it's always better to have proof of the disability such as a doctor's proof or diagnosis. Apply at your local social security office and you can call them first. i'm in california and different states pay different amounts but they pay enough money and depending on how severe the disability is and how long it lasts you can get it from 3+ years till your child dies. 3

what should i say to an employer who lead me to believe i had the job??? I was hired as a bartender..i worked a shift and did a really good job my first night. Now, they didn't have me on a schedule. Yesteday i get a call saying i did a great job blah blah blah,but another girl came back and is a single mother and needs the money. What he doesn't know is that i have 2 kids and a husband in school. I feel i should tell him face to face how i feel and ask him why he had me come in and work in the first place?? I feel used in a way..any suggestions on this issue?? You're correct: you were used.  If you have proof that you were actually hired, you can probably sue for wrongful discharge. Firing because "another girl came back" isn't acceptable cause for dismissal.\n\nThe definition of wrongful discharge is: When an employee is fired for reasons that are not legitimate, typically either because they are unlawful or because they violate the terms of an employment contract. The contract can be either expressed or implied.\n\nIf you have a case, what you can recover may not be worth the effort, but a free consultation with a lawyer only costs you an hour of your time. 1

What percent of Americans celebrate Christmas? This war on Christmas is ridiculous- what percent of americans celebrate this holiday?\nI do- and I am proud to :-) Great question, and I am with you...here are some stats based on a 2003 FOX News national poll conducted December 3-4 by Opinion Dynamics Corporation. \n\nPolling was conducted by telephone December 3-4, 2003 in the evenings. The sample is 900 registered voters nationwide with a margin of error of ±3 percentage points.  \n\n1. Which of these late December holidays do you celebrate? (Multiple responses allowed)\n\n1. Christmas - 96%\n2. Hanukkah - 5%\n3. Kwanzaa - 2%\n4. (Other/Refused) - 1%\n5. (None) - 1%\n\nSo, I say if the majority celebrates it...why let the minority get us down... 1
What should a technology geek save his money for: New windows software, or Play Station 3?  From a pure gaming stand point.  Nothing beats a high-end PC with the latest graphics card (dual cards if you can afford them), 2GB of memory and somewhere in the area of 500GB of storage (preferably two 250GB hard drives in a RAID configuration).  The best gaming experience is on a PC, period.  I can't stand console controllers.  Now if consoles used a keyboard and mouse I might be a little more forgiving.  At any rate, I would save your money for either upgrades to your PC or a new PC at the end of the year as Vista will be coming out along with DirectX 10 and a whole new generation of graphics cards.\n\nI'm saving my money for all of that.  Then again I have spent upwards of $2,500 on my desktop and further upgrades.  And I will be doing so again this year. 8

why are are cyclones named after women?  Tropical cyclones are named to provide ease of communication between forecasters and the general public regarding forecasts, watches, and warnings. Since the storms can often last a week or longer and that more than one can be occurring in the same basin at the same time, names can reduce the confusion about what storm is being described. According to Dunn and Miller (1960), the first use of a proper name for a tropical cyclone was by an Australian forecaster early in the 20th century. He gave tropical cyclone names "after political figures whom he disliked. By properly naming a hurricane, the weatherman could publicly describe a politician (who perhaps was not too generous with weather-bureau appropriations) as 'causing great distress' or 'wandering aimlessly about the Pacific.'" (Perhaps this should be brought back into use ;-)\n\nDuring World War II, tropical cyclones were informally given women's names by US Army Air Corp and Navy meteorologists (after their girlfriends or wives) who were monitoring and forecasting tropical cyclones over the Pacific. From 1950 to 1952, tropical cyclones of the North Atlantic Ocean were identified by the phonetic alphabet (Able-Baker-Charlie-etc.), but in 1953 the US Weather Bureau switched to women's names. In 1979, the WMO and the US National Weather Service (NWS) switched to a list of names that also included men's names.\n\nThe Northeast Pacific basin tropical cyclones were named using women's names starting in 1959 for storms near Hawaii and in 1960 for the remainder of the Northeast Pacific basin. In 1978, both men's and women's names were utilized.\n\nThe Northwest Pacific basin tropical cyclones were given women's names officially starting in 1945 and men's names were also included beginning in 1979. Beginning on 1 January 2000, tropical cyclones in the Northwest Pacific basin are being named from a new and very different list of names. The new names are Asian names and were contributed by all the nations and territories that are members of the WMO's Typhoon Committee. These newly selected names have two major differences from the rest of the world's tropical cyclone name rosters. One, the names by and large are not personal names. There are a few men's and women's names, but the majority are names of flowers, animals, birds, trees, or even foods, etc, while some are descriptive adjectives. Secondly, the names will not be allotted in alphabetical order, but are arranged by contributing nation with the countries being alphabetized.\n\nThe North Indian Ocean region tropical cyclones are not named.\n\nThe Southwest Indian Ocean tropical cyclones were first named during the 1960/1961 season.\n\nThe Australian and South Pacific region (east of 90E, south of the equator) started giving women's names to the storms in 1964 and both men's and women's names in 1974/1975. 2

How do some of these software companies make money if they give their products out for free ? For example, FIREFOX. I downloaded it a few months back, how do they go about making money and competing w/ IE ? Quite frequently, software companies or Internet service providers will distribute their software for free, but charge a monthly user fee if you want to use the program after a certain trial period.  The income they receive from the monthly fees is much more than the cost of distributing the free software.\n\nMozilla, the providor of the Firefox programs. also sells advertising that displays on their programs. 5
How can I as a teacher get a free or inexpensive laptop?  There are technology grants running around all over out there.  You should have someone at the central office who can help you research grants.  It takes work, and it would belong to the school, but it is one way.  You would have to show how the computer would benefit your students.  The other way to get a cheap one is ebay, but remember, you get what you pay for. 4

what is a placebo effect?  It's the effect that people get when they believe they should get one.\n\nBasically, it comes from the expectation that something good should happen.  \n\nThere was an experiment once, where they wanted to determine if the level of light over the work area could effect production.  They went into the area and changed the light bulbs to a higher wattage.  Work production increased.  Ahha! they thought.  Higher light increases production.  Then they went in and changed the light bulbs back to the original ones.  You might think that production dropped, but in fact it increased again.\n\nThe people were reacting to the attention they were getting.  The feeling that someone was paying attention to them increased their production.\n\nSo, the placebo effect is one that we perceive someone is concerned about us, and the "medication" we are getting should make us feel better.  And it often does, even if there is no medication in the pill.  \n\nA company researching a new medication would want to give a placebo to a group of people they were testing to ensure that it was their medication and not the "placebo effect" that was causing the improvement. 3
How old is the earth in carbon radio years?  Earth is way older than radiocarbon dating can determine, i.e. way older than 60,000 years.\n\nSedimental rocks show evidence of the magnetic cycles of earth which reach back into the pre-cambrium.\n\nThorium decay is used for dating ancient rocks, and Thorium decay has been put into relation with these cycles. While not perfect, this method has so far given good evidence. 2

does size matter?  I wish I could say no, it doesn't. But actually it does. Now, don't take that to mean that it has to be huge, because that's really not fun either, as it can be very uncomfortable and sometimes hurt. But if it's too small, it just doesn't get the job done (and by that I mean REALLY small) Not too small, but not too big.

Swearing in Sign Language? Why is it that when people want to learn sign language the first thing they want to learn is how to swear? I guess because they like to be able to insult someone in a language that the insultee doesn't know.  \n\nPersonally, I just want to learn basic words.  And my name.  :]  Which is why the first thing I learned in sign language was the alphabet.  Call it narcissm.  ^^ 1

Calculate the amount of heat needed to change ice to steam? Calculate the amount of heat (in kJ) needed to change 36.80 g ice at -16.73 oC to steam at 227.6 oC. \n(Some constants for H2O: Heat of fusion: 333 J/g; Heat of vaporization: 2260 J/g; Specific heats: Ice: 2.1 J/g.K, Water: 4.2 J/g.K, Steam: 2.0 J/g.K).  Please explain how you did it so I can learn how to do this :-).  Thanks! The heat required can be divided into 5 parts:\n1. Heat required to race the temperature to the melting point.\n2. Heat required to melt the ice.\n3. Heat required to raise the water to the boiling point.\n4. Heat required to change the water to steam.\n5. Heat required to raise the temperature of the steam to the final value.\n\nCompute part 1 using the specific heat of ice.\nCompute part 2 using the heat of fusion.\nCompute part 3 using the specific heat of water.\nCompute part 4 using the heat of vaporization.\nCompute part 5 using the specific heat of steam.\n\nYou can do the math, after all it is your homework assignment. 2
Why don't earthquakes happen everywhere?  Earthquakes happen when two tectonic plates grind, scrape, push, or shove up against each other. The harder the collision, the bigger the earthquake. But, if you live in the middle of a tectonic plate, nothing will grind, scrape, push, or shove there so there will be no earthquakes there. 2

why teachers go abroad?  Many reasons: First, because its really 'freakin' cool to go abroad and sample different cultures and languages.\nTwo: Alot of schools abroad offer great packages, like free room and board while your teaching there and some even offer to pay for your current or inpending degree and any travel expenses\nThree:Some american schools offer exchange programs for teachers, so that teachers can go abroad to experiment and learn about different and alternative teaching styles.  Normally teachers are compensated for it, kinda like a sabbatical leave* 4

If a company goes public, former employees have 180 day lock periods as current employees does.?  If you hold stock in a private company that goes public, the 180 day lock period is usually imposed by contract; the underwriter of the IPO demands that all existing stockholders agree to the lock-up.  As a former employee, the company may not have any leverage over you to force to you sign a lock-up, although the documents you signed when you received the stock may have had a lock-up in them.  Presuming this is not the case, and that you do not sign a lock-up, you will not have to wait 180 days.   However, presuming that the company does not register you shares (it probably won't), you probably will have to wait 90 days to sell, under the federal securities laws, as your shares are unregistered, and can only be sold pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements; the most widely used exemption is under Rule 144, and it requires that the shares have been held for at least one year, and also that the company have been publicly traded and making its securities filing for 90 days.   Further, if the company has undergone any transformative mergers or re-orgs, you may be deemed to have acquired the shares on the date of such transaction, in which case your one year holding period started then. 7
what is global warming.?  Global warming is a plot devised by scientists of the world to dominate the planet !!!\n\nYou see if we accept this theory as fact from then on scientists will be able to control everything that we do based on the complex interactions, almost unfathomably complex, between consumption and global warming effects -- thus, scientists will be allow to make educated guesses if they like, which will almost always certainly result in politically correct and repressive conclusions that forward the goals of this neo-imperialism.\n\n\nThe bottom line for this question is that the LONGEST historical charts showing the temperatures on Earth show that we are currently quite COLD !!!  In fact we are currently tied for the coldest period ever on the long term charts, the entire period if life on Earth. Thus, odds are very good that temperatures will raise no matter what we do so over the very long term scientists will be found to be correct that the Earth is indeed warming up. And I am sure they will continue to blame the heating on human activity and they will continue to try to use this to gain control over the free peoples of the world. Although since this trend that shows the Earth being currently quite cold is a very long term trend, in the million of years, so this is a long term gamble for the scientists a lot can happen between now and when the longer term trend is likely to kick in.\n\nBut the idea that this heating is unnatural or some how damaging to the Earth is silly because the long term charts show that the Earth is usually much warmer, during the last 542 million years, the entire period of time that life has existed on Earth.\n\nEvery classroom and library show have a large poster on the wall to show the temperature record of the Phanerozoic period, the last 542 million years, to remind people of the absurd conclusions science can reach from time to time.\n\nIsn't it interesting that 542 million years shows that we are currently tied for the coldest temps EVER !!!\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Phanerozoic_Climate_Change.png\n\n"The Phanerozoic (occasionally Phaenerozoic) Eon is the period of geologic time during which abundant animal life has existed. It covers roughly 545 million years and goes back to the time when diverse hard-shelled animals first appeared. The Phanerozoic eon is still ongoing." \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phanerozoic\n\nIf you look at the chart of Holocene temperature variation we are not hotter, on the average we are cooler -- notice the long term cooling trend or downward slope of the chart.\nHolocene Temperature Variations ...\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Holocene_Temperature_Variations.png\n\nFrom this chart it looks like we are currently on the top of an upward swing that started with the mini-ice-age in the 1600s and that we are currently topping out.\n\nThis is probably why scientist are currently predicting in the future, both, much HOTTER weather, and a new ice-age, it is because it is time for a new long term downward trend -- well, that is on the short term chart showing the thousands of years, yes in terms of millions of years we are still currently VERY cold !\n\nAnd 5 million years of temps changes shows we are cooler, but fluctuating ...\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Five_Myr_Climate_Change.png\n\nAnd 65 million years of temps changes shows we are\ncooler, but fluctuating ...\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:65_Myr_Climate_Change.png\n\nIsn't it interesting that 542 million years shows that\nwe are currently tied for the coldest EVER !!!\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Phanerozoic_Climate_Change.png\n\nSo I think the scientists that know about this LONG term temperature change believe we will get hotter no matter what, so they can't loose even if the current theories of Global Warming turn out to be BULL of planetary proportions !!!\n\nThe ice-age temps shows our current temps to be fairly typical, notice the other peaks were HIGHER and sh 10
How much a Lab Technician earn per month? Lab Technicians at Mines;SASOL;PLASCON;COCACOLA;MOORDRIFT almost everywhere I am VERY concerned that you lab technicians can't spell "average" or construct a proper sentence.

Is there any Special Awards for Best Magazine?  Many weekend newspapers incorporate magazine supplements, such as Parade and LIFE in its most recent incarnation, both in the USA, and the Sunday Times Magazine in the UK.\n\nThe Gentleman's Magazine, first published in 1731, is considered to be the first general-interest magazine. The oldest magazine still in print is The Scots Magazine, which was first published in 1739, though multiple changes in ownership and gaps in publication totaling over 90 years weaken that claim.\n\nThe most widely distributed magazine in the world is The Watchtower Announcing Jehovah's Kingdom (founded in 1879). Its worldwide circulation including all editions comprises 26.5 million copies. 8

How many of you would have the nerve to say this? [Is bald-faced lying im the job description?\nAnd how will denying established facts play with the jury?]\n\nLawyers for former Enron Corp. chiefs Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling insisted Tuesday the men were guilty of no crimes, arguing the company was never infested with fraud and instead fell victim to a sudden crisis of market confidence.\n\n"This is not a case of hear-no-evil, see-no-evil," Skilling lawyer Petrocelli said, at times animatedly jabbing his finger at the jury. "This is a case of there was no evil."\n\nDirectly countering four years of negative publicity that turned the very name Enron into a symbol of accounting chicanery, Petrocelli said, "There's no evidence any books were cooked at Enron."\n\nLay lawyer Michael Ramsey described Enron as "one of the finest free-market institutions the world has ever seen."\n\nWhen Skilling resigned as Enron CEO in August 2001, turning the reins over to Lay, "He left a sound, vibrant and wonderful company," Ramsey said.\nYahoo!News they both need to burn a while for this one, as do the defense attorneys who are cashing in on it. 10
what is the relation ship betveen death and art? its crazy, but it happens. when some one is about to die in the neighborhood, i am in extreme anxiety and pain, and all of a sudden the pains are gone and the agoney is over, withen a few minuts i find out that some one has died in the nearby houses, it always happens, Why does that happen(history of this is 30 years old) and i have not found a way out as yet As a Christian, I believe that God lays on our hearts certain situations that we need to pray about.  Maybe the pain and anxiety is the Holy Spirit urging you to pray for someone's spirit as they are about to pass away. 1
Would you rather have JR Smith or Stephen Jackson for your hoops team? My only other shooting guards are Saurunas Jasikevicius and Cuttino Mobley, so it's not exactly my strongest position. with artest on his way out of indiana, stephen jackson now becomes the #2 scoring option on the pacers. smith is the 3rd option at best with the emergence of paul and west. jackson plays 7 more mpg than smith and that's bound to go up slightly once artest gets traded, along with (hopefully) other categories. interestingly enough, basketballmonster.com rates a trade of the 2 dead even 6
Spontaneous Computer Restarting - Two Questions.? I have a brand new computer with Windows XP.  When I am not on the internet, I unplug the phone line from the back of the computer (Yes, I am stuck in the 90s with dialup).  I am extremely careful about the virus software and the window's updates - I always do them dutifully when prompted.  I use the computer as an alarm clock, so it is on all night, but I turn it off during the day while I am at work.\n\nQuestion #1 - Last night, in the middle of the night, I heard the computer shut down and then the startup music... so I am assuming that it spontaneously restarted.  I know of no updates that needed installing.  What would cause this to occur?  \n\nQuestion #2 - Occasionally, there is a buzzing or loud humming type noise which pulses slightly coming from the tower.  This occurs even when the computer is idling, and happens about once every 2 or 3 minutes and lasts for about 15 seconds.\n\nThanks for your help!! :) Answer #1 - It could have been a quick power outage, you might not have noticed it if you were nodding off to sleep.  Another possiblity is that if you have an external USB hard drive(s) connected to your computer for additional storage, they can sometime cause random re-booting (and sometime issues with boot-up afterwards) due to I/O conflicts. Those are two possible scenarios that could have caused your midnight reboot.\n\nAnswer #2 - This definately sounds like your computers Power Supply fan.  Simply use a hose vacuum on the back of the fan and this should help. Another possibility though is that you left a CD-ROM in your computer and your virus software is accessing the drive to check it(sometimes CD's can make a humming noise if not seated properly in the drive). 5

how do you find if ou have a credit card in your name?  You can go to the individual credit reporting agencies or there are websites that allow you to purchase all 3 reports (Experian, Equifax, TransUnion) for about $25.\n\nI have found that the reports can contain different information and it is not a bad idea to check all 3 reports about once a year.  You are allowed to submit corrections if accounts have been closed or if balances are paid and reported incorrectly.\n\nYou can request a *free* credit report once yearly.

Is there a god?  God. This explanation is what everyone eventually resorts to when the other answers fail. Throughout all of human history, we've been trying to explain existence. But nobody has ever succeeded. And it's likely that nobody ever will. So we create the concept of God, whose only necessary property is being "that which explains existence." \n\nThis doesn't tell us much about god, though. It doesn't mean that any particular religion is correct. It merely defines god as something which answers The Question, because we have not been able to. 1
who are muslims ?  A Muslim is a believer in or follower of Islam. The word Muslim means one who submits and implies complete submission to the will of God (Allah). Muslims believe that nature is itself Islamic, since it follows natural laws placed by God. Thus, a Muslim strives to surrender to God's commands every step of the way.\n\nUntil recently the word was also spelled Moslem. Muslims do not recommend this spelling because it is often pronounced "mawzlem," which sounds like an Arabic word for "oppressor." Many English-language writers used to call Muslims "Mohammedans" or "Mahometans", meaning "followers of Mohammed", but this terminology is considered incorrect and insulting, because Muslims believe it implies that they worship the prophet Muhammad, contrary to the fundamental principles of Islam itself.\n\n\nSources of Islam\n\nSunni sources of Islam\nThe Holy Quran \nAhadith (singular Hadith) - recordings of the life of the Prophet Muhammad, reported by any one of his companions. Many matters not specifically mentioned in the Qur'an are covered in the Ahadith. \nIjma (consensus) \nQiyas - the process of analogical reasoning from a known injunction (nass) to a new injunction. \n\nShi'a sources of Islam\nThe Holy Quran \nAhadith (singular Hadith) - narrations reported from the Prophet Muhammad, his daughter Fatimeh Zahra or any of the twelve Imams appointed by God to succeed Muhammad. The narrations are reported by their companions. \nIjma (consensus) \nAql (intellect) 1

where did aids come from?  Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), which causes AIDS, is very similar to Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) that infects monkeys and apes.  \n\nHIV/AIDS most likely began when a monkey or ape infected with SIV bit a human and infected the human with SIV.  The SIV virus then mutated into HIV, which was better suited to infect humans. 2

did jesus have any tattoos? I heard that he did from a former pastor of mine and wanted to know if it was true I suppose he could have been refering to this verse:\n\nRevelation 19:16 - And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.\n\nIt says written. I don't think that it means ink inside the skin but a topical written statement. It may be more spiritual than physical. I would ask the pastor to show you where in scripture that he bases that statement. \n\nIf God said not to mark your skin, Jesus surely would obey. He came to fulfill the law.\n\nLev 19:28  Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you: I am the LORD. 4

What is the most important club in golf? I was told my husband needs a new sand wedge, but is there a more important club? That's a very good question.  The answer to that question would depend on the golfer you ask.  I personally believe it is the putter, but that's just me.  If it was your husband who said he needed a new sand wedge then he would know.  As far as a more important club, that would depend on your husband's skill with the rest of the clubs in his bag.  If this is a gift you might be able to get a golfing buddy to casually ask what your husband considers to be his most important club, and go with that, if not the best way would be to ask him straight out.  I know I would like it if my wife were to ask me to go with her to get a club for me, but that's just me. LOL!  At any rate good luck with your purchase. 6
I know very little about mythology, what is a good beginner book for greek or other mythology?  A good beginner pictoral is : \nIllustrated Dictionary of Mythology, by Philip Wilkinson. It is a very basic span of all different Mythology, with pictures to represnt, and the beliefs listed with them. It has been a good referance starter for me.\n(It is very generic, so if you are looking more specific, this will only go so far)\nTime Life also put out 3 great sets called Myth and Mankind, The Enchanted World, and Lost Civilizations. They are factual, and well put together. Not just a referance, but a good source to pick out a coffee table book as well! 1

Which one do i go with? I am dating this girl.  She's really cool and everything but I go to college 2 hours away and only see her on breaks and stuff.  I have this other girl at college who i dated for a little while but we broke up cuz she was really controlling and it drove me crazy. Constantly told me where to go.  Both say they love me so much.  The other one said she'd change and not do it anymore.  The two of them are complete opposites and i've known the girl i was dating for a while and she's finally turning her life around because of me.  I really like them both but i really don't know what to do.  The one from college is waiting around for me because she thinks i might come back and i don't know.  Should i go witht he one from college and just spare myself the trouble trying to keep the long distance relationship or do i try to make it work?  I'm so confused about this and i really need some help This would be easier if you said the one who is a long distance girlfriend is the controling one, because that would be an instant "GUeh-oodbye!"\n\nHey you're young in college, did you need to settle down? You're still discovering yourself at the moment, and this is a good time to not be obligated to anyone.\nIf it were me, I'd tell the controlling one that I like her enough to hang out with in social settings, but I do not want to be tied down period, and if she's gonna loose her mind about it, she can just move on right away.\nThe girl back home- she sounds like the kind of person you don't want to lose touch with. Maybe you could both agree to see other people. Bearing in mind this means SHE can go out with other guys, who are going to want to try and get in good with her, possibly try to score, and if the idea of someone scoring with YOUR girl, bothers you. Well.....\n\nLong distance doesn't have to be a bad thing. I know for myself, when you're finally together again, nothing is sweeter than the feel of their skin, the light in their eyes, and their sweat mingling with yours... oops got carried away there. But that's my point, does the girl at home really do it for you, would you burn with jealousy if she started hanging with another guy? IF so, she's the one, atleast for now, and so long as she knows how imporant she is to you, you'll both be fine.\n\nYou're at college, STUDY man! (and party some, but I didn't say that) 9
Why there would be no need for Allah to appoint anyother prophet after Mohammad?  Because the Prophet Mohammed was Allah's Messenger of His Holy Word, the last of Allah's chosen prophets as cited in the Holy Qu'Ran.  The Prophet Mohammmed was Allah's  spiritually-perfect embodiment as Holy Messenger to faithfully deliver His Word through the Holy Q'uRan to over 1.2 billion adherents to Islam worldwide. 1
How do you get rid of strep throat? I'm searching for home remedies only.  No doctors! Wild Mountain oregano oil taken straight.  Get the North American Herb and Spice brand or Vitality works in a bottle. No capsules, because you want it to go to work right away on the affected area. They are both good.  Studies have shown it is as effective as prescription antibiotics for strep.  Oregano oil is very strong so be prepared to chase it down with a little water.  I take about 5 drops 2 X daily for something like this. NOTE: Check out the second link I have attached. It talks about how studies have shown it to be effective on strep.   You can buy Vitality works at iherb.com for $14.00 a bottle.  Health food stores charge up to $80.00 a bottle for North American Herb and Spice brand.) You can save yourself a little money and it is just as good. Good Luck! 3
I fthere was a 100m dash between hare and tortoise who will win.Pl read deatails and answer.? At the start ,assume tortoise is 50m ahead of the hare ,conceded generously by the hare.By the time the hare runs 50m the tortoise would have traveled somme distance 'x'.By the time tha hare runs the diastance 'x',the tortoise would have run a dstance'y'.By the time the hare runs 'y' the tortoise would have gone further.Hence the hare can never never catch up and win, as the tortoise always keeps some distance for the hare to cover.So folks!would you like to change the story of the Hare and the tortoise? The fallacy implied by the question is that the Hare's motion is somehow dependent on the Tortoise's progress. Or to suggest that the Hare can only proceed to point A if the Tortoise has been there first. In fact, motion is governed by velocity which is dependent on time. For this reason, we can only fairly compare their progress by comparing their movement over time.\n\nObviously, the only way the Tortoise wins is if it can travel 50m faster than the Hare travels 100m.\n\nEven if we must relate the Hare's progress in terms of the Tortoise's, we can prove that a decreasing geometric progression has a limit - in this case the point in space where the Hare would catch up to the tortoise if an infinite number of "Hare catches up to x while Tortoise travels to y" iterations occured. If this point in space is before the finish line, we can say the Hare will win, otherwise we have a fast Tortoise. 2

Is Bush a good president? Perhaps asked one too many times, but I'd like to hear your opinions. No.\n\n1. He uses his religion to dictate policy.\n2. He lies to the american people, often not for their own good.\n3. He misleads the commanders and generals in the field to get his own agend passed.\n4. He lies and misleads the United Nations.\n5. He wiretapps innocent americans and expects to pass it off as anti-terrorism efforts.\n6. He has started a huge 'political and religious' war against terrorists, and neglects to cover losses in the united states such as hunger, drugs, poverty, guns and hate crimes.\n7. He is staunchly against gay and lesbian rights, which as they are americans should be affored the same rights and roles as everyone else.\n8. He flaunts his power, even though he doesn't have a clue on how to use it.  His IQ is one of the lowest of any president in history; he hasn't written any of his own speeches, let alone a book about his policy and life.  In general his intelligence leaves quite a bit to be desired.\n9. He doesn't seem to care about world policy; it is his way or the highway.\n10. He has put our boarders at risk, even from the canadians.\n11. He has severed ties to some of our oldest allies, simply because some of our allies think that he has gone to far in his push for world peace.\n12. He is constantly trying to push his world agenda onto other conountries, and forcing democracy into their countries without their consent.\n13. He doesn't feel that those who are not christian should have the same rights as those that are.\n14. He doesn't feel that POW's are entitled to any basic civil liberties.\n15. He doesn't aggree with the Geneva Convention, in fact he has wanted to rewrite it several times.\n16. He wants to actually remove us from our seat at the UN, which would be catastrophic to the agency as we hold a founding seat.\n17. He has invaded Iraq under false pretenses, and continously defends our rights there; whereas we should have no rights there as that is NOT our country or our protectorate, instead it is the soverign right of the iraqi people, not americans.\n18. He neglects his duty as president and spends more than 1/2 his normal time and term on vacation or away from the white house.\n19. He cuts funding to military bases, military outposts, military members and families; and then increases funding for anti terrorism funds with said cuts.\n20. He cuts funding for military housing for families in need.\n\nThose are the top 20 reason why i believe he is a bad president. 10

How long does it take to  pass a kidney stone?  Does the pain increase?  It isn't any more painful for males than women... speaking as a woman who has had them twice.  I've also had four kids and would choose having another kid over a kidney stone any day.  There is no timeframe for passing stones. They either pass or they don't, and they take their own sweet time.  The first one I had was a couple weeks of severe pain and peeing blood.  The second was off and on pain for a month and peeing blood.  I had to have lithotrypsy done that time because the size of the stone was comparative to a marble and it wouldn't have passed.  Make sure you see a urologist if you suspect a stone. If it gets lodged in the urethra and doesn't allow urine to pass then it can damage your kidney. 3

How do you know if you have cervical cancer?  Well when you go for a gynocology checkup, they will often do a papsmear to make sure everything is alright.

What's the best sleeping aid?  Exercise could help, but don't do it later in the evening.  It will release endorphins that will keep you up.  Exercising in the morning or afternoon should do the trick.  If the above doesn't work, take some nyquil.  I had two different prescription medications as sleep aids that didn't work the way they should and gave me nightmares or left me foggy the next day, but the cheap old generic nightime cold/flu medicine similar to nyquil knocked me out like a light and didn't leave me feeling sleepy the next day.  If it's a chronic case of sleeplessness, perhaps you should make a visit to your doctor.  Don't use anything for extended periods of time to help you sleep, it can become a habit and those aids will eventually become less effective. 3
What is the biggest city on the world ?  what exactly it means to be the "biggest city." Is it by land area? Is it by population? The former seems a little arbitrary, but the latter might be hard to pin down, especially since once-distinct cities have begun to merge into huge sprawling "metropolitan areas."\n\nThe InfoPlease Almanac, which listed Mumbai(Bombay), India, as the most populous city in the world. They went on to list Shanghai,China in second place and Sao Paolo, Brazil, in third , but they chose to only count inhabitants of within the actual city limits.

what is the relation between rastafarian and judah? rastafarians and people who really knows the connection answer please. Rasta, or the Rastafari movement, is a religious movement that accepts Haile Selassie I, the former emperor of Ethiopia, as King of Kings, Lord of Lords and the Lion of Judah as Jah (the Rastafari name for God, from a shortened form of Jehovah found in Psalms 68:4 in the King James Version of the Bible), and part of the Holy Trinity. The name Rastafari comes from Ras Täfäri, the pre-coronation name of Haile Selassie I. The movement emerged in Jamaica among working-class and peasant black people in the early 1930s, arising from an interpretation of Biblical prophecy, black social and political aspirations, and the teachings of their prophet, Jamaican black publicist and organiser Marcus Garvey, whose political and cultural vision helped inspire a new world view. The movement is sometimes called "Rastafarianism"; however, this is considered improper and offensive by Rastas. 1
What programs do you people use to make good websites? What programs do you people use to make good websites? I think it's best that you "hand" code it in notepad because MSFontPage and other WYSIWYG (What you see is what you get) editors insert a lot of unnecessary lines of code that slows down the loading time. A good place to start learing is lissaexplains.com . For graphics you could use GIMP which is free (Google or Yahoo it), if you think you're serious about making a good website and have money then you might want to consider buying and learning Photoshop ($600). Tutorials for GIMP and Photoshop can be found at pixel2life.com . A good webhost is pretty hard to find but you could always start with GeoCities (ad supported). 5
what is holocauste?  Holocaust (hŏl'əkôst', hō'lə–) , name given to the period of persecution and extermination of European Jews by Nazi Germany. Although anti-Semitism in Europe has a long history, persecution of German Jews began with Hitler's rise to power in 1933. Jews were disenfranchised, then terrorized in anti-Jewish riots (such as Kristallnacht), forced into the ghettos, their property seized, and finally were sent to concentration camps. After the outbreak of World War II, Hitler established death camps to secretly implement what he called “the final solution of the Jewish question.” Extermination squads were also sent to the fronts: In one operation alone, over 30,000 Jews were killed at Babi Yar, outside Kiev. After 450,000 Jews were sent to death camps from the Warsaw Ghetto, news of their fate led the last 60,000 to rebel (1943), fighting until they were killed, captured, or escaped to join the resistance. The main Jewish resistance was spiritual: observing their religion and refraining from suicide, while Zionists evacuated some to Palestine. By the end of the war 6 million Jews had been systematically murdered. The Allies refused rescue attempts and American Jews were warned against attempting them. While the European churches were silent, some clergy and individual non-Jews saved many. The Danes sent most Danish Jews to Sweden in private boats while under German occupation. 10

how do i make windows xp shut down faster?  Definitely DO NOT uninstall your Norton Antivirus. Try right clicking on the Norton Antivirus icon, next to the clock in the lower right hand corner of your desktop, and select 'disable scanning', whatever option you have to disable the real time scan. Also, you can try closing the million things that are located next to the clock. Then do a disk defragment on your system, after the reboot. Start - All Programs - Accessories - System Tools - Disk Defrag. It is recommended that you do this when you are not doing anything on the computer.\nCheers. 5

what does the color bittersweet look like? I need to know before Christmas.  I'd like an outfit for the holiday in this color.  Thank you in advance. Look at this web page for Crayola crayons bittersweet color swatch.\nhttp://www.crayola.com/colorcensus/americas_favorites/display.cfm?color=24\nI remember it as a sort of burnt orange color, but it probably has a little more red in it, looking at the color swatch, [they do say it's in the "orange" family, though, not the "red" family, like scarlet, brick red, and magenta] and since it is named after the berries of a plant called "bittersweet". \nThe Probert Encyclopedia describes the berries as scarlet-red. http://www.probertencyclopaedia.com/B1EB.HTM\nYou can see images of bittersweet berries by searching google images for bittersweet. Most of them look orangish-red to me. \nOverall, I recommend a reddish burnt orange. 7

What is a good method to quit drinking without having to turn to groups like AA? I go out to sports bars a couple times a week lately.  I don't intend to get drunk, but once I start drinking, I always go beyond what I wanted to drink.  I don't drink liquor, only beer.\n\nThe problem is the hangover the next day pretty much takes that day away from me.  I'm tired of losing days with my family to being sick, because I'm choosing a few hours of "good" times the night before.  It is like the old saying, "I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired."\n\nI've decided to quit drinking all together, and it is going well.  The first step to start with for me has been to avoid the sports bars.  I know I can't avoid them forever, as we go out with family and friends to them.  I've been able to have a good time drinking Diet Coke.\n\nI feel I am a strong minded person, and I can commit and beat this problem with my own strength and will power.\n\nI would appreciate any other tips that you could share with me to help me on my way. Keep a journal. I know it sounds cheesy, but you'll start to really figure out why you want it. Why you need the break from reality. It's become a hobby, right? Finding a new one to replace the drinking helps, too. Golf, cooking, movies, coaching kids, anything. Something that you can find more rewarding. You know? 3
how to deal with an unfaithful husband?  Focus on improving your own life. Avoid relying on him at all, and don't offer him anything. If you're staying together "for the kids", realize that they will be growing up around a negative influence anyway. Nobody deserves to be cheated on, and cheating on him will only make you as low as he is. If he was not being his typical self when it happened, he will confess and apologize and won't do it again. But don't give him too many chances! 1

why Bukhara and Samarqand known as Tajik cities are in Ubekistan?!? looking through historical materials I found these two cities of persian Tajik culture, but for some reason they are located in Turkish Uzbekistan? Originally they were part of Iran so maybe that's why you think they are part of Tajik culture in Uzbakestan, there is a poem from Hafez the famous persian peot of 14th century which says: "Agar aan torke shirazi be dast arad dele maaraa\nBe khaale henduash bakhsham SAMARQANDO BOKHARA ra"\nwhich means "If that beautiful Shirazi lady can capture my heart\nI will give Bokhara and Samarqand just for her beauty spot" 10
Does anyone knw how to wakeup a remote comp on LAN? I've tried some softies but which made the comp power up but the comp said "Please select proper boot device and press any key when ready". Why is the boot device not selected properly? This generally happens when you have the WOL (Wake on Lan) setting set to PXE boot.  You need to go into the BIOS and change the WOL settings to use the proper device.  It is separate from the BIOS boot order.  If the motherboard does not support it, you will need to setup a PXE boot server to point it back locally if need be. 5

why is the sky blue?  Rayleigh scattering (named after Lord Rayleigh) is the scattering of light by particles much smaller than the wavelength of the light. It occurs when light travels in transparent solids and liquids, but is most prominently seen in gases. Rayleigh scattering of sunlight from particles in the atmosphere is one reason light from the sky is blue. 2

Are Space and Time continuous or are them quantized ?  There are two major theories of modern physics: Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity. Both work well, with QM being applicable to atomic and smaller sizes, and GR to large (Solar size, galaxy size, etc.) things.\n\nThe major question in physics today is: how do we combine QM and GR so that they are two aspects of one larger theory. This postulated theory is usually called a Unified Theory or Theory of Everything or something like that. String theories are attempts to do this (so far all are still incomplete).\n\nThe major difference between QM and GR is that nn QM energy comes in discrete levels (all way to small for us to notice). However in GR space-time is continious. So it is not instantly clear whether space-time is continous or quantized in a unified theory.\n\nFor consistency between these space quantization would have to be on extremely small scales. This would almost certain occur (if it did) at distances called the Planck length, which is ~ 10^-33 cm. (This is about one billion trillion times smaller than an atomic nucleus.)\n\nQuantization of time would then be the interval for light to cross this distance, about 10^-43 seconds. It is because of a lack of a unified theory that physicists can't say anything about the conditions of the universe before 10^-43 seconds after the Big Bang. (Of course that is still pretty good.)\n\nThe short answer is: no one knows, but the scale of quantization would have to be much, much smaller than any known elementary particle. 2

Have you ever wished that you were a boy or a girl? Why?  When I was a young teen & would always wish I were a boy, simply because my father always talked of having a boy. But, hey, he got me for an only child! Anyway, once he was remarried & had two step-sons, it wasn't so bad.\n\nThe only other times I'd wish I were male was when I'd get called out for being too...whatever...there were many times when I was a teenager where my attitudes matched that of a male more than a female. As I grew older, however, I came to realize that I was simply a strong-minded female &, surprisingly, most men really found that attractive in a woman :) My husband certainly does, as did every man I ever dated.\n\nBy the time I was in my latter teens & early twenties, I was more than happy to be a female; except for the dreaded monthly thing. If you ask me, I think the men should get that every other month :) 7

Why doeblowing on hot food cooli? Why is it if we blow on hot soups or other food we tend to cool it a bit Temperatures of hot foods decrease as the foods steam (therefore giving OFF heat, and retaining less heat).  By blowing on the food we are (1) helping steam to whip away from the food faster and (2) adding our breath which is necessarily less hot than the heat of our food.  It's the same idea behind putting ice in a hot liquid, except our breath isn't as cold as ice.  If it were, we'd be running around causing all sorts of trouble. 2

How does privatizing Social Security accounts work exaclty? I don't understand if it is like a bank account, or if they put tax money into an "account" that they invest in the stock market. Or what privatizing accounts is exacly... There is no law in place right now so there is really no right answer. I believe the current administration proposal is that some portion of the social security can go into private accounts, but that the investments will be regulated; you can't invest in highly speculative things like penny stocks, but can invest in high quality bonds, stock market indexes and the like. 10

What is the best way to study the Bible to get a complete understanding? If there is a web site that helped you with the answer, please site it :) Here are my opinions:  First, I think it is important to read Scripture and ask God to reveal what he wants you to learn. But I also have gained a great deal by the many scholars who have studied and written about the Word.\n\nI am a big, big fan of Andrew Murray. He was a pastor, missionary, teacher, and the author of more than 240 books. His writings are very deep and he it totally Bible-centered. You can read some of his books online and download them FREE since they are past the copywrite date. \n\nIf you REALLY want to go deep, study from The Holiest of All, which is a verse-by-verse study of the Book of Hebrews. This one is not available online but you can order it.

What do you mean by modem of Computer?  modem\n(MOdulator-DEModulator) Until the late 1990s, the term stood for a device that allowed a computer or terminal to transmit data over a standard dial-up telephone line. Since the advent of high-speed cable and DSL connections, modem may refer to devices for low-speed dial-up or high-speed broadband.\n\nThis definition pertains only to dial-up modems, which convert digital pulses from the computer to audio tones that an analog telephone line is set up to handle and vice versa. V.92 is the last dial-up standard, providing a data rate of 56 Kbps (see V.92). For high-speed broadband modems, see cable modem, DSL and cellular modem. 5

In an auto crash, the seat belt provides the pressure and surface area against the body. What causes ....? or provides the force? If I understand the question correctly, I think the force you're looking for is inertia. Your body is moving at the speed of the car - then the car stops. Now the car has no speed, but you're still moving forward at that speed until something (hopefully the seat belt) acts to stop you.\n\nIf you're referring to the force provided to stop you - that's the Newtonian counter-force to your inertia moving forward. 2
Is making gay marriages legal a good thing for the society (like in the UK off late)?  Ultimately, it is a question of Civil Rights.  Marriage is a secular institution, not always a religious one.  Allowing some citizens to take part while forbiddding others is not different than legal discrimination based on gender or ethnicity.  A marriage union gives the individuals involved special legal, financial, and social rights, and these same rights must be extended to all people, regardless of their sexual orientation.  And, by the way, I am not gay, if that matters. 1

Do you think the spam problem has been solved? There's two answers i see, but i'd like to hear other people thoughts on it.\n\nFirst i would say, yes, it has been solved. I used to recieve about 1000 spams everyday. Now i only recieve about 100-200 and they all but a few go into my bulk email file.\n\nBut to truly solve the problem you have to stop it at it's source and get all ISPs on board with new tchnologies such as domain keys and sender ID. So on the infrastructure side, no it hasn't been solved No it has not resolved and could never be! As long as there's honey, there will be bees. 5

Is it possible to create artificial gravity in space? Modern scientists think that if they can build a spaceship shaped like a tire and rotate it at its center like a tire, centripetal forces will create artificial gravity around the edges of the spaceship, but I think that's impractical.

Thats the only way to do it because you can create Gravity like on startrek 2

This  about the endrometriosis still grows after histrorectomy? The reason I ask about was, when I had my histrorectomy, they left 3 leasons , because it was either to close to my colon or it was attacted to it, anyway they didn't get it, they was afraid they would mess up and cause me colon problems.Its been almost 2 years now sence I've had it done, and I cramp in my abodom almost everyday, and i hurt sometimes real bad where my ovarys used to be, like i'm having a very bad period. but  my regular dr seems not to worried about it, and said i don't need a pap smear ,only about every 5 to 10 years. Someone told me that this hurting I have is called phantom pain, but they r very real,. Am I worring about nothing Please help me fiigure this out. Thank you Sorry Maggie you are incorrect. Endometriosis is the presence of normal endometrial mucosa (glands and stroma) ABNORMALLY implanted in locations OTHER than the uterine cavity. This tissue, possessing the same steroid receptors as normal endometrium, is capable of responding to the normal cycles of hormones. One theory of spread is thought to be dispersion of ectopic (meaning where it should not be) inplants throughout the peritoneal cavity (area where your bowels, liver reside) during menstruation, since sloughing off of products of endometrial tissue from the uterus is not just unidirectional (out through the cervix then vagina, but also up through the fallopian tubes leading to the body cavity known as retrograde flow. This is common in women and can't fully explain endometriosis. Endometriosis has even been found on structures even above the diaphragm. Endometriosis responds and is driven by estrogen. There are reports of women with endometriosis occuring after hysterectomy and removal of the ovaries (which makes estrogens). Women normally continue to make lower levels of weaker estrogens even after their ovaries have been removed. Some women for whatever reason continue to make high levels, and this is thought to be a reason for further symptoms.\n\nTo answer your question simply, yes, it can still grow 3

how hot are the flames in a fire? white, yellow, orange flames?  The hottest flames are those with sufficient oxygen, and usually are transparent blueish where carbon monoxide from incomplete combustion is burnt. Orange to white flames result from incomplete combustion of vaporized organic fuel with soot particles heated up to reddish to white glow, i.e. 800 - 1100°C IIRC. The blueish flame will be up to 1500°C. 2
Who first described 1p36 deletion syndrome? Chromosome 1p36 deletion syndrome can also be called "monosomy 1p36".\n\nWho first described this genetic disorder, and what year?\n\nDoes this disorder have a common name, for example, like Down Syndrome, Marfan Syndrome, Usher Syndrome? Caused by a terminal deletion of the most distal band of the short arm of chromosome 1, monosomy 1p36 is the most commonly observed terminal chromosomal deletion, occurring in approximately 1 in 5,000 births (Shaffer and Lupski 2000; Heilstedt et al. 2003b). As first described by the Shaffer lab in 13 subjects (Shapira et al. 1997), craniofacial characteristics of this contiguous gene deletion syndrome (CGDS)--so-called because it involves the deletion of multiple adjacent genes on the same chromosome arm--include late-closing, large anterior fontanels (membranous intervals at the intersection of the cranial bones at the crown of the skull), brachycephaly (disproportionate shortness of the head), deep-set eyes, flat nasal bridge, asymmetric ears, and pointed chin. Monosomy 1p36 is also associated with mental retardation, developmental delay, hearing impairment, seizures, growth impairment, and heart defects (Shapira et al. 1997; Slavotinek et al. 1999; Heilstedt et al. 2003a). Over 90 subjects with rearrangements of 1p36 have enrolled in our studies, of which 61 were recently published (Heilstedt et al. 2003a). The deletion sizes in the subjects vary considerably (Wu et al. 1999; Heilstedt et al. 2003a); however, there is some uniformity in the origin of the deletions, with over 60% being maternally derived (Wu et al. 1999; Heilstedt et al. 2003a). Candidate genes have been proposed for some of the individual features of monosomy 1p36, including seizures (Heilstedt et al. 2001) and facial clefting anomalies (Colmenares et al. 2002). \n\nThe Shaffer laboratory has recently identified possible mechanisms for the generation and/or stabilization of terminal deletions of 1p (Ballif et al. 2003; Ballif et al. 2004a; Ballif et al. 2004b; Gajecka et al. 2005). In addition, the Shaffer laboratory has recently demonstrated the use of microarrays--a rapid, sensitive, and high-resolution technology for the detection of many chromosomal anomalies--in the detection of deletions of 1p36 (Yu et al. 2003). \n\n\ncheck this article\n\nShapira SK, McCaskill C, Northrup H, Spikes AS, Elder FF, Sutton VR, Korenberg JR, Greenberg F, Shaffer LG (1997) Chromosome 1p36 deletions: the clinical phenotype and molecular characterization of a common newly delineated syndrome.

dose the Bible say anythign about psychics? is it good or bad to go to one, inever been to one, i feel its bad. No the Bible does not.  Those who say differently are seeing what they want to see in the scripture.  There is a world of difference in the very concept of what the Bible was condemning and what one would call a psychic today.\nHowever, if you feel it might be bad for you, then do not go to one and do not use anything connected with one.  These is a quote from the Bible that is relevant to this discussion:\n“… your sons and your daughters will prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams and your young men shall see visions.” 1

Then you could get each user to sign up for web email account. They could post comments via a web form and have replies, etc sent to their webmail account you give them. I do this now for a few clients. You need to check with you web hosting service if they can provide you with web based email softwares.\n\nGood Luck!\n\nKimBot 5
Which video card should I buy for my situation? I've got a Pentium 4 3.0 Ghz chip and I want to put together a dual display setup.  I've already got onboard video and I'm wondering which card to get to run the other monitor (assuming one of my monitors CAN be onboard video with a dual setup?).  I have PCI slots open as well as AGP.  I'm looking to spend between $50-$100, and I want to purchase it from Newegg.  I'll be using it for Photoshop, Dreamweaver, and other various desktop publishing tools.  The card will be hooked up to either a 17" LCD or a 19" CRT. It's possible to do a dual-display setup with your computer but there are some things you should know.\n\n* AGP cards are exclusive so it definitely won't share with your on-board video.\n* Some systems are designed to disable on-board video when another video card is inserted (PCI or AGP).  It's hard to tell if your system will do that.\n\nNo problem though, you just need to buy a video card with two video outputs.  I'm familiar with nvidia cards and I know for certain that dual-display is supported in the software so any nvidia card would work as long as two VGA outputs are present on the card.  If you plan to connect to one CRT and one LCD with DVI connector, you can use this card then (see picture):\n\nhttp://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814121184\n\nIf you are doing two CRTs, however, you'll need something like this where they include a DVI-to-VGA adaptor:\n\nhttp://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814168002\n\nYou can also look for dual-VGA video cards like this one but I'm not familiar with ATI products and how easy it is to set it up:\n\nhttp://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814161150 5

The circumference of the earth at the equator is 24,901.55 miles (40,075.16 kilometers).\n\nBut, if you measure the earth through the poles the circumference is a bit shorter - 24,859.82 miles (40,008 km). This the earth is a tad wider than it is tall, giving it a slight bulge at the equator. This shape is known as an ellipsoid or more properly, geoid (earth-like). 2

what seems to be the problem when you have weird cravings for dirt,gasoline,oil, unnatural things?  Many young children put nonfood items in their mouths at one time or another. They're naturally curious about their environment, and they may, for instance, eat some dirt out of the sandbox. Kids with pica, however, go beyond this innocent exploration of their surroundings. As many as 25% to 30% of kids (and 20% of those seen in mental health clinics) have an eating disorder called pica, which is characterized by persistent and compulsive cravings (lasting 1 month or longer) to eat nonfood items. \n\nWhat Is Pica?\nThe word pica comes from the Latin word for magpie, a bird known for its large and indiscriminate appetite. \n\nPica is most common in people with developmental disabilities, including autism and mental retardation, and in children between the ages of 2 and 3. Although kids younger than 18 to 24 months can try to eat nonfood items, it isn't necessarily considered abnormal at that age. \n\nPica is also a behavior that may also surface in children who've had a brain injury affecting their development. It can also be a problem for some pregnant women, as well as people with epilepsy. 3
life cycle of a plant. ans for 10yrs old?  1. Seed: a little baby plant, sleeping until the right time comes along\n2. Germination: the baby plant pokes out of its seed when there is enough moisture and the right temperature\n3. Growth: using energy from the sun and nutrients from the soil the plant grows to its full size\n4. Flowering: When it is big enough, the plant will start to make flowers so that it can make new seeds\n5. Pollination/fertilization: two types of plant parts must come together to make a new seed. Sometimes insects help this happen.\n6. New seed! 2
Hey,could someone help me solve this problem?  Using Bournolli's equation, solve (dy/dx)+y=e^(x)y^(-2).? This for a Differential Equations course. Take y on the other side\n\ny^2 dy/dx + y^3 = e^(x)\nMultiply by 3\n\n3 y^2 dy/dx + 3 y^3 = 3 e^(x)\n\nFirst term is d/dx (y^3)\nHence put z = y^3 and teh equation becomes\ndz/dx + 3z = 3 e^(x)\n\nNow this is in standard form\nMultiply throughout by e^(3x)\n\ne^(3x) dz/dx+ 3 e^(3x) z = 3 e^(4x)\nLHS can be re-written as\n\nd/dx { e^(3x)* z) = 3 e^(4x)\nIntegrate both sides\ne(3x)*z = 3 e^(4x)/4 +C\n\nz = 3/4 e^(4x)*e^(-3x) + C e^(-3x)\n\nSubstitute back for z=y^3 2
How will the Yankees do in 2006?  The Yankees always reload.  As always, they will be in contention throughout the season.  However, they will face some heavy competition from Boston and Toronto.  Yes Toronto.  The Blue Jays have ponied up and signed some key free agents.\n\nThe Yankees always have plenty of offense with a rotisserie type lineup of bats.  Their biggest weakness has been starting pitching.  The Yankees used 14 different starting pitchers last year\n\nRandy Johnson is another year older.  Which Mike Mussina is going to show up?  The one from the first half or second half of last year.  Shawn Chacon does not have much of a track record.  Wang is young and unproven.  Carl Pavano had problems last year adjusting to the American League and shoulder problems.\n\nMy final prediction is that they take the division.  With the AL Wild Card coming from the AL East. 6
Why do mosquitoes nto bit all people? I just came back from Jamaica, and when I was there I noticed that only my nephew, and myself got bitten. But my other relatives didn't. Does it have to do with the fact that My nephew and i arn't born in Jamaica and all my other relatives are? We were all in the same room with mosquitoes that came through the doors, and they never got bitten but my nephew and I did. The itch you feel is a reaction to the mosquitioes' saliva and your skin. I don't think I have ever heard of anyone that is immune to it. Also, you getting bitten has alot to do with your body temp, and odor. If you have a sweet smelling perfume on or emit a sweet odor, you attract mosquitoes and those wearing no scents and bug spray of course, are more likely to not get bitten. 2

Explain how spectral observations (red shift) have led to the theory of the big bang.? im in 10th garde and i need a detailed answer\nthank you Actually Einstein predicted the Big Bang before Hubble found the first observational evidence.\n\nEinstein found that in his theory of General Relativity that the universe as a whole should be either expanding or contracting. He didn't like this so he added an extra term the "cosmological constant" to balance the equations and have a universe that was not expanding or contracting. That sort of static universe was what was expected in those days.\n\nMeanwhile, Edmund Hubble began making observations in the 1920s from the Mt Wilson Observatory of distant "nebulae." He had discovered previosuly that many of this faint blobs, previously thought to be gas clouds, were in fact galaxies like our own Milky Way. This was a big surprise since previosuly the Milky Way was the only galaxy, or what they called at the time, an "island universe."\n\nSo, it was natural for Hubble to look at the spectra of some of these distant galaxies. What he found was that, except for a couple of very nearby galaxies like M-31 the Andromeda Galaxy, all the other galaxies had shifted spectra. That is, these other galaxies has spectra which were redshifted, indicating that they were moving away from us.\n\nFurther he found that the fainter galaxies (which on average are farther away) had the largest redshifts. This lead to the famous "Hubble's Law" that says that the observed redshift is proportional to the distance a galaxy is from us.\n\nEinstein found out about Hubble's discovery and realized what it meant - the whole universe is expanding. Although naively it looks like everything is moving away from us, all of space is expanding, so that an observor in any galaxy would detect the same thing - that every galaxy is moving away from them.\n\nThe usual analogy is to think of rasins in rasin bread. As the bread rises all the dough (space) expands, so the distance between all rasins (galaxies) grows. Thus from any one rasin (galaxy) all the rest look like they are moving away.\n\nEinstein realized that his "cosmological constant" was unneccessary. He famously called it his "greatest blunder" and that he could have officially predicted the expansion of the universe before Hubble confirmed it with observations. (And in fact, before Hubble's discovery, other scientists like Willem de Sitter and Alexander Friedmann used the equantions of General Relativity to calculate an expanding universe.) \n\nAt that point it was realized that if space is expanding that in the past it must have been all bunched up in one spot. Just before Hubble Georges Lemaître realized this and thought that at first there was some sort of "primaval atom" from which everything else came from.\n\nFred Hoyle didn't like Lemaitre's idea at all, not the least of which was because Lemaitre insisted that God started the whole thing. Hoyle developed a rival theory the Steady State universe, and dismissed the other type of ideas as a "hot big bang." Of course Hoyle's term, meant as a put-down, became the offical name. (Hoyle's Steady State Theory was a serious rival to the Big Bang until the 1960s and the discovery of the microwave background.)\n\nIt wasn't until 1948 that the modern aspects of the Big Bang were proposed by George Gamow and Ralph Alpher. These guys showed that from an initial explosion of compressed everything one would get the correct mixture of hydrogen and helium and other trace elements observed in the whole universe. That is, if one starts from a hot subatomic, compressed mixture and lets it go, it will recombine into the right ratio of atoms. (Right being the ration actually observed.)\n\nAnd so it goes from there, to much more observational evidence for the Big Bang, as well as lots of theoretical progress. At the moment we know that the old cyclical idea, that the universe expands and then contracts, is wrong. In fact the universe seems to be accelerating, tha 2

'Intelligent Design' should be better named 'Malevolent Design'. Do you agree ?  Intelligent design embodies a theology that features a god who is malicious toward people.  \n\n1.  When you look below the surface, the world is filled with evidence that leads open minded people to conclude that evolution has occurred.  This evidence comes from the fields of paleontology, paleogeography, biogeography, molecular biology, genetics, embryology, and probably lots of others.  The god of intelligent design would have had to rig this evidence in favor of misleading us.\n\n2.  If the god of intelligent design violates the natural laws he created to create living organisms and to create false evidence, how often does he do this?  For example, maybe two seconds ago, he created the us and the entire universe, including this message up to this point, my memory of having written it, and your memory of having read it thus far.  If god violates natural law, anything is possible.\n\n3.  If the intelligent design god is going to create the world in any whimsical way, then he created all the suffering that we endure when he could have created a world without suffering.  Either he willfuly created our suffering, or he is an inept creator.\n\n4.  If the existence of complex organisms proves the existence of an intelligent designer, then the existence of the intelligent designer proves the existence of a more intelligent designer who created him.  ...and an even more intelligent designer who created the second one.   ...and an even more than more intelligent designer who created the thrid one.  ...and so on, ad infinitum.  Which one should be worshiped?  What will happen to our souls if we worship the wrong one?\n\n5.  I'm sure that people better versed in philosophy and theology could add many more reasons to believe that the god of intelligent design is malicious. 2

Who has any ideas how to use cosmic energy to create electricity?  Ideas of having a solar energy collector in space, converting the collected energy to microwaves before beaming them to the earth has been suggested many years ago.

Who is going to have a better career in the NFl, Reggie Bush or LenDale White?  Reggie Bush is a Marshall Faulk like player without as much TD scoring ability (which is a very high compliment). He will not be a 30 carry a game back, but will be able to break a game open from anywhere on the field. He will be very dangerous from the slot as well as out of the backfield, and even returning punts.\n\nLenDale White has the upside to be another Emmitt Smith (the man is a TD machine, who can really move the chains). He should not make sportcenter as much as Bush, but may turn out to be the more valuable pro as someone who can carry the mail 30+ times a game. 6

Girls why do you preffer atheletes over sensevitive at a yuong age?  I like sensitive guys. Atheletic guys are too rough. Good thing: They listen to what you say. Bad thing: They are too quiet or shy, so they might not make the first move because you are too quiet and shy aswell. Plus, they may not contribute to your conversation, because they're afraid of saying the wrong thing and losing the girl. This is just my opinion. 9

who were the post lutheran reformers? they were nine, i think. that's what my teacher had said. Examples were, John Calvin, Henry VIII, the presbyterian church and such. who were the others? let me remind you that it is on the time of catholic reformation. I think that you mean post Luther reformers, not post Lutheran.  The Lutheran religion was not really ever "established" until many years after Luther's death.  Philip Melancthon was instrumental in the establishment of the "Lutheran" religion.  Martin Luther himself was rolling over in his grave at the notion of a religion named after himself.\nJust about all of the reformers either worked with Luther or incorporated some of Luther's orginal thoughts into their own separation from the Catholic Church.  Luther himself never wanted seperation, he wanted to "reform" the church... hence Protestant "Reformation."  \nAnyway, Andreas Carlstadt was instrumental in the Ana-baptist movement (Presbyterianism), John Calvin, John Wesley (Methodism), Henry III (Anglicanism/Episcopalean), Ulrich Zwingli (Swiss-Anabaptist), Johann Tetzel (credited for Luther's Inspiration), John Knox (Presbyterianism), and Thomas Muentzer (Peasant's War).\nHere is a pretty thorough article on your topic:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformation\nI hope that this helps.\n-Super 4

what is your favorite book?  DON QUIXOTE DE LA MANCHA by Cervantes Saavedra. Il love this book for a 600+ page book it took be 2 weeks. It is funny, sad, adventours, silly, but mostly funny. I will never think of windmills again after reading it. It's about Don Quixote(a guy who went crazy and he thinks he is a knight and his companion scahno puva adventours in spain. Mishaps are abound beause Don Quixote images things that are not there or something esle (like when Don Quixot imagions the windmills are gaints). It aslo is very good because it has many substories. my favorite parts is Don Quixote and the duchess. Cervantes worte this book as social critism to spain. Spain was once the most powerful country. In the 17th century england and france were getting more powerful with new techongles. And spain just keep its old way. In the end spain drop off and england and france took the lead. Don Quxiote represents spain and the morden day world represents England and SPain. 8

As far as sexual pleasure from the nipple rings...You will have to ask her what she would like.  The best advice that anyone could ever give in any relationship is to communicate with each other.  It would be lovely (or not), if we could all read each others minds, alas, we cant so we need to communicate with each other.  Good Luck. 9

How is "Brown & Root and Lyndon Johnson" like "Haliburton and Vice President Cheney"? President Lyndon Johnson had the same type of cozy "you bankroll me and I'll send a lot of government contracts your way" relationship with Brown & Root as VP Cheney has with Haliburton today. Interestingly, Brown & Root bought Kellogg and became "Kellogg, Brown & Root", then "KBR", and then bought Haliburton with their massive Vietnam War profits. Haliburton IS Brown & Root, executing the same business plan that proved so successful in the 60's: put your guy into the White House (even if just as the de facto President), find a pretext for a war, have him find a way to get the US deep into the war, make MASSIVE PROFITS, PREFERABLY WITH NO-BID, COST-PLUS CONTRACTS, repeat. Except your facts are all wrong. Halliburton acquired Brown & Root in 1962, well before major US involvement in Vietnam. KBR didn't become its own entity until 2002 after the asbestos lawsuits were going full steam ahead, threatening Halliburton assets. The company spilt off KBR and placed in under bankruptcy protection.\n\nSo what is your question anyway??? It appears to be a misguided attack on the right. 10
what is holocast? is there going to be a war between iran and us?  The Holocaust is the name applied to the systematic state-sponsored persecution and genocide of the Jews of Europe, along with various ethnic, religious and political groups during World War II by Nazi Germany and collaborators. Early elements of the Holocaust include the Kristallnacht pogrom and the T-4 Euthanasia Program, progressing to the later use of killing squads and extermination camps in a massive and centrally organized effort to murder every possible member of the populations targeted by the Nazis.\n\nThe word holocaust originally derived from the Greek word holokauston, meaning "a completely (holos) burnt (kaustos) sacrificial offering" to a god. Since the late 19th century, "holocaust" has primarily been used to refer to disasters or catastrophes. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the word was first used to describe Hitler's treatment of the Jews from as early as 1942, though did not become a standard reference until the 1950s. By the late 1970s, however, the conventional meaning of the word became the Nazi genocide. The term is also used by many in a narrower sense, to refer specifically to the unprecedented destruction of European Jewry in particular. 10
mendelssons traditional wedding march was first played at whos wedding, and what yr?  From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\nJump to: navigation, search\nMendelssohn's Wedding March is one of the best known of the pieces that he wrote for A Midsummer Night's Dream in 1842.\n\nAt weddings in many English-speaking countries, this piece is commonly used as a recessional, though frequently stripped of its episodes in this context.\n\nThe first time it was used at a wedding was when Dorothy Carew wed Tom Daniel at St Peter’s Church, Tiverton, UK, on 2 June 1847. However it did not become popular at weddings until it was selected by Victoria, The Princess Royal for her marriage to the Crown Prince of Prussia on January 25, 1858.\n\nThe organ on which the Wedding March was allegedly composed is housed in St Ann's Church Tottenham. 4

What is SuperNova in Science ?  A supernova is the death of a supermassive star.  Our sun converts Hydrogen into Helium right now.  When all or most of the Hydrogen has been converted, the Sun will heat up and start fusing Helium atoms together.  The Sun will continue to fuse heavier and heavier elements until it gets to Iron.  The increase in energy needed here is too great.  Our sun is average, it won't Supernova.  Much more massive stars when they reach this point collapse in on itself because there is no nuclear furnace keeping gravity in check.  The resulting explosion releases massive amounts of energy, creates elements heavier than Iron, and leave either a nuetron star or a black hole where the original star used to be 2

what is power induction?  Power induction occurs when some material that can conduct electrical current is moved through a magnetic field.\n\nThe newest type of flashlight (sometimes called "shake flashlights") uses this principle. When a shake flashlight is shaken, a magnet slides back and forth through a copper wire coil. The electricity produced as a result is then stored in a capacitor (a capacitor is an electronics component that will store electrical energy) instead of a battery.\n\nPower induction can also occur between individual lines of a high-voltage power line system. 2

The intestines were torn due to a seat belt injury in a car accident. the incision was lateral, approximently 6 inches. my experience may be a little different, but i had an abdominal hysterectomy...(cut from hip to hip). i carried my little pillow around with me EVERYWHERE i went, didn't over-do it..i had help getting up AND sitting down. my stomach muscles healed quite fast to my suprise, my doc said it was do to me taking it easy for the first 4 weeks after surgery...don't leave home with-out your pillow (if you don't have one, or know what i'm talking about; it's a little pillow you hold on your stomach to walk, get up, etc..,don't have one?? just use a little (soft) couch pillow, hopes this helps and hope you feel better soon!! =) 3
is wrong to tattoo and peirce your body??? it is beautifying your body. beauty is in the eye of the beholder right?? tattoos can serve a purpose(to show your opinions and beliefs,a visual of your personality) and peircings are beautiful. There is nothing wrong with either one.  But take into consideration if it is just a phase that you are going through.  As a person age, the choice that they made are sometimes not as cool as once thought of.  Many as they grow older will have the tats removed and the piercing taken out.\n\nI used to think nipple piercing on girls were cool.  But then one of those girls said that pus always oozes out of one that was not infected.  Yuck!  I think piercing is still cool when done in areas that involves only skin and not an areas that can change shape like the nipple when you are excited.\n\nIt is okay to make a statement, but there are other ways.  If you like tats, then do something that could be covered up.  My ex had sleeve tats that when she wore a blouse with sleeves up to her elbow, you would not know she had tats.  She had both sleeves, and her entire back.\n\nBut looking into the future, it would be weird.  Check out grandma's tats. 1

Do you know anyone autistic? I don't know I thought it'd be cool to see what they can do? My, but that's kind of rude.\nBut I've known people with Torrets, who can be fun when they're also smart people who also are very aware they have Torrets, and I've known a few idiot savants, but that's not really the same. In any respect, people with  mental or neurological problems really shouldn't be the object of cruelity for one's own amusement. 7

Part 2 at home schooling question? For those who responded to my first question thanks so much.  But what if you where a single parent, with a full time job.  Its not that I wouldn't want to stay home but couldn't afford it. I have a friend who is doing it!  Her son is middle school aged, and very responsible.  When she leaves for work, she leaves his lessons (she uses a curriculum that is software based), she checks in with him at lunch to see if he is having any difficulties that she can get him through.  After work she takes to him to sports practice, then they get home, she reviews the lessons, and they review the lessons.  \nIt is hard, but it can be done, depending on the child's age and responsibility level. 4

what is meant by superconductors?  Superconductors are electrical conductors which have a very low resistance.  In the past these materials need to be at very low temperatures.  Recent advances have allowed the creation of HTS (high temperature superconductors) which can operate at very much higher tempteratures than before. 2
Is DNA the real map from where we come from and where we go to????  Interestingly phrased.\n\nYes, I would say that DNA is the map from where we are coming from. Researchers are using DNA and the relative similarities of certain sequences to deduce just how long ago we diverged from previous forms.\n\nWhat I mean by that: evolutionarily speaking, everything living on earth today can be traced back to a common ancestor (LUCA - Last Universal Common Ancestor). The bigger the difference in the sequences of two species DNA, the longer ago we diverged from that common ancestor and the less related the two organims are to one another -- meaning there are more intermediate organisms between their current status and the ancient ancestor shard by the two.\n\nWe can use DNA not just to illucidate species broad histories, but individual histories too. We have a very unique piece of DNA in our cells. It is contained in our mitochandria. Mitochandria are little energy plants in our cells. The DNA in mitochandria, unlike the rest of our DNA, as we know it, is passed down only from our mothers. So, based on that, this DNA is less diverse. Any differences in this DNA has to come from mutations. Because the mutation rate is relatively slow, there are key "markers" that have appeared from time to time in specific subgroups of humans over time. So the markers you contain in your mitochandrial DNA are indicative of where which subgroup you are a decenent of. These subrgroups can be indicative of races, but as the more information we collect on the various markers from around the world, we'll be able to determine specific regions from which your ancestors lived and migrated to throughout history.\n\nAs far as a map to where we are going, I would say that DNA is that too, but that is less able to be predicted. Our DNA will definitely determine how our species continues to evolve. Let me give you an example. Let's say that this bird flu pandemic that the media has been stressing over the past 6 months actually does happen sometime in the future. An individuals ability to survive such a pandemic will be directly linked to their specific genetic sequence. Some will be innately immune to infection and thus will probably survive the pandemic. Others will not be so lucky. If the speculation is true and hundreds of millions of people do die, their genetic makeup will be eliminated -- thus those genes that make up those people will be removed from the general gene pool. The remainder of people will determine the fate of humankind. If another pandemic was to follow years down the road and the genes that were left over were succeptble to that infection, it could mean the end of the human race. More than likely though, there will always be some subset of the population whose genes allow for survival. From there, the future of humans depends on how overall fit those genes are. 2
I have just found out that one of my best friends has been diagnosed with breast cancer.? She says that she is fighting to stay alive but the doctors say that she might only reach age 18. Now, the only thing that I can do around her is cry because I feel sorry for her. What should I do? Pray for her. I don't know if you are a Christian, but if you are, you should know that talking to God about it relieves much stress and His Will WILL be done! Whatever happens is for the best. You are in my prayers. ~tracie 3

translate books? i wanna translate a book and publish it.i am a sophomore now.\ni dont know how to begin this work?do i need to contact the author or publisher? if so,how can i deal with the copyright?ur answers are greatly appreciated! Translators don't usually get to pick the books they work on, unless they're very, very good. Your first step would be to get a job as a translator at a publishing company, and they'll assign you the books they want you to translate. \n\nYou could translate a book on your own if you wanted, but you would have to keep it for your personal use. If you tried to get it printed, you'd be breaking the copyright law. 1
What does "Get a life" mean? We all have life.  Why do people sometime say "you need to get a life" That is relative, I've done more things in my life than most people are willing to believe. By my standards, were I to tell someone to get a life, it would involve lofty goals. In my opinion, because of my background, I think that it is a phrase meant to offend rather than to be taken literally, in that case whoever told you that, you tell them I am telling them to get a life. 1
FAFSA and Financial Aid? My parents are divorced.  When applying for financial aid, to I list my home income to include the parent I'm living with or both parents? You have to include the household income of the parent you're living on right now. You can also check which one of them have you as a direct dependant on their tax return. Not both of them can have you there and the government will also use that information as a decision point. 4
How much time should you allow for househunting before you move out of your apartment? My lease is up at end of April. I am ready to put a downpayment on a place. Is the time right to start hunting for a place, or should I wait until later? I would start now.  It is a good idea to keep an eye on the market before you ACTUALLY are going to go for it. \n\nWe just did this - We sold our old house.  (We started looking at homes in end of May beginning June.  We saw a few we like and ALOT that weren't exactly what we were looking for.  they needed too much tweeking so we kept looking.   \n\nIn July we put in an offer - they didn't take it.  So we moved on.  Then in August we put in another offer and they wanted to go too high so we moved on.  Then we finally found the house we are in and it was September that we put the offer in.  We closed on the house and moved in - in Oct  (three months ago)  We had time to really look and not feel rushed and also to know that we were getting a good deal.  If you aren't activly looking  ( I mean every single weekend) and watching your local market where you want to buy into - every single day - you won't be as prepared to buy.  So I say now is the perfect time to start looking.  Just don't jump on the first thing that comes along - be patient - Sometimes you have to let a few deals go to see what is really ment to be.  \n\nGreat site to watch the MLS  (multiple listings service)  is Zip realty.  they are free - you just have to sign up, they give you a few info emails - but the rest of the time you can hang out on that site and just watch all the houses in your area of search.   You can save specific searches in your "My zip" area and go to them each day to see what new houses are on the market and if any have lowered their asking prices.  It is invaluable!! \n\nI litterally logged onto my "Myzip" every single day for July, August & September - It was probably the most useful tool.\n\nBTW - We didn't use a realestate agent either.  We watched the listings ourself and called to make our own appointments.  We never used the zip realty guy that was in our area.  You don't have to if you don't want to. 7

What is AdWords?  AdWords is an advertising program run by Google.  Here are its main distinguishing characteristics: \n \n- You can buy in for a very small amount of money.  You pay only for clickthroughs, and you can choose exactly how many you'd like to have. \n \n- You choose keywords for which your ad shows up.  You can choose any keywords you want, but you're required to maintain a certain clickthrough ratio in order to be allowed to advertise on a certain keyword. \n \n- You can choose your price per clickthrough.  It's a sort of bidding system; choosing a higher price gives you better placement of your ad. \n \n<3 5

How much land was damaged due to the eruption of Mount Saint Helens?  From Wikipedia.org:\n\n" Fifty-seven people were killed and 250 homes, 47 bridges, 15 miles (24 km) of railways and 185 miles (300 km) of highway were destroyed. The eruption caused a massive debris avalanche, reducing its summit from 9,677 feet (2,950 m) to 8,364 feet (2,550 m) in elevation and replacing it with a mile-wide (1.5 km-wide) horseshoe-shaped crater (see geology section or 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens for more detail). The debris avalanche from the 1980 eruption was up to 0.7 cubic miles (2.3 km3) in volume, making it the largest in recorded history. However, the scale of it still pales in comparison to far larger debris avalanches that have occurred in the geological past elsewhere on Earth." 2

How many miles a day to get fit? I started bicycling about a year ago.  I am up to about 10 miles in a 45 minute period and stuck there.  I've been thinking that I"m not getting enough exercise though and considering switching to jogging.  Do folks who use bicycling as exercise HAVE to cross train to see results? It depends on how you define fit. Ten miles in 45 minutes is a great start. But I don't measure my workouts/rides in terms of miles. I measure it in terms of duration and quality. If you do a ten mile ride, and a majority of it is downhill, then you're really not getting much of a workout.\n\nI focus on the quality of the ride. I mix things up, mainly because I race.\n\nIn terms of weight management, I tend to work on long, slow base miles over the winter months. This helps the body learn to use fat as a source of energy before burning up other valuable energy sourecs. This also prepares the body for more intense workouts as the season progresses. That's when the intensity workouts kick in - things like sprint workouts, intervals (multiple reps at a higher, fixed intensity), hill repeats. This, combined with racing helps me raise and maintain my fitness and speed.\n\nTo translate it into something you can use, the basic message here is that whatever you do, increase the distance and/or intensity of your rides SLOWLY - this is to prevent injuries. Keep at it, and you'll find your fitness will improve. You'll find that you can ride farther and with less effort over the same distance as in the past.\n\nGood luck! 6

Why is "number" abbreviated as "no" when there is no "o" in number?  the reason that the word "number" is abbreviated "no" even though there is no "o" in it is because believe it or not the average person pronounces it with an "o" like n"o"mber which if you ask me is really stupid. ( next itme your out listen to the average Educated person and how they pronounce it,....you'll be surprised :) :)....) 4
Is it a law that deployed people be paid by their current employer while gone?  Absolutely not. some large employers, as a matter of policy may pay you some or all of your salary for some period of time.\n\nMost civilian employers support their servicemembers by holding positions for them, while some even maintain insurance benefits. The better the relationship these deployed citizen-Soldiers maintain with their employer, the better their reintegration is likely to be upon returning to their civilian jobs.\n\nthe only legal requirement is tha they not discriminate under the guidelines of the Uniformed Services Employment and Re-employment Rights Act. This act provides strict guidance for both servicemembers and employers. Some employers choose to go above and beyond what the act requires. 10

Is it okay for two cousins to mess around if they are of the same sex? I walked in on my little brother and our cousin messin around the other nite. They did'nt see me and I did'nt let them know I knew. They were so into what they were doing they did'nt notice me. So I just backed out of the room. I want to let them know that I know but I don't want to freak them out. Is it okay that two cousin mess around in their early years and should I say something to them? I think two boys or two girls of the same sex should be able to "mess around" on their own terms.\nAs long as it isnt more than messing around.\nEven if they're cousins they still have the right to experiment with their bodies at any age. Incest is weird but to each his own. In this type of messin around between cousins there will be no baby produced like between boy and girl and no incest baby being born for these kissin cousins I am curious about the ages though. Kids usually experiment "with messin around"  from the ages of 9 - 16 no matter what you try to do to stop them. Unlike some have expressed here, do not tell they're parents it is none of any of your business so back off and give positive guidance without confronting them in an awkward and detrimental way by poking into their lifes. Let their parents find out on their own and deal with it themselves. You shouldnt go around sneaking up on people or you find something you didnt want to find out  So back off. Really its natural and ultimately will not harm them. Believe it or not most boys experiment sexually with each others when they are younger and many don't.... But most that do won't admit it if they are "straight" when they grow up. And if they grow up gay so what... from what I know of, the biggest problem gays have is deciding on vacationing in Paris or the Hamptons. So ease off.  Gay people ROCK ! They'll be okay and now you know... don"t go "walking in" on them or anybody else. Nosy 9

why are men unfaithful in a marriage?  Because for every unfaithful man, there is a woman who disrespects marriage as much as the man she is cheating with.  She may be married, she may be single, but she certainly has little if any respect for marriage.\n\nSo why is ANYONE, regardless of gender unfaithful to marriage?\n\nBecause they are selfish. 9
Why is George Bush doing a good/bad job?  Bad Job:\n\n1. When he took over office he had a surplus of cash; now we have a deficit of 8.1 trillion dollars.\n\n2. Took us to war for oil and lies.\n\n3. Illegally spying on his citizens. \n\n4. reacted extremely slow to the hurricane Katrina crisis and stated that there was no way to know that this could ever happen.  Even though there where numerous reports that this will happen and he cut the levy's budget the summer prior.\n\n5. Lowered taxes on the richest of the rich in America and to help cut savings have recently decided to cut spending on medicade, medicare, and education programs.\n\n6. Never really won the popular vote in the 2000 election.\n\n7. Used cocaine and other illegal narcotics and has been convicted of a DUI.\n\n8. Draft dodger\n\n9. Could care less how the other 50% (Democrats)of the population feel about his policies.  \n\n10. Incorporating religious philosophies with politics and law.  Even though the basic principal of our countries laws and ideologies is the separation of church in state. \n\n11. Trying to get a Supreme Court justice who will overthrow Roe vs. Wade.\n\n12. There is many more reason why he is a bad president, a bad person, and there will sadly be more reason to dislike him to come. 10
what is a single-meber district?  Single meMber district? This might help...\n\nThe plurality voting system (also known as first past the post) is a voting system used to elect a single winner in a given election. In political science, the use of the plurality voting system alongside multiple, single-winner constituencies to elect a multi-member body is often referred to as single-member district plurality or SMDP. Plurality voting is also variously referred to as winner-take-all or relative majority voting; however, these terms can also refer to elections for multiple winners in a particular constituency using bloc voting.\n\nThe term first past the post (abbreviated FPTP or FPP) was coined in an analogy to horse racing, where the winner of the race is the first to pass a particular point on the track (in this case a plurality of votes), after which all other runners automatically and completely lose (that is, the payoff is "winner-take-all"). There is, however, no "post" that the winning candidate must pass in order to win, as they are only required to receive the largest number of votes in their favor. This sometimes results in the alternate name "furthest past the post". It also tends to magnify the winning party's victory--that is the winning party tends to get a larger percentage of the seats than of the popular vote, as estimated by the cube rule.\n\nPlurality voting is used in some former British colonies [1] and is used in 43 of the 191 countries in the United Nations.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-member_district_plurality 10

In American politics, what is a filibuster? Who holds the record for the longest filibuster in US history?  In a legislature or other decision making body, a filibuster is an attempt to obstruct a particular decision from being taken by using up the time available, typically through an extremely long speech.\n\nSenator Strom Thurmond (D-SC) set a record in 1957 by filibustering the Civil Rights Act of 1957 for 24 hours and 18 minutes, although the bill ultimately passed. 10
how does blood clean cells?  Blood provide 2 functions for all of the cells in your body. It brings nourishment to it such as vitamins, minerals, water, and oxegyn. It also carries the waste created by the cells away. Just like every human creates waste, such as fecal matter and urine, every cell also creates waste. The blood carries the waste away and takes it to elimination organs such as the bowel, skin, kidneys, and the lungs. 3
how do i use an external hard drive?  There are different types of hard drives, but usually the new ones come with an external enclosure with either a USB port or a Firewire (IEEE1394) port.  If you have a computer with either of these ports you are good to go.  Since I have a USB drive, I can provide you these steps:\n\nAssuming that you have switched on your computer, connect the hard drive to the power supply (some drives can directly take power from the USB cable and hence don't need to be connected to the power supply).  So verify first whether your drive needs a power supply.\n\nSecondly, connect the drive via a USB cable to the USB port of your computer.\n\nIf you have Windows XP, it will automatically recognize the drive as a USB device (so you don't have to install special drivers, if you are using Windows 98, you might have to install USB drivers that come with the external drive before connecting it to your PC).\n\nThats it, you are all set.  You can access the drive using Windows Explorer or My Computer and save files to it just like your computer's internal hard drive. 5
WHAT BENEFITS DOES IT HAVE FOR CHILDREN TO LEARN TO TAP DANCE HE IS 5 YEARS OLD?  Five is a great age to start learning to tap dance. It is fabulous in terms of teaching pattern recognition, sequencing, counting, etc - all very useful in learning arithmetic. Similarly, it is good for instilling musicality, rhythm and observation skills (both listening and visual). Because of the precise nature of tap (i.e. mistakes stand out), it is very good at helping kids learn how to work cooperatively in groups. It teaches a form of artiistic expression, music appreciation and cultural history. The work habits gained through learning something like tap - that mastery is only achieved through hard work and practice - get carried over into everything else the child does. 4

how to delete yahoo email account?  Long story short :  https://edit.yahoo.com/config/delete_user\n\nTwo ways to delete your Yahoo Account\n\n(1) Get it deleted by inactivity\n(2) Terminate your account manually\n\nFor the first method, just don't login to your account for 4 months, and your account gets deleted. But the waiting period is quiet long. It is a good policy by Yahoo, as it helps maintain an accurate number of users. I remember, when Hotmail used to brag about in its initial days about its huge userbase, most of its accounts were never used by users(who had registered themselves to get a taste of what email is called). Yahoo always gave an accurate picture. Also, for common usernames like amitgupta, emmacooper, etc which are never available (due to large no of people having these names), a chance is available to the new users to get such usernames from users who are inactive( which generally have to be registered as emmacooper1232005 due to unavailability)\n\nFor the second method, I gave you the link above. The advantage is that your account is terminated instantaneously. You can read the explaination at http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/edit/edit-23.html 5

Thanks for the answers, May i know what mathematic operation do i need to apply??  1) keep "people" the same; balance "minutes" \noperation: solve this proportion\n\nprevious sheets : NEW SHEETS = previous minutes : new minutes\n\nNEW SHEETS = previous sheets * new minutes / previous minutes\n\nNEW SHEETS = 2 * 10 / 5 = 2*2 = 4\n\nat this point you know that 2 people can work 4 sheets in 10 minutes.\n\nNow keep minutes the same. Balance sheets with a proportion:\n\nNEW PEOPLE : old people = new sheets : old sheets\n\nNEW PEOPLE = old people * new sheets / old sheets\n\nNEW PEOPLE = 2 * 20 / 4 = 2 * 5 = 10\n\n10 is the answer 2
Who are these Christians going door to door? Did I miss something? I have heard a few times now Christians going door to door and telling people they are going to hell. Who are these Christians? What denomination are they? On average are these in certain cities? Please someone fill me in. I can't find a church in my area going door to door. I know of a religion that does that but they are not Christians. Someone who knows anything about this please tell me. There are many Christian groups that are nondenominational(they have no organized church) that go around. most tend to be strong on the you are damned to go to hell story. Thsi is probably why you cannot find the church they are coming from.\nP.S. from my experiance mormons and JW's do not say you are going to hell. 1
who are the space scientists of india?  I would list first  the late Vikram Sarabhai and his Physical Research Laboratory at Ahmedabad. I am consciously omitting space technologists from the list. Another great institution for space sciences is the Tata Institute of Fundamental research at Mumbai. Another source is the Indian National Committee for Space Research. A visit to their web sites will help identify individual researchers. They are too many to name. 2

someone once told me that christians can do whatever they want because jesus died for their sins. true?  There have been some good answers so far but let me add another perspective. When a person becomes a Christian, they become a different person with a new nature-the nature of God. With this new nature comes a whole new set of desires. A Christian wants what God wants. As someone once said, "if it pleases you to please God then you can do what you please." \n\nOf course there are times in the life of a Christian when we let our human desires over-rule what God wants. But when you do something wrong, which the Bible describes as sin, then a true Christian will immediately feel bad about it and repent. Repent means to change your thinking and thus your actions. So a Christian will immediately acknowledge it as sin, reject it, and receive God's forgiveness. Since Christ died for all of our sins, He thus secured God's forgiveness for us. Therefore, as Christians we are forgiven. \n\nHowever, this is NOT an excuse to keep on sinning. And as a true Christian you should not want to continue in a life of sin.  For additional info you might check out the chapter entitled Your Means of Exchange: The Cross-Forgiveness in the book, Introducing The New You. 1

how did the term red herring come to be?  The phrase red herring has a number of metaphorical senses that share the general sense of something being a diversion from the original objective:\n\n    * a type of logical fallacy in which one purports to prove one's point by means of irrelevant arguments. See Ignoratio elenchi.\n    * in detective work, mystery fiction, and puzzle-solving, a false clue which leads investigators, readers, or solvers towards an incorrect solution.\n    * in politics, a minor or even phony issue trumped up as being of great importance, in order to influence voters to vote for one party or candidate and against the other, or distract from more important issues that might help the opposing party.\n    * in literature, a plot device intended to distract the reader from a more important event in the plot, usually a twist ending. See also MacGuffin.\n    * in adventure games, an item or object of no practical use; its purpose may be to frustrate the gamer who tries to find the intended use for it. Famous examples are the chainsaw of Maniac Mansion and the actual red herring (although this fish proved useful...) in the original Monkey Island game. Some red herrings exist because some secondary plots or puzzles that existed in drafts were removed from the latest version of the games, but some of the items relevant to those puzzles were forgotten and made their way into the game.\n\nThe phrase is believed to originate from the practice of saving a hunted fox by dragging a red herring across its trail to cause the pursuing hounds to lose the true scent and follow the false trail of herring odour instead. 4

how many pyramids are discovered in Egypt ?  There are no more famous ancient sites within Egypt, or for that matter elsewhere in the world, than the Great Pyramids at Giza. They are, without question, the icon most associated with the Egypt. They have been both the main destination for tourists, and a source of imaginative thought to the world for over three thousand years.\n\nHowever, there are actually over 100 pyramids in Egypt, many of which are relatively unknown to anyone who is not an ancient Egypt enthusiast. All but a very few are grouped around and near the City of Cairo, just south of the Nile Delta. Otherwise, only one royal pyramid is known in southern Egypt (at Abydos), that being the one built by Ahmose, founder of the 18th Dynasty and Egypt's New Kingdom. It may have also been the last royal pyramid built in Egypt.\n\nHence, major pyramids were not built throughout Egypt's ancient history. The Pyramid Age began with a burst of building, starting with the 3rd Dynasty reign of Djoser. Some of the early kings, most specifically Snefru, built more than one pyramid. Almost all of the kings added to their number through the end of the Middle Kingdom, with the possible exception of the First Intermediate Period between the Old and Middle Kingdoms. After the first Pharaoh of Egypt's New Kingdom, Ahmose, royal pyramid building by Egyptians ceased entirely. Somewhat abruptly the kings of the New Kingdom chose, rather than making their tombs completely obvious, to hide them in the hills of the West Bank of Thebes (modern Luxor).\n\nHowever, smaller pyramids were constructed, for example in the Deir el-Medina necropolis, by private individuals. The Late Period Nubians who ruled Egypt also built relatively small pyramids with much steeper sides, though these were in fact constructed in Nubia itself. This tradition was carried on in Nubia after these southern rulers lost control of Egypt, and eventually, more pyramids were actually built in Nubia than Egypt, though on a much smaller scale.\n\nOther pyramids in the world certainly exist, but their purpose, for the most part, was different than those of ancient Egypt. The most famous outside Egypt are probably those located in Mexico and to the south of Mexico, but these appear to have been built more as temples. In Egypt, all but a select few of the pyramids were built as tombs, sometimes to hold the physical body of a pharaoh (as well as other individuals), or to hold the soul of the deceased (as in the case of the small cult pyramids built next to the larger ones). Otherwise, the purpose of only a few small, regional stepped pyramids remains elusive.\n\nWhile pyramids were, for the most part, tombs for the Pharaohs of Egypt, one must nevertheless question the reason that Egyptian rulers chose this particular shape, and for that matter, why they built them so large. Today, we believe that they chose the shape in order to mimic the Benben, a pyramid shaped stone found in the earliest of temples, which itself is thought to symbolize the primeval mound from which the Egyptians believed life emerged. This also connected the pyramid to Re, the Sun God, as it was he, according to some of the ancient Egypt mythology, who rose from the primeval mound to create life.\n\nAs far the great size of many of the pyramids in Egypt, we can really only surmise that the Pharaohs were making a statement about their own power and perhaps, about the glory and strength of their country. However, it should also be remembered that many of the latter pyramids were not nearly as large as the Great Pyramids at Giza (and elsewhere).\n\nPyramids evolved. The first of them was not a perfectly formed pyramid. In fact, the first Pyramid we believe that was built in Egypt, that of Djoser, was not a true pyramid at all with smooth sides and a point at the top. Rather, its sides were stepped, and the top of the pyramid truncated with a flat surface (as best we know). As the Egyptian pyramids evolved, there were failures as well glorious fail 4
Why do people still stand behind GW? Can someone tell me how it is that people here can still support and defend GW when the man has done nothing but lie to us from day 1 , most of the world is against us, I'm all for supporting our country and staying true to my country ,but that does not mean that I have to turn a blind eye to the corrupt things this president has done or support it. I often ask myself the same question. \n\nThe sheep stand behind him because this administration has done a successful job in terrorizing his (Bush's) supporters with fear. They use the crayola chart to let people know the 'terror threat' yet they want people to live their lives and not let what happened on 9/11 to affect how we live. The crayola chart really is only needed by state and local governments as it advises if they need more resources for that particular time frame. (public servants)\n\nIn the name of ' I don't like that party ', people will side with him as well. So Bush could have told people that he is the spawn of Satan and people would have still voted for him becuase they so much dislike the opposing political party. 10
how hot is the sun?  It depends whether you want the core temperature or the surface temperature.  The Sun's outer visible layer is called the photosphere and has a temperature of 6,000°C (11,000°F) around the surface.  Solar energy is created deep within the core of the Sun.  It is here that the temperature (15,000,000° C or 27,000,000° F). 2

Would you have a better chance of going to heaven if ...? you are a convicted murder who repented, or a gay couple who have never done any thing wrong to any body and saves the rain forest and all that goody two shoe stuff, the only thing that you ever did that might get you noticed at the gates was fall in love with a person of the same sex This is not a question. Be honest with yourself and us. \n\nBut if you want the truth, there is only one sin and one sin alone that keeps us from heaven, and that is not receiving God's free gift of salvation through His Son. You need to realize that good works do NOT get us to heaven. You cannot buy your way there, that is why Jesus had to pay the price for us. It is a debt we could not pay. But don't worry, if you want your companion more than God, He will not stand in the way of your decision, that is what free will is for. If you are willing to pay an eternal price for such a decision, it will be your choice and your choice alone. You might want to talk to God about it first. 1

How can you tell if your penis is circumsized or not?  The Penis "Head" is covered with foreskin. The entire Penis looks like one big piece of d--k. You have to hold the Penis with one hand,and pull back the skin with the other,and if then,you see the head,(you do know what that looks like-don't you?),then you ARE NOT circumcised. If you can see the head,without pulling back the foreskin,then YOU ARE circumcised. If you are not circumcised,then you should always pull back the foreskin,to wash the head,or "Smegma"(a slimy substance that accumulates there),can cause all sorts of sexually transmitted diseases. You should also wear a condom,until you can get circumcised. (PS) Talk to your parents about getting the surgery ASAP. 3

Why is there no frost on a windy night? In the winter, I often have to scrape my windshield in the morning.  However, if the night before was windy, I don't have a frost problem. It is more difficult for the moisture to accumulate on your windshield when it is windy.  It takes some time for water to freeze when there is no wind at all so you can imagine how difficult it would be for water to accumulate and freeze when the wind is blowing. 2

every time I try to address 192.168.2.1 I get page unavailable,why?  What do service do you expect to find at 192.168.2.1?\n\nAs mentioned by others, the 192.168.*.* range is for private networks. In its most common useage, its used by home routers and wireless access points for home networks. If you have a LinkSys, DLink, NetGear or 2Wire router, your local network is in the 192.168.*.* range.\n\nSpecifially, most of these devices use 192.168.1.1 to get you to their configuration page. If you're trying to configure your router, try 192.168.1.1 instead, and I think you'll get the result you're expecting. 5
How do you deal with a cheating sister? I walked in on my now ex, and my sister sleeping together.  I walked away, and stopped talking to her, two years ago.  I can't find it inside to talk to her or look at her with out really wanting to scream...  They just got engaged.  My mother wants me to attend the wedding. She thiks I should put it away and be there.  I don't think this is a good idea.  I am not saying I would cause a fight, but I can't sit there and watch her make vows to the same man I did.  I don't feel it is beacuse of who he is, but of what she did.  I don't feel much at all for the lost of him.  I can't stand the betrayl from her. what do I do? I'm sure your mother means well, but she doesn't understand the hurt and pain that you are going through. It's easy for her to say "Put it away" because she's not the one who was betrayed.\n\nWhether or not to attend the wedding should be entirely your choice. Don't let anyone else guilt you into going. If you are still working through the hurt, you have to do what's right for you. Everyone has the right to set and maintain their own boundaries and to work through their pain on their own schedule.\n\nDo what you know is right in your heart, and don't let anyone else make you feel bad about it. You don't owe an explanation or justification, either. Stick to something simple: "I just don't feel ready to do that" should suffice.\n\nHopefully someday you'll be able to work through this and have a relationship with your sister. But that's something that cannot be rushed, and no one else has the right to push you.\n\nDr. Barb Nefer, http://www.bnlifeskills.com 9

The biggest thing I have seen that helps...just staying active mentally and physically.  FI you feel good you will look good and be your body and mind will not get as stressed and not hold as much stress.  Hope it helps. 3
Where can I find magazine articles, and other stuff about schizophrenia? I am working on my term paper, and my topic is on Schizophrenia, and I am just trying to find some articles about it. So any help that you guys have to offer, would be greatly appreciated. The very first place I'd look (in the odd event that you didn't) is in the DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th Edition). In fact, that should pretty well do it. I would also be prone to look to check out some books specifically about the disorder for reference (a link with many is included in my sources).\n\nAs for magazine articles and things of that nature, I haven't really seen many reputable sources. I mean there may be a study in a Scientific American somewhere, but even that is fairly doubtful. It's just really not something to throw in a magazine (Mental Disorder Monthly would be kind of odd don't you think?) 3

What does it mean when a guy says yes to a date? when i asked him he was surprised I asked him and he said yes (right away).  he did not tell me what day we will go out he only said we will have enough time to go out. should i ask him what he meant by this or should i wait until he says something. If you asked me on a date, I would have made arrangements to make it a night that you would want to date me again.I think he was in shock, to be asked and just put some icing on your attempt to get him through that situation,which is very wrong...You need to ask him if he is joking you or not,and be straight forward with him...Whatever you do,don't wait around for the answer,because there are many men that will not turn you down...Unfortunately I would,because I am married to that girl that asked me out...lol 9

Look at this? Do you think porn should able to be placed on the inter net if so why? No, it's another way to degrade women and to make us feel we need to get boob jobs and what not.  It's just way too accessible.  I'm all for free speech and all that sort of stuff (I'm a die hard Democrat), but I think it deserves SOME regulation.  It's gotten out of hand. 9

For how long can you post obscenities in this forum before the moderators notice? Note that I'm not encouraging you to post obscenities.\nI'm not discouraging you either.\nDoes it depend on which forum you post in, how offensive it is or simply if someone reports it? I really have no idea, I have had some cencered that I didn't think was to bad, and others that were bad were there for a day. So my answer is who knows. 7

You're experience typical college burn out blues.\n\nMy advice: bite the bullet and get it over with, so you can get on with your life.\n\nIf you drop out now, I predict other distractions will grab your attention, and you'll end up postponing even further what remains of your degree completion. 4
Why is the sky blue?  The sky is blue due to atmospheric scattering of blue light. Blue photons are the most energetic of the visible light photos, and interact more with the atmosphere as a result. To be clear, all colors get scattered, it s just that blue is affected the most because of it is more energetic.   A related effect happens around sunset. At this time of day, sunlight needs to travel through significantly more air to reach your eyes. The length of air is so long that nearly all the blue and green is scattered away before it reaches you. All that is left is yellows, oranges and reds, some of which reaches your eyes, and the rest scattered in the sky within your view. 2

what is known about Xena, the 10th planet ? what do you know about previous year discovered planet Xena, it was named ? I'm interested in this a lot.\nthank you for answers. According to Wikipedia, the official designation of this "planet" is 2003 UB313.  Its discoverers claim that it is definitely larger than Pluto, and that it has at least one moon.\n\nThe name is not actually Xena, and this is simply a codename used by the discoverers, and has not been submitted to the International Astronomical Union for consideration as a real name for the planet.\n\nIt's roughly 20 percent larger than Pluto, I guess.  They can't disclose the name that they will be proposing for the planet.\n\nThere is a re-definition of the term "planet" going on right now by the IAU, so it is possible that this will turn out not to be considered an actual planet.\n\nMore info here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_UB313 2

That makes u that better person, that motivates u into being bad or good or doing bad or good. 1
the incumbency effect? explain and analyze "the incumbency effect and what factors account for it The first, and most central, fact we should know about congressional elections is the incumbency advantage (see the following section for useful tips on how to teach about incumbency). Simply put, what we mean by this is that incumbent members of Congress are at a great advantage when running for reelection; over time, incumbents are reelected close to 95% of the time. Some years, this figure climbs as high as 98%; in 1998, for example, 395 out of 403 incumbents who sought reelection were successful (seven lost in the general election and one lost his primary). \n\nFour Central Facts about Incumbency \n\n1. Incumbents win an overwhelming proportion of the time because they have significant advantages. These advantages include the ability to send free mail to their constituents and the ability to perform little favors for their constituents.\n\n2. Incumbents win reelection so often because congressional elections are usually poorly followed by media and by the voters. Voters in congressional elections often vote by simple cues such as party and/or name recognition (incumbents have the advantage because their names are more likely to be known). Issue positions or policy behavior while in office affect few people's votes.\n\n3. Congress as a whole is unpopular, but incumbents can nicely weather the storm. An unpopular institution does not affect the reelection ambitions of its members.\n\n4. Members of Congress "run scared." Even in the absence of any reason to fear for their electoral lives, the worry incessantly about losing the next election. This keeps them risk averse and keeps their behavior in line with what they perceive their constituents want.\n\nFor a good site that discusses other aspects of the incumbency effect as well as provides a great annotated bibliography on the topic check out the source below. 10
why doesn't my boyfriend act like he wants to be with me? I need some help! Ok, my boyfriend and I have been together for almost 2 years and we broke up for 2 months and we just reciently got back together. But now he doesn't even want to kiss me or do anything with me. He bairly see's me or talks to me during the day. He says he wants to be with me, but why isn't he acting like it at all? Heh.\n\nHe prolly doesn't know how to act. Maybe he does want to be with you but feels uncomfortable. Sounds like there's prolly still some bad blood that has to do with the breakup from before. 9
I'm interested in designing a wall of some 20 framed pictures. i need suggestions on placement?  I usually place the biggest one first.

With one year left on my lease for my retail store, when should I begin to re-negotiate for a new one? I have a retail store with one year left on my lease. I am wondering when would be a good time to start talks with the landlord. Should I wait for another 3 months or perhaps 6 months? Or should I let it be known I want to extend it now? I would start to plant the seed with the landlord soon. You will be in a better position to negotiate with him if you have more time and thought invested. Start by dropping hints and let him know what you like and dislike about where you are. Also check out what similar areas in other retail locations are renting for. Not for the sake of moving, but to use in your negotiation process if needed.\n\nNegotiating is like dating. Not many people say yes to a marrige proposal on the first date. You have to court that person for some time before popping the big question. 7

I want to start a home based web design business. What is the best way to start?  You may want to check out freeservers.com they have free pages & the hosting fees aren't that bad when you want to upgrade.\nThen you will want to start learning something about HTML/XHTML so that you can check coding of your pages. A good HTML/XHTML editor is PageBuilder (it's gone public domain now) \nAnother thing you can do is get the Yahoo SiteBuilder. It's a WYSIWYG editor and can help you learn to code. But remember that your pages may not work in all browsers unless you are using XHTML.\nYou'll have to pick your own software for that kind of editor. I'm still looking too. 5
What is the real reason for the war in Iraq?  Take a look around your own group of friends. Things get dull and right away someone starts stirring up trouble to make things interesting.\n\nThe same thing happens on a macro-scale. We can't live without arguing and fighting about something. If we get out of Iraq, we will have to send our boys somewhere else otherwise, they'll just hang around the inner city killing their local homies or, they'll sit around idle on a base in Germany cultivating a heroin addiction. 10
What would you rate The Exorcism Of Emily Rose on a scale of 1-10?  5.  Wasn't scary.  Good effects of her nightmarish visions.  The only part that really freaked me was her shouting in Aramaic, saying she was Lucifer, etc.  \n\n'72 Exorcist still reigns in this department. 8
Will beaming people up like on Star Trek ever be possible?  The uncertainty principle only really applies to subatomic particles - atoms are too big to have any effect. Since we change all of our atoms frequently, replacing them by transportation wouldn't really matter. The important thing is capturing your entire pattern and reproducing it elsewhere.\n\nThis is where the problem lies:\n1) Its a huge amount of information to capture, transmit and reassemble in a sufficiently short amount of time (exabits a seconds)\n2) You would need some reassembly mechanism at the other end - transporting onto a new planet doesn't make sense\n\nSo - transportation from one device to another may be possibly eventually (given the acceleration of technology about 70 years), but transportation as in Star Trek - probably not. 2

How do I wipe a NTFS hard drive file system? I need to wipe my whole hard drive clean as can be. My whole system is corrupted and I need to start over from scratch. To wipe all data and make sure nothing can be retrieved, you will have to format the drive several times - I believe its seven times if you want to be absolutely certain that its wiped clean, and that no one can retrieve any data from the drive.\n\nHave a look for hard drive erasers on download.com or tucows.com.\n\nIf you wish to just reformat and reinstall, lets assume its Windows XP that you are reinstalling since you didn't say:\n\n1. Put Windows XP into your CD-ROM, reboot your machine.\n\nIf your machine doesn't boot from the CD-ROM drive, you need to change some settings in BIOS.  Reset the machine again, tap DELETE or F1 to get into your BIOS setup.  Change your boot priority to include your CD-ROM drive before the hard disk.  Save and reboot machine into Windows XP CD-ROM.\n\n\n2. When the installation disk finishes booting, follow the instructions from there to reformat your hard disk and reinstall windows. 5

How much do Cirque du Soleil performers get paid? I just saw the excellent Varekai show in Miami. I've also seen La Nouba in Orlando. Just as a curiosity, I was wondering what is the range of salaries for Cirque du Soleil performers. From a CNN Interview\n\nCOLLINS: Now 28 and an acrobat in the Las Vegas show Mystere, Danielle is considered a veteran performer. Cirque pays its performers a yearly salary ranging from $30,000 for an apprentice to more than $100,000 for an established artist. After 10 years, Danielle wonders what's next. 8
If it's illigal to release yourself with any woman, I guess woman should cover themself to prevent us being ho  I'd ask you to post a couple clues here so we can actually figure out what you're asking about, but that would require the asker to actually have a clue...\n\nPlease pardon the rudeness, but there are far too many poorly-presented questions like this on here.\n\nTo respond to your updated question, It isn't necessarily government that enforces dress codes. A little morality and common sense comes into play there.\n\nAnd, how a woman dresses is going to create a lable for her, no matter how good she looks. That's just the way society is.\n\nDid I get a little closer to your answer that time? 9

How did Aztec life and culture affect our world today?  Aztecs brought the concept of the number zero...also calendars of today are derived from the Aztec calendar....The following words come from the Aztec language Nahuatl: (coyotl)Coyote, (mizquitl) Mesquite,(tomatl)tomato.  Also Aztecs used saunas, took daily baths (unlike the conquistadores), ate/drank chocolate, tatoos used by the lower class to improve their looks, had gardens sorrounding their homes, Aztecs used symbols similar to the characters used by the Chinese and Japanese, the poinsetta (in Spanish: Noche Buena and in Nahuatl: Cuetlaxochitl).  And finally one thing the Aztecs did that all societies should do but dont is that in the Aztec culture young and middle aged men were impaired by strict social barriers against drinking alcohol.... 1
Can Britney Spears really sing? I think she sucks. There's no point trying to be Madonna if u don't have her talents, right? I agree with you. It's amazing who they give a singing contract too. The only thing that's getting her where she is her body and how she likes to flaunt it. Plus she is doing the most stupid things like marrying a dead beat. 8
If a 1000 lb brown bear&1000 lb siberian tiger fight who would win?Since they live together this must happen.?  The largest brown bear in the world is the Kodiak bear, attaining a weight of 1,600 pounds and ten feet in height as it rears up to fight. Siberian tigers do not weigh 1,000 pounds. They max out around 650 pounds and are 13 feet long including the tail, the body is 9 feet. Neither animal would want to test the strength of the other so any encounter would probably result in a stalement with both animals not wanting to get hurt and moving along. But the bear is a more powerful animal and would beat a tiger in my opinion. 2
What does UIC stand for in the Army? I'm trying to fill out my husband's housing application and it is asking for UIC but i don't know what that stands for. Military and their damn acronyms. The Unit Identification Code (UIC) is a six digit code which uniquely identifies every unit in the Army. 10
How do fractures differ from sprains?  A sprain you can wrap and will heal on its own, a fracture needs to be set.  I thought I sprained my ankle last year and after 6 weeks of it only getting worse, went to the doctor, had an MRI, and found that I fracture my ankle bone and would never heal on its own.  I was in a hard cast, then walking cast, then physical therapy for about 4 months total.  If I had gone to the doctor sooner, I could have cut the hard cast out and my healing time in half. 3

how can i text someones cell phone from my computer?  It is possible. There are a lot of sites that do this.\n\nTest messaing over cellphones are called SMS - short Messaging Service.\n\nLot of websites allow you to do this - for FREE or for a price. Try "SMS from computer" or similar search or yahoo, google, etc.\n\nAs far as I remember www.sms.ac was one of the famous sites.\n\nIn the US, t-mobile also offers free text messaing to their customers from their website. \n\nAnd BTW, if you use Yahoo! Messenger and your contacts have added their cell phone number added. U can txt message them right from Yahoo! messenger. 5

Should teachers be required to renew their credentials every 5 years?  On one side I say yes and on the other I say no. It depends really. Some teachers I do not think should be teachers, and I think this will help remove them, yet the good teachers also may be removed because of that too. 4
where do i find how much i can get if i take my husband to child support?  The child support fund is not fixed. It can be determined based on the ability of your estranged husband to provide the amount. \n\nHowever, the amount or percentage can be established by the Family Court. Don't depend too much on that fund. Even if the court will issue the order, the father might look for other ways NOT to give that support.\n\nWhat can be sure here is that official sanctions can be imposed on the father if he fails to follow the order of the court or to provide what he has promised you or what you have agreed upon. 10

Why do you think Chinese websites are fun if you been to one? TO see a chinese website:  www.qq.com I'm Chinese American and i never been to www.qq.com but i've been to www.oncity.cc .  I think it's mostly because of...\n\nNothing\n\nWhy i think that is because really, their websites are just the same.  I heard that pretty much, all games of chinese are the same reason made.  \n\nWhat makes them "fun" is because they make it like in levels like Yahoo Answer.  They make levels and the higher you are, more people know you.  \n\nLike Oncity, the always have a marriage somethings.  **Fake marriage.  Then, those people who get "married", they send an invitation to others and if you get one, you go up a level. That's really why they like it, it's because you get higher.... 5

Am I the only one on here that digs Al Kooper's music. If not, which songs do you like?  I remember the Super Session album he was on back in the late 60's with Mike Bloomfield. Haven't heard any of his music for years. The song that first comes to mind is Season of the Witch. I believe he also played the great organ part on Dylan's original "Like a Rolling Stone", but I may be mistaken about that. 8
What is your favorite ballpark you have ever visited? Why? My favorite ballpark is Tiger Stadium. I liked the seating, the food prices, and I once had an opportunity to step on the field of Tiger Stadium where many sport legends once stood including Ty Cobb, Babe Ruth, Al Kaline, Joe Carter, and Sammy Sosa. At one time I wanted the stadium to be preserved for future generations but since I don’t see it being developed in the future, I would like to see the stadium demolished but the field preserved for future generations to play on. As a Yankee fan, I am required to say Yankee Stadium but with that park aside... Camden Yards is excellent.  I love the fans there, the micro brews, the statue of Babe Ruth just outside the gates... It is just a cool place. 6
How compatible is a Gemini male with a Pisces female?  As an astrologer and tarot reader, I can tell you for sure, that a Pisces female will suffer in a 75% with a male Gemini, because Pisces is a dreamer, and romantic, Gemini, lies, and they think about themselves first... \nBe careful! 8

how was the quintessence discovered? i dont know enough about any thing in text book  i droped out of school in the 10th grade i didnt like being a geek . but i have been studing on and off for the past 15 years our natural envirement and have partially developed a therory of my own on motion mass and static energy as a binding force,for example the earths center is kind of nucleous that controlls every thing in our world and it is directly effected by the sun through its electomagetic forces and it could be duplicated if i could just talk to some one who knows a lot of info on the relationship between ectricity and magnetic fields mans form of energy franklin could not see the key was the answer to his his own question \n[iron] elementaly srtongest for both aplications and an ore that is aboundantly  found in every living thing attraction like a magnet=gravity Quintessence was discovered by two groups which looked at distant supernova. By seeing how bright the supernova were they were able to estimate how far away they were. This was used to plot the relationship between distance and redshift that can be used to show how fast the universe is expanding.\n\nWhat they found instead, was that the universe is accelerating. That is, the rate and which the universe is expanding today is more than it was a billion years ago, and  in a billion years from today the rate of expansion will be even faster.\n\nThe name "quintessense" is used for various models of the vaccum energy which drive the acceleration of the rate of expansion. The term was chosen because it sound nice and mysterious, it has no connection with any Earth-Fire thing. They could have called it "Peanut Butter" and nothing would have changed in the mathematics - which is what counts.\n\nIf you're interested in science, like it sounds you are, I would strongly recommend reading more about it, and just enjoy the very strangeness of it. Engage with people on message boards. It is extremely difficult to make a major, ground-breaking contribution to physics even with a PhD and research experience. It is basically impossible to do so without one. \n\nI don't mean to be condensending, its just that there were, and still are, a lot of crank theories out there based on a few ideas which may or may not be wrong, but which ignore the VAST amount of experimental data there is about the universe we live in.\n\nYou don't want to fall into the trap of being a crank, or quack. Trust me, I've seen it. (When a post-doc at a big state university.) 2

Are tattoos sacrilegious?  Woo hoo!!  A Jesus and tattoo question, all in one! And it's not even my birthday!  I love this question, Yes in Leviticus it says what the make no marks of the dead or tattoo any marks on your body.  But that's not what it says, the original word in Hebrew that is commonly translated as tattoo is not exactly tattoo, the word is "to put", So in the original Hebrew it says you shall not make cuttings in your flesh or put on marks of the dead, what is a mark of the dead that He is speaking of here?  The demonic ritual cutting and marking of the gods of all the other nations that the Israelites were living around.  \n\nIsaiah 49:16 the Lord says behold I have inscribed your name upon the palms of my hand, and the meaning in Hebrew for the word translated as inscribed is "to cut out or engrave", God was speaking of a common practice to engrave or make marks on hands of things to remember.  \nGod also speaks of earings and nose piercing as ornaments of beauty in Song of Solomon and Ezekiel 16.\nIn Revelation 19 it says that on Jesus' thigh is written a name that no one knows, cool huh!?\nBut, tattoos done out of anger or rebellion, as well as done in demonic or obscene matters(666, pentagrams, pornography)that is sacrilegious.\nAllelujah and Amen. 1

is the luxury class basically parasitic in nature? like i see a lot of wives basking in the reflected glory of their husbands...aint this simply a parasitic existence? The class alone is not merely parasitic. If not for the luxury class, who would start businesses? Not to mention that the service industry feeds off of this class, indeed depends on the luxury of others (the luxury of being able to afford restaurants, hotels, etc.) to support them. \n\nWe live too closely bound on this planet in every way to consider any part of our society parasitic. The institutions of welfare and the like are parasitic in nature, but the people on these services are not parasitic by nature either. They are merely taking advantage of a service which should not be offered in the first place.\n\nAnd I work full time, and live under the poverty line. This is not the elite speaking. This is a hard worker who believes in earning every dime. Don't blame the rich for being rich. That's a bellyaching waste of time. Worry about yourself, your work, your life. It'll all work out.\n\nGood Luck! 1

when is a good time to invest in property?  *********Never.  And Never is too soon**********\n\nThe investment company that I used turned out to be professional scam artists.  They 1) stole my money 2) had my life threatened 3)stole my identity & 4) falsely accused me of trying to steal their property & had me arrested 5) stole my documentation 6) I have been made homeless and had to file bankruptcy. 7) with an arrest I can't get a decent job to feed, clothe or sustain myself or my family. 8) Some days I do not have a roof or food. My life had my families lives have been turned upside down. We have been living in danger for a long time now.  Law Enforcement Agencies have done nothing to stop the criminals.  After this trama, I would never invest in property. \n\nI used to invest in stocks & bonds prior to the stock market lows.  I thought real estate was a slow stable long term method of investing.  It has been a horror story.\n\nJust, Please go to your credit union and open a savings account. Think of your future differently.  I do every day. 7

Energy cannot be created or destroyed is a statement of WHO's LAW?  Energy is created.\nPhysicists currently believe that about 75% of the energy in the universe exists in a form known as dark energy.\nThis energy has a constant density over all space regardless of what the space contains and so the total amount of dark energy increases as at the same rate as the increase of the volume of the universe (which is expanding). 2

My wife wants to gain some weight in a healthy manner - how can she do it? She is age 21, about 98 pounds, very little body fat, eats a healthy balanced diet, and does medium exercise once a day. To gain weight in a healthy manner there are a few options:\n\n1.) You can eat more. There are some weight gainer formula shakes which can be taken daily.\n\n2.) You can exercise more.\n\n3.) a combonation of both. \n\nFrom personal experience I recommend #3. I used to weigh only 140 at 5'11" and now weight 185. If your wife is excercising regularly make sure she is not doing too much cardio. Cardio is the ultimate weight reducer. Even one cardio session can have a lasting effect on how energy gets metabolized. Muscle is denser than fat so the goal is to keep and build as much muscle as possible. (without looking like a freak of nature). Couple that with some extra protien foods like eggs and shakes and you have a good combo at hand. 3
Why is sex so complicated? why is it sex cant just be about pleasure without attachment involved?  Sex is not just an activity. Sex is "supposed" to be a special bonding shared between married people. That is if you believe in God. Otherwise, sex is at the discretion of the two consenting adults as to what it means to them. If you have a blanket that keeps you warm and is very comfortable and feels good, you get attached to it right? Why wouldn't you get attached to some good sex??? 9

If I use half a cup of sugar, does it matter if I use a nonjuice drink mix instead of juice for my toddler?  Why on earth would you want to? The sugar will make her hyper and then she will crash.  It is so much better to give them juice or gatorade or pedialite.  They have important nutrients.  Its important start healthy habits for your child now.  If she drinks sugary stuff when she is young when she is old she won't want anything but sugar and chance are will be obsese later in life because she won't know how to make good eating choices. Good habits start early- she is really impressionable right now. 3

What is the surgical management on abscess like symptoms on six month old root canal? This tooth was previously root canaled.  I thought it was not done before so the dentist drilled this tooth and found that a root canal had already been done before so he resealed it and put a new crown (old one was chipped) on.\nNow, I am positive I have an infection. The superior gum margin is sore and X-ray is non-contributative because the\n infection is small. Three grams/day Amoxycillin for 10 days did not  work. Nor did  Augmentin work.   Now I'm trying Ciprofloxacine.  If this antibiotic doesn't work? What other antibiotic would be next in line to use. What surgical intervention can be done in this delicate case, as a last resort; aside of extracting the tooth. I truly need your advise. The dentist thinks I'm joking because he can't see anything on the x-ray. Help! I find that extremely hard to believe.  A dentist is not going to "drill into" a tooth without first having an x-ray of the tooth.  An x-ray will show whether or not a root canal has been performed.  Thus, the dentist would have known before he "drilled into" the tooth if it had previous root canal therapy. 3

Do you think being bisexual in this day and time bad or good?  It just IS. Why look for value judgements about a fact of life? It may be easier to be bisexual in some places now than in almost all places in the historical past. But one doesn't choose to be bisexual, or gay, or heterosexual, for that matter. The way you treat the ones you love - or even the ones you just have sex with - is what matters. Live your life the best way you know how. That'll be good enough. 9

My max weight is 186 i weight in at 205 and i stand 5'8' how much should i lose and whats the best why to go a  WHAT to eat for losing weight\n\n• Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, especially NC (negative calorie) food.\n\n* Print these lists. They will be your ... "Bible", from now on !\n* Dill and parsely - include them in all your salads. Also ognion + garlic.\n* Try eat mostly fresh vegs & fruits (whenever possible, of course)\n* If you really want a book, then check this out: The Negative Calorie Diet Workbook & Cookbook - eBook (Win95/98 only). Read more about this e-book here.\n\n\n• Eat fish, chicken, beef, pork. (preferences are in this order)\n\n* If you are a vegetarian, then ignore this!\n* Avoid fat meat\n\n\n• Eat 2-3 slices of bread/day. Don't EVER exclude bread from your diet!\n\n• Snacks between meals (if needed): apples, oranges, grepfruits and other NC fruits\n\n* Don't cheat ... NO cookies, chips, candies, brownies etc! \n* EVEN if they have "low fat" indication... They might have low fat, yet they can have lots of CALORIES !!!\n\n\n• About rice, potatoes, beans, [xxx]nuts, pastry, pasta... you know!\n\n* Don't eat too much of those, at least during the first weeks of the diet. I'm not a low carb addict, but I've noticed weight gains if consuming those in large quantities, especially when associated with other foods.\n* If you like them a lot, try and eat them like one meal. A nice delicious plate of spaghetti could be your lunch (never dinner!), followed by a nice big apple. These rich starch foods are not good for dinner!\n* At dinner time, chose mainly large mixed veggies salads... with fish, lean meat or cheese (if you are not a vegetarian). \n\nif u want to lose weight the best food to it are baked potatoes with nothing on it. no salt no nothing just plain. u can eat a 10000000000 baked potatoes till ur stuff and not gain a pound. i heard that from a weight loss tape. the best drink is water or gatorade. thats a start then when you work out do some taeboo. if u want a macine. run with dumbells on a treadmill. u could do the rocky workout. but thats a new story. u could use a butterfly macine i think it works the abs\n\n1) It is not just the amount you eat, but what you eat. Lean meats and vegtables that snap are a good place to start. And by snap I mean fresh and not boiled or doused with better or whatever.\n\n2) Exercise moderatly but for about an hour every other day. Spend half of that walking or running at a good enough pace for you to feel labored. The other half of the time use weights, or exercises such as push ups or situps to get a muscle "burn". A gym is also an option, but I don't know if you have the money for or want to spend the money on it.\n\n3) Sleep well. To bed earlier and up earlier. Exercise in the morning when you wake up, not in the evening before bed. 7 hours of GOOD sleep is a must.\n\n4) Occupy yourself with a hobby that keeps your attention for a long period of time. A hobby like this keeps your mind focused and gives less of a chance for snacking from boredom.\n\nThat is a good place to start... if you see good results, keep it up and modify to fit you... if it does not, see a doctor AND a trainer \n\nKeep working out, drink water a lot, eat 5 to 6 meals a day but in small quantities, vegtables are important specially cucumber and lattice, fruits not be eaten after meals except by 2 to 3 hours, minimize the starch quantities in your meals lots of salad is important, your last meal must be before you sleep by 2 to 3 hours\nthe most important thing is you don't lose patient wait and have a strong will to be as what you want\n\nyou might have some more ideas from www.ivillage.com\n\ngood luck 3

Change yourself and then you will realize that your girlfriend was just another one of your bad choices!\n\nThere are people that dont cheat on each other, but if you cant be responsible and respectable- you are cheating others as well as yourself.\n\n(u must feel lucky to be locked up and still allowed to be on the internet) 9
can you please tell me how long is durable general power of attorney is affective?  The general rule is they are effective until revoked by the grantor or until the grantor's death.  It is possible that a court could revoke the agent's power (i.e. terminate the POA).  For example, an incompetant person cannot revoke his/her POA; so a guardian might be appointed who would revoke the POA on the incompetant ward's behalf. 10

Man troubles...any advice?

TY for any advice. well I would move out cause It'll get worse, before it get better,if he thinks you stole his money,then he does'nt think much of you. sorry that your going through that, I hope it gets better for you, stay strong. 9

What is this script about? Brain Food or Environmental Fodder?\n\n“If Nature nurtures on Nurture, and if Nurture is refined to a more advanced degree, over the ages by Nature; then Nature is refining itself to a finer degree by consumption of an evolving and more sophisticated Nurture, which is further refined by a higher degree of Nature?” \nIf the above seems logical, then life is not an endless circle but a series of concentric and incessant layer upon layer of circular loops, strung out through eternity by the same paradigm, (humanity’s universal umbilical cord) forever and ever, to grow, to protect the Earth, to flourish, to procreate, and to evolve into the desires of God, and then and only then will the ceiling of God’s creation be manifested, if and when.\nTherefore; if humanity thrives on what it sows, and what it sows becomes a better environmentally protected product, then humanity will evolve to a finer degree of life’s quality and continue to refine the products on which it subsists, which in turn will evolve into better human product for continuum of progressive human evolution.\nDoes evolution sound logical?  Do you agree with the above concept? its a philosophical premise to a thesis about nature of man and crap. its all philosophical babble. 1

who is paramahansa yogananda?  Paramahansa Yogananda परमहंस योगानन्‍द (January 5, 1893 – March 7, 1952), was an Indian yogi and guru. He was instrumental in bringing Kriya Yoga to the West.\n\n\nLife\nYogananda was born Mukunda Lal Ghosh in Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh, India into a devout Bengali family. His autobiography claims that from his earliest years, his awareness and experience of the spiritual was far beyond the ordinary. In his youth he sought out many of India's Hindu sages and saints, hoping to find an illumined teacher to guide him in his spiritual quest.\n\nYogananda met his guru, Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri, in 1910, at the age of 17. After passing his Intermediate Examination in Arts from the Scottish Church College, Calcutta, he did his graduation in religious studies from the Serampore College, a constituent college of the University of Calcutta . 1
What is the WILL of the FATHER (God)?

Who all wants more movies without all the computerized special-effects? I'd like to go back to originality. Is that asking too much (a little sarcasm, but not much)? Me.\nI miss films that aren't filled to the brim with cgi.  To me, most of the computer effects look too fake.  I prefer well-made models and costumes (things that look like I could actually reach out and touch them) to cgi. Cgi makes high budget films look like cheap video games.\nI thought all of the characters and ships, etc in the original Star Wars' and the dinosaur models in Jurassic Park were pretty believable.\n\nI must admit, I don't mind studios using computers for adding multitudes of extras or for backdrops (but, I do wish more films were shot on location.) 8

Toleration? Why do we tolerate the extremists in religion? We don't tolerate them but the problem is that the extremists don't preach where there are happy people within a specific community, they target the sad, the poor and all those who have a feeling of injustice or frustration so as to influence them to take revenge upon those who are the source of their suffrance,they also try to influence youngsters as young people don't know much but are powerfully passionated and making them fight for a real or a fake reason becomes easy, as it is difficult for many persons to differentiate a lamb from a wolf when the wolf in question is preaching with passion and devotion the name God. 1
Why do comic book superheroes have such a poor sense of humor?  Thanks to Frank Miller, comic book writers now like to make superheroes dark, gritty, and humorless.\n\nThere are still a lot of wisecracking comic book characters, though: Spiderman, Deadpool, etc. 8

who is the talles man in the world?  Robert Wadlow: World's Biggest Man\nAlton, Illinois \n\nBigness is its own reward. You want to be a success? Sell a bigger burger. Open a megastore or a multiplex. Merge your way into multinational conglomeratehood. \n\nSince size is the prize, it's only right that several towns bank on the man who towered head-and-shoulders above all others. His name was Robert Wadlow, and he stood 8' 11" tall -- the BIGGEST man who ever lived. \n\nRobert Pershing Wadlow was born in Alton in 1918, a normal-size baby, but soon his perky pituitary gland triggered abnormal growth. At the age of 13, already 7 ft. 4 in., he was proclaimed the world's biggest Boy Scout. And he kept getting bigger.... he eventually topped out at 8 ft. 11.1 inches. \n\nAt the Franklin Masonic Temple in Alton, visitors can ponder the massive chair of this modern Goliath. Alton's business leaders can be forgiven if they sometimes sit in Robert's chair, musing over the fate that makes some men big while others suffer shortsightedness and shortfalls. \n\nhttp://www.roadsideamerica.com/attract/ILALTwadlow.html 7

Who is a sound engineer?  Audio engineering is a part of audio science dealing with the recording and reproduction of sound through mechanical and electronic means. The field of audio engineering draws on many disciplines, including electrical engineering, acoustics, psychoacoustics, and music. Unlike acoustical engineering, audio engineering generally does not deal with noise control or acoustical design. Much of audio engineering is also used in broadcast engineering. 2

What happened to the sanctity of marriage? In this society, why is it so acceptible for people to divorce. Why do we laugh at the phrase "Till death do us part"? Are we so morally obscure that nobody can truly believe in true love? Why is infidelity in the mainstream now? Do we just need something to gossip about, or are we truly on the verge of a moral collapse? I believe Henry the eighth is to blame 9

I was fired about 45 days ago for claiming personal expenses in my expense account. What should I do?? Maryland is a "At Will" work state so there is nothing I can do about being terminated. But I am concerned about any follow up actions taken by my previous employer. I do not have the resources to fight them in court. The descrepancies are more a misunderstanding than fraud and under $12,000 over a three year period. Your best bet is to lawyer up.  Retain a lawyer and get prepared for them to press charges.  They will, no doubt, pursue this. $12,000 is a lot of money, and they have to set an example for their other employees. 7

How prophet Muhammad looks like?  No one living knows exactly what he looks like.  Even though for years there have been depictions of Jesus Christ there is only desciptions of him in the Bible that are vague and no one can say for certain that he looks anything like we think that he does.  Muhammad is described in the same type of way, however as it is written that there should be no images of him, the Muslim people have kept it that way and feel that people who do are being disrespectful not only of the prophet, but of Islam as well when this is not followed. 1
I am a decent shy medical professional and need a girl for some discreet dating, please advice.? I have tried few online-dating sites but no luck and I hate wasting time on the net. I'm not exactly sure where you're residing, but sometimes the local newspapers do provide a list of events happening in your area and the idea is just having the nerve to step out of your comfort zone to attend one of these events.

why we see red sky during sunset?  At sun set light travells through dense layers of air close to the surface of earth. These layers are usually loaded with dust particles or water molucles (at lacks and seas). Hwen lihgt passes through these dense areas the particles in the air act as a prism to disperse seven clours of light. Red ligt being the most powerful (shortest wave length) becomes more visible and so sky looks red. However, due to variations of percentage of particles in air different sheds of red colours are experienced at different places and at the same place  on different days. 2

should my child be expected to read by the end of kindergarten?  Mine just turned 4 and he is reading a little.  I bought him a Leapster L-Max for Christmas and it's really good and he reads because he wants to know what to do next.  However, it may be a bad idea for me to let him get too far ahead and then go to a public school where he'll be bored going through the basic steps and probably start causing trouble.\n\nKindergarten is where they begin to learn the basics of reading and have enough knowledge to form words.  So No. 4

What's the best website that I can find information on comparing two topics like:Green Day and Kanye West? Please do not make fun of the fact that my college teacher chose a topic on which we must demonstrate to the 6th graders how to write a comparison story based on detailed facts.The 6th graders voted that they wanted the college students to show them comparison between kanye west and green day because my teacher is interested in green day, and the 6th grade teacher is interested in kanye west, so the 6th graders made a music artists' joke, which came out to be the result of our writing.Thank You so much guys. This isn't very comprehensive, but Google Fight shows how popular they are compared to each other.\n\nKanye - 4,570,000      \nGreen Day - 163,000,000 5

If a child is adopted by the stepfather, can child support be enforced from real father? Childs real parents devorced when child was 4. Whith in a year the mother remarried. When the real father requested that the child come spend a week of xmas vac the mother denied the visitation.She told the father that she wanted her new husband to be his only father. She said she didnt care about the money and she wanted what she felt was best for the child. Neither party made any attempt to contact the other after this and the  child had taken the new last name. 10 years later the mother moved to a differnt state and began collecting back child support via the D.A./ attached wages.The total with interest means that father will have to pay halve his net income for the rest of his life. Laws on support vary from state to state.  The father does have an obligation to obey a support order until it is modified, so the father needs to go back to court  that issued the support order to seek an amendment of the order or to dispute the amount owed. 10

If the flu is contagious how come there is a flu season? Where does it go when it is out of season? From Wikipedia:\n\nOne possible explanation for "flu season" is that, because people are indoors more often during the winter, they are in close contact more often, and this promotes transmission from person to person. Another is that cold temperatures lead to drier air, which may dehydrate mucous, preventing the body from effectively expelling virus particles. The virus may also linger longer on exposed surfaces (doorknobs, countertops, etc.) in colder temperatures. Increased travel and visitation due to the Christmas season may also play a role. 3
how can i landing a set by c prog ramming? structure datas If you can work in C++, there are many set \nimplementations available in the standard template\nlibrary.  However, if you're working in C, you\ncan add functional/useful sets using just a small number\nof bitwise and logical operations.\n\nThe basic idea is that a set will be a bit vector,\nand element "i" will be at position "1<<i".\nFor small sets (say, up to 32 or 64), you can\nhold the sets in a scalar variable.  For larger\nsets, you'd need to create an array of scalars and factor\nthat into the accessing code.\n\nWith no error checking, and just for illustration,\nI've included a trivial example of using "bit vector"\nsets in C:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\ntypedef long set_t;\n\n#define clear_set(x)          (x=0)\n#define set_element(e, x)     (x |= (1<<(e)))\n#define is_element(e, x)      ((1<<(e)) & x)\n#define sizeof_set            (sizeof(set_t)*8)\n\nint\nmain()\n{\n    int i;\n    set_t s;\n\n    clear_set(s);\n\n    set_element(5, s);\n    set_element(15, s);\n    set_element(25, s);\n\n    printf("The set consists of [");\n    for (i=0; i<sizeof_set; i++) {\n        if (is_element(i, s)) {\n            printf(" %d", i);\n        }\n    }\n    printf(" ]&#92;n");\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWhen compiled and executed, it demonstrates that\nit correctly created a set with elements 5, 15, and 25.\n\n$ cc set.c\n$ a.out\nThe set consists of [ 5 15 25 ] 5

How do you feel about the port deals with the U.A.E ?  I think it proves that cronyism is rampant in this administration. You know the UAE "donated" $100 million to the US for hurricane katrina just a few weeks before this all came up, also one of the UAE company that is doin this deal, DP world, top executives has been nominated by W to become our new Maritime Administrator.\n____________________________________________________________\n\nDubai, 24 January 2006: - Global ports operator DP World today welcomed news that one of its senior executives, Dave Sanborn, has been nominated by US President George W. Bush to serve as Maritime Administrator a key transportation appointment reporting directly to Norman Mineta the Secretary of Transportation and Cabinet Member. \n\nThe White House has issued a statement from Washington DC announcing the nomination. The confirmation process will begin in February.\n\nMr Sanborn currently holds the position of Director of Operations for Europe and Latin America for the Dubai-based company.\n____________________________________________________________\n\n\nWASHINGTON -- The United Arab Emirates gave the Bush administration $100 million to help victims of Hurricane Katrina weeks before a state-owned company there sought U.S. approval for its ports deal. \n\nThe White House said Thursday the $100 million for storm victims demonstrates the relationship between the two governments caught in a firestorm over the potential security risks of state-owned Dubai Ports World running significant operations at six major U.S. ports. 10
Where can I find information about "day" teeth clenching?  Clenching your teeth otherwise known as bruxism is harmful to to excessive wear of teeth and can be associated with TMJ problems. Daytime clenching is best managed by behavioral modification of the habit. I.E. pushing tongue against roof of mouth instead of biting down. Muscle relaxants and splints can be used but tend to interfere with normal life. Nighttime clenching is usually controled with a maxillary flat plane applicance that opens your mouth slightly to take it out of optimal function so you don't clench so forcefully during the nighttime. 3

Is it true that Kirlian photos of Idols shows the energy in it?  Kirlian photographs don't show auras anywhere at any time in any thing. All that Kirlian photographs show is the dispersal pattern of water molecules ionised by an electric field. No aura of any sort is produced.\n\nIf you are asking if you can produce a Kirlian photograph of an idol then the answer is yes, provided the idol is moist and not in a vacuum. You can produce a Kirlian photograph of anything if it is moist and not in a vacuum. You can produce a Kirlian photograph of a garden gnome provided you wet it with the hose first. In fact you can produce a Kirlian photograph of the garden hose itself.\n\nKirlian photographs are a hoax, a fraud, a scam for the gullible. Unless you want to suggest that garden gnomes and garden hoses also have 'auras' that much is obvious. 1
how can I make a maya 7 file readable in maya 6?  If you're on a Mac, it's not going to work 100%, but on a PC, you need to save as maya ascii (.ma) and then open the .ma file in a text editor (wordpad should be fine).  Now replace all the 7.0's with 6.5 and save the file.  This should be enough to make it open in 6.5.\n\nHowever, if there are any dynamics or character animation scripts being called or anything that might be 7.0 specific there still could be a problem.  For that you may need further assistance.  Ask another question here if you hit another wall. 5
what is the difference between dvd +r and dvd -r?  They're simply two different competeing formats that developed from two separate consortiums of manufacturers.  -R was the original (developed by Pioneer) and had better compatibility with existing DVD players at the time but this gap has been closed.  +R was developed by Ricoh, Sony and a few others, and came out about 1 year after -R.\n\nI believe there are some differences in the reflectivity of the two formats, since -R only writers cannot burn +R discs and vice-versa.  The main advantage of +R is that all of the current writers support burning up to 16x (only on 16x media - I've only seen -R burners go up to 8x).  Also, I believe dual-layer media is +R format only, but I'm not 100% sure.\n\nToday, other than burn speed, the point is moot since every writer on the market supports both formats and nearly all recent DVD players will read either format (including dual-layer).  Cost of the media between the two formats is about the same as well. 5

Which telescopes are better??, Meade or Celestron?  this is subjective - but - Celestron has been having financial troubles, and was bought by another Far east company, whereas Meade seems to be doing pretty well, and has invested quite a bit in new automated manufactuting in Calif. So if you are talking about their SCT scopes, I think current Meades are likely better than current Celestrons, but the scopes are not all "exactly" the same, and you might find an example of a new celestron that does have better optics. There smaller non-sct scopes are in general, made in the far east and are likely pretty much the same quality.  Again, this is highly subjective, and 10 people will give you 11 opinons.  Meade has just introduced there new RC line, which the current issue of Sky and Telescope raves about as really superior to the SCTs. 2
How do you add video to a webpage?  If you want it to play automatically you can use the <embed> element. This is supported in IE, Netscape and Firefox. The code is (substitute whatever format for avi):\n<embed src="video.avi" />\nThe <embed> element is supported by both Internet Explorer and Netscape, but it is not a standard HTML or XHTML element. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommend using the <object> element instead.\n\nThe code for this is:\n<object data="video.avi" type="video/avi" /> 5

Any helpful mnemonics for trigonometry formulas? Are there any good mnemonics for memorizing trig formulas and identities, such as the addition formulas, e.g.: [ sin(s+t) = sins s cos t + cos s sin t ] and the Double-Angle formulas (sin2 x = 2 sin x cos x)? Here are a couple i learned for double angle formulas.\n\nFor sin(a+b)= sin(a)cos(b)+cos(a)sin(b)\nSay out loud: "sine cosine cosine sine"\n\nFor cos(a+b)= cos(a)cos(b)-sin(a)sin(b)\nSay out loud: "cosine cosine SIGN sine sine"\nNotice the word "SIGN". The word SIGN is there to remind you that the SIGN of the rightmost term has the opposite SIGN of the input to the cosine on the left hand side of the equation (if its a+b, then subtract. if its a-b, then add).\n\nJust say it out loud like 3 times. It has a really nice rythm:\n\n"Sine Cosine Cosine Sine"\n"Cosine Cosine SIGN Sine Sine"\n"Sine Cosine Cosine Sine"\n"Cosine Cosine SIGN Sine Sine"\n"Sine Cosine Cosine Sine"\n"Cosine Cosine SIGN Sine Sine"\n\nSee? Easy. 2

is 3.59 good gpa?  Yes, but try to keep it above 3.50. \n\nPeople might tell you 'oh, don't worry about it', but in reality your gpa can affect scholarships, acceptance into certain programs, and other things.\n\nGenerally speaking, someone with a higher GPA is seen as being more committed to their studies and a better student than someone with a lower GPA. Therefore academic organizations are more interesting in working with persons with a higher GPA. \n\nMaintaining a 3.50 GPA will keep you in the upper echelons of your peers, and that is where you want to be. 4

I'm tired of it and frustrated about this, so how do I change it? My fiance plays video games and is on the computer majority of the day while I cook, clean, and take care of the baby. I tried to give him some space about it but now he has totally taken advantage. I'm tired of doing everything everyday and still have to get up with the baby in the middle of the night like he is so tired when I'm the tired one. I've talked to him about this several times and we've had several arguments about it but I never seem to get through to him. What can I say or do to get my point across? I'm tired of yelling at him about it. I need a break. HELP!!!!! You don't have to worry about whether or not you can make it without him, do you? You're already doing everything on your own anyway, plus taking care of him (his laundry, cooking, s.e.x., etc). \nDoes he work? Doesn't sound like he has time if he's spending that much time on the PC. If he's not even working, then time to tell him to grow up and take on his responsibilities. I would give him say, 2 weeks to get a job or find somebody else to live off of. If he does work, then I'd sit him down or write him a letter explaining how I felt. Do not, whatever you do, start yelling. That will get you nowhere. Let him know that if things don't improve, then eventually, you'll get so sick of it that you will kick him out. Have you asked him what he would do if you decided to stay on the computer all the time and expected him to do everything? \nAnother idea: you could go on "strike" until he does get it and changes. Don't wash him laundry anymore, only yours and the baby's. Don't cook for him anymore, just for you and feed the baby. Don't do his dishes, don't do anything for him. When you've got his attention, I bet he'll listen if he is worth anything. Don't demand he give up the computer completely, but apparently he needs some reasonable time limits. 9

How does the state of SC determine the pay for the Juror? If jury Duty Last more than a week, or reguardless of how long it lasts the pay is unfair. I have bills to pay as I am sure everyone else does. I would just like some answers because no one has offered any to me. The amount is set by the legislature of the state (unless you are on a federal grand jury.)\n\nIf service would work a significant hardship, more so than others, you will almost certainly be excused.  But you'll have to tell the clerk, and probably a judge.  In California, the first form you fill out asks if your work pays you during the time you serve, and distinctions are made on that basis.\n\nJury service is a duty, and a privilege -- part of US democracy, and part of the protections of law we each enjoy.  It isn't fair to cause hardships on the jurors, but don't think of the "pay" as being pay for serving, just as a small offset of expenses. 10

Do engineers get paid more in India then in America?  In absolute $ amount, the wages are higher in the US for the same job. But money has more buying power in India, for the time being. So, in that sense, one can argue that an engineer in India has a better life than an engineer in the US. It all depends on the individual case. 1
I have a defaulted student loan.  Is there any help in getting it out of default?  contact your servicer/gaurantor about student loan rehabilitation.

Is South America becoming the new "USSR" of the 21th century? We have had Fidel Castro for a while now.  Then Hugo Chavez, Evo Morales and now Michelle Bachelet.    Does this sound scary enough:\n\nOn Dec 30th, 2005 during a speech in Cuba Morales describes Castro and Chavez as “the commanders of the forces for the liberation of the Americas and the world”. \n\nOn Jan 3rd, 2006 during a speech in Caracas, Evo Morales announces the consolidation of the “Axis of Good” between Caracas, Havana and La Paz, to counter the “‘Axis of Evil’ led by Washington ”.\n\nSource of quotes from wikipedia.org No.What Fidel and Chavez are doing is to change the point of view about United States and they exterior policy to Latin Americans.This is achieving it, financing the campaigns to the socialist candidates of Latin America, such is the case of Evo Morales and Ollanta Humala, presidential candidate of peru.  Also the integration of Latin America manages to promoting the low " the dream of Simón Bolívar".  But I think that the intelligent leaders as Lula, the president of Brazil, the chosen president Michelle Bachelet, or the president of Argentina, Nestor Kirchner, the ones that agrees them to have relations with the United States, and although they share certain points of its politics with Chavez ó Fidel, they are but open and they will impede that Latin America become a species of Soviet communist block. 10

How do you rate the languages of the world ?can i get the rankings of all the languages ?  When you say rate, I automatically think of which is best. I can't answer that question nor do I think anyone else can. However, what I can tell you is the use of each language (at least approximations). Read on for more details and check the sources as it's a pretty interesting question to answer...\n\nThis question is a very interesting one that has a rather complicated answer.  Estimates of how many people speak a language are quite general and can vary considerably.  For example, English estimates vary from 275 to 450 million, Spanish from 150 to over 300 million, Hindi from 150 to 350 million, and Russian from 150 to 180 million.\n\nTo further complicate matters, the definition of “speaker” can be vague.  Some surveys of languages give information on native speakers only.  Others count both native speakers and secondary speakers (those who use the language regularly or primarily even though it is not their native language).\n\nLastly, it is important to consider not only the population (number) of language speakers, but also the geographic distribution of these languages.  Some languages have relatively large populations of native speakers but are used almost exclusively in a few countries.  On the other hand, other languages have relatively small populations of native speakers but are used in many different countries as an official or national language.\n\n\nThe World's Most Widely Spoken Languages\n\nAvignon (France) Stop (Arabic) Batik (Thai) Narita Airport (Japan)\n\nClick here to see the full data from Comrie (1998), Weber (1997), and the Summer Institute for Linguistics (SIL) 1999 Ethnologue Survey as well as charts comparing the number of speakers of each language and the number of countries using each language.\n\nWhat are the world's most widely spoken languages?\n\nThis question is a very interesting one that has a rather complicated answer.

Adam and Eve, inbreeding to populate earth, vestigial organs...? Do any creationists have a way to incorporate things like vestigial organs with the creation and propagation of humans? Vestigial organs are parts of our body that we don't use, but science thinks we used to at an earlier stage.  ex. appendix, fetal gills Am I the only one bold enough to say this? ADAM AND EVE WERE NOT REAL. Study human evolution and you will better understand where we all came from and why we are hairless and other things as well. Adam and Eve were a construct designed to explain the unexpainable back before we had the means to figure out the truth. Thats what religion is. Sad but true. Not saying there is no God, but religion is mostly just stories put together over our history to explain things as we began to wonder but stilllacked the technology to answer ourselves. Now we do! 1

Why abbreviate to lbs. no. ????? Why does the english language abbreviate the word pounds to "lbs." and the word number to "no." and other similar situated words as those? Pounds abbreviates to lbs because lbs is actually an abbreviation of libres, which is latin for 'pounds'.  Latin is used for abbreviations a lot because its use in the sciences percolates into everyday English, especially for weights and measures. 4
What is UP with all the Chuck Norris stuff?  I feel like everyone is in on the joke but me.? I'm hearing all these stupid quotes about chuck norris at work, home and on SNL there was a skit just the other night about him.  I hear it comes from some website, I don't get it. Is it just that there is nothing to get? He is a CULT icon. Pure and simple. Chuck Norris has made some of the most entertaining movies of all time. Even if they had lousy production values, they entertained a few generations of kids who are now grown up and remember those movies and bring it up for nostalgia. Its a guy thing too. And Chuck is an honest to god badass.\nI think the real question is why he isn't even more popular. 8

My mom says its our religious culture to only wear skirts.? All my life i have been told to wear only skirts.\nWill i be doing wrong as to wear pants? and does my mothers belief have to be mine and my future family's? I grew up (in the US) in a very strict Christian church, where women didn't wear pants, men didn't have beards or mustaches, and all elbows/knees were expected to be covered.\n\nThis was based on a couple of things (based on my opinions, mind you, I'm no theologian). General modesty, and the Biblical passage stating 'a woman shall not wear that which pertains to a man.'\n\nNow, while I respect the intent of these teachings and the people I've known that teach them, I don't feel that the Biblical passage in question necessitates that women should not wear pants. The passage clearly pre-dates the clothes we wear today, and I simply don't believe that God expects us to live at the whim of the times. Taken to its logical conclusion, the idea that women can't wear pants simply because it is the fashion for men to wear them suggests that if all men were suddenly to begin wearing dresses, women by necessity would have to start wearing pants. I don't believe God expects us to live at society's whims like that.\n\nHowever, clothing is a very personal choice. If there is one thing I learned from growing up in that kind of church, it is that I am in no position to impose my own religious convictions upon another person.\n\nI don't believe it is a sin for a woman to wear pants, but when in doubt, I rely upon James 4:17 "Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin." If you believe something, based upon what you have read and what you have been taught and upon your own relationship with God, that is what is right or wrong for you. No one else's personal beliefs or experiences take the place of that. 1
what are ssl conections?  Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS), its successor, are cryptographic protocols which provide secure communications on the Internet. There are slight differences between SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0, but the protocol remains substantially the same. The term "SSL" as used here applies to both protocols unless clarified by context.\n\nDescription\n\nSSL provides endpoint authentication and communications privacy over the Internet using cryptography. In typical use, only the server is authenticated (i.e. its identity is ensured) while the client remains unauthenticated; mutual authentication requires public key infrastructure (or PKI) deployment to clients. The protocols allow client/server applications to communicate in a way designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, and message forgery.\nSSL involves a number of basic phases:\nPeer negotiation for algorithm support\nPublic key encryption-based key exchange and certificate-based authentication\nSymmetric cipher-based traffic encryption\nDuring the first phase, the client and server negotiate which cryptographic algorithms will be used. Current implementations support the following choices:\nfor public-key cryptography: RSA, Diffie-Hellman, DSA or Fortezza;\nfor symmetric ciphers: RC2, RC4, IDEA, DES, Triple DES or AES;\nfor one-way hash functions: MD5 or SHA.\n[edit]\nHow it works\n\nThe SSL protocol exchanges records; each record can be optionally compressed, encrypted and packed with a message authentication code (MAC). Each record has a content_type field that specifies which upper level protocol is being used.\nWhen the connection starts, the record level encapsulates another protocol, the handshake protocol, which has content_type 22.\nThe client sends and receives several handshake structures:\nIt sends a ClientHello message specifying the list of cipher suites, compression methods and the highest protocol version it supports. It also sends random bytes which will be used later.\nThen it receives a ServerHello, in which the server chooses the connection parameters from the choices offered by the client earlier.\nWhen the connection parameters are known, client and server exchange certificates (depending on the selected public key cipher). These certificates are currently X.509, but there's also a draft specifying the use of OpenPGP based certificates.\nThe server can request a certificate from the client, so that the connection can be mutually authenticated.\nClient and server negotiate a common secret called "master secret", possibly using the result of a Diffie-Hellman exchange, or simply encrypting a secret with a public key that is decrypted with the peer's private key. All other key data is derived from this "master secret" (and the client- and server-generated random values), which is passed through a carefully designed "Pseudo Random Function".\nTLS/SSL have a variety of security measures:\nNumbering all the records and using the sequence number in the MACs.\nUsing a message digest enhanced with a key (so only with the key can you check the MAC). This is specified in RFC 2104).\nProtection against several known attacks (including man in the middle attacks), like those involving a downgrade of the protocol to previous (less secure) versions, or weaker cipher suites.\nThe message that ends the handshake ("Finished") sends a hash of all the exchanged data seen by both parties.\nThe pseudo random function splits the input data in 2 halves and processes them with different hashing algorithms (MD5 and SHA), then XORs them together. This way it protects itself in the event that one of these algorithms is found vulnerable.\n[edit]\nApplications\n\nSSL runs on layers beneath application protocols such as HTTP, SMTP and NNTP and above the TCP transport protocol, which forms part of the TCP/IP protocol suite. While it can add security to any protocol that uses reliable connections (such as TCP), it  5

I, Robot: why are we 400 years away from making a human-like robot? I read somewhere that we're nowhere near making a robot like in "I, Robot" or "AI" but in fact it'll be another 400 years till we get to that advanced technology, why? I dont believe we are 400 years away. I've seen predictions that put it more between 50 to 100 years, or even less. \n\nEven without understanding our own brains, we can replicate the processing power. Studies in Neural network technologies have shown potential for future applications in articificial intellience. These networks can be simulated in software, and are used through out the world for various tasks.\n\nNeural nodes are 'trained' to react to certain stimulus. A larger network of trained neural nodes can then be trained to react quite similarly to the human brain.\n\nSo i'm not sure where the 400 years number comes from, but i believe it will be a lot soon. 2

in wich chemical i can dissolve pmma scrap to make the sheets again?  PMMA is a polymer (poly-methyl-methacrylate) which can be dissolved in a number of organic solvents.  n-hexane, n-heptane, cyclohexane, benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, styrene, acetone, ethyl ether, methanol, ethanol, methyl methacrylate(MMA), trichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran and ethyl acetate can all be used.\n\nprobably the best choice is acetone, acetic acid or ethanol since they are cheap and easy to come by.  you will probably have to heat it if the PMMA is already polymerized. 2

What's your advice to someone facing the MIME type challenge in 2006?  Many developers are choosing to use XHTML instead of HTML as they move towards web standards. Some of these developers use XHTML without looking at all the issues. \n\nMy advice to anyone thinking about using XHTML would be to read all the information you can on the advantages and disadvantages of XHTML so that you can make an informed decision. \n\nIf you feel that XHTML is the most appropriate choice, you will then be faced with the "MIME type challenge" which is: \n\nXHTML 1.0 (transitional, frameset or strict) should be served as application/xhtml+xml. \nInternet Explorer does not support the application/xhtml+xml MIME type. \nTo solve this MIME type challenge, you then have to choose one of the following options: \n\nIgnore the issue completely and use XHTML served up as text/html. \nUse XHTML served up as text/html using backward compatibility mode. \nUse XHTML served up as application/xhtml+xml and deal with Internet Explorer using content negotiation. \nThere are many detailed articles that explain the issues associated with these three choices: \n\nSending XHTML as text/html Considered Harmful \nXHTML's Dirty Little Secret \nXHTML is dead \nContent negotiation \nPretending to use XHTML \nQuick guide to XHTML \nThe perils of using XHTML properly \nAt the risk of being burned at the stake, I think that unless you are willing to serve your pages as application/xhtml+xml with content negotiation, then you are probably better off staying with HTML 4.01 at this time. \n\nI prefer HTML 4.01 Strict over HTML 4.01 Transitional, as it forces developers to separate content and presentation more fully than Transitional. For example, presentational attributes such as align, background, bgcolor, border (for images and objects), clear, color, face, hspace and many others are allowed in Transitional, but not in Strict. Using Strict also forces developers to structure and mark up content more thoughtfully as you cannot have inline content directly inside the body, blockquote or form elements. \n\nThe bottom line is that each developer has to make their own choices. 5
How can I change the color of my eyes ? The "white" portion of my eyes is actually yellowish. How can I make it whiter ? Yellow sclera (the whites of the eyes) are commonly a result of jaundice, which is caused by too much bilirubin in the blood. This, in turn, is often the result of a blocked bile duct or liver problems. Vitamin K shots are given to hospital-born babies if they develop jaundice; however, these cases are usually because the liver has not fully matured, but does within a week.\n\nPrevention of adult jaundice can be accomplished by having clean drinking water and good hygienic habits. Most jaundice cases can be treated with rest and eating healthy, nutritious, clean food. Some extreme cases may require medication.\n\nIn any case, you should get yourself examined in order to get an official diagnosis. 3

I have been diagnosed with cancer.  When I die will my wife be responsible for payment of my debt?  Why do you believe you're going to die?\nBy trust in God and natural remedies cancer can be cured--if it is God's will AND we do our part.\n\nI work at Hartland Wellness Center (http://hartland.edu/hwc/index.... located in Virgina which helps people with cancer, high blood pressure, obesity, etc. We think that diseases just come out of nowhere, but many times it's because of lifestyle.\n\nIf I eat tons of candy, am I going to get sick? Yes. If I have an unhealthly lifestyle, and I'm going to be sick? Yes. We can reverse our lifestyle, trust and God, and ask God to heal us. The answer might be yes, no, in a little, but we have to do our part.\n\nConventional medicine focuses on the symptoms. It's like someone trying to chop off a tree but not get at the roots. What happens? The tree grows back. However, if we attack the tree at its roots (the cause), then the tree dies. We are told that we have a disease but not what the cause of the problem is. Like I just said many times the cause is lifestyle.\n\nAt the Wellness Center we teach how trust and God and a healthy lifestyle can enable people to recover both physically and spiritually. Your friend can come next session if he/she wants, or Hartland can direct him or her to another place. 7

why is taking a derivative and an intergral opposite operations? In basic calculus, we use the derivative to find the slope of a curve, and the integral to find the area under a curve. The question is, why are these operations the opposite of each other? Imagine that you've integrated a function up to some value x.  Now, if you move to x+dx you get a sliver of area equal to f(x) times dx.  So the rate of change of the integral (the derivative of the integral) is just the value of the function.\n\nIn other words, how fast you're adding to the integral is the height of the function. 2

Hello starcameo.. :)\n\nI used to be an atheist..so I know where he is coming from..he is not mean..he just does not know the truth as we do..I remember how I used to hate Christians for asking me all the time, do you want to know Jesus as your Saviour..his eyes are just blinded to the truth..we must Love everyone..especially those that call us names..for we are to walk, and talk like Jesus..\n\nWe must Love our enemies..pray for those that persecute us..\n\nI Love you Atheist..and I will be praying for you..and all here..Amen!\n\nIn Jesus Most Precious Name..\nWith Love..In Christ.. 1

Up until now he's still hiding and remarkably, cannot be found by the US. and is unimpeded in his terroristic acts. 10
who did not like the constanine movie compared to the comic?  It definately didn't follow the comic, but I thought that it was a good adaptation. It was more not even based off of the comic than anything. They basically just Americanized it. I don't think its a bad movie, but people should look at it as a movie, not as a comic-movie. 8

How does a plane get the oxygen for the passengers?  Fresh air is from the engines.  The first stages of a jet engine compresses the air.  The air heats up when it's compressed.  Part of that compressed air is piped off and goes through heat exchangers, cooling it to about 32F.  That cool air and some of the hot air from the engine are combined to give a comfortable tempurature in the cabin.  This flow of air pressurizes the fuselage so that the passingers can breath normally.  Valves in the fuselage control this pressure, preventing over or under pressurization. 2

what  is known as Gspot /"?  Wrong...the G-spot (the full name is actually the Grafenberg spot) is the spot halfway up the woman's vagina that is supposed to produce a massive orgasm in her when stimulated. It is said that men have a G-spot, too -- up the anus, when the other penis touches the prostate gland it's supposed to act as a G-spot for men. (Never will I try that!) 2

In your opinion... In which sports are the college games more exciting than the professional games?  In my opinion, college basketball is a far more exiting experience than pro basketball, because the kids have much more to lose than pro players do.  Efforts to win for the sake of winning and for the sake of pride are far more exciting to watch than efforts made by players who are being paid millions of dollars whether they win or lose.  March Madness vs. the NBA Playoffs - no comparison in my book. 6

what is a mole sieve?  You are probably referring to a "molecular sieve".  It's a bit of a misnomer.  A molecular sieve is a substance, usually a clay or ceramic, which is extremely porous and which is usually hydorphilic.  Typically it is used to dry solvents, or to extract water from organic liquids.  The surface of the molecular sieve is highly polar, usually because of the presence of a lot of hydroxyl groups.  The water hydrogen bonds to the hydroxyl groups in the molecular sieve, effectively drying toe organic solvent.  Usually the molecular sieve is sold in the form of small, cylindrical pellets, although sometimes you can find it in powder form. 2

Why does lexmark charge so much for ink jet cartridges? Replacing the ink on my z715 would cost more then I paid for the printer, which makes it practically a "Disposable Printer".\n\nCan anyone personally recommend a better brand that has reasonably priced printers & ink for someone who does light printing? It's a communist plot. Same as the oil companies. Once they've got you, they've got you.\n\nI refill my own Epson cartridges and there is something socially uplifting when I do it. I got a refill kit from Costco and I think it's going to last for YEARS. I'm a printing fool now. It really frees you to think that it's almost free to print full colour pictures. And I bought Costco print paper, much cheaper and equal in quality to those Kodak weasels.\n\nMy Epson photo 820 has a proprietary chip, so I bought a $5.00 (don't pay more) chip resetter on line.\n\nAs far as HP goes, there is a scotch-tape trick to resetting the cartridge to fool the printer into thinking it's a brand new, one million dollar qenuine HP printer cartridge. Same thing probably goes for Lexmark, but I haven't had to mess with my Lexmark printer/scanner/fax yet.\n\nWear gloves when refilling cartridges or you'll resemble a bank robber who grabbed the dye-pack. 5

Why do people feel the need to use racial slurs?  In my opinion, it comes from more than one source, and childhood environment, I think, is a huge part of that.  Teach someone from birth to act a certain way or to say things in a certain way, and they will grow up doing those things.  And deep down, I think we can all agree that no matter how tolerant we become, everyone is still going to dislike someone else. 1
In your opinion, what is the greatest cause of poverty today?  Lack of education and understanding. I feel our schools and society fail miserably to prepare students for life on the outside. When I finally got out on my own I didn't have a clue how to obtain an apartment, phone or utilities. I didn't know how to shop for bargains, balance a checkbook or manage my money. I was raised to beleive that if you work hard you will do well. That is not necessarilly the case. Life is competitive. You either choose to compete or you don't, however, we are not all endowed with equal abillities. Handicaps are not always visible. Some people seem to have been born with everythiong going for them. Others seem to never get a break. I am a healthy middle aged individual. All I have ever wanted is to be able to earn a moderate living. This I have accomplished but it is not a secure living nor is it moderate to everyone's standards. According to most people I have a moderate house, 2 used cars and the abilities to pay the bills and still have a little left over however I make twice as much as the average individual. There are many things I could do without, such as the second car and all expenses incured by it, my multimedia system including my computer, tv's, vcrs'dvds, cell phones... And then, there's all my other belongings such as boats, bikes, fancy clothes, toys, gadgets, dining out, nightclubs and all the expenses incurred therein as well. All this and I live alone! I know many familys with four generations living under the same roof just to survive. Now, here is the point, would I be willing to share it all if I knew I could get a family or even an individual off the street? Would you?\n I think the biggest cause of poverty is a lack of understanding, a willingness to turn a blind eye.\n Laziness? Yes, I feel laziness is the root cause of poverty, not on behalf of the impoverished but on behalf of all of us who continue to allow it to go on, all of us who feel someone else will do something about it.\n How do we fix it? Seek those who have not, find out why not and help them to overcome.\n Put and end to beurocracy, pork barrel programs, illicit foreign aid, tax evaders and gougers so we can have the money it will take to help.\n Teach our schools to focus more on 'Life Economics' and make it a requirement. Identify the individual talents of children and guide them along the right path for them. Don't penalize and ridicule them because they may not be good at math, taking tests or sports. Stop being so damned two dimensional and realise there is a universe of possibilities awaiting all of us if we could only recognise the abillities of all individuals istead of a stereotyped few. Please forgive my longwinded answer but your's was a question worthy of the time. May we all prevail. 10
if a plane was on some type of treadmill that detects speed, will it ever take off? This has been addressesd on a few different places I frequent.\n\nthe question:  if an airplane is on a treadmill or some type of conveyer belt that senses speed and accelerates accordingly.  Will the plane ever gain enough windspeed to actually take off? If the plane is on a treadmill like the ones we run on at the gym, then it won't really be 'going' anywhere and will not take off because no air is passing by the wings to generate lift.  \n\nI think you might have to clarify this one further... 2

when did the catholic chruch began??? or what are some distinctive doctrines or any well known members..... The Catholic Church is a Church of sinners and much suffering. It is also a Church of saints and scholars. The story of the Catholic Church is a divine and human story. The Church is divine in its Founder, Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is the only founder of a religion who claimed to be God, and proved that claim by rising from the dead. The Catholic Church is also human - afflicted with all the frailties of human nature - the sin and suffering, but also the saintliness and scholarship. When the Church was failing God, God raised up prophets or reformers. A reformer is one who changes people's hearts, not revealed doctrine. There have been thousands of great reformers in the Catholic Church, like St. Francis of A$$isi, St. Clare, St. Benedict, St. Teresa of Avila, etc. The Catholic Church and the Bible have not, in 2000 years, changed any of the many truths revealed by God; among these truths: \n\na) that Holy Communion is really and truly the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ, \nb) devotion to Mary, \nc) confession, \nd) praying for the dead (Purgatory), \ne) the Pope is the visible head of the Church on earth. (Christ of course, is the invisible head of the Church.)\n\nThe following is a brief chronological listing of some of the significant events in Church history from its beginning:\n\nc. 32 Jesus Christ promised to found His Church. "... you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church..." Matthew 16:18\n \nc. 33 Jesus, the Good Shepherd, fulfills His promise to Peter by commissioning him to "Feed My lambs... Tend My sheep... Feed My sheep." John 21:15-18\n \nc. 33 Pentecost - The Holy Spirit came upon Mary, the Apostles and about 120 Disciples. Three thousand came into the Church that day. Jesus' followers took Him seriously. They preached the Gospel.\n \nc. 34 Judaizers begin teaching that one must become a Jew before they can become a Christian. The Council of Jerusalem answered the Judaizers in c. 50 (Acts 15).\n \nc. 45 The Didache, an important record about the beliefs, practices and rule of early Christians, was in existence. We have it today.\n \nc. 67 St. Peter and St. Paul were martyred (killed for their faith).\n \n70 The temple in Jerusalem was destroyed by the Romans.\n \nc. 50-313 Emperors Nero, Domitian, Decius and Dioletian persecuted the Church.\n\nIn Rome, the Church had to meet in secret to worship, receive instruction, and receive the Sacraments.\n \n96 Clement of Rome settles a dispute in the Corinthian church by exercising his papal authority as successor of Peter. St. John is still alive.\n \n108 St. Ignatius of Antioch, on his way to be martyred in Rome, was the first to call the Church "Catholic".\n\n370-405 The Catholic Church decided what books were inspired by God, and put them into one book, "The Bible". The list of the 73 inspired books, as we have them today in the Catholic Bible, was first compiled by St. Athanasius (c.297-373). This list was confirmed by the Council of Hippo (393), Council of Carthage (397) both in North Africa (St. Augustine was active in both councils), Pope Innocent I (405), and the Council of Trent (1545-63). The Bible was preserved by the monks, who copied it over and over again in handwriting for the next 1000 years until the printing press was invented in 1450.\n\n1450 Printing was invented by Johann Gutenberg, and the first book to be printed was the Catholic Bible. It is called "the Mazarin Bible" which was printed in 1452 in Mayence, Germany, at the request of Cardinal Mazarin. 1
how can i be intelligent and beautiful at the same time?  What kind of a question is that?  I know plenty of people (including myself, not bragging) who are both intelligent and beautiful at the same time.  Do you think it has to be one or the other?  If so I can see where your problem with intelligence is.  Come on, think a little.  What are you really asking here?  Do you think you're ugly or stupid?  Did someone tell you to change yourself?  The only answer I know to tell you is just to keep yourself up mentaly and physicaly.  It's impossible for anyone to give you another answer unless you post more details. 4
When you get married (or if you already are) do you want a big wedding? Small one? Justice of the Peace quicky  I had a small wedding.  It wasn't nearly as expensive as a big wedding (so more money for the honeymoon and other day-to-day living costs).  The small setting was very nice and left me calm without stressing over every little detail; I was actually able to enjoy the wedding.\n\nI had initally started to plan a big wedding but realized very quickly that everyone had their hand out for money.  I realized that it could become very easy to loose focus on WHY I was planning a wedding.\n\nThe small wedding was fun for everyone and didn't eat up the entire day for me, the groom or anyone in the family. 9

Where is the island that only sex offenders live. It is called sometimes sex offenders island?  Washington state took over the penitentiary from the federal government in 1981.

i filed bankruptcy. some creditors were left out by mistake. Now still have bad credit. what do i do now? I want to buy a house and am tired of renting. Is there any help for people like me and where. How much money do you need up front for say an $80.000 house? First off if you filed Bankruptcy and left out some creditors you must pay them back.  So you need to call them and set up a payment plan.  you need to get your credit score over 600 before anyone will talk to you about home ownership and to buy an $80,000 home you should try to have $15,000 in savings.  If you are a vet or can apply for a down payment grant you can get by with less, but even a zero down loan needs 3-5k for closing costs. 7

when was the 3 point line introduced into NCAA basketball.?  Although the three-point line was added uniformly to NCAA basketball for the 1986-1987 season, it had been used on a part-time basis in prior years.  The Southern Conference introduced it for conference games and some select non-conference games during the 1980-1981 season.  Other conferences also experimented with using the three-point basket, including the Big West Conference and the Atlantic Coast Conference during the early 1980s. 6

If you don't get at least 4 hours of sleep and enter a REM cycle is sleep worthless? I know it takes 4 hours to enter REM cycles during sleep so if you get less than 4 hours does sleep even matter? It's not worthless . . . just not as beneficial.  Even a few hours sleep will recharge your muscles as well as increase blood flow to your brain.  But, REM sleep is necessary.  Go a day or two without it and you will begin to suffer memory loss, poor concentration, and difficulty completing simple tasks. 3

how much of a role does television play in developing the values and morals of children?  I think it has alot to do with it. Children see things and they think it is cool and that is how they should act. It desensitizes them to death, sex, violence, and drugs. That is hard for parents to recover from. It should be controlled, but that is up to the parents to do. 8

Who were the first people to use suicidal bombs??  In their fight to create the nation of Israel zionists participated in actions against Great Britain that were they to happen today would have been considered terrorism.  The same could be said of the American Revolutionary War, the French Revolution and the Civil War.  \n\nI realize that doesn't strictly answer your question.    Here is a reference that should be useful:\nHonor and Martyrdom: Suicide Bombing Isn't as New or Alien as Westerners Imagine\n"The rate of suicide bombings - the seemingly endless supply of people prepared to blow themselves up - leaves a western audience utterly bewildered. What kind of psychology motivates people to such violent extremes? The incomprehension prompts revulsion that this form of warfare is historically unprecedented and reveals a peculiar, aberrant irrationality - a kind of inhuman madness. All too quickly, Islam is blamed for deluding its believers into martyrdom with promises of 72 virgins; the old prejudices about Islam as a faith uniquely associated with violence and unquestioning belief are fanned into life again.\n\nBut such prejudices won't get us very far in trying to unpick which elements of this violent phenomenon are in fact unprecedented and which are not - or to understand why the strategy has been adopted." 1
Do you think it is Crazy to allow the man who tried to assassinate President Ronald Reagan visits his parents? The man who tried to assassinate President Ronald Reagan will be allowed visits to his parents' home without supervision, a federal judge ruled Friday. The judge said John Hinckley "is not permitted to leave one or both parents' supervision at any time during the course of the conditional release," unless his hospital prescribes time away. Hinckley has been in treatment at St. Elizabeths Hospital, in Washington, D.C., since being found not guilty by reason of insanity for the 1981 assassination attempt on Reagan.\n\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2005/LAW/12/30/hinckley.home/index.html why did you ask pretty much the same question twice but just reword it? 10

I am my fathers caretaker and therefore can not work, is there any program which I could get financial help ,? I have a child, 6 y/o and my dad is disabled, handicapped, he has a neological disorder and is in a wheelchair. I am divorced Don't you mean that your father is disabled and he can't work.  If you are able bodied then certainly you can work.  Every state has programs run by Social and Health Services for the disabled.  Supplemental Security Income and Medicaid are other programs.  Personal care providers are one of those service.  You could also be a paid care provider if your father qualifies for one.  One person being disabled never causes another to be unable to work 10

Why are accountants and investment brokers not very rich? Is it because its easier to preach than practice - In India An accountant is someone who records numbers and knows the rules regarding how those numbers need to be recorded it.  Accountants are not necessarily investment gurus.  Plus accounts who work usually only earn a fixed salary unlike someone who is a sales person earning a commission.  If you are working for a commission your income is not fixed and you have the potential for much higher income.\nAlso, accountants don't make that much money.\nI know because I am an accountant. The money is decent but not great. 7
What can i buy a guy for Valentine's who i've just met? He is cute, a friend to the bottle but he looks like he is ready to quit.  I like him but i would'nt say i've fallen for him. well if he's an alcoholic, the best thing you can give him for V-Day is being his friend. I was once addicted to the bottle and I had friends or so I thought. Once I was ready to quit, I realized that they weren't really friends at all, just my drinking buddies. To this day, they don't call me unless they want me to bail them outta jail or what not. Stick with him. It's very hard! But if you sit there through all his horrible stages, he'll appreciate it very much in the end! Without my family and my TRUE REAL friends, I would still be where I was 5 or 6 years ago. Sitting on some jail cell cot and waiting to detox. 1

do u love president george bush? US president, junior For What? He is the most stupidest president that america has ever had. When the Indian Prime Minister Visited him in 2003, he did not even know his name: Atal Behari Vajpayee. And his first visit outside the country was after becomming the president to UK. He cannot even point out China in the world map...welll....I need to say he is a moron, bent on creating voilence in this world. \nI strongly object his Nuclear Deal with India and his visit altogether.\n\nSo in a nutshell: No I hate him. Stupid. 10

Spirituality vs religious? I choose not to practice any particular religious faith, however I consider myself very spiritual.  Wondering if others feel the same way, what their belief systems are, etc? I've studied many religions but belong to none.  It is not that I believe in God.  I know God exists.  I experienced God directly when I was seventeen years old.  I believe that would make me a spiritual person.\n\nYet we have to remember that in creating this "I'm spiritual so I don't need religion" attitude we have neglected one thing: community.  We are social animals, and thousands of years of working in groups has changed us, not forever, but sufficiently that becoming a lone creature again would be a hard path, taking centuries.  For thousands of years man has thrived in groups that gather and do activities in common. For some, work meets some of this need, but everyone finds some hidden need met by ritualistic gatherings.  Have you ever watched some of the people at a football game?  Body paint, costumes, rituals, chanting, even 'priests' leading the crowd in the chanting.\nDo we need to outgrow this?  Perhaps, but until then, it never hurts to visit an occaisional temple, church, gathering, etc.  Might find that it isn't so much primative as it is comforting and socially uplifting. 1

How can I not be nervous about kissing? I'm 18 and am nervous about kissing this guy I like and I'm pretty sure he likes me too.  I've never kissed for real before.  I've done little pecks but nothing more.  I don't know how to get over this irrational "fear" I have about kissing.  Do you have any advice besides "just do it" and "try not to think about it"? The best thing to do is make yourself available for the kiss by being close enough to kiss, and by making subtle hints like eye contact, and \noccasionally staring briefly at his lips.  Also, being alone or in a private setting is important.\n\nIf you make the first move, make sure that you don't come on too strong.  If he likes you and wants to kiss you, he will kiss back by prolonging the kiss or using a little tongue.  If this happens, just respond by relaxing and don't being too agressive with your own tongue.  If you start slowly and carefully, you won't be making any mistakes.  Let him take the lead and if you like it, continue.  If not, pull away and smile.  Remember guys fear rejection as much (or more) than girls do.\n\nIf he doesn't want you to kiss him, he'll pull away.  Let him.  You don't want to waste valuable kissing time on someone who doesn't want you.\n\nAlways remember less is more.  You'll never regret having kissed too little, but you'll always regret coming on too strong.  Remember to remain confident, too.  Don't forget a breath mint! 9

Can U Please Tell Us About List Of Illegal Structures Of Delhi? buildings which are made illegal New Delhi: As Delhi's top politicians were served notices for owning alleged illegal constructions, Union Urban Development Minister Jaipal Reddy on Saturday said the Centre was formulating a policy for a "win-win" solution to the problem of unauthorised structures.\n\n"All unauthorised structures cannot be treated on the same level. There is a need to look at the degrees of violation. We will prepare a policy to reach a solution to this problem," he told reporters here. \n\nThe policy would prescribe penalty according to the degree of violation. It would discriminate serious building violations like construction on public places from minor offences like building an additional room flouting the building plan, he said. \n\n"I need to consult the Delhi chief minister, leaders of all parties and the governor before framing a policy," he said. \n\nMeanwhile, the demolition drive in the national capital will continue, he said. \n\nRegarding the observations of the high court on corrupt officials in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi, Reddy said that "the situation was fairly serious". \n\n"The concerned organisation must take cognisance of the observations and take steps," he said. 10
What recourse is there against a lawyer who sued me frivolously? This is about a lawyer who added me to a case just because my name is in the chart. The case against the principle is bogus anyway, even more so against me. The allegations are fraudulent VERY CLEARLY unfounded. They make no sense, and are arbitrary just so that my name is added. The fright and stress caused my wife to miscarry. If I did something like this to patient, I can BET they would would sue me. State Bar Association doesn't care. Is there any recourse? You have to win the case first.  Then you MIGHT have claim for abuse of process and malicious prosecution.  These types of cases are VERY hard to prove and looked down upon by the courts.  You should consult an attorney familiar with the laws of your state on these issues. 10

Gymnastic coaches:  any ideas for getting straight legs on vault? I have one level 5 gymnast who has a very explosive vault but can not seem to keep from bending knees--badly!  Most of the time now (after doing drills) she keeps them straight at first and then bends them on the way over for a little extra kick.  She scored pretty well on level 4 vault but had a hard time with fear on the vault table and seems to have developed the bad habit, thinking she needed it to get over.  She doesn't.  I think she knows it now but can't seem to break the habit and is getting discouraged. try doing donkey kicks. that's when you have the gymnast place her hands on the vault and bounces on the springboard kicking her legs as high as she can. this allows her to focus on kicking over while making it easier to focus on straight legs. 6

My AIM makes an odd "swoosh" sort of noise when I sign on and flashes in the system tray.  Any ideas? The yellow buddy in my system tray keeps flashing what looks to be a mailbox, but I don't have an AOL account and so I don't have a mail account.  I have no idea what's going on! Your AIM might have a problem in it.  This once happened to mine and I just redownloaded it.  After installing it, make sure to restart your computer.  Also, if you have very low RAM or memory in your hard drive, that may also be the problem.\n\nAlso about the mail, ignore it, if you have an AIM account, then you might recive that, double click on it and see where it takes you. 5

Why the mass of photon not increases when it travell from the sun to earth with the speed of light?  Special Relativity says that if you have something with a mass and then move that mass at a speed close to the speed of light it will look (to the outside) as if the mass was increased. This seems to be what you are referring to.\n\nPhotons are special in the sense that they have no mass. In this case special relativity (and much experimental verification) says that they must always travel at exactly the speed of light as seen from any reference frame.\n\nWhat can change those is the frequency (and wavelength which is inversely proportional to frequency).\n\nSo if you are floating outside a black hole and shoot a bunch of photons into the BH, you will detect the photons increase their wavelength as they fall (equivelent to lower frequencies), while their speed, the speed of light, will stay the same.\n\nThe Relativistic Mass links includes a calculator, type in a speed (like 0.8 for 80% the speed of light) and see how much your rest mass will change. Fun for the whole family! 2
How do set up a lookup table in a database? I am trying to create a mysql/php script. Right now I know I need a table for categories. A lookup table is just a regular table data structure that is comprised of a small number of columns mapping a name to a value.\n\nFor instance:\n* Table..: CATEGORY_DATA\n* Columns: category_id, category_name\n* Values.: "1", "Sports"\n           "2", "Sci-Fi"\n\nThese category_id column is called a "primary key" because it is unique to the table - it acts a "foreign key" on another table allowing you to "lookup" the name of the numeric values.\n\nThis table can be created like any other, either using a GUI tool or entering the SQL into the MySQL database terminal application: "CREATE TABLE blah (id NUMBER, name VARCHAR, etc) ..." 5
What is the best RAID configuration for three SCSI hard drives, and why? {3 Ultra320 72.8GB 15K}?  Depends on what you're looking for.  For max performance and disk space, RAID1; for a balance of both performance and data integrity, RAID5.  If you add a fourth drive, the RAID5 performance should increase by a factor large enough to offset the speed advantage RAID1 gives, but if you're limited to three, and want max performance, RAID1 is the way to go.  Just make sure you have a backup solution if you're data is important.\n\nRAID1 gives the best performance because it doesn't have to concern itself with writing separate data out to the RAID5 "parity" drive.  It simply spans all disks in the array when writing.  Read performance is affected as well, since, when reading, additional parity calculations are performed in a RAID5 configuration.  RAID1 simply reads the data segmented during the write, and re-assembles it in the proper sequence. 5

what is the areola for?  In anatomy, the term areola (diminutive of Latin area, "open place") is used to describe any small circular area such as the colored skin surrounding the nipple. While it is most commonly used to describe the pigmented ring around the human nipple, it can also be used to describe other small circular areas such as the inflamed area surrounding a pimple.\n\nThere is a reason for the areola being a different color to the rest of the breast. The areola is roughly where the ducts of the mammary glands are. Careful inspection of a mature human nipple will reveal 15-20 small openings arranged radially around the tip of nipple (lactiferous ducts) from where milk is released during lactation. Other small openings in the areola are sebaceous glands which may provide a little oily lubrication during lactation, otherwise known as Montgomery's glands (or glands of Montgomery).\n\nNormal areola color ranges from light pink to dark brown with people with lighter skin tones tending to have paler areolas and people with darker skin tones to have darker areolas (though there can be considerable variation even for the same skin color); the size (diameter) also varies. Areolar color changes to a darker shade during pregnancy. Some regression to the original color may occur thereafter but part of the change is permanent.\n\nIn Japan, where many women view dark areolas as a sign of aging, topical creams have been developed for the purpose of lightening (or "pinkening") the nipples.\n\nRetrieved from "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Areola" 4

Why women who been hurt by there ex, think all men are the same ? ( Men and women, both get hurt.)?  Most women do that mostly when they have been hurt more than once. They probably feel that if it keeps happening then all men must be the same. I for one feel thats not true and if a woman who has been hurt constantly compares her current to her ex,then she will never have a meaningful relationship 9

How do you lose love handles? What exercises target that specific area? I know about the dietary side, but there's still a pesky bit left there that I can't shake. a few good exercises for you:\n1) when you are doing your crunches, twist. bring your right elbow to your left knee.\n2) hold a weight bar over your head (with only enough weight to make you focus on stability, not much) then, standing with feet shoulder width apart, bring the bar to your left side, then back up, then over to the right side. you are only moving your upper body side to side.\n3)the best excercise (hurts like a mofo) is the side plank. just like the normal plank, but turn to your side. lay on the floor and hold all body weight on your forearm and balance yourself on your forearm and foot. hold this for anywhere from 30sec-1min. i promise you will feel it! =)\n\nGood luck to you =) 3
How do you comfort someone at a funeral? There's usually so many people, and so little time to really express anthing intelligent and comforting.  \n(Funeral & reception).\n\nWhat is the normal way to act? I think one of the most appreciated ways to comfort a grieving person is to tell them how the deceased had touched your life, such as a short story or a character quality about the person.

If I can't shop online it's annoying.  I like http://www.bedbathstore.com/ for catalog shopping, because bedbathandbeyond.com is very boxy and unfriendly.  Linens are not something I need to go to a huge megastore in order to wait on line for. 7

How does chemical erosion work? science fair project research paper Chemical erosion (also called weathering) occurs when rock or other materials are changed into smaller pieces by chemical processes.  These processes include direct oxidation (such as iron rusting), chemical dissolving (such as acid rain reacting with marble or limestone) and other chemical processes.  \nSome good site to look at are below: 2
Is it true that the we cary around up to 22 pounds of undigested food? That's what they said in a comercial...  I believe that the commercial's point is that at any given time a person can have pounds of undigested food in their system including:  food that's currently being digested, and particulate that never completed digestion and is putrifying in the intestines.  \n\nAlthough 22 lbs does sound excessive. 3
As an American, do you really like Bush Government? Why? I´m really interested. I´m Spanish and i live there. But, here people don´t like very much his foreign policy and the way he´s taking the war in Iraq. I don't. In fact, the overwhelming majority of Americans disapprove of President Bush. But many Americans believe that deposing Saddam Hussein will bring a new era of freedom and prosperity to Iraq and give the West a much-needed ally in that area. His supporters are more optimistic than most people about progress in Iraq and hopefully they'll turn out to be right. 10
should you tip your mechanic, tow truck man and cable guy?  The tow truck guy, yes, if he does something out of the way. Your mechanic and your cable guy, no, but if you're so inclined you can take cookies or donuts or something the next time you pick your car up. For your cable guy, the best way to express your appreciation for a job well done is to express it in writing to his supervisor. 1
Name the first dinosaur discovered by mankind?  Adapted from Dinosaurs: The Very Latest Information and Hands-On Activities From the Museum of the Rockies, by Liza Charlesworth and Bonnie Sachatello-Sawyer. A Scholastic Professional Book.\n\nWay back in 1676, Robert Plot, the curator of an English museum, described and drew a thigh bone that he believed belonged to a giant man. Although that fossil disappeared without a trace, the surviving illustration suggests that it may well have been part of a "Megalosaurus." Later, in 1822, large teeth discovered in England by Mary Ann Mantell and her husband, Gideon, were thought to be the remains of a huge and extinct iguana. It wasn't until 1841 that British scientist Richard Owen came to realize that such fossils were distinct from the teeth or bones of any living creature. The ancient animals were so different, in fact, that they deserved their own name. So Owen dubbed the group "Dinosauria," which means "terrible lizards."\n\nAcross the ocean in North America, dinosaur tracks were studied in the Connecticut Valley, beginning in the 1830's. They were believed to belong to enormous ravens, freed from Noah's Ark after the Great Flood. At that time, paleontology was long on deduction and short on evidence. This was remedied when two wealthy and competitive American scientists, Othniel Marsh and Edward Cope, raced to excavate fossils in the Rocky Mountain region. In the late 1800's, their separate teams, armed against Native Americans and each other, dug up tons of bones from several sites. All in all, Marsh and Cope's rivalry — known as the Bone Wars — uncovered 136 new species. And their respective fossil displays generated excitement for dinosaurs the world over.\n\nIn the 1900's, enthusiasm for dinosaurs grew steadily, attracting the attention of the scientific community. Institutions such as the Carnegie Museum of Natural History and the American Museum of Natural History assembled dig teams, which uncovered many rich bone beds in North America (as did their counterparts overseas). New sites in Utah revealed several different species, including "Camarasaurus," "Apatosaurus," and "Stegosaurus;" "Tyrannosaurus rex" remains were found in Montana and baby Coelosaurs in New Mexico.\n\nIn recent decades, dinosaur research continues, but the emphasis has shifted from finding and classifying these animals to analyzing and reconstructing their lives and habitats. In the late 1960's, Robert Bakker proposed that these ancient creatures may well have been as agile and energetic as warm-blooded animals. In the mid 1970's, Peter Dodson, along with James Farlow, hypothesized that they used their horns to attract the attention of females, as well as for fighting. And in the late 1970's, Jack Horner made history by identifying some of the first dinosaurs nests and eggs in North America. These important "Maiasaura" fossils helped to determine that some species nested in colonies and cared for their young.\n\nIn the past few years, several paleontologists, including Ken Carpenter, Phil Currie, and William Coombs, have identified juvenile dinosaurs that were previously thought to be adults; and David Weishampel has theorized that some dinosaurs probably used their crests and nasal passages to create sound. Each day, scientists working all over the world, in the field and in research labs, help to redefine the meaning of the world "dinosaur." 2
Is there any one out there who believes they have seen a Soul ...? I speak of the Soul as meeaning a non physical form. Ghost stories are Bull**it!!! I did watch someone die once. It was an extremely moving experience. The woman was dying of kidney failure (very painful)and was struggling quite a bit to stay alive.She was thrashing around and was in and out of consciousness for several hours. As the last moments approached I stared deeply into her eyes to see what was going on inside her mind (so to speak). What I saw really shook me quite a bit. In her eyes I saw a change taking place. As I looked I began to see other faces in her face. Not anything like a ghost, but more like a percieved image of all the people I have ever known. My parents, freinds and even my own face. I guess it was empathy or something, but I saw death and stared it in the face. I saw us all there. we are all of one "soul" I would say. All of lifes experiences will happen to us all ultimately. Enjoy it while you can. And keep in mind we are all the same. There are no seperations when it comes to "soul". 1
Odds of winning the lottery? Are the odds of winning the lottery any greater if you use the same numbers every draw versus using "quick pick" random number that are different each time.  Also, looking at numbers that are frequently selected in winning sets - any higher odds? Nope, the lottery is random, and doing either way of the quick pick or your favorite numbers have the same odds. Good luck winning since I never do. 2

what is the US government's annual IT spending? I need to know the budget for 2006-07  as well as past spending figures. This will take a significant amount of work.\n\nThe actual budget you can get a copy of through your elected representative.  It may even be available on a disk.  If you seek on the internet it is possible to find such on a disk from a private company but it will cost money.\n\nTo the total cost of IT means that you will you have to go through each Agenmcy's/ Depatment's line item budget.  I don't believe that there are common account numbers across all agencies/departments.\n\nEven when you are through with that project you  will only have a part of the IT cost because for cetain agencies these figures are behind security walls.\n\nGood Luck. 10
Which comes first: thunder or lightning?  Look, lightning and thunder HAPPEN at the same time. Lightning causes the air to displace and when it contracts again (immediately) you get thunder, the sound of air filling a gap. You see lightning first because it is traveling @ 180,000 mps, thunder travels at the speed of sound (depends on where you live). You can generally determine how far away you are from the place of origin by counting 1 one-hundred, 2 one hundred, etc until you hear thunder and divide that number by two. That is how many miles away you are.\n\nBTW, if you see lightning and hear thunder at the same time, the event is right where you are! 2

why do I get a blood clot out of my nose after a nose bleed? Whenever I have a bloody nose, I know it's stopped when a blood clot comes out.  Seems odd that a blood clot coming out would indicate the blood flow is stopping.  It seems like the clot being held in place is what would stop it. Nosebleed\n\nWhat is a nosebleed? \nA nosebleed occurs when the membranes lining the inner nose are disturbed or irritated enough to cause abnormal bleeding. The medical term for nosebleed is epistaxis. \n\nThere are 2 types of nosebleeds: anterior and posterior. If the bleeding is near the front of the nose, it is an anterior nosebleed. If the bleeding is from the back of the nose, it is a posterior nosebleed. An anterior nosebleed is usually not as severe or serious as a posterior nosebleed. \n\nHow does it occur? \nThe most common causes of nosebleed are: \n\nA breakdown in the membranes lining the nose. This can be triggered by dry air or probing, bumping, picking, or rubbing your nose. Blowing your nose forcefully can also cause a nosebleed, especially if the nasal membrane is already inflamed because of allergies or an infection, such as a sinus infection. \nInjury to the face or nose. \nRebleeding from an area of a previous nosebleed. \nHigh altitude. \nDrug abuse involving the nose, such as cocaine snorting or glue sniffing. \nHigh blood pressure. \nMedicine that increases the time it takes for your blood to clot. \nMedical problems that prevent your blood from clotting normally. \nIf you have a nosebleed after a heavy blow to your head, it could mean you have a fractured skull. You should go to the hospital right away. \n\nWhat are the symptoms? \nSymptoms of anterior nosebleed are bleeding that stops and starts or constant bleeding out of the front of your nose. Blood can flow from one or both nostrils. It may flow into your throat. \n\nSymptoms of posterior nosebleed include rapid bleeding from the back of the nos or a slow, steady ooze. Sometimes the blood flows back into your throat and you are coughing up blood. It is more common with posterior nose bleeding to lose blood quickly. \n\nHow is it diagnosed? \nIf you see your health care provider when you have a nosebleed, he or she will have you sit up and lean forward to determine the rate and site of the bleeding. Depending on the amount of bleeding you are having, your provider may check your pulse and blood pressure and take a blood sample to check for anemia. You may need tests to check the ability of your blood to clot and your blood type in case you lose too much blood and need a transfusion. \n\nHow is it treated? \nMost nosebleeds are minor and respond to first aid. First aid for a nosebleed includes these steps: \n\nWhen your nose starts bleeding, sit up and lean forward to prevent blood from passing into your throat. \nPinch the nose firmly together between the thumb and index finger, just below the nasal bones, and hold it for 5 full minutes. \nIf it continues to bleed, hold it again for another 5 minutes. 3

Do you support my Training Evaluation Fremula? (Wich is evaluations = 100% of acheivments?  Not necessarily.  It would depend on who is performing the evaluation and if the evaluator is free of bias. \n\nFurthermore, achievement in great part is the acknowledgement of all the variables that led to the achievement.  No one other than yourself can possibly know all that has gone into your accomplishment. \n\nEvaluation is an assessment of proficiency rather than acknowledgment of all the work that has led to the achievement.  Achievement is yours alone.  Therefore, achievement is only subject to self-evaluation.  Proficiency is subject to outside evaluation. \n\nRegardless of outside evaluation, enjoy your achievements.  They are a road map to future achievements. 4

i need any information on the molds penicillin, alternaria, aspergillus, and cladosporium.? any info on any other types of mold would be SUPER nice too. i just need to know about them! PLEASE!!! The common fungi responsible for allergies in humans are Alternaria, Aspergillus, Penicillium and Cladosporium.  Aspergillus and Penicillium  grow quite happily in your basement in summer and Cladosporium is the dark brown mould that grows around the edge of the bath or shower stall or even on the ceiling in bathrooms.  All of these fungi belong in the Deuteromycota and produce large numbers of spores that become airborne (bioaerosols) and are inhaled to cause pulmonary problems in humans and sometimes animals.  \n\nThere are over 150 species in the Aspergillus genus, only a few of which may be found indoors or may be potentially pathogenic, or harmful to the health of humans and animals. This genus is found world-wide, and is especially common in the Northern Hemisphere in autumn and winter. Most people are naturally immune to the effects of Aspergillis, but when disease occurs, it may take on several forms. Aspergillus produces many well known toxins such as aflatoxins, ochratoxins, and sterigmatocystin. Aflatoxin from Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus are associated with stored peanuts and grains.\n\nCladosporium is the most common of the “black molds.” It produces a black pigment that is useful in protection from Ultraviolet light, which may explain why it is so common in nature. Certain species in this genus are pathogenic, but no major mycotoxins are associated with Cladosporium. 4

I am suffering from Diabetes. how is it possible for me to avoid heart attack?  I can suggest the following steps to avoid heart attack. I will answer your question staright assuming you have all the information you need about diabetes.\n\n1. Lose weight. Even if you don't lose down to the recommended levels, studies have shown that losing 5-7% can reduce risk of heart attack by up to 35%\n\n2. Exercise regularly as directed by your MD. Remember you should take a snack before exercisng and carry life saver candies with you at all times\n\n3. Avoid food abuse: Eat healthy, avoid blood sugars above 125mg/dl whenever possible. This will reduce the rate of fat plaque formation in your veins. Eath a lot of soluble fibres that help to lower cholesterol and triglycerides.\n\n4. Follow your MD treatment regimen faithfully. The doctor may prescribe some ACE inhibitors and other hypertension drugs in attempt to prevent Nephropathy (kidney destruction) which in returns overloads the heart. \n\n5. Makew regular visits to your MD and consider consulting a registered dietician 3

Why do desert exist?  A desert is defined by its low rainfall record, hence why you can get hot, cold and frigid deserts.\n\nDeserts can be caused by a number of factors, for example mountains surrounding the area cause rain to fall on their slopes rather than further inland so creating the arid conditions.(can't think of an example for this but there are several)\n\nThe area may be so far inland that the damp winds from the sea fail to reach it. When combined with a hot climate severe desert conditions occur. (Death Valley)\n\nThere may be a cold current running along the coast which causes coastal fog and precipitation, preventing it raining inland. (Patagonian Desert)\n\nThe sand is the product of weathering on the rock, the hot temperatures during the day cause the rocks to expand, the rocks are made up of different minerls and colours of crystals (grains) due to colour some expand more than others, this can break the rock surface down. (Intergranular errosion). The wind picks up the bits and hits them against other rocks, turning the lumps to powder (mechanical errosion).\n\nwhen rain does fall the water scours rock debris off the surface causing the pieces to rub over each other (more mechanical errosion). When drying out in the heat the water evapourates leaving salt deposits behind, these can dissole minerals in the rock (chemical errosion) and can cause slat pillars which are capable of lifting erroded rock layers off the surface. 2

How to make a stink bomb? My older brother used to takes us to the Saturday afternoon matinee and when the theater was jam-packed full of food-fighting kids, we couldn't find a seat.\nSo, my big brother took something out of his pocket that looked like a small ketchup package leftover from Wendys and, he stepped on it releasing the most foul, rotten-eggs ever! We got our seats all right but we had to put up with the stink for awhile.\nNow just for chits and giggles, how can I make another big stink like big brother did? A stink bomb or stinkbomb is a device designed to create an unpleasant smell. They range in effectiveness from simple pranks to military grade chemical agents.\n\nAt one end of the spectrum, relatively harmless stink bombs consist of aluminum sulfide, which smells strongly of rotten eggs. When exposed to air, the aluminum sulfide reacts with moisture, hydrolyzes, and hydrogen sulfide is released. Other popular substances on which to base stink bombs are thiols with lower molecular weight, e.g., methyl mercaptan and ethyl mercaptan — the chemicals that give odor to skunks and are added to natural gas. A variation on this idea is the scent bomb, or perfume bomb, filled with an overpowering "cheap perfume" smell. Prank stink bombs and perfume bombs are usually sold as a 1- or 2- ml sealed glass ampoule, which can be broken by throwing against a hard surface or by crushing under one's shoe sole, thus releasing the odorous liquid contained therein. 2
what was the agreement that split congress into th house of representatives and the senate?  Don't listen to "fool".  He&#92;she is wrong.\nIt was a compromise between the states with large populations and the states with small populations.  The states with large populations wanted representation in congress to be based on population like the House of Representatives.  The small states wanted every state to have the same number of votes.  They agreed to the "Great Compromise" which made a bicameral legislature with the Senate and the House of Representatives.  Obviosly the Senate gives each state two votes and the House gives each state based on its population. 10

Can anyone help me in designing a Downlink Cellular Jammer as my Study Project?  That's a big subject.  Analog or digital? U.S., Europe, Japan, Germany, Scandanavia, Germany, UK?  All use different systems.  Most use some form of spread spectrum technology, which makes them resistant to jamming.  A good reference is Peterson, Ziemer, and Borth, "Introduction to Spread Spectrum Communications", ISBN 0-02-431623-7.\n\nAlso, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_phone_jammer\n\n\nFor U.S., "The FCC has fielded enough queries about the legality of cell phone jammers that it issued a notice last year. In it, the agency warns that jammers violate federal laws that broadly prohibit interfering with licensed radio spectrum. Owning, manufacturing, marketing, offering for sale or operating a cell phone jammer is punishable by an $11,000 fine and up to a year in prison for each offense, the notice states."\n\nFrom http://www.newhousenews.com/archive/story1a092200.html 2

Overall, though, Green Day's songs are pretty awesome! 8
Is it a good time to buy a house in Los Altos CA?  the market for homes over $1m is definitely softening and will continue to soften as rates increase. the active part of the market is in the $600k-$900k range, which in los altos would be a condo. therefore if you are looking to buy you should take your time and be picky and you should be able to negotiate. 7

how can I hook up wifi to my home pc and how does it work?  You will need a wireless router and an wireless card.\n\nEssentially, the wireless router will broadcast a signal, and the card (attached to your computer) will accept the signal and talk with the router.\n\nUsually you use wireless on laptops, in which case, unless you have an internal card, you'll need a PCMCIA wireless card, or a USB wireless card.\n\nIf you're looking to hook up your desktop, a PCI wireless card or USB wireless card will work. Using a wireless card on a desktop computer simply allows you to have your internet conneceted computer anywhere in the house, and you aren't limited to where your phone jacks / cable terminals are. No need to run wires through the house.\n\nI would recommend the Linksys WRT54G & WMP54G or WPC54G, depending on whether it's a laptop or desktop. \n\nFollow the instructions on the device for setting it up. 5

how many inmates in ca penal system under three strikes law?  Actually, there is a report on this on the CA Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation site... the link is:\nhttp://www.cdcr.ca.gov/ReportsResearch/docs/Quarterly/Strike1/STRIKE1d0509.pdf\n..this is just for CA alone... basically it says that the total number of inmates on their 2nd or 3rd strike is 40,587\n\nThese strikes, espcially the 3rd (which gives 25 to life), are from any type of felony (violent or non-violent)...\n\n..and in comment to the previous answer... to put it this way, It actually costs the state and tax payers more money to put someone on death row and actually kill them, than to have them in prison for life without the possibility of parole. (the difference being millions of dollars) 10

After they get to know you, they'll either like you or they wont, and there isnt much (anything) you can do to change that. 1

Kosher salt is supposedly blessed but is there any chemical difference between it and regular table salt?  Definitions of Kosher salt  on the Web:\n\n    * Coarse-grained salt that is easy to handle; keep a container near the stove and use it while you cook.\n      http://www.recipestogo.com/glossary/glossaryK.html\n\n    * keep a small dish of kosher or coarse salt near your range and season at every stage of the cooking process\n      http://www.ciudad-la.com/CIUFOO/CIUFOOGM/body_ciufoogm.htm\n\n    * Pure, refined salt used for pickling because it does not contain magnesium carbonate and thus does not cloud brine solutions. Also used to prepare kosher items. Also known as coarse salt or pickling salt.\n      http://www.ciakids.com/forkids/dictionary/p_dictionary.html\n\n\nTypically kosher salt, unlike common table salt, contains no additives (for example, iodine). 2

why is it that people that have tattoos are stereotyped by other people?  dont listen to golfcarmel. he obviously doesnt know what hes talking about. i have yet to get sick of my tattoos, and i dont ever really think i will = ) people are stereotyped because there still is that biker/sailor/ "bad person" stigma behind them. any heavily tattooed person is aware of this and  know they will get reactions from non-tattooed people looking to put in their two cents. its the bad with the good, and for beautiful artwork that i get to enjoy EVERYDAY for the rest of my life is a small price to pay. yes, the stares and snippy comments do get old but these come from ignorant people who are just "judging by the cover". 3
why don't ppl answer board of health surveys over the telephone?  It is so simple and it helps health issues . That's how each state gets money from gov. for state health issues, so why not do the survey? Don't hang up on them, do the survey and help your state and yourselves and families who have no health insurances. First, people don't like getting phone call surveys, especially ones that ask odd questions.\n\nSecondly, calling random numbers (especially out of the phone book) isn't a very reliable way of getting data.  Too many people have cell phones and caller id, which is going to eliminate specific populations from your survey.\n\nThird, more often than not if you call a random number, the person receiving the call is probably doing something that is important to them  and doesn't want to be interrupted. Even if what they are doing isn't as helpful to them in the long run as what you are asking about, people resent being interrupted.\n\n\nFrankly, I haven't heard of this - maybe this isn't happening in Texas, or perhaps making people more aware of what the survey is for, before people are called, would get better results.  And allowing people to do the survey online or call the surveyors would improve your success as well. 3

what is the cause of dream?  i really suffer from dream! any one who can explain what really dream means?  Batti,\n\nDreams are quite mysterious, though it may be that they're caused by the transfer of your short term memories into your long term memory; it's a sort of scramble of sensory perception, which is what causes them to be quite strange but often quite applicable to your life.  Dreams may also involve the reprocessing of long term memories.\n\nYou may be able to find more information here..\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreams 3
Where did the spanish word Almuerzo orginate?  As for old practices, there were 4 meals in latinamerican cultures, DESAYUNO Which is a light meal eaten by the time you wake up, worth to mention that usualy country people still practice them, since they wake up before sunrise, and it's just a pice of sweat bread with a glass of milk or coffe. ALMUERZO is something much hevier for the stomach, A couple of eggs, or Chilaquiles, or a small portion of Meat, this is eaten by mid morning, say around 9 o 10, assuming of course that you woke up very early, then LA COMIDA, wich usualy is taken between 2 and 4 PM with the family gathered around the table, and finaly LA CENA usually taken by 8 or 9 PM wich and may vary from region to region, and of course the amount of food taken\n\nNow in modern days and specialy in cities, Desayuno and Almuerzo had been merged as a single meal but Comida and Cena still remains as a standard.\n\nIf you ment to ask by the origins of the word, I can't tell. sorry. but the word context had been explained sufficently I hope. 4

Why nobody is raising the ISSUE of Israel's Nuclear Might?? I also wonder how many people in France recall that it was France who got Israel off to its start in the bomb business, when secretly agreed to supply it with plutonium-producding reactor at Diamona. Isreal is an allay to the U.S.A, its is even more of a state for the united states than another country, if USA make sure that Isreal are powerful enough they are sure that the can contol the middle east, therefore it wont complain about isreal's nuclear power, in fact, USA helps israel's nuclear power become more.\nSince USA doesnt complain about israel's nuclear power all other contries in the world wont even dare to come close to this area in order to protect its realtions with the USA 10

what happend in the nuclear war?  In nuclear war, each country that have the nuclear strike capability will throw out all of their nuclear bomb or missile to their opponent population center or military facilities. The result is catastrophic, the nuclear winter is coming. If half of entire world nuclear stock is used, it's already enough to end humans' civilization.\nBasically, in nuclear winter, the sun is blocked by thick smoke for several weeks or years, making it very cold. Don't forget the lethal radiation from nuclear fallout. The ozone will be also depleted. This all will wipe out all plant, animal, agriciulture, phytoplankton, and human. Even there are survivors, the extreme cold weather, high radiation, disease, and lack (or no) food will wipe out almost (if not all) every living life-forms from earth. 10

How does the free market environment encourage the economic and socioeconomic goals sought by society?  Free markets economy is an addendum to the laws of nature. Water flows from high to low till equilized. There is no good or bad about it - it just is. The good is - lower parts can get water, the bad part is that water may cause attrition or floods along the way, or simply be wasted in the lower areas. But movement of resources from resource rich to rosurce poor countries/areas follows the same principle. \n\nSurvival of the fittest is another way of looking at it. In the resourse hungry countries, people will do anything to survive, including accepting low paid jobs. In the resource rich countries, people are at a higher level of Maslow's triangle, are more complacent and demanding of higher standards of living. This creates a cycle of abundance and deprivation in various areas of the world - thus a boom is always followed by a boom and vice versa.\n\nThe overall socio-economic goals of a society include equality for all. Free markets are one way of redistributing wealth and adhering to the supply and demand principles. Culture of consumerism necessitates maximizing affordability - so production has to be at the lowest price. If the demand of the same job is high elsewhere, then thats where the jobs will go.\n\nMost issues associated with concept of free economy are detrimental to the wellbeing of vulnerable population. Patent issues cause hundreds of thousand deaths/suicides in India and Africa. It amplifies the divide between the rich and the poor. WHO, GATT, JAFAA and NAFTAA are weapons used to coerce governments of small countries. Instead of waging war and occupying countries, the US uses trade economics to control and occupy countries. So Free Trade has really become an intrument of war rather than the instrument of social justice that it was supposed to be.\n\nI guess the free economy is a concept - and just like any other concept it has its good and bad. Often the media portrays only one side of the issue - depending on where you live you get to hear one side of the story. 10
Why are people from the Orient so short? I have never seen a 6 foot tall Chinese guy. In fact, I don't think I've ever met anyone from China who is taller than 5'8" or so. \n\nWhat causes this height difference?\n\nBy the by - I put 'The Orient' and not 'Asia' because I am talking about Japan, China, Korea, etc - which is historically called 'The Orient'. Anyone who wants to push the 'pc' thing, go ahead, but please answer the question as well. The Asian diet does not include a lot of dairy products (it is estimated that some 90% of Asians have some degree of lactose intolerance) and protein.  It traditionally includes mainly vegetables and starches.  So, although Asians are height-challenged, they enjoy a longer lifespan than an average Caucasian.  (The Japanese have one of the world's longest life expectancies (number 4 in the world) as opposed to Americans (who are #29). 1

Young and the Restless? OR Bold and the beautiful? or ? Soap operas are somewhat entertainment when in between jobs. I find them okay, nothing major that i cannot miss. It entertains me somewhat.

Do you feel that 2 years in the military should be a  prerequisite for US citizenship? My observations have been that the Latino and Black populations comprise most of the minorities in the military.  I see this daily at a major US airport.  I am not for war but at the same time I feel that, if immigrants want the freedoms which America provides, they should be willing to fight for them. This is a very good question.\n\nI do not think it should be required for citizenship, but I do think it could be tied into certain "benefits". I firmly believe that true service would help most people, lower unemployment (military training translates to outside employment), and lessen the "gimme, gimme, gimme a handout" crap that is very widespread. Why should people be given welfare when they are able bodied enough to serve in the military? Why should people squeeze money from the Fed for schooling, when they can earn that benefit by serving in the armed forces? 10

What is currently the best and most used online dating site?  Match.com is the most popular, so you have the largest pool of potential matches.\n\nOn the other hand, other sites may offer higher quality matches. eHarmony offers extensive screenings to help find people you are compatible with. Other sites offer niche-oriented services, such as JDate (catering to Jews), Gay.com, or sites that help find someone that matches your political leanings. If you are looking for someone that meets very specific criteria, a site like this may be more effective. 9

The Vatican City in central Rome ranks as the smallest nation of the world. It measures 0.17 square miles.<br />\n2. Monaco. <br />\n3. San Marino.\nHow did they manage to become countries?<br />\n1. The political freedom of the Vatican is guaranteed and protected by Italy. It concordat between the Holy See and the kingdom of Italy signed in 1929 in the Lateran Palace, Rome, by Cardinal Gasparri for Pius XI and by Benito Mussolini for Victor Emmanuel III.<br />\n2. Monaco came under French protection in 1861. However from 1911, when the first constitution was promulgated, the prince of Monaco was an absolute ruler.<br />\n3. According to tradition, Marino, a Christian stonecutter from Dalmatia, took refuge (4th cent) on Mt. Titano, the chief geographical feature of present-day San Marino. By the mid-5th cent., a community was formed; because of its relatively inaccessible location and its poverty, it has succeeded, with a few brief interruptions, in maintaining its independence. In 1631 its independence was recognized by the papacy. 2

Why is DSL faster then Dialup since they both use the phone line?  A phone line was originally created to only handle frequencies as high or low as a human voice.  Therefore when using dialup, you are limited by the amount of data that can be transferred within that frequency.  Using DSL, the frequency has a much larger range, and that is why if you have DSL, you have to have a filter for you phones, it filters out the DSL frequencies, and only picks up the voice frequencies. 5

No it's not. you'll just end up getting hurt... if you really want to be with them... stay friends until they've earned your trust. then try for a relationship, but don't jump into one if you can't trust the person you'll be with. That will cause fights and will eventually kill the whole relationship. 9

why do airplanes appear to fly so slow to people on the ground?  Earth is around, you know that. An aero plan has to fly around and it would be flying thousands of kilometers away from you.\n\n It would appear that the plane is flying so slowly. But if you see an aero plane that is flying on low altitude that would appear to be faster.\n\nSky is so wide, you can see larger area if you look further and further you can see more wide angle. \n\nIt is not same as if it is closer to you, the distance would be very small. If it is far distance is greater. 4

What are MX Records and Nameservers?  Nameservers, or DNS Servers, are servers that provide mapping between internet names (like "answers.yahoo.com") and IP addresses (like "209.191.70.167").  They are essential for the operation of the internet as we know it.  Without name servers, you would have to know the IP address of every website you wanted to browse or every mail server you wanted send mail to or through.\n\nThere are a variety of name records that are stored on a DNS server.  They include:\n\nSOA -- Start of Authority records that tell you information about how to reach a domain's servers and owner\n\nA -- Address records that do a direct map of name to address\n\nCNAME -- Alias records that tell you that, for example, "Answers.yahoo.com" really means you need to look up "web-vip1.search.mud.yahoo.com".\n\nPTR -- Reverse address records that tell you what name is associated with a specific address.\n\nAnd, the one you asked about:\n\nMX -- Mail Exchanger records.  MX records tell you, in order, which mail server handles inbound e-mail for a specific domain.  When you send e-mail to, for example, bgates@microsoft.com, your mail server checks the mx records for microsoft.com.  Starting with the one that has the lowest priority number, it tries to deliver the e-mail to that box.  If that box is down, or it gets back a non-fatal error message, then it moves to the box with the next highest priority number.\n\nThe sources will tell you MUCH more information. 5

Whats the maximum number of days a human being can go without sleep?  Various biological factors help determine how long people can last without sleeping. Some people can go for longer periods of time than others. \n\nNotorious cases of record-setters include disc jockey Peter Tripp who in 1959 stayed up for more than eight days as a promotional stunt. After a few days, he began to hallucinate, seeing kittens, mice, and cobwebs. He also became paranoid, insisting that an electrician had dropped a hot electrode into his shoe.\n\nSix years later, high school student Randy Gardner attempted to break the Guinness Book of World Records for the longest time awake -- 260 hours. And after 11 days without sleep he suffered no hallucinations or paranoia and no psychotic symptoms.\n\nSome people with severe insomnia claim to have gone for several weeks without sleep. Though ususally in cases like this, even though they appear awake, their brain actually goes into a light sleep-like state. 3

what should the rise and run be on my stairsgiong up 9.5ft and out 12ft with 14 steps?  I'm making two assumptions.  The total number of footsteps needed to go up the stairs is the number of steps + 1, the usual definition of number of steps.  And you want to know the "unit" rise and run, i.e., the r&r of each step.  If so,\nunit rise=total rise/(no. steps + 1)\nsame idea for unit run.\nIf you're actually making stairs, see the ref. for useful info like allowance for floor thickness, etc. 2
how do i set up my outlook express in and out pop3? i have zoominternet.net on my in and out what do i put????????? is it mail.zoomnetinternet.net i tried this it didnt work help please POP3 is your incoming mail server, the one that transfers your mail to you.  SMTP is the outgoing server that transfers your mail out to other users.  The names may be the same, or they may be different from each other.  mail.zoomnetinternet.net is likely at least the POP3 server.  Just be sure you have it spelled correctly.\n\nI tried to find your ISP on the web and couldn't.  Their site should be able to give you some help on this.  Sorry I couldn't offer more. 5

can i sue a school or their district for not allowing me to have access to my childrens school records??  There are many legal ramifications. If you are the legal parent, the one who is on the birth right or the legal guardian, then yes you have a right to see them. If you are not the legal guardian then no. There are also certain things you can and cannot see. You have a right to see what pertains to your child, and your child only. The district has the right to protect and keep communications within the district private. In other words, official documents only. Grades, discipline records, medical issues. As far as things that are in regards to teachers and their confidentiality, no, you have no right to that. The key word is, are you the legal guardian....that is the biggest question in regards to this topic. 10
Why can Bush get away with misinforming us about intelligence, then use that as reason for war? Why can Bush get away with misinforming us about intelligence and then using that as reason for war? Because the American public is more willing to forgive presidents that don't project themselves as smarter then them.  Its similar to how Oliver North and the Irancontra scandal in the 80's did not affect Reagan's popularity, but how Clinton's "lies" about Monica almost resulted in impeachment.  In a way, this may be Bush's genius, that he understands what lies Americans are willing to accept, and not accept. 10

Holocaust? What was the reality about it? Do you believe in it?  What was the reality about it???? Are you serious?!?! Millions upon millions of jews were systematically murdered by the Nazis- 6 million!!! Can you even fathom how many people that is? Many families were forced from their homes into ghettos where living conditions were grutesque and disgusting. Many families were torn apart, and children saw their parents for the last time as they marched off toward the crematoriums. Groups of Jews were taken to a desolate field, forced to dig a large hole, then were lined up in rows of 5- to then be shot by machine guns to fall into the grave that they dug for themselves!! Many times groups of 100 or more would be shot in this way. The people who were in the second row had to pick up the bodies of the people shot before them and push them into the hole, before they were then shot on the spot. So many Jews were humiliated and made to clean the streets with toothbrushes, or even sweep the streets with their hands after a storm. I hope that you don't deny the holocaust. Everything that happened was very real. I hope you take the time to research the holocaust and to read about some of the atrocities that have taken place from 1939-1945. (Some of these terrible things happened even before the war took place- and a lot of the discrimination was starting in Russia before the war "officially" began.) 10
How should we spread the message of truth and love to people who are killing their own brothers.? World was more safe a few years ago. An American could easily move in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Is there any way to find a pricelist for baseballcards?  If you want the most up to date prices, you should pickup a beckett magazine at your local cardshop. The beckett mags are separated into individual sports so you would need to buy two different mags if you wanted to lookup baseball and football cards.\n\nIf you have older cards that don't fluctuate in price as much, you should go to a bookstore. There is a hobby section that will have some price guides there.\n\nAlso I know that TOYS R US carries beckett magazines and price guides that you can check out. 6

Does any one know a college/university that accepts life experience towards credits? I want to get a degree in criminal justice, and I was hoping my ten years in law enforcement would equal a large part of the degree. I have also attended several advanced academies and training seminars. You'd probably be best off to find a college you're interested in and talk to their academic counselors about this. They might give you credit that would count towards your degree but not fulfill any requirements; it would prevent you from having to take extra electives classes but not get you out of any classes relating to the CJ major. 4

If you're really ok, then maybe some people just dont feel too friendly toward you. If someone turned down your offer of friendship, move forward, anyway there are lots of people out there who can be your friends 1
wear can i find owen hart last match.?  Owen's last televised match was as the Blue Blazer with Jeff Jarrett vs. Val Venis & Godfather on WWF RAW on May 17, 1999. The only place you could find this is on ebay and even then, the WWE is cracking down on people selling their WWE unofficial tape or DVD collections so it's more than likely you won't be able to find it for purchase for a long time or ever.\n\nAs far as his last match, Owen's last match before his passing was the night before the Over the Edge PPV, he and Jeff Jarrett defeated Edge and Christian in Chicago, IL at a house show. More than likely there's no video of the match. 6

What steps should I take to begin the process of gaining custody of him? you should gives important reasons to have custody of him, also see if you have time and money to do so. 10

Is it possible to devise an experiment that proves or disproves the existence of parallel universes ?  It is not known whether this is possible or not right now. So it is possible that it's possible. :-)\n\nFor example, several credible scientific theories postulate the existence of parallel universes that can be accessed via various ways. Most of them would only allow one-way travel right now (like through a black hole), but the physics are not fully understood, obviously. It is possible that we could find a different one-way path back to this universe from the other one, for example.\n\nSee the article below for some conjecture from one of the great physicists thinking about these things. He wrote the book "The Elegant Universe," which also makes for interesting reading about these types of things, and gives a layman's introduction to string theory. 2

can a batsmen complain to umpire of Bowler's throw action or its just the match referee who can complain about  - Any one can criticise the action of a bowler from \n  Batsman to Umpire.\n- But the ICC evaluates the bowlers bowling action and \n  declares whether its legal or not.\n- ICC has a set of rules/procedures which determine how to \n  evaluate a bowlers throwing action.\n- Recently ICC amended its rules in case of Shoaib \n  Akhthars case and concluded his action is because of his \n  physical defect and hence its assumed as a legal action \n  and its cleared.\n- So to avoid further crisis it amended the law as the \n  straight should not go beyond 15 degree agree. And \n  bowling action within this constraint will be treated as \n  legal. 6

California Law states you can't take photos of a woman with a wooden leg. Why not?  As usual with legal-related questions on Yahoo! Answers, too little information has been provided to answer the question adequately.  No legal search I can perform reveals that it is illegal in California.  Without a citation to the law or an exact phrase from the law, I cannot verify that the law exists, and I cannot explain the legislative theory behind the law without the text of the statute.  So far as I can tell, this law does not exist and is merely an urban legend. 10

What happens to the auras of two persons when they make love?  I think this may be the first time I've been able to really agree with any of Megami's posts, but I do (mostly).\nI can't say much about the "color", but I can say that the two do indeed "mix". Even when they separate, parts of their spirits stay "mixed".\nThis is what the Bible refers to as "becoming one flesh", and a major reason to only have sex inside the commitment of marriage.\nThis is why very promiscuous people often become mentally unstable, and at the very least "hardened" to the deeper levels of their personality.\n\nEdit: Megami - what I mean is that I agree with your conclusion, I just disagree with how you arrived at your conclusion. 1
How can I make my voice heard? I'm struggling with an eating disorder, and constantly bombarded with negative reinforcement from society.  Every commercial is either for fast food, or a new majic diet pill.  I can't get away from it, and I want it to stop putting bad thoughts in america's girls' heads.  Eating disorders are glorified instead of addressed/dealt with.  People accept being too thin, but shun those are too fat.  \nI would also like to find a reliable birth control for guys, but that's a perfect world.  I can't expect miracles. Why not start a blog that addresses these issues?\n\nYour voice could be heard and you could offer a beacon of hope to many girls in the same situation.\n\nIt's not a perfect solution, but it is cheap and available. 1

Where is the list of North American Indian Reservations? Tony Hillerman writes of the size of the Navajo Reservation in the southwest. I have friends from Walpole Island and Sault Ste. Marie, but I still don't know how many and how large or where existing living reservations are. I'd like to know what tribes they're reserved to, as well.\nNot the "reservations" that have been created for gambling purposes. Here's another list. This one is on wiki, and is pretty easy to use.  Each link takes you to more detailed information for each reservation including what tribe(s) inhabits the reservation.  I think it includes all of the Indian Reservations in the US and there are links to some info on Canadian Indian 'Reserves'. It also comes with a high-res map from the BIA (Bureau of Indian Affairs).\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Indian_reservations_in_the_United_States\n\n(1/16th Native American.

Since reparations has been given due to past crimes against humanity shouldn't African Americans receive also? Due to slavery and 400 yr+ of oppression also the unequal treatment of blacks in America due to White supremacy and injustice. Reparations in the United States have generally been limited to the survivors of government harm.  Watch your terminology, though - slavery was not a crime until 1865, since the government permitted slavery and only outlawed it through the Thirteenth Amendment after the Civil War.\n\nFor instance, the United States paid survivors of Japanese internment programs from WWII.  The program, however, was limited to survivors.  No survivors of slavery exist today.\n\nA current reparations program would be too bizarre to fathom.  All African-Americans were not harmed by slavery, after all, since some immigrated to America after slavery, or since some have no slave ancestors.  It would be virtually impossible to require proof of slave ancestry, and then to divide some sum proportionately.\n\nAdditionally, the vague "400 yr+ of oppression" is unhelpful in crafting legislation.  Slavery ended.  Segregation did exist also, that's ended for over 50 years now.  If you're problem with "White supremacy and injustice," then I'm afraid that no amount of money will solve the problem.  Instead, educating future generations and winning over hearts and minds is the most effective remedy to injustice. 10

Who would have been better, Bush or Kerry, or in that case Al Gore? Would it have been better for Kerry or Al Gore to have won, or is Bush the best choice. Why? In my opinion either Kerry or Gore would have made a much better president.\n\nBush led our country into a war that never should have been. Our economy has been in a downward spiral since he took office. His medicare program is proving itself to be a disaster for our senior citizens,  More and more Americans are losing health care benefits.  The NSA is wiretapping American citizens without warrants.  His Supreme Court appointees have shifted a balanced court to the right.  \n\nAdditionally, his attempt to greatly expand Presidential power in the name of the "War on Terror" is especially frightening since it affects the Executive / Legislative / Judicial balance of goverment as defined in our Constitution.\n\nI'm sure I could go on but I've got to get back to work! 10

When was the revolutionary war?  The American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), also known as the American War of Independence, was a war fought primarily between Great Britain and revolutionaries within thirteen British colonies in North America. The war began largely as a colonial revolt against the economic policies of the British Empire, and eventually widened far beyond British North America, with France, Spain, and the Netherlands entering the war against Great Britain. Additionally, many American Indians fought on both sides of the conflict.\n\nThroughout the war, the British were able to use their naval superiority to capture colonial coastal cities, but control of the countryside largely eluded them. French involvement proved decisive, with a naval victory in the Chesapeake leading to the surrender of a British army at the Battle of Yorktown in 1781. The Treaty of Paris in 1783 recognized the independence of the United States of America. Because a great number of colonists fled the thirteen colonies and settled in the north, the war also paved the way for the eventual creation of what would become Canada. 10

Does time have any objective reality outside of the human mind?  Actually, according to Einstein's general theory of relativity, which is not the one J.R. is referring to, time is developed to explain the force of gravity and the curvature of space-time.  A physicist named Godel developed a postulate in which he proves that time was merely developed to explain.  Time does not behave independently in our universe.  Look up "Godel's incompleteness theorem". 2

Do you believe that public executions would deter crime? Public executions used to be common.  How do you feel about this subject? I don't think executions deter crime at all, and I don't know why public executions would make it any better, not least because there is no way to actually force people to watch them. The sort of people who would choose to watch them are the sort of people who wouldn't commit crimes.\n\nCanada does not have the death penalty, and yet has a third as many murders per capita. Also, the United States has a murder rate significantly higher than any of the other first-world countries, all of which don't have the death penalty. Finally, non-death penalty states have consistently lower murder rates than death penalty states. 10

why world think that muslims are terrorists??  Muslims are terrorists if all Germans are nazis, Americans are gangsters, Columbians are drug dealers, Italians are mafia members and ....\nI think thats because the only news from muslims which  news companies spread is about terrorism.\nPropaganda has great powers and it can make you believe that muslims are terrorist.\nAfter cold war when the danger of communism vanished western governments need an enemy and there wasn't anyone better than muslims.\nMaybe it is true that some famous terrorist are muslim but it is also true that muslim countries have suffered from many unwanted problems e.g. afghanestan which was american front during cold war for controlling the communism movement in middle east which is one of the most important oil producers in world and believe me, there is nothing remained there except ruined cities and mountain and minefield and vast fields of poppy which is used to make opium and heroin in great amounts. this is a proper place for terrorism to grow. so I think muslims are wrongfuly accused. 1

Stolen credit card number? My boyfriend had his credit card number stolen, I assume from using it to make purchases via the internet.

Call the credit companies - sush as Equifax and put a freeze on your credit in addition to calling the credit card company.

what is the best way to get her to like you? what is the best way to get a girl to like like you? Ask her out on a date so you all can get to know each other a little better.  Start out as friends first and if the feelings between the two of you grows stronger maybe you all can take it to another level.  Remember take things slow; don't sell yourself short and commit to her just yet.  Date around to see if its anybody else out there for you.  You're young have fun!  By the way, if she can't like you for you then she's not worth your time. 9
I have inherited dark circles and rest does not help, is there a way to get rid of them?  Retinol-A (retin-A) is supposed to do something for that.  It is often in face creams.  Also, SPF-15 is good.\n\nYou can put a little turmeric (a yellow spice that makes curry yellow) into water, or even rose water (you can get that at an international grocery store) and put a bit of that under your eyes (wash it off afterwards).\n\nIf you can't actually get rid of them, there is some makeup that can cover them up fairly well.  It is a yellow stick - made like lipstick.  Yellow color hides the blue color, so that is why it works. 3
what are the positive and negative effects of eletronic monitoring of offenders?

how to overcome sexual interest gap? we r married 2 years. we love each other more thna anything else. but i m a sexadict and she is a sex-as-usual. she wants to stisfy me but she just doesn't get aroused as much i do. how can we make each other happy? Some women think they should only have sex if they are feeling aroused. But the truth is, as she goes about  her day-to-day life, she might not think about sex all that much. So when you ask for sex, she won't be in the mood. Instead, try asking if you can snuggle, kiss, or give her a backrub. Make sure she knows that you won't have sex if she doesn't want to. After fifteen minutes of affection, you can ask if she'd like to have sex. She might be more interested at that point. \n\nTo be fair, you can also try to turn down your sex drive a bit. Try to spend a little less time thinking about sex or looking at things that make you horny. Instead, work on a hobby or spend time with your friends. 3
Hi, I am from Lebanon (Middle East). I want to apply as a refugee to Canada. What is the best way to do that ? I am an arabic person from Lebanon, I have the lebanese nationality. I want to apply as a refugee to Canada. I had a work in Lebanon and I was stolen by a syrian man (my partner). He threatened to kill me if I talked about him. I lost all my 11,000 $ from three years. Now the Syrian troops went out of Lebanon, but if I talked to the lebanese police about that, I am afraid of being accused for buying a forbidden type of satellites (only in Lebanon) which is used to download and upload internet. I used this satellite in my work, I was a local internet service provider. By this way I will go to prison in Lebanon and everybody knows what they do with prisoners there... So anyone PLEASE to give help and tell me what is the best way to apply to Canada as a refugee, from inside Canada or outside Canada ??? How is this done ??? Is there any possibility to be returned to Lebanon from Canada ??? Thank you ... hi,\n\ngetting refugee status in most places is difficult.  in canada you can only apply directly as a refugee if you are from certain countries, otherwise you have to be nominated by the UN high commissioner of refugees.  the list of places you can directly apply from is here:  http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/refugees/resettle-direct.html\n\nyou will probably have better luck if you visit canada as a tourist, and when you are there apply for politial asylum.  if you can show that you have a reasonable fear of being persecuted, tortured or killed upon your return, but i do not know how many cases they approve or what your odds are.  there are a lot of immigration attorneys in canada that specialize in this, so once you are here you can probably talk to them.  IN ANY CASE you are better off if you have family here.  more information from the canadian government on the asylum process:  http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/refugees/asylum-1.html\n\na third option you may consider is to apply as a normal immigrant under the "skilled worker" program.  you have to qualify in certain ways - education, language etc.  you can take an online test to see if you qualify  - it is not a binding result, but it will give you an idea of where you stand.  it's here:  http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/skilled/assess/index.html\n\nyou might also consider applying on a student visa.  \n\nin pretty much any situation you will want to talk to an immigration lawyer.  they are much, much better informed than i and you should not make such big decisions based on stuff you read on the internet.  i think the best thing to do is to try to find the money to visit canada as a tourist.  then when you are here look up an immigration attorney.  they will tell you the best thing to do.  \n\na cheaper option you could consider finding one on the internet and trying to get an initial consultation over the phone.  most attorneys will offer a free hour of initial consultation where you tell them about yourself and they let you know if they can help or not.  i would think this could happen over the telephone. 10

What is the best way to learn alot of information in a short amount of time without help? Ok I know that sounded kinda weird, but at work I have this manual I'm supposed to study, and it's not even about what I'm going to be trained to do, but my boss wants me familiar with the information in the book. It's a big thick manual. It's a normal notebook with about 200 pages in it. What is the best way to learn all the key information fast? Does it have a Index?  If so look through it first.  Also does it have Headings or words that are bolded or in itallics, if so look over these items first.  Usually the first sentence in a paragraph has the basic info, so you can skim the the book, if the first sentence has good information then read more, if not go on to the next paragraph.  Also the first & last paragraphs in a chapter usually have lots of info.  Sometimes if you go to the end of the book it will have key words or terms that you can read & get a good feel for the book. Each book is different, so it is hard to give hard & fast rules about the best way to get the most info in the least time.  I hope this helps. 7
What is the best way to begin moving up in snowboarding? I live in the south and we never get snow.

What turns a good idea into reality? Why isn't it just easy? What makes it easier or harder to achieve? I need an idea factory! Not one that creates ideas - we all already do lots of that - but one that churns out real product at the other end, or then at least sends it back to the drawing board if its not gonna happen. \n\nAlmost something like ideas.yahoo.com - where real people can participate in the development of ideas & the criteria for those ideas and the copyright/ownership remains with the originator.\n\nOr it must be for a happy world / free for all / public domain.\n\nIs there maybe already a site for that? As Thomas Edison said, genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration.  No good idea ever got off the drawing board without an inspired and energetic person behind it. 2

Should she change doctors, if so, why? i agree with cblrdy and molebeing,  doctors are a great source of care and comfort. when you are sick than cured that is a comfortable feeling, a thankful feeling, and a feeling of releif, i wouldnt exactly call the feeling a crush, more like admiration; because of the learning that went into making diagnoses simple or complex. just make sure she isnt confusing compassion with passion. 2

In real life with the first jamacian bobsled team did the cart really break and they carried it to the end? Like in the movie cool runnings based off the first jamacian bobsled team?

Remember "Cool Runnings" is not a documentary, it is a commercial film. The Jamaicans were actually respected for fighting against all odds and trying to be themselves. 6

How is bi-polar disorder dx'd? What profession? Tests?  Great answer by hidden_smiles.  The one thing I would add is that the period of mania can be exhibited as grandiosity.  Rapid speech and multiple ideas coming out at the same time.  An agitated frame of mind, extreme nervousness and paranoia.  Insomnia is a corollary having to do with the nervousness.  In some cases the grandiosity is expressed as irritability and anger.  The difficult thing is that there's no test as such for bipolar (manic-depressive) disorder.  One of the ways that bipolar disorder disorder is deduced is through a long term analysis by a counsellor, social worker or psychiatrist.  Another indicator is an adverse reaction to anti-depressant medication such as Zoloft or Celexa.  In some cases being on this medication can push somebody with bi-polar tendencies towards a state of mania.  The good news is that there are mood stabilizers that can be provided by a licensed psychiatrist if this is diagnosed.  All in all, there is a lot of help for this and a lot of information online.  Good luck to you. 3

what is your opinion about Iran?  One of the most important countries in the world, and the most important country in the Middle East. Has a democratic govt. and people that are always there for the nation. There are some tensions between Iran, Israel, and the United States. The reason is that Iran is developing peaceful nuclear technology, but United States, without any documents accuses Iran of developing nuclear weapons. United States is currently doing every thing it can against Iran, but won't make a military movement against Iran, because it knows that in the case of this war ( between Iran, and United States, and/or Israel) The loser of war certainly is not Iran.\nIranian people have a civilization of more than 2000 years and many Iranian scientists in previous centuries have set the bases of science and math. 7

How come the politicians forget us as soon as there elected?  They only forget what they had promised the vote bank but, seldom they forget about their own needs.\n\nIn essence they do not forget but they just reprioritize and conveniently forget their promises till next election. 10
why men like sex more than women?  IT IS NOT TRUE THAT MEN LIKE SEX MORE THAN WOMEN. WHAT HAPPENS IS WOMEN ARE USUALLY MORE RESERVED THAN MEN SO MEN USUALLY ASK AND INITIATE SEX MORE OFTEN THAT WOMEN. ALSO, WOMEN NEED TO BE THERE EMOTIONALLY IN ORDER TO DESIRE SEX AND MEN CAN JUST HAVE SEX WITHOUT BECOMING EMOTIONALLY ATTACHED. 9
Oxygen itself burns or it is just a agent which supports combustion.?  Fire is what is called a "redox reaction."  This is where atoms exchange electrons, truning high energy bonds into low energy bonds (or orbitals).  Every redox reaction needs an oxidizer (which takes electrons) and a reducer (which gives up electrons).  In a normal fire, oxygen acts as the electron-accepter.  Carbohydrates (wood, sugar, oil, coal, etc) usually acts as the reducer (ie the electron donor).\n\nO2 takes away electrons and becomes CO2, meaning that the oxygen gets consumed in the burning process.  So really, both the oxygen and the fuel are burning, because they both release energy and end up changed by the process. 2
is racism the main problem facing black people today?  No.  It is the fact that the laws that are intended to try to even the playing field like affirmative action are racist.  Racism works both ways.  To not be racist is to not care what ethnicity a person is.  Though I am white, I always fill out the forms saying that I am blasian.  What's worse is that laws like affirmative action don't attack racism, they just try to turn men of a different race white.  It is trying to force assimilation. 10

Why do twins feel they have to dress alike ?  Probably because their parents treated them like a "unit" growing up.  I have twins and I get sooo many matching outfits.  The funny thing is that I've never dressed them identical a day of their 8-month-old lives, but I think people just get a kick out of seeing two little people dressed alike.  \n\nWhat's worse is when the mom has a matching outfit with the kids.  Oh boy... 9

Can anyone please explain to me what quantum mechanics is? try to make it as simple as possible! Quantum mechanics is a mathematical theory that can describe the behavior of objects that are roughly 10,000,000,000 times smaller than a typical human being. Quantum particles move from one point to another as if they are waves. However, at a detector they always appear as discrete lumps of matter. There is no counterpart to this behavior in the world that we perceive with our own senses. One cannot rely on every-day experience to form some kind of "intuition" of how these objects move. The intuition or "understanding" formed by the study of basic elements of quantum mechanics is essential to grasp the behavior of more complicated quantum systems. \n\n\nPlease visit the below url for moe information 2
Why do people turn "green" with envy?  Jealousy is referred to as the "green-eyed monster" in a Shakespearean play.  I'm not sure which play it is right now, although I want to say it's Othello.  It might be a reference to Shakespeare. 4
Is there really a need to provide different formats for video and audio?  Quite unequivocally, yes. A visually impaired user may not be able to see a video; a user with a hearing impairment may not be able to hear an audio track. If developers don't provide essential visual or aural information in alternative formats (even as a simple description or text transcript), some users will not be able to take advantage of the information you're putting on your site. \n\nAs is often the case, adding what would be considered 'accessibility' features can have benefits for all users, not just users with disabilities. For example, imagine that you're writing an article or research paper, and you want to include a quote from a conference's speech. If the speech is only available as an audio file (a podcast, to use the term 'du jour'), you'll have to listen to the audio and manually type up your quote. If the speech is also made available as a transcript, it simply becomes a matter of copying and pasting. And of course, search engines can't index the content of audio/video files. 5
Do you know who's quote this is, and do you agree : )? Shopping is a woman thing. It's a contact sport like football. Women enjoy the scrimmage, the noisy crowds, the danger of being trampled to death, and the ecstasy of the purchase. Erma Bombeck.\n\nI do agree with it! When I was young, I used to accompany my mom for shopping. It was hell. A Fish Market to be accurate. \nI hope my gf WONT be someone who will put me in the perils of getting trampled. :P 4

Can you claim a dependant who is not a relative if lived with you for one year while having temp. guardianship  To claim someone as a dependent on your federal tax form, the person must live with you for 6 months or more and if no one else is paying for more than 1/2 of what it costs to support them. It does not matter who has custody or guardianship, that is not a requirement to claim someone as a dependent. You do not need the permission of the person who has legal custody. In my state, we can also do this on state tax forms. You might want to read over your state tax forms and if it is unclear whether or not you qualify to claim this person as a dependent then, you should consult a tax specialist. 7

How long can a person stay under water ? whats the average and whats the highest \nand whats your opinion "the longest that humans can hold their breath for is about 2 1/2 minutes, and this is for pearl divers who make a living by holding their breath underwater. Most of us can only hold our breath for 1 minute."  (see Source)\n\nI think that there are extremes (world record holders) that are nowhere near the average.\n\nI read somewhere that there's a trick to holding your breath for a long time, and it is to eliminate the nitrogen from your body.  I forget how you do it (sorry), but the point was that it's the presence of nitrogen, not the absence of oxygen, that causes the FIRST problem for humans. 6
Does anyone think that this Republican/Democrat party system is undoing the country at home and abroad?  The two party system is as old as the country itself.  actually, it is patterened after the house of commons in merry ole England.  If you think our party system is volitile, you should see and hear the antics used over there.  the two party system works as well as any other, probably better, given its longevity. I vote that we leave it alone except for one factor, that is popular vote.  I believe that we should still base our outcomes on the popular vote of this country.  In this way, the people have truly spoken! By the way, the hell with abroad.  We owe no other nation, or group of people, an explanation as to the domestic decisions of this country. 10

Why Dan Marino is the best QB ever? Here's the answer: http://img505.imageshack.us/img505/6574/fspike2po.gif\n\nOh baby it's the 'FAKE' ja ja Dan is the best QB ever.  People seem to forget that he was the only QB to have success without any semblance of a running game.  We also need to remember that also the dolphins defense didn't start to improve until jimmy Johnson became head coach, which wasn't until Dan's career was pretty much over.  So from 83-00, 17 years, Dan  carried his team to a Superbowl in his rookie season, a few AFC Championship games, and broke the TD record w/o having running game or defense to back him up.  As far as individual performances go, he is the best ever. 6
What do you all really think about people from Kentucky? I am a 17 year old female who lives in Kentucky and I have often heard that people believe that Kentuckians have no intelligence. A typical stereotype for the south, right? Well we all wear shoes here, people. I am sure ther are plenty of intelligent, proper people in Kentucky. There are also plenty of ignorant, inbred, trashy people. This is pretty much the same everywhere you go, from florida to alaska. The reason Kentucky gets more attention for it is the southern drawl. Most of the rest of the country after hearing a southern drawl, assumes that person is an idiot. This is no more right than most southerners assuming all people of color are criminals. 1
Do you think that today music is bad for the soul? I know there are some Christian out there that believe that Christian shouldn’t listen to today music. i am a christian and i do listen to christian and some non-christian music, one of my friends feel that christian shouldn't listen to today music b/c it affects the soul and we had many talks about this do you feel the same why and if so why? As A christian Believer, I agree that today's music affect us in our spiritual lives.  I mean how can one have a good effective prayer life with God.  There's a spirit with worldly music, I mean think about it, You listen to a song on the radio and it can make you feel a certain way and also can put negative thoughts in your mind- whether it's to have sex with someone, robb someone, committ suicide or whatever.  Statistic show that many people have committed so many acts of violence because of various music they listen too.  I'm not trying to be deep, just trying to make it to heaven. \nJust Pray about it, does it feel right, would Jesus listen to it? 8

What do you feel about forbiding prayer in school and allowing slander against God or Gods Books ? When I was growing up in Idaho we were to say the pledge to the flag and we could pray if we choose to , but now if our children did they could get exspelled or evan sued . What is next burning the Bible,tora and Qu'ran ? Kids can still pray in school.  They just can't be forced to, and they're not given a designated time to do it during the school day.  If prayer were forbidden in school, I would never get through a day of teaching!  I find it sad that moments of silence have been removed from schools b/c it's nice to have a small moment at the beginning of the day to collect your thoughts, pray, or zone out.  Nothing can stop a person from having a personal relationship with God. 10

explanation of the NEAR V. MINNESOTA (1930)?  Near v. Minnesota\n283 U.S. 697 (1931)\nAuthor: DK\n\nFacts: A Minnesota law provided for abatement, as a public nuisance, of a malicious, scandalous and defamatory newspaper, magazine or other periodical. D’s newspaper published defamatory and scandalous articles and a court issued an injunction permanently enjoining the newspaper from publishing.\n\nIssue: Was the law unconstitutional?\n\nHolding: Yes\n\nRationale:  According to the court, the injunction was prior restrain on press and was unconstitutional.  The Court stated that the appropriate way of dealing with unprotected speech was after the fact punishment and not prior restraint on the freedom of press.  Therefore, prior restrain can’t be used to punish a publication unless there exist some exceptional circumstances (e.g. national security during times of war). 10

Is America Ready for either a black president or female president?  Yes, or almost.  Colin Powell seems pretty smart, so does Rice.  People are already talking about Hillary (whom I don't want to see elected because spouses tend to be able hold considerable leverage over their significant others, she's too liberal for my tastes, I don't remember her before her husband became president, and she seems to be making political moves, not true idealogical shifts, simply to attract voters.  I don't like that.) 10
Is it wise to try to influence my wife's decision? We separated 3 days ago when she said she needed time to herself to figure out what she wanted. We still live in the same house for financial reasons. Should I try to convince her that we are better together just because that's what I want, or should I just sit here and hope that everything turns out all right? I still love my wife, but she is hurting me with all of this. Any suggestions? How long have you been married?  From a women's point view you def. need to talk with your wife, tell her your hopes and dreams for your marriage, let her know you still care and that you'll be there for her.  Why? Because you still love her.  But let her decide what she wants.  She said she needs time, give it to her, but don't lose touch with her. 9

I feel like my family thinks i am crazy what do i do to prove i am not ? I had to go to the student guidence conuseler in first grade and  i haven't had to go since. They didn't think i was crazy then why now ? If this is a legitimate question, you should submit to speaking to a counselor or psychotherapist.  That will serve the purpose of satisfying their concern, as well as giving you an outlet for whatever may be bothering you.  In order to do this, however, you must withstand the urge to be embarassed about it.  Lots of people go to therapy these days. 7
Why should I be against the idea of a national ID card? There are plans afoot to introduce a national ID card in the UK.

Why, because we already have one, and its called a Drivers License...\nAny information that is needed on a person can be found on it, and if not, it could be added...\nJust another matter where the Government is trying to take total control.... 10
how many people die of Aids in an hour? how can we avoid this deaths? 232,876 people die every day (on average), then how many people die per second?  Well, 232,876 divided by 24 hours = 9,703 people die every hour.  9,703 divided by 60 minutes = 161 people die every minute.  161 divided by 60 seconds = 2.6 (we'll say 2) people die every second.  Can you imagine this?  2 people die in this world every second of every minute of every hour of every day of every week of every month of every year!  It's adds up to 85,000,000 people a year. 3

What is the differnce between plasma tv's and High deffanition?  I won't correct your spelling (I have trouble myself), but that is an apples and oranges question. Plasma has to do with the type of screen (Plasma, LCD, DLP...and so on). HD has to do with the resolution, or the number of lines on the picture, old TV's had 410 lines HD has 720 or 1080, ie a sharper picture. I would be glad to go in more detail if you e-mail me. :) 8
Bermuda Triangle? I'm doing a speech on the Bermuda Triangle and i need some information on it can anyone help? Bermuda Shorts:\n\nA Brief History of\nthe Devil's Triangle\n\nLimbo of the Lost. The Twilight Zone. Hoodoo Sea. The Devil's Triangle. The vast three-sided segment of the Atlantic Ocean bordered by Bermuda, Puerto Rico and Fort Lauderdale, Florida, did not receive its most famous nickname until 1964, but reports of bizarre happenings there, or nearby, have been recorded for centuries. In fact, many claim that Christopher Columbus bore witness to the Bermuda Triangle's weirdness.\n\nAs the Nina, the Pinta and the Santa Maria sailed through the area in 1492, it is reported that Columbus's compass went haywire and that he and his crew saw weird lights in the sky, but these events have mundane explanations. From the account in Columbus's journal, it is thought that his compass's slight inaccuracy stemmed from nothing more than the discrepancy between true north and magnetic north. As for the lights, Columbus wrote of seeing "a great flame of fire" that crashed into the ocean -- probably a meteor. He saw lights in the sky again on October 11, which, of course, was the day before his famous landing. The lights, brief flashes near the horizon, were spotted in the area where dry land turned out to be.\n\nAnother historical event retroactively attributed to the Bermuda Triangle is the discovery of the Mary Celeste. The vessel was found abandoned on the high seas in 1892, about 400 miles off its intended course from New York to Genoa. There was no sign of its crew of ten or what had happened to them. Since the lifeboat was also missing, it is quite possible that they abandoned the Mary Celeste during a storm that they wrongly guessed the ship could not weather. But what makes it even harder to call this a Bermuda Triangle mystery is that it the ship was nowhere near the Triangle -- it was found off the coast of Portugal.\n\nThe Bermuda Triangle legend really began in earnest on December 5, 1945, with the famed disappearance of Flight 19. Five Navy Avenger bombers mysteriously vanished while on a routine training mission, as did a rescue plane sent to search for them -- six aircraft and 27 men, gone without a trace. Or so the story goes.\n\nWhen all the facts are laid out, the tale of Flight 19 becomes far less puzzling. All of the crewmen of the five Avengers were inexperienced trainees, with the exception of their patrol leader, Lt. Charles Taylor. Taylor was perhaps not at the height of his abilities that day, as some reports indicate that he had a hangover and failed in his attempts to pass off this flight duty to someone else.\n\nWith the four rookie pilots entirely dependent on his guidance, Taylor found that his compass malfunctioned soon into the flight. Taylor chose to continue the run on dead reckoning, navigating by sighting landmarks below. Being familiar with the islands of the Florida Keys where he lived, Taylor had reason to feel confident in flying by sight. But visibility became poor due to a brewing storm, and he quickly became disoriented.\n\nFlight 19 was still in radio contact with the Fort Lauderdale air base, although the weather and a bad receiver in one of the Avengers made communication very spotty. They may have been guided safely home if Taylor had switched to an emergency frequency with less radio traffic, but he refused for fear they would be unable to reestablish contact under these conditions.\n\nTaylor ended up thinking they were over the Gulf of Mexico, and ordered the patrol east in search of land. But in reality, they had been heading up the Atlantic coastline, and Taylor was mistakenly leading his hapless trainees much further out to sea. Radio recordings indicate that some of them suggested to Taylor that Florida was actually to the west.\n\nA search party was dispatched, which included the Martin Mariner that many claim disappeared into the Bermuda Triangle along with Flight 19. While it is true that it never returned, the Mariner did not vanish; it blew up 23 secon 4
did any bodies wash ashore when the titanic sank in 1912?  Of the ~1500 people who died, only about 900 bodies were recovered.  For months after, life-jacketed decomposing bodies were spotted by ships takinga similar route.  Perhaps the most famous person to dieon Titanic, John Jacob Astor wasnt pulled from the untill several months after he died, badly decomposed.  No bodies actually washed ashore, but many were lost at sea. 4

God said He created the rainbow to remind Him not to destroy earth.does He foget?  God. (cheating) This explanation is what everyone eventually resorts to when the other answers fail. Now, before I go any further, I should make clear that I'm not talking about any of the gods defined in various religions. Throughout all of human history, we've been trying to explain existence. But nobody has ever succeeded. And it's likely that nobody ever will. So we create the concept of God, whose only necessary property is being "that which explains existence." \n\nThis doesn't tell us much about god, though. It doesn't mean that any particular religion is correct. It merely defines god as something which answers The Question, because we have not been able to. 4

The story of Shangri-La is based on the concept of Shambhala, a mystical city in the Buddhist religion. 4
Ladies, why in your opinion are us males so obsessed with girl's boobs? Also what personal life experiences have you had as a result of this breast obsession? Because men don't have them and 99.9% of humans associate breats with life as breast feeding provides the first food.\n\nI am well endowed enough that if I choose to show clevage, I get treated differently by men while out shopping or enjoying an evening out. Without the clevage showing, less doors get opened, I get smiled at less and I am less often allowed in line before a man. Perhaps all the attention is a ploy to get closer to said subject! 1

Is the USA slowly declining to its fall? Our country is extremely young on the scheme of world history. Do you think it will last? Yes, but I don't think it is due to a lack of religion or the devil walking in our midst. In fact it should not have anything to do with religion as there should be a seperation of church and state. Which is not to insinuate that there is anything wrong with religion except that our goverment attempts to limit the power of factions for domestic security. I could care less what people do in their private lives it doesn't carry over to the public arena. I don't agree with the motives to follow but the US could fall as our economy is a source of security. Since WWII we have been economically dominant yet, our economic superpower is waning as various economies around the world are becoming stronger and challenging America. America will become more desperate to try and keep its self secure on many fronts therefore becoming overextended. 10

Can a woman and a man be friends?  It depends on the woman and man. Some people use "friendship" as a way of becoming close to someone who they secretly harbour feelings for. In a case like that, then chances are, there's going to be a lot of hurt, if the feelings are not reciprocated. But if we are talking about two people who have absolutely no romantic feelings towards each other, then yes, they can be friends, and be closer than even brothers-and-sisters. 9

how cure people that experience paranoid delusion/delution or something like that?  A paranoid delusion is most often a sympton of a disorder that is chronic rather than acute. There really is no such thing as a cure....maintanence of symptoms, treatment yes...This varies for everyone...I have known some people that never leave behind their delusions (it is how they frame...make sense of the world) others experience delusions on and off while recieving treatment. Some people find the wonder drug and, if they are lucky, therapy combo and leave their delusions behind. It is such an unknown that brain of ours that it really is true  that we are guinea pigs. And for me that is an okay trade-off. My illness has been very responsive to treatment. So what is a little cottonmouth or possible threat of shaving a decade off my life if I don't live in perpetual fear. Whatever... I am getting off track. 3

Is it possible for humans to naturally become nocturners?? There are people who worked all night,which means they would sleep during the day.Scientist believe that the feeling of sleepiness comes from melatonin which is pump to our bloodstream at night and stop pumping during the day,which is why we feel sleepy at night and active during the day.So does people who stay all night and sleep during the day actually managed to make their melatonin pumps during the day instead of the night? in other word is it possible for human to naturally feel sleepy during the day and active at night,in which make them nocturners?? The release of melatonin is partially regulated by the sensing of daylight in the hypothalamus of your brain. But I think that there is some evidence to show a change in the melatonin releasing time in people who sleep through the day. I also think there are light bulbs designed to better mimic the suns ability to regulate melatonin release. 2

if the man that was shot by the Vice president should die, should the vice president be charged with a crime?  He is not critical. However, if any person dies and it is related directly to other persons harm, then the law states he may be charged with involuntary homicide. The same holds true for an automobile accident or anything that may take the life of another human being. I personally, do not think this attorney will die as a result of the injury sustained from this incident. It was a very unfortunate accident. 10

Many school districts key pay increases and tenure (permanent employment) based on advanced degrees (Masters and PhD.) and teacher groups like the NEA actively encourage its members to do more study. Additionally, you may find yourself involved in summer school classes or other activities.\n\nIf you're considering becoming a teacher, you should consider this:  those who choose teaching as a career are likely less interested in a job that has summers off than they are with the opportunity to educate and motivate children. 4

what are the symptoms of glocuma? is their any relationship between glocuma and diabetese if so kindly describe thesymptoms and possible reamedy. Glaucoma\n\n\n\nGlaucoma affects approximately 3 million Americans and is a leading cause of blindness in the US.\n\nGlaucoma is a group of diseases that can damage the eye's optic nerve and result in vision loss and blindness. However, with early treatment, you can often protect your eyes against serious vision loss. Glaucoma is symptom less and gradually steals your vision without warning, but can be detected by a simple test usually performed during a routine vision exam. \n\nAnnual Glaucoma testing is recommended for everyone over 60 years old. Individuals with a family history of glaucoma, African Americans and the elderly are considered at elevated risk of glaucoma and should be tested on a yearly basis. \n\n\nFortunately, glaucoma can now be treated with a remarkable laser technology that can halt the disease’s progress. The new procedure, called Endoscopic CycloPhotocoagulation (ECP), targets the fluid-producing structures of a patient’s eye to reduce the pressure that causes glaucomㅁ :-) 3

What is  .dll files ? 1) How do I know what .dll files I can delete during    \n   Registry Clean/Fix ?\n\n2) What is the main purpose or function of these .dll   files ?. are they improtant ?\n\n3) are .dll files important executiable files for any software ? DLL stands for Dynamic Link Library, and yes, they are important.  Most (not all, but most) software distributes common functions in DLL.  For example, if I was writing two different programs that dealt with widgets, I might put all the common Widget code in a DLL and share it between the two programs.  The fact that you sometimes really don't know what dll goes with what program is why the Java and .Net platforms are catching on so well, they don't dump all there dlls in the same place and confuse issues.  Normally, uninstalling a program will remove the dlls it put in.  If you don't know where the dll came from, I wouldn't delete it. 5
answer this riddle? A RIDDLE THAT'LL  KILL YOUR BRAIN! \n\nThis is going to make you so MAD! There are three words in the English language that end in "gry". ONE is angry and the other is hungry. EveryONE knows what the third ONE means and what it stands for. EveryONE uses them everyday, and if you listened very carefully, I've given you the third word. What is it? _______gry? Send this to 5 People and the answer will pop up on the screen automatically. From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nGry is also an obsolete unit of measurement, equal to 1/10 of a line, which is in turn 1/12 of an inch. Hence, a gry is 1/120 inch or about 0.212 mm. \nThe -Gry Puzzle is a popular puzzle that asks for the third English word, other than "angry" and "hungry," that ends with the letters "gry." Aside from words derived from "angry" and "hungry," there is no stand-alone word ending in "gry" that is in current usage. Both Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged (Merriam-Webster, Inc., 2002, ISBN 0877792011) and the Oxford English Dictionary, Second Edition (Oxford University Press, 1989, ISBN 0198611862) contain the phrase "aggry bead." To find a third word ending in "gry" that is not part of a phrase, you must turn to obsolete words or personal or place names. A list of 130 of these is given at the end of this article.\n\nSo, basically, this puzzle has no good answer. Yet it has become the most frequently asked word puzzle. It is so common that it is a standing joke [1] on the Stumpers reference librarian list server [2] that it's time to change your car's oil when it is asked anew. The regular readers of the Usenet newsgroup rec.puzzles [3] coined the word "nugry" [4] to describe a (presumably) new reader who posts a frequently asked question. 8

Why do some christians think it is okay to believe in Evolution, when it is against christianity.?  The reason I've usually heard is something to the effect of "Evolution is *how* God created life". Usually, though, it's not enough to say that God set evolution off and left it to its own thing, a more common belief seems to be "guided evolution", which is essentially evolution with all the hard bits done by God. In either of these interpretations, God has to nip down at some point, and zap a soul into humans.\n\nI find these ideas a little strange, myself. It's essentially saying "Yes, I can see all this scientific evidence for evolution is very compelling, but it can't be right because it needs God in it somewhere", which seems a very backwards way to conclude things. 1

Why Information is not a basic dimensional concept in Physics in the same way Space,Time and Mass are ?  Of course information is an important basic concept in physics. I do not understand what you even mean with this question. \n\nFor example, the restrictions that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light only refer to INFORMATION TRANSFER. \n\nThere is a huge field of quantum information theory in physics that is very active. \n\nIf you want to do dimensional analysis, as one does with other dimensional units (essentially using group theoretic principles in studying a problem), I am sure you can devise a scheme using "bits" or some other units of information and do dimensional analysis (for example, one might consider nats, shannons or hartleys; see reference below) 2

What is hacker ? What is hacker ? The negative usage of hacker is one who exploits systems or gains unauthorized access through clever tactics and detailed knowledge, that is, through the use of a hack. However, because most hacks do not exploit systems or gain unauthorized access, most people who have enough technical skill to produce clever hacks consider the use of the word hacker in this sense to be bigotry. Malicious hackers in this sense are often called black hat hackers, but it is more appropriate to call them crackers as this is a term which distinguishes the exploitation of security weaknesses from hacking in general. The opposite term of black hat hackers, White hat, are those who attempt to break into systems or networks in order to help the owners of the system by making them aware of security flaws, or to perform some other altruistic activity. Other hackers often viewed negatively include phreakers and software crackers. 5
treatment of decubiti at home?  Prevention consists of a position change every two hours or more often if needed. Treatment also involves keeping the area clean, promoting tissue regeneration and removing necrotic (dead) tissue, which can form a breeding ground for infection. Antibiotics can also be taken, but deep wounds may require surgical removal or debridement of dead tissue.  Devices can also be used to prevent decubiti. The devices available include foam padding, sheep-skin like padding for wheelchairs, air mattresses, silicon gel pads, sponge rubber mattresses (egg crate), and very specialized flotation beds to name a few. 3

How do I reimage my PC? Does reimage just refer to redoing the hard drive?  Is there anything I need to do special? Reimaging refers to restoring an image to your pc harddrive.  The image would be of the harddrive in some factory state.  If you have the "Restore" discs that came with your computer (if you have a computer that came with restore discs) then you would just use those.\n\nIf you don't have a computer like that, then you are talking about formatting the harddrive and reinstalling the operating system on it. (Windows probably)\n\nThe original factory Windows XP CD is bootable meaning your computer can boot off it and start the windows xp installation. 5

What are the differences between snow showers, freezing rain, sleet, and flurries? How are these different:\n\nsnow showers, freezing rain, sleet, and flurries Snow Shower - A short duration of light to moderate snowfall. Accumulations of snow are possible.\n\nFreezing Rain - Rain that falls in liquid form and then freezes upon impact with the ground or an item with a temperature of 32 degrees Fahrenheit or less, possibly producing a thin coating of ice. Even in small amounts, freezing rain can cause traveling problems. Large amounts can pull down power lines and tree branches.\n\nSleet - Precipitation consisting of transparent pellets of ice, 5 millimeters or less in diameter. Also called ice pellets. Forms when snow enters a warm layer of air above the surface and melts and then enters a deep layer of sub freezing air on the surface and refreezes.\n\nSnow Flurries - Intermittent snowfall of short duration. No measurable accumulation of snow occurs.\n\nYour HW i guess? ;) 2

why don't all professors have online textbooks? i've had a couple who have and it is awesome!!! no wasting hundreds of dollars on books. why can't all profs do that? I'd love to but there aren't a huge number of them that are legally available.  Also, not all students like them, especially those who want to carry a book around to study when they can.  I agree with you that textbooks are extremely expensive, as I am the aunt of two college students as well as a college instructor myself.\n\nI make an effort to choose the best balance between quality and affordability when assigning a textbook for a class.  I suggest you write a letter to the editor of your school's newspaper encouraging professors to think about this issue. 4

What evidence is there to show that the universe is a open system, if it is? I have heard from most that the universe is considered a closed system. "open" and "closed" systems usually refer to the exchange of something, usually energy or matter, between a system and its external environment.\n\nfor example, some hot liquid in a tightly-closed thermos bottle could be considered a closed system since it (approximately) cannot exchange matter or thermal energy with the outside world.\n\nit all depends on how you define "universe".  if you define it to mean absolutely everything that exists, then it's reasonable to treat it as a closed system, since there is nothing else for it to exchange something with!\n\nif you define the universe as "the stuff we can see" then it's possible that there is something Way Out There that nobody's detected and that is interacting with the visible universe.\n\none bit of evidence for this might be the expansion of the universe, which is measured via the Doppler red-shift of various galaxies around us.  according to general relativity and the details of the big bang theory, the universe (defined as above - that which we can see) should be expanding at a much greater rate than it is, if it is a closed system.\n\nthere are several postulated explanations for this - one that has gained recent press is the theory of "dark matter" which, in its simplest sense, means "stuff we cannot see that is between us and what we can see".  to date there is no hard evidence for the existence of dark matter.\n\nanother possible explanation is that the universe - that which we can see - is not closed and is interacting with some external agent.  this is perfectly reasonable, as our telescopes have practical limitations and cannot see off into eternity.  so, this does not constitute hard evidence for an "open system" model of the universe, but it remains an open question. 2

The characteristic symptoms are a rash and a 'strawberry tongue'. The disease is treated with antibiotics and it is usually resolved without complications.\n\nA person can become infected with streptococcus either by touching or through airborne droplets.

what is the oxidation number for KMnO4?  Group I elements almost always have an oxidation number of +1, so the K (potassium) has a +1.  Unless they're in peroxide compounds, which is not the case here, oxygen usually has an oxidation number of -2.  The hardest one is the Mn.  We know that the whole compound has to have an oxidation number of 0, so let's do some math.  There is one +1, and there are 4 oxygens, each with -2.  \n+1 + ? + 4*(-2)=0\nThe answer is +7.  Therefore, Mn must have an oxidation number of +7. \nK=+1, Mn=+7, O=-2 2
what is a rootkit?  A rootkit is a set of software tools frequently used by a third party (usually an intruder) after gaining access to a computer system. These tools are intended to conceal running processes, files or system data, which helps an intruder maintain access to a system without the user's knowledge. Rootkits are known to exist for a variety of operating systems such as Linux, Solaris and versions of Microsoft Windows. A computer with a rootkit on it is called a rooted computer. 5

what is hydracell?  I'm assuming you have mis-spelled your question for the term "hydrocele".  The dictionary defines it as: \n\nA pathological accumulation of serous fluid in a bodily cavity, especially in the scrotal pouch.  \n\nIn other words, its a type of bubble that is full of fluid.  It usually happens in the scrotum.  I work in the operating room, and have actually seen several of these and they range in different sizes and severity.  Having a hydrocele removed is a very simple procedure.\n\nYou can check Web MD for more information, but be sure to spell hydrocele correctly to get accurate information. 3
Is anyone else disgusted by ESPN's obsessive coverage of the Tocchet gambling story? The same network that dumped the NHL from its schedule and has just about ignored hockey since its triumphant return from last season's lockout is now falling all over itself to cast the league in the ugliest light possible by giving saturation coverage to this overblown gambling story. How utterly transparent and despicable ESPN's actions are. We need a viable alternative to their little tyranny over sports television and I'm hoping OLN continues to blossom and grow with the NHL as its flagship. ESPN sucks! I hate this story. Who cares? It's not like they did anything wrong anyway, excpet for skipping out on taxes, but really, they make millions of dollars every year, so they pay taxes on that money. I want to see something about the Olympics or the race for top 8 spots in the Western Conference, or ANYTHING except this story. From what I hear Canadian television is only doing minimal coverage on it. I think I'll move. 6

I am doing a study for bible study and I want to know how do Leviathan and King Triton connected? I was studying out different things and I was informed that another name for the demon Leviathan is Triton.  Among some other similarities.  I was thinking about the obvious Triton that we all know and it struck a cord with me.  It is quite similar but it is hard to find a direct tie between Leviathan and King Trion in one writing.  Disney is disney and there aren't too many other writings on the actual history of how this character was created. Actually Triton was a "lesser" greek God.\n\nHe is a sea God and I'm sure that is the connection in Disney's movie (which was actually an adaptation of a Hans Christian Anderson story. Hans is the one who first used Triton.) 4

The mother is 21 years older than the child.? In 6 years from now, the mother will be 5 times as old as the child. \n\nQuestion: Where's the father? Well, the only time a mother will be five times as old as a child about 21 years younger is when the mother is about 25, and the child is about 5. Subtract 6 from that, and.. hey, the child is -1 year old! Or, approximately.\n\nWhich leads me to figure that, while we can't quite be sure where the father is, we do know that the mother's there too.

my daughter is going to marry a man who touched her 11yrs.old daughter........? my daughter tina is 31yrs.old and is going to marry a man who touched her daughter in the wrong place tina's daughter is only 11yrs.old this guy has admited touching this child but tina has forgiven this guy and will be marrying him this friday how can I look him in the eye and be happy about this marriage when all I want to do is ---- him up what is wrong with tina?? this wedding is wrong for and her child more so. HELP ME PEOPLE?????? That must be a tough dilemma to be in.\nIf your goal is to prevent the wedding, that's easy: just involve some authority in it. The price to pay is probably your relationship with your daughter, plus some time of dealing with the authorities and stuff. That in the case that there's diligence.\nOr you could just let her get married and not go to the wedding. That'll cost you also.\nOr you could just let her live her life and choose what will make her happy even if it damages her, but have a talk with your granddaughter to let you know if anything like that ever happens. Then you can deal with it at that future occassion. That way you keep good relations with them, which are necessary for them to let you prevent future issues like this.\nIf you break up with your daughter, her life will go on without the possibility of you being a part of it. You might not want that.\nYou might want to get some input from a family counselor or something. 7
do you believe that dissent is patriotic?  Dissent is what this country was founded on. 'No taxation without representation' ring a bell to anyone?? Dissent led to the formation of our country. Our forefathers welcomed dissent to make sure all people's ideas had been taken into consideration. Why is it now that we as a nation look at people who dissent as the enemy? If you don't speak up, you're just like a lamb being led to the slaughter. No one spoke up against Hitler (at least not publicly or loudly) until it was too late and then looked what happened! 10

What is Carborundum? Is it the hardest material on earth?  No, Diamond is the hardest material on earth, and carborundum is a diamond stimulant (tries to simulate the appearance of diamond).\n\nIn fact, diamond is three times harder than carborundum.\n\nCarborundum, a trademark name for Silicon carbide manufactured as an abrasive, is a ceramic compound of silicon and carbon (also known as moissanite).\n\n"Most silicon carbide is man-made for use as an abrasive (when it is often known by the trademark carborundum), or more recently as a semiconductor and moissanite gemstones. The simplest manufacturing process is to combine sand and carbon at a high temperature, between 1600 °C and 2500 °C." 2

how should one control his anger?  Walk out of the situation before the anger takes control of you. Like 'babygirl' said, it will give you time to cool down & think through the situation sensibly instead of causing harm, whether physically or verbally, to the other in a fit of rage.\n\nThat's what I do, just walk out on the person or just don't talk. I am known for a vicious temper & that's how I deal with it. :) 3

How can i test if my boyfriend is cheating on me? I have a boyfriend and i really love him and he loves me but for the past week, i have been trying to call him and he hasnt answered my calls. I dont want to believe that hes cheating on me with another girl because it is so devastating for me, but he isnt really the cheating type. I've left him messages on his phone and i refuse to call his house because of his dad(scary guy). I am concerned that maybe something happened to him or maybe he lost his phone or he is grounded. What can i do? how can i test if he is cheating on me? is there a way to test my theory? he doesnt go to my school but he is the same age. He hasnt returned any call for 1 week! wats goin on? If you are that concerned, you should just call even if his Dad is scary.  You aren't going to be satisfied until you find out whats going on...so just do it...or have a friend call.  If you truly believe he is cheating, than you should probably just count your blessings and move forward.  Sometimes people ask questions but, they really don't want to hear the answer. DON'T LOOK FOR ANSWERS YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR...SAVE YOURSELF THE HEARTACHE AND BE THANKFUL HE JUST MOVED ON.  GOOD LUCK AND ALWAYS BE TRUE TO YOURSELF FIRST, THEN YOU WILL BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHAT AFFECTS YOU AND WHAT DOESN'T. 9

i'm 28,Nigerian, i want to get married to a white woman from the western world, how can i meet a serious one? i'm 28,Nigerian, i want to get married to a white woman from the western world, how can i meet a serious one? \ni dont really understand this part, but i do know that i want to get married as soon as possible especially to a beautiful white girl. i am joshua, based in nigeria. i am an african. i just concluded my first degree from university of lagos. i was a member of aiesec in lagos, and i really understand what cultural interaction means. i have been participating in cultural interaction and now i want it in my marriage. THANKS i think setting out to specifically find a WHITE woman as a marriage partner is a mistake. Who is to say you wont find true love with an Asian woman, Hispanic woman or a Nigerian woman? Don't limit yourself like that! \nthat said, I shall step off my soap box. You can meet serious women through educational type things, such as a study abroad in another country. Perhaps, if you are considering pursuing a higher degree, you can do so in another country? 9

If someone is suffering physical and mental abuse from a partner, is it possible they come here to vent? on a stranger who displays similar traits? True life story, I was six years old in 1977, my mom took me to a circus in minn, as she got tikets I wandered off behind one of the tents. There were rows of open bar cages full of tigers for the show. There was a an awful racket, to my six year old dissmay, a trainer was wipping one of the cats w/ a bull whip through the bars. WHACK! The tiger was all cowered in the corner, whincing at every lash. Thoses are some of the childhood memories that stop abruptly, cause mom had me by the ear dragging me back to the ant lines of civilized life where such things should not be viewed by a child. The circus show was amazing! These animals would roll balls and jump through fire hoops stand on thier hindleggs and spin. All thing I'm sure every tiger does in the jungle when he's boared. There was that whip too, only it wasn't the same one, this one was show w/ chrome tassles and such. At the crack of the whip, one tiger leapt from his post and began YES I THINK SO BECAUSE HERE YOU CAN FIND THAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE THINGS GOING ON IN THERE LIVES AND SOMETIMES THEY CAN EXPRESS THERE FEELINGS HERE AND KNOW THAT THERE IS  SOMEONE OUT THERE THAT IS IN THERE SHOES 9
how do i create a rescue disk to get rid of the NYB virus?  Information about the NYB Virus\n\nSIZE: 512 bytes.\nINFECTS: Floppy Boot sectors and Master Boot Records.\nWHAT IT DOES: Simple virus which infects diskettes and Master Boot records. After infected, each time booting up the computer, it will then load into high memory. Once in high memory, the virus will then have the capability of infecting all non-write protected diskettes used in the computer. Once the diskette is infected there is a 1/512 chance that the the virus activates. When activated, the virus will attempt to access a location on the floppy drive that does not exist, possibly causing physical damage to the floppy drive. Generally, this only occurs on older floppy disk drives.\n\nMETHODS OF CLEANING VIRUS: It is recommended that all viruses be cleaned utilizing a Virus Protection program. However, an alternate method of cleaning the virus is booting from a clean write protected boot diskette with fdisk.exe on it. Boot from the diskette and once at the A:&#92;> type FDISK /MBR\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION: The FDISK /MBR command, by default, is a non-destructive command. It is not recommended you run this command if you have one of the following:\n\nAny type of advanced security program.\nBoot manager such as partition magic.\nYou believe your computer is infected with the Monkey B virus. If infected with the Monkey B virus, it is a possibility that the hard disk drive information could be lost. 5
how long can a severed finger be stored in ice before it is reattached surgically?  It depends on a lot of factors. As long as the fingure is stored correctly and the tissue does not die, the finger can be reattached. A safe guess would be at least an hour if iced as soon as it is severed and stored correctly. I'm sure there are instances when it can be stored for a several hours, if not longer. 3

What is the difference in Goju Ryu, Goju Shorei and Goju Ryu Shorei Karate?  Goju-Ryu\n\nGoju-ryu was founded in the 1930's by Miyagi Chojun from Okinawan karate and Chinese Kempo techniques. It is combination of hard "go" and soft "ju" techniques that work together similar to yin and yang. Linear motion is combined with circular movements. Patterns are practiced slowly with emphasis on breathing.\n\nShorei-Ryu\n\nShorei-ryu is an Okinawan hard style. Known for its heavy, powerful techniques, body toughening training, and its numerous stances.  It is more suitable for a person of heavy body structure. It strives to emulate the actions of the 5 traditional animals and teaches all the traditional Okinawan weapons, such as the bo, tonfa, and sai. Some characteristics of Shorei-ryu are:\n\n    *\n\n      Stances exceptionally low in kata form.\n    *\n\n      Seiken thrust: is slightly downward and in center of body. The rear leg moves slightly forward at the completion of the punch. The moving of the rear leg is automatic and is caused by the power generated by the force of the punch and the forward movement of the hips.\n    *\n\n      Fist: index finger under curled thumb.\n    *\n\n      Hips: rotate with a definite forward movement.\n    *\n\n      Blocks: all start spiraling at wrists and spiral until completion of block.\n    *\n\n      Head snap when turning.\n    *\n\n      Thousand hand, five and six-count rice exercises, and sun fist.\n    *\n\n      High rising block, executed from thigh up.\n    *\n\n      Teeth clenched.\n    *\n\n      Wide-eyed stare.\n    *\n\n      Eight faces: the art of looking or expression (hyojo do): Confidence, Friendly, Solemn, Unconcerned, Contempt, Shock, Fear, and Anger.\n    *\n\n      All kicks, blocks, and strikes are 90% circular.\n    *\n\n      Kicks: for every forward one there is a reverse one. \n    *\n\n      Te-katana and te-uke covers are very obvious in all Shuri-ryu techniques and katas.\n    * Body: always relaxed until exact moment of completing technique. 6
Do T-cells reproduce after being attacked by diseases such as AID or weaker ones?  The T cells that are "relevant", meaning the ones that are adapted to take care of the certain antigen (yes, there are leukocytes in our body that are adapted to take care of HIV viruses, but they die before they can hold the desease back), do reproduce as a result of the exposure to the antigen. But, as I said, don't "get there in time" to prevent the infection and thus cannot avoid AIDS.\n\nShortly - the answer is yes :). 2

How do i file a lien in california (san diego)?  I'm trying to recover about $15k that I lent to a friend.  You would have to get a court order granting you a lien. San Diego County limits small claims to $7,500 for "natural" persons (i.e. individuals, not companies). You could forfeit your right to anything more than $7,500 and sue your friend there. Otherwise, you would have to file suit in Civil Court. Information on both processes is at the sites below. 10
what do when you cam't get a job? so you can move out of your grandmas house?  HA! How old are you again?! Honestly, I wouldn't discontinue job searching. File for unemployement if need be while in the meanwhile you can still search. Are there any talents/skills/trade that you have that can make you some extra change?? I agree with changing environments, too. Sometimes a change of venue & establishing a strong network can help you get a job. Don't forget tax time is right around the corner. Maybe someone can file you as a dependent--Or you can file? \n\nWhen job searching you can't be too pickey either when you don't have anything. Try temp agencies, networking, internet, word of mouths, etc. There's a lot you can do to find a job. Don't have too much pride where even working at fast food isn't enough. It's not cute or sexy being picky, broke, & homeless. I suggest finding something out there & save up. Good Luck! 9

If you are at the north or south pole where does the sun rise?  This question has been adequately answered, but it is a trick question in that every direction at the north pole is south (you can't walk east, west, or north of the north pole), and every direction at the south pole is north. You could, however take one step south, turn and walk east, but you would have to walk in a little circle to maintain your easterly direction. Weird, huh? 2
WHY DO SOME MEN HAVE ELECTRICITY IN THE BODY??  All animals have a charged neuromuscular system. Thatis what allows for normal contractions of your bodies muscles.

what are foods that will \nhelp with my \nconstipation? I don't get bowel movements every day, more like every 3-4 days.I know that fiber will help me.I don't want to rely on them fiber drinks.I am going to stop eating out.I am not over weight.What are some foods that will help me? Try gentle exercise. Take a short walk each day. Gradually increase your walking time until you are walking for at least 20 minutes. \nMake sure you drink enough fluids. Most adults should try to drink between 8 and 10 glasses of water, noncaffeinated beverages, or fruit juice each day. Avoid alcoholic beverages and caffeine, which can increase dehydration. If you have heart failure or kidney failure, talk to your health professional about what amount of fluid is right for you. \nInclude fruits, vegetables, and fiber in your diet each day. Have a bran muffin or bran cereal for breakfast, and try eating a piece of fruit for a mid-afternoon snack. \nSchedule time each day for a bowel movement (after breakfast, for example). Establishing a daily routine may help. Take your time. Don't be in a hurry. \nIf you are still constipated: \nAdd some processed or synthetic fiber—such as Citrucel, Metamucil, or Perdiem—to your diet each day. \nTry a stool softener, such as Colace, if your stools are very hard. \nIf constipation persists, add a saline laxative, such as Fleet Phospho-Soda or Milk of Magnesia. You should not take these types of laxatives if you are on a sodium-restricted diet or have kidney problems or high blood pressure. \nYou may occasionally need to try a stimulant laxative, such as Ex-Lax or Feen-a-Mint. Use these preparations sparingly. Regular use may interfere with your body's ability to absorb vitamin D and calcium, which can weaken your bones. \nOveruse of stimulant laxatives decreases the tone and sensation in the large intestine, causing dependence on laxatives. Do not use laxatives for longer than 2 weeks without consulting your health professional. \nSupport your feet with a small step stool [about 6 in. (15 cm)] when you sit on the toilet. This will help flex your hips and place your pelvis in a more normal "squatting" position for having a bowel movement. 3
is once saved always saved wrong??? MY RELIGION SAYS IT IS.. i'M CHURCH OF CHRIST.. AND I BELIEVE IT IS BUT IS IT DOES ANYONE HAVE BIBLE SCRIPTURE PROOF THAT IT IS OR ISN'T????? Hello sweet little child.. :)\n\nThis is lengthy so please forgive me ahead of time..here are quite alot of scriptures to support that we can lose our salvation..\n====================================================\n1. Fall from grace - Gal. 5:1-4,13 \n2. Be led away with error - 2 Pet. 3:17 \n3. Err from the truth - James 5:19-20 \n4. Weak brother may perish - 1 Cor. 8:11 \n5. Fall into condemnation - James 5:12 \n6. Be moved away from the hope - Col. 1:21-23 \n7. Deny the Lord who bought them - 2 Pet. 2:1 \n8. Depart from the living God - Heb. 3:12 \n9. Can be a castaway - 1 Cor. 9:27 \n10. Can become accursed children - 2 Pet. 2:14 \n\nWhat the scriptures say. \n\n1 Parable of sower \n\nMark 4:16 (Luke 8:13) "And in a similar way these are the ones on whom seed was sown on the rocky places, who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy; (they believe for a while) and they have no firm root in themselves, but are only temporary; then, when affliction or persecution arises because of the word, immediately they fall away. \n\n2 Fallen from grace passage: \n\nGalatians 5:4 "You have been severed from Christ, you who are seeking to be justified by law; you have fallen from grace." \n\n\n3 Pruning passages: \n\nJohn 15:5-6 "I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me, and I in him, he bears much fruit; for apart from Me you can do nothing. If anyone does not abide in Me, he is thrown away as a branch, and dries up; and they gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned." \n\nRomans 11:19-23 "You will say then, "Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in." Quite right, they were broken off for their unbelief, but you stand by your faith. Do not be conceited, but fear; for if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will He spare you. Behold then the kindness and severity of God; to those who fell, severity, but to you, God's kindness, if you continue in His kindness; otherwise you also will be cut off. And they also, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in; for God is able to graft them in again." \n\n4 Hebrews Passages: \n\nHebrews 6:4-6 For in the case of those who have once been enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come, and then have fallen away, it is impossible to renew them again to repentance, since they again crucify to themselves the Son of God, and put Him to open shame. \n\nHebrews 10:26-27 For if we go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, but a certain terrifying expectation of judgment, and the fury of a fire which will consume the adversaries." \n\nHebrews 10:38-39 "But My righteous one shall live by faith; And if he shrinks back, My soul has no pleasure in him. But we are not of those who shrink back to destruction, but of those who have faith to the preserving of the soul." \n\n5 Doctrinal Apostasy passages: \n\nActs 20:17,28-30 "And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called to him the elders of the church." ... "I know that after my departure savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock; and from among your own selves men will arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them." \n\n1 Timothy 1:18-21 "fight the good fight, keeping faith and a good conscience, which some have rejected and suffered shipwreck in regard to their faith. Among these are HYMENAEUS and Alexander" \n\n2 Timothy 2:16-18 But avoid worldly and empty chatter, for it will lead to further ungodliness, and their talk will spread like gangrene. Among them are HYMENAEUS and Philetus, men who have gone astray from the truth saying that the resurrection has already taken place, and thus they upset the faith of some. \n\n1 Timothy 4:1 &quo 1
why does pubic hair grow to a certain length and then stop?  There are a lot of kinds of "hair". Each species of mammal has at least one kind of "hair" or fur. Many species have several different specialized types. For example, cat whiskers are very different from regular cat fur in texture and length. One of the main differences in hair is whether it is determinate in length (grows to a certain length and stops) or indeterminate in length (grows for as long as it is alive.) Humans have both kinds in different places on the body. Head hair, scalp and face, is indeterminate. Body hair, arms, underarms, legs, pubic area, fingers and toes is determinate. The only determinate hairs on the head are normal eyebrows, ear hair and nose hairs. I think the reason is obvious. "Wild hairs" are determinate hairs that have encountered a genetic failure. The length possibilities of each type of hair from sheep's wool to seal fur are genetically determined.  Pubic hair is a secondary sex characteristic that signals availability for mating. It is not designed to cover, conceal, protect, or warm the area that produces it. It may have some scent retaining or focusing function too. This is still debatable. I hope this helps. 2
Preparing a Solution? How many grams of CaCl2 are needed to prepare 147.5 mL of a 1.270 M solution?  Please explain your answer so I can learn :D.  Thanks! 1 mole (also represented as mol)= 6.022x10^23.  This is just a number.  Molecules are represented in mol quantities because they're too small to work with otherwise.  So that when you are dealing with CaCl2 in these problems, you're actually using 6.022x10^23 molecules of CaCl2.  Additionally, when you see the molecular weight of a molecule, that is actually the weight of 1mol of that molecule.\n1M= 1mol/Litre.  You need 1.27M.  Divide 1.27 by 1,000 to find the number of mol CaCl2 per mL you need.  (1.27/1,000=0.00127mol CaCl2/mL)\nMultiply this by 147.5 to get the number of mol CaCl2 you will have.  (0.00127*147.5= 0.187325mol CaCl2)\nNow multiply this number by the molecular weight of CaCl2 to get your answer!  (0.187325*110.984= 20.79g CaCl2) 2
The 26th riddle.? There is a common English word that is nine letters long. Each time you remove a letter from it, it still remains an English word - from nine letters right down to a single letter. What is the original word, and what are the words that it becomes after removing one letter at a time? The word you are looking for is Startling.\nStarting, staring, string, sting, sing, sin, in, I are the words obtained by removing the letters one by one. 8

Matthew15/24, Jesus says he's only here for the lost sheep of Israel. So why do you try to convert non-jews?  Jesus was talking about His ministry while here on earth! The messiah was promised to the people of Israel and they alone were expecting Him. \nLater on Jesus told His disciples(who were all Jews by the way) to go into ALL the earth and preach the Gospel to ALL Nations. \n\nMatthew 28, 18-20 1

DO YOU THINK THAT JESUS WAS REALLY MARRIED TO MAGDALENE?  Why is everyone saying "It's just a fictional book"?? The speculation that Jesus was married to Magdalene has been around a lot longer than Dan Brown. He wasn't the one to create the idea. \n\nAccepted Christian sources (i.e. the Bible) don't suggest one way or the other. I suspect that he was married. But whether he was or wasn't doesn't seem real important compared to everything else about him and what he did and continues to do. \n\nP.S. Jesus was a party animal? Where did you get that from? It's hard enough to prove the authenticity of much of the bible, so whatever your source, good luck backing it up. The whole whipping sequence in the Temple is a different matter. That is called the wrath of God--something we often like to forget since the unconditional love of God is what we like to think God is all about. 1

How do I get rid of a virus that got past Norton Antivirus Security? Help, PLEASE!? This virus just popped up on my puter. It got past Norton Anti Virus Security System. Help!!! There are one of two things for you and I dearly hope that you didn't pay for that copy of Norton.  The first thing is uninstall Norton, it is the worst anti-virus application on the market, you will probably have to restart.  Then download and install AVG Free made by Grisoft, http://free.grisoft.com/ which is a free anti-virus program and you will get free program updates as well.  Once that is installed run its scanner to remove the virus.\n\nOr, you can download AVG Free without uninstalling Norton but having two anti-virus solutions on your PC is never a good idea as they may interfere with each other.\n\nFor a Firewall (always have your PC behind a router) but for a software solution I like the Kerio Personal Firewall, http://www.snapfiles.com/get/keriofirewall.html/\n\nFor spyware protection get all of the following:\n\nAdaware SE Personal, http://www.lavasoft.com/\nMS Antispyware Beta, http://www.microsoft.com/athome/security/spyware/software/default.mspx\nSpybot S&D, http://www.safer-networking.com/\nSpywareBlaster, http://www.javacoolsoftware.com/\n\nWell, just go ahead and download AVG and run it instead.  Norton should be in the Add/Remove programs list in the Control Panel, if it isn't check it's entry in the Start Menu under All Programs and see if Norton provided an uninstaller, there has to be a way to get rid of it.  If you still can't remove it download, CCleaner, http://www.ccleaner.com/ and see if it has an option to remove Norton under its "Tools" section.\n\nIf you STILL can't remove it, just go ahead and download AVG.  But prevent Norton from starting up by going to Start > Run typing in msconfig and uncheck anything related to Norton, if you can't identify it, type the item names into Google to identify them, the first or second search result will be from a process library telling you what the entry is. 5
What exactly means to be an agnostic ??? does it mean that sometimes you believe in the existence of a god...? does it mean that sometimes you believe in the existence of a god and sometimes you don’t? Agnosticism is a doubt that there is enough evidence to prove the existence of god one way or the other.  There are both atheistic and theistic agnostics.  The atheistic agnostics believe there is no conclusive evidence, but lean towards atheist conclusions; theistic agnostics also do not think there is conclusive evidence, but lean towards there being a god, just an unknowable one.  A common criticism of agnosticism in general is that by avoiding a choice, you are still choosing, in effect choosing atheism. 1

i am 50 yrs. old, male.  am i old?  when i was 6 i thought the perfect age was 10 becasue it was half way to 20 and 20 was old.  yeah 50 is getting close to old,  but some 50 year olds are old , by that i mean they act old, sit around all day and talk aobut what hurts and other 50 year olds arent old because they act like they stil enjoy life and do things.  so its up to you,  the good things about being 50 is that your old enough to have tried that and done that and know its not for you, you should have learned some things in your first 50 years so hopefully you are wise and not a 50 year old fool.  don't get a new tattoo or pierce your belly buttton or anythign to try to act 20 that will make you look like a 50 year old who is trying ot act like they are a teenager and everybody will laugh at you behind your back,  act and be your age gracefully Ok. 3

What are Proxy server. How it works.?  A proxy server is a computer network service that allows clients to make indirect network connections to other network services. A client connects to the proxy server, then requests a connection, file, or other resource available on a different server. The proxy provides the resource either by connecting to the specified server or by serving it from a cache. In some cases, the proxy may alter the client's request or the server's response for various purposes. A proxy server can also serve as a firewall.\n\nA proxy server receives a request for an Internet service (such as a Web page request) from a user. If it passes filtering requirements, the proxy server, assuming it is also a cache server, looks in its local cache of previously downloaded Web pages. If it finds the page, it returns it to the user without needing to forward the request to the Internet. If the page is not in the cache, the proxy server, acting as a client on behalf of the user, uses one of its own IP addresses to request the page from the server out on the Internet. When the page is returned, the proxy server relates it to the original request and forwards it on to the user.\n\nTo the user, the proxy server is invisible; all Internet requests and returned responses appear to be directly with the addressed Internet server. (The proxy is not quite invisible; its IP address has to be specified as a configuration option to the browser or other protocol program.) \n\nYou can see more detailed explainations at the following sites:\n\nhttp://www.stayinvisible.com/index.pl/proxy_servers_faq\nhttp://www.winthrop.edu/dacus/WAM/proxy_notes.html 5
What is so exciting about Intel Yonah?  Unlike Pentium D, which is based on Intel's Pentium 4 desktop processor, Yonah is based on their mobile archtecture, Pentium M, but provides dual core in a mobile package.  As a result, for laptops, as well as servers where power consumption is an issue (which is nearly all servers) Yonah offers significant performance benefits.  See the anandtech story, as well as others referencing it. 5

What do you think about Iran? I want to know what do others think about my country... Let me begin by saying that my wife's cousin married an Iranian so I have nothing against anybody on an individual basis.  However, I take issue w/ the Iranian people for electing a rhetoric spewing, inflaming anti-semite for "President".  \n\nFurthermore, I cannot understand how the government of a country rich in petroleum oil would want to develop nuclear energy for "peaceful means" after announcing to the world that Israel should be "wiped off the map"?  This theocratic government w/ absolute power over its people needs to be "wiped off" from rule and its citizens re-educated on how to properly co-exist w/ the rest of the world in harmony. 10

why english spelling is different than speaking? writing-raiting\nnose-nous\nscience-sains\nwhy? Because of the long and complicated influence from other languages as well as language 'evolution'. English is a germanic language. In 1066, Then french invaded england and we have a huge romance language influence from that. Then we have arabic words, indian words, it goes on and on. Plus some 'olde englishe' words were pronounce differently.  For instance I believe knight didn't have a silent 'k' originally. There have been many other vowel shifts and consonant additions/deletions that leave us with the mess we have today 7
how do i say sorry? my boyfriend was talking to my sister and found out i tried to slit my wrists once. i didnt want to talk about it so i keep just saying ''just drop it'' so he got pissed and hung up. now i dont know where he is. i tried to tell him why i did what i did and why i stopped. i stopped cause of him. but i dont how to say that or apologize. any suggestions? First of all, get some counseling to help you deal with your problems. Why did he have to know right then? Why couldn't he respect the fact that you didn't want to talk about it? You should have the right not to talk about what you don't want to. If he hasn't contacted you again because you wouldn't talk about this, does he really care about you? I'm just saying this because what he did was NOT YOUR FAULT! Perhaps you could have asked to talk about it later, but that didn't happen.\n\nLet's say you find him and still want to apologize...you could simply say, "I'm sorry for hurting your feelings by not talking to you about the problem. I was uncomfortable at the time. I needed some space. I am ready to talk about it now." (Assuming you actually do want to talk about it.) Tell him that sometimes you need time to think. If he can't respect that you deserve better!\n\nAnd, again, get some help from a doctor if you feel like hurting yourself again, please! 9

How can I be less shy about singing? I sing a lot when I'm by myself even though I'm a pretty bad singer. However, when anybody is with me (Even my parents) I find it really scary to sing in front of them. The reason I want help is because my friends and I are starting a band. you feel that way maybe because you are not completly confident on how good you are a singing. evaluate yourself, if you think you sing pretty good, you dont have to be shy at all, so if everybody tells you that you sing very good, that's all you need to throw that shyness away and forget about it. 8

It was in high school and I think it was a heat transfer experiment using bimetallic strips to generate motion but I can't remember what the device was called or the materials used.  If anyone knows the device name or materials used I would appreciate the info. thank you. A radiometer does what you describe. \n\nhttp://store.sundancesolar.com/solrad.html\n\n\nDirections to build a simple radiometer:\n\nMake a radiometer to measure solar energy. Colour the paper side of a gum wrapper black and cut in four pieces. Stick the pieces to each side of a match stick with the shiny sides all facing the same way. Wrap a thread around a pencil and attach to the match stick. Suspend in the jar and place in a sunny location. The radiometer will turn as it absorbs energy. 2

is god real?  Yes ofcourse,as a muslim i believe in God,only one God.                                                 Quran says:[It is God who raised the skies without support,as you can see,then he established himself on throne(of authority),and enthralled the sun and the moon(so that)each run to a predetermined course.He disposes all affairs,distinctly explaining every sign that you may be certain of the meeting with your Lord](13:2)\n        the nature and the universe will provide the proof of existence of God,if you observe them.there are open signs of existence of God for man in the nature,if he wants to understand. Allah(God) says in Quran: [And a sign for them is the night:we withdraw therefrom the day,and behold they are plunged in darkness;and the sun runs his course for a period determined for him:That is the decree of (Him),the Exalted in Might,the All-knowing.And the moon,we have measured for her mansions(to traverse)till she return like the old(and withered)lower part of a date-stalk.It is not permitted to the sun to catch up the moon,nor can the night outstrip the day:each (just)swims along in(its own)orbit(according to law)](36:37-40)                                                  AND YES THERE IS ONLY ONE GOD,the absolute creator of the universe,its components and its laws.He is the beginning and the end of all things. Allah(God) says in Quran: [Proclaim,He is the one and only God. The Absolute God.Never did he beget.Nor was he begotten.Non equals him.](112:1-4)                                                  \n   nothing seems impossible in this scientific age,but still no one is able to creat even a small fly(and give him a life) So there is a God who created us and all the universe. Nature has all the answers of our questions so observe it and think on it. all the systems of the universe and this world are in great order and are well managed,it indicates that it is managed by one God.we know the every two persons have diff opinions and natures,there are sometimes similarities but they are not exactly like each other(even twins differs 4rm each other) if a same work is given to two persons,they will do it in their own way.similarly if there were more than one God,the universe might have been destroyed.as each of them would hav tried to run the universe according to his rules and will.I HOPE U UNDERSTAND WHAT I MEANS TO SAY.(sorry 4 grammatic mistakes,if any) 1

was our original ancester monkeies?  No Darwinist who understands evolution would ever say that humans evolved from monkeys.  The answer in evolution is that monkeys and humans share a common ancestor.\n\nSHARE A COMMON ANCESTOR\n\nRepeat that prase a few dozen times until you finally wrap your head around the fact that only creationists and idiotic atheists who don't understand evolution (but have an agenda against God) would ever say that the theory of evolution teaches man descended from monkeys.\n\nEvolution holds that all life is related.  Hence, you also have a common ancestor shared with the house cat or with the frog, but your common ancestry is more closely shared with the monkey than the cat, and more with the cat than the frog.\n\nPlease check the following link.  Please.  It's not about evolution. 2

My bn commander and sgt mjr bought t-shirts with government money, than sold them to soldiers, what can i do? They sold them to soldiers that were pressured into buying them too.  No one want so bring it up because if they do then they will be "trouble makers" or "negative individuals".   My upper level chain of command are bad people. If this is the only bad thing they have done I would just let it slide. If your leadership is routinely making poor decisions you can contact the the Brig CO or CSM (anonomously if you prefer). If Brigade does nothing then you can take it up to Division. I'm just an ROTC cadet and I don't really know whats going on in your Unit but that is the standard precedure for taking action. I would first contact your platoon or company leadership and address the problem to your superiors. A CO or senior NCO can't fix what they don't know about.\n\nBeing an ROTC cadet I don't have a lot of real world experience. I only answered your question because I am almost 100% sure no one else would have. This is why I would recommend talking with someone in your unit who has had a lot of time in the service. See a Platoon Sergeant or the First Sergeant for some feedback, their job as NCOs is to take care of their soldiers. 10

If a rabbit wanted to know if a wolf would eat him, should he ask a wolf for advice? Food for thought. If you have a question about something, do you go to the source that is 'in question'? Would you seek out many sources for the truth? or stick to one source? I need reasons. Most of my questions are for surveys and research. I would cautiosly ask the wolf and then immediately start going to other sources to ask also. Never trust just one source especially the people in pulpits for that is where most wolves are found. Whenever I want to study out a particular issue, I try to prove my beliefs wrong. Most people look fot the answers that they want to hear and in doing such will never find the truth if they are wrong. You must be willing to hear other opinions and know that there is a possibility that you may need to change your belief on the topic your searching. 1

Why is Pat Robertson such a KOOK??? Is this guy for real and do people really listen to this freak? I think we should all get down on our knees and thank God we live in a nation that looks at someone like Pat Robertson and mostly laughs.  There are people who are buying into the nonesense he spews, but then again they're the same people that buy every snake-oil product advertised on TV.\n\nI don't know if he's for real, but he is out there with a national forum on cable TV.  That makes him really no different than the Bill O'Reillys and Tucker Carlsons of the world.  \n\nThe thing that surprises me the most about Reverend Looney Tunes is that the Conservative Christian lobby isn't running in the opposite direction from him, screaming "He doesn't speak for us!"  I don't think it'll take too many more of those "God has punished"-type diatribes before people start associating him with them.  And that's when the Republicans will find themselves in deep water without oars OR a boat.\n\nMeanwhile, I wait in anticipation for the next time Robertson logs off what he must think is his personal IM with the Almighty and gives us The World According To Pat.  Just remember--not everyone who say they're holy get into Heaven. 1
what distance is needed by a car to stop if her spee3d is 60 km/h?  Depends on the rate of deceleration of the vehicle (as well as surface characteristics).  However a rule of thumb they teach in driver's education is one car length for every ten mph of speed.  So at 36 mph/60 kph, that would be about 4 car lengths, or about 20 meters (unless you drive a mini). 6

What Is A Quigi Board and How Do You Use It?  Ouija (pronounced wee-juh or wee-jee) refers to the belief that one can receive messages during a séance by the use of a Ouija board (also called a talking board or spirit board) and planchette. The fingers of the participants are placed on the planchette which then moves about a board covered with numbers, letters and symbols so as to spell out messages.\n\nOuija is a trademark for a talking board currently sold by Parker Brothers. While the word is not a genericized trademark, it has become a trademark which is often used generically to refer to any talking board.\n\nA Ouija board is operated by one or more users. They place the planchette on the board and then rest their fingers on the planchette. The users start moving the planchette around the board and speaking to the entity (or entities) they wish to summon; They then begin asking questions of it. Eventually the planchette will come to rest on one letter after another, spelling out a message. Often an additional participant records the messages on paper. As with automatic writing, the messages are often vague and open to interpretation, or complete gibberish.\n\nSome talking boards have words or phrases written on them to simplify the interpretation of the messages. Tarot, zodiac, and other esoteric symbols are frequently incorporated into talking board's design, along with dramatic and mystical artwork. Some users prefer to improvise their own Ouija board. They may use a sheet of paper with the alphabet written on it or lettered cards placed around a table, together with an object like an overturned glass or coin as the indicator. Hand-made Ouija boards produced by artists are valued by talking board enthusiasts and collectors.\n\nMany users feel that the spirit with whom they are communicating is controlling their motions to guide their hands, spelling out messages. They see the board as a tool or medium through which they communicate with the spirit realm. These believers often take offense at the dismissal of the talking board as merely a game. Other users contend that they are in control of their own actions, but that the talking board allows communication with their inner psychic voice or subconscious.\n\nSome proponents of Ouija boards claim the activity is harmless fun. Others believe that they are communicating with spiritual entities but there is no harm in doing so provided that basic guidelines are followed. These rules often vary from user to user, but usually include things like never playing alone, beginning and ending a séance "properly", and always using the board in a "comfortable" environment. Numerous superstitions surround Ouija board use.\n\nFrom Wikipedia.  Ouija boards scare me. 1
Would you consider a career in science? Why or why not?  I would go for a career in science if you love ask questions and analyze what has been observed.  There is still much to be discovered. However, unless you come up with some revolutionary idea, complete famous research, or go into the work for the giant drug companies, don't expect to be compinsated financially for your hard work.  The real benefit is getting paid for something that you love to do. The U.S. is currently in need of good science teachers as well.  Their is good reason for a range of interests and perspectives in science, as we have historically been incorrect in assumptions about how the world and universe actually work. 2
what does the contitution do ?  It was envisioned to be a foundation of all laws.  \n\nEssentially, it gives the government specific powers and restrictions.  It delineated which branch of the government can do what.  But most importantly, it provides certain inalienable rights and freedoms for the people.  \n\nThe constitution is relatively short (compared to other countries).  That is actually by design.  The framers actually envisioned that it would change from time to time, that's why we have all these amendments.  \n\nThe constitution is also the supreme law of the land.  Any federal or state law contrary to it is invalid.  The Supreme Court gets the final say on whether any law is unconstitutional. 10
How do you get someone off of your mind you think about all the time?  That's my problem too, usually I just try to keep busy...keep my mind occupied on anything that doesn't remind me of the person. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. What's really awesome is when you find out that the person had been having a hard time trying not to think about you as well. 9
Using CSS, how would I make an image glued to the bottom of the browser and centered? Well? There is no way to do this in CSS, however, you can write a javascript that does something like\n<script>\nx.style.position = "Absolute"; //Sets x's positioning to Absolute\nx.style.top = document.innerHeight - 100; //Sets x's Y position to the exact height of the browser, replace 100 with the actual height of the image\n</script>\nThe said <img> tag would have to have Name="x" and ID="x" specified. I have not attempted to execute the above script, it's just an example of what you could try, but you're going to have to do some research to make it compatible with multiple browsers, and have it automatically execute the script if the user resizes their window.\nAlternatively, put the whole site inside a table, and have an extra table row hold the image below the rest of the document. 5

how do i know if my boyfriend really loves me? i don't know if he's playing with me or not he says he loves me and i love him but i don't know....he defended me when his dad called me a loser, but idk There are a lot of ways you cant tell if he does love you. If he has toled you he loves you then it is probably true. Knowing that he still stands by you even if his family dislikes you is another good sign, but there are a lot of other things too. Someone you love should also be your best friend. Can you trust him? can you talk to him about anything? Does he come to you with his problems? Does he let you hangout with him in front of his friends? Do you suspect hes trying to hide anything from you? If he really loves you then he'll show it, and you'll know for sure. If you have any doubts or questions about his actions or love for you then you can also talk to him about it. If he loves you and you love him you should be able to talk to him aboout anything, even this. 9

I saw my neighbor fall down a flight of stairs, it was the funniest thing, I feel bad, what should I do? An eldly gentilmen fell down a flight of stairs and was seriously hurt, he is okay,now. But I can't stop laughing about the situation. Everytime I see him, I think of the incident, and start laughing uncontrollably. I know it is not appropiate, but it is really funny. I want to apologize for laughing, but there is know way I could see him, without laughing. I'm not a bad person, but his face triggers my laughing. I'm afaid to leave the apartment because I know I will laugh, and not be able to stop laughting. He sits right in front of the porch, all day. It's start to affect my life, what should I do. This almost happened three week ago, it is always on my mind. It was really funny,not him getting hurt, but the fall was the funnest thing in the world.I still have not been able to confront the man.  Please help me. I can almost picture you trying to leave your house and peeking out the window before you set foot outside to make sure he is not around.  That's also kind of funny!\n\nSo it occurred to me, what if you embarrassed yourself in front of this guy and that way maybe you would be even.\n\nSomething simple would be, go visit him (with the excuse that you want to check on how he is doing) and when you start laughing if you laugh so hard that you start to pee your pants (or skirt whatever the case may be), just let it happen!  You'll be so embarrassed that the next time you see him you won't want to laugh (or maybe both of you will laugh at each other like crazies).\n\nYou don't see yourself doing that?  Well then just face him and after you are done laughing apologize, you may also be embarrassed about laughing and maybe after that you will be able to leave your house and talk to this again like a normal person would.  I hope this helps!\n\ncali_rich_and_smooth@yahoo.com 1
How can I take some xmas lights that plug into AC and make them hook to a battery so I can walk with them? portable... wearable... xmas lights... thats what I want. Buy a DC to AC inverter.  These are used in cars to convert the 12 Volt car battery to 110 V AC to power things like TVs and power tools.  You can get them in auto parts stores or the automotive section of places like Wal-Mart.  Since these are designed for 12 volts, now you need a 12 Volt battery.  To power a set of lights for more than an hour, get a 12 Volt "gel pack" or "Sealed Lead Acid" battery.  A battery store like "batteries plus" will have them, Radio Shack should too.  Also, they are used for things like Power Wheels cars that Wal-Mart sells for little kids to drive around in.  They only weigh a few pounds. 2

is there any evidence to a pre christian camino de santiago?  Yes, Wikipedia says:\n\n"Prior to its existence as a Catholic pilgrimage, the route is believed to also have had significance for the ancient pagan peoples of the Iberian peninsula, among them the Celts, and later the Romans who conquered northern Spain. The site of Santiago de Compostela itself may have been perhaps a Roman shrine.\n\nTo this day many of the pilgrims continue on from Santiago de Compostela to the Atlantic coast of Galicia to finish their pilgrimage at Cape Finisterre (Fisterra in Galician) which is almost the westernmost point of Europe. The fact that the Romans called it Finisterrae (literally the end of the world in Latin) indicates that it was seen as a sacred place.\n\nPagan influences can still be seen along the Way; indeed some of the modern-day pilgrims themselves are attracted more to the pagan legends associated with the Way rather than the Christian." 1

Plese i needd help again? What is the best summer workout to lose the most weight with? im a teenager and weight 200+ lbs.But if you see me i don't look like it i look more like 160lbs. im just thick but i still want to lose weight. Honey losing weight isn't about a fad diet. No, it is about a lifestyle change. Not snacking all the time and getting some exercise. I know you want the quick answer but there isn't one. Gaining weight is a lot like putting money in the bank. Every time you eat you are making a deposit into your weight bank...get it. You naturally burn so many calories every day whether you exercise or not, we will call this a bankers fee. Now here is the most important part....evertime you exercise you are making a withdrawel. deposit - fee - withdrawel = what you weigh.\n\nYou have to love you for you and if you want to make chnges do it for yourself. Nobody is gonna do it for you. 3

I am a non-denominational, right-wing conservative, born-again, fundemetalist(in a nice way) Christian.\n\nI knew there had to be a God. But was this God personal, or some force?

Why Do You Hate Us So Much? I am an unashamed moonbat - neocon-speak for liberal. I visit neocon blogs sometimes as I honestly want to know why they hate us, They say so often that we say we believe in tolerance, but are intolerant. Liberals run a wide spectrum so some might be that way, but I don't see a lot of that.  Why do neoconservatives hate us? Why do we still make you so mad even though your people are running the entire USA federal government? Why can you overlook such obvious and up-front knowledge that the Bush Admin has not only lied but broken Constitutional law? And what - if anything - could  liberals do short of suicide or political conversion that would lessen your hatred for us? This is a 100% honest question; I would really appreciate a 100% honest answer, not just more hatred or jokes or saying we "help the terrorists", since that's part of the whole point: there's less terrorism when there's less hate and more of it when the hate increases.  I thank you in advance for your intelligent reply. well isnt it obvious?...they hate folks like u (and me) because you are honest (as your question attests itself) about issues and not afraid to ask honest questions...and also you know a lot, well enough to know that the neo-cons lie and break the constitution....well truth is bitter aint it?\n\nalso why should you care if they hate you or not? their hatred pulls a cloud over their eyes, makes them intractable to any reasoning and arguments....just be the way you are and keep on widening your horizons...you would grow to pity them..... 10
What is dermatoid in the right ovary?  How can it be cured?  A dermoid cyst is a saclike growth that is present at birth. It contains structures such as hair, fluid, teeth, or skin glands that can be found on or in the skin. Dermoid cysts grow slowly and are not tender unless ruptured. They usually occur on the face, inside the skull, on the lower back, and in the ovaries. These growths can develop in a woman during her reproductive years. They can cause torsion, infection, rupture, and cancer. These dermoid cysts can be removed with either conventional surgery or laparoscopy (surgery that uses small incisions and specially designed instruments to enter the abdomen or pelvis). 3

The previous answers are either wrong/incomplete/mischievious.\nFirstly there is nothing called parallel angles! You probably meant to ask what happens if the angles of two triangles are same. In that case there is no congruence/similarity between the two triangles.\nBut if two angles are equal betwen them, they are SIMILAR (same shape) and not congruent.\nIf in addition they have a side equal, they become congruent! 2

how can i find a Zeta Phi Beta chant cd, the company that made them isoutof busines . Ebay has one thats taken i found a web site, but i never heard of it and i am afraid it is a scam for my credit card number, because it asked for the security number on the back of the card, so i canceled the transaction to try to find more about the wedsite stompshow.com  it is the only site besides ebay that comes up when searching for the zeta phi beta chant cd.  please help!!! I'm not sure about finding another copy of the CD, but I did find a little bit about the website you went to by using the online tool Whois.sc, and the link to the page at that site that offers detailed information about stompshow.com is http://www.whois.sc/stompshow.com\nStompshow.com is not a secure site (i.e. it's probably not a good idea to put credit card information through their web site), the IP address is in England, but the domain is registered to an address in Los Angeles -- very odd (to me at least).\n\nPerhaps you could try finding the CD at a library?\n\nGood luck! 8

why are structure's height  are describe using above sea level or below sea level?are sea level alway the same  Sea level is used because people need an absolute reference point.\n\nActual sea level changes on an hourly basis, because of the tides. Sea level is also different in different parts of the world. One place this is important is the Panama Canal. Sea level on the Pacific is not the same as on the Atlantic.\n\nAccepted sea level is the average of the area, or continent, based on tides of the various bodies of water surrounding the area. 4

IS the MBA program offered by ICFAI university recognized?  ICFAI university has been constituted under one of the North-Eastern State Act.It is also recognised under the Uttaranchal Govt. Act.So there is no problem of recognition. One case that emerged was that of private universities that were recognised under Chhatisgarh University Act which led to establishment of some 108 private universities in the city of Raipur, the capital of Chhatisgarh itself. The law was repelled by the Supreme Court and all such universities were in trouble. ICFAI too suffered a jolt but since I already mentioned that it is also recognized by two other State Governement Acts there's no much problem with recognition.\n\n           Alternatively you can look for MBA-Biotechnology from University of Pune which is the No.1 MBA-BT course in India.Logon on to http://www.microbiologyindia.cjb.net for more information on this course.The fees is also less with excellent placement records. 4
Whats the best way to remove chest hair?  I am not at home to give you the name of the product, but there is a cream hair remover that says it's for black men's beards. I get laser hair removal done, and had to use it a few times since you can't shave after having that done. My boyfriend had hair on his lower back, and I used it on him & it was awesome. Very smooth & actually grows back softer & less thick. Only leave it on there for 6-7 min or might burn a little. It is in a tube that is white & kind of a turquoise green color. It will say it is for Black Men's Beards. My boyfriend & I are white & it worked great for us. It will be by the shaving creams & gels aisle. 3

what the differences between catholic and ortodox religions?  This question has been asked many times. Most Orthodox, in attempting to distinguish between Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism, usually mention the Pope or Purgatory, sometimes the filioque. Historically, the differences, however, are far more numerous and quite profound. \n\nAlso, in modern times, since Vatican II of thirty years ago, that major, if not tragic attempt, to "update" Roman Catholicism (e.g., the revision of canon law), the differences between Orthodoxy and the followers of the Pope have widened. \n\nIn our present discussion, however, the concern will be those differences which have grown since Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism separated almost a thousand years ago. \n\n1. Faith and Reason \n\nFollowing the Holy Fathers, Orthodoxy uses science and philosophy to defend and explain her Faith. Unlike Roman Catholicism, she does not build on the results of philosophy and science. The Church does not seek to reconcile faith and reason. She makes no effort to prove by logic or science what Christ gave His followers to believe. If physics or biology or chemistry or philosophy lends support to the teachings of the Church, she does not refuse them. However, Orthodoxy is not intimidated by man's intellectual accomplishments. She does not bow to them and change the Christian Faith to make it consistent with the results of human thought and science. \n\nSt. Basil the Great advised young monks to use Greek philosophy as a bee uses the flower. Take only the "honey," ---- the truth --- which God has planted in the world to prepare men for the Coming of the Lord. \n\nFor example, the Greeks had a doctrine of the Logos. The Gospel of John opens, "In the beginning was the Word (Logos, in Greek). For the pagans, the Logos was not God, as He is for Christians; rather he is a principle, a power or force by which "God: formed and governs the world. The Fathers pointed to the similarity between the Logos or Word of the Bible and the Logos of Greek philosophy as a sign of Providence. The difference between them, they attributed to the sinfulness of men and the weakness of the human intellect. They remembered the words of the Apostle Paul, "Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ" (Col. 2: 8). \n\nRoman Catholicism, on the other hand, places a high value on human reason. Its history shows the consequence of that trust. For example, in the Latin Middle Ages, the 13th century, the theologian-philosopher, Thomas Aquinas, joined "Christianity" with the philosophy of Aristotle. From that period til now, the Latins have never wavered in their respect for human wisdom; and it has radically altered the theology, mysteries and institutions of the Christian religion. \n\n2. The Development of Doctrine \n\nThe Orthodox Church does not endorse the view that the teachings of Christ have changed from time to time; rather that Christianity has remained unaltered from the moment that the Lord delivered the Faith to the Apostles (Matt. 28: 18-20). She affirms that "the faith once delivered to the saints" (Jude 3) is now what it was in the beginning. Orthodox of the twentieth century believe precisely what was believed by Orthodox of the first, the fifth, the tenth, the fifteenth centuries. \n\nTo be sure, Orthodoxy recognizes external changes (e.g., vestments of clergy, monastic habits, new feasts, canons of ecumenical and regional councils, etc.), but nothing has been added or subtracted from her Faith. The external changes have a single purpose: To express that Faith under new circumstances. For example, the Bible and divine Services were translated from Hebrew and Greek into the language of new lands; or new religious customs arose to express the ethnic sensibilities of the converted peoples, etc.; nevertheless, their has always been "one faith, one Lord, one baptism" (Eph.  1
What is more important in Algebra.. showing steps, or getting answer? Be precise!?  The final answer is important, but the steps are in some ways far more important. \n\nI do many long computations using algebra and more fancy types of mathematics (calculus, complex analysis, differential geometry etc). Some of the computations take hundreds of pages. Keeping track of the manipulations, being able to check the work for errors (which inevitably creep in), being able to redo the work later for the same or a related problem, being able to check the assumptions and so on are absolutely critical. And to do this, one has to write out all the steps, as clearly and carefully as possible. \n\nShowing the steps is of vital importance if you want to do this kind of work. If you want to be a scientist, or an engineer, or an accountant, or statistician, or any kind of technical person, or to work in any profession where you have to interact with technical people (and these are some of the highest paying, most interesting jobs that exist), you have to be able to analyze complicated problems, and describe to yourself and others carefully how you solved them.\n\nEven if you do not want to work in a profession involved with technical work, the entire reason you are studying algebra is to train yourself to think logically about certain kinds of problems. By not showing your steps, you are shortchanging yourself and hurting yourself, because showing your steps forces you to understand the process of getting an answer much better.\n\nA final reason to show your steps is that if you show your work, it is far less likely that you will be accused of cheating. It is just smart to protect yourself from any kinds of charges like this, if you can. 2

what changed and caused the crisis between great britain and the thirteen colonies?  The steps leading up to the war and their consequences are as follows:\n1. Proclomation of 1763 which prohibited the colonist from living west of the Appalachian Mts.-made the colonist mad and many disregarded the proclomation.\n2. Britain raising taxes on the colonist to help defray the costs of the French and Indian War-the colonist protested and refused to pay the taxes.\n3. Boston Massacre in 1770 which was used as American propoganda against the British when in fact it was a large crowd threatening a small group of British soldiers who either fired accidently or out of fear for their lives\n4. Quartering of British soldiers in colonists homes-caused great resentment against the British.\n5. Boston Tea Party in which colonist threw tea into Boston Harbor to protest the monopoly given the British East India Trading Company causing the British to pass the Coercive Acts which severly punished Boston.\n6.  To show support for the Mass. colony all of the colonies except one met at the first Continental Congress and authorized colonies to raise militias, and to boycott British tea.\n7. Lexington and Concord April 1775-British troops attempted to capture Sam Adams and a store of arms and powder at Concord, Mass.  The British were met at Lexington, Mass. on April 19th by a small group of "minute men", resulting in the death of several colonist.\n8.

No,I hardley ever go to Walmart.I agree with you that most food items are overpriced.You would be better off going to a store such as Kroger for food.I think everyone should stop going to Walmart.Walmart used to advertise "buy American" but they have changed their policy and now they buy most of their products from foreign countries mostly from China.They are taking jobs away from the American people.They are only interested in profits. 7

Why does the moon appear larger when it is close to the horizon?  Frosty is right, Otisabi is wrong. The round shape of the atmosphere bends the light. You also get a reddish taint to the moons colour when it's close to the horizon. This is due to the red part of the light reflected from the moon hitting your eye, while the rest is into space. If you've ever looked into a round fishbowl you'll see how it distorts light to make things look larger. 2
how can electromagnetic waves be diverted or stoped or can be focused to some specific direction.?  This is intuitive if you remember that light is an example of an electromagnetic wave.  \n\nA lens can focus electromagnetic waves, and mirrors can divert them.  They can be 'stopped' by being absorbed into something, and many materials will absorb electromagnetic waves (like skin, that absorbs light, and therefore warms up and gets tan in sunlight). 2
Why are criminals allowed to see their attorney before the police starts questioning them? I don't exactly get y criminals have this ability to have their attorney's present with them while being questioned by the police?? All of the above are right. In more detail, the US Supreme Court held that because the state (aka: police) can be coercive and overwhelming, it is too easy for them to pressure someone into a confession. This could potentially violate both the person's due process rights and their right to not say anything that would incriminate them (both 5th Amendment rights).\n\nTherefore, to balance the scales of justice, and to preserve the right to an attorney, people in custodial interrogation must be allowed to speak with an attorney if they ask. This ensures that the person being held by the police has someone there to help them and support them, and thus to ensure that their constitutional rights are protected. \n\nThe Court in Miranda v. Arizona found that because people may not know their rights, police are required to notify them of their rights before questioning, and must get a waiver of those rights before they can proceed. 10
what is diabetis mellitus? state it's causes and control measures.State in detail all you know about diabetis  Diabetes Mellitus, commonly referred to as "diabetes," means "sweet urine." Diabetes mellitus means "to flow, honey" in Greek\n\nIt is a disease that affects the body's ability to produce or respond to insulin, a hormone that allows blood glucose (blood sugar) to enter the cells of the body and be used for energy. It results from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. In diabetes too much glucose stays in the blood. Elevated levels of blood glucose (hyperglycemia) lead to spillage of glucose into the urine.\n\nAs a result of elevated levels of blood glucose, two problems occur: body cells become starved for energy, and, over time, the high glucose levels can damage the nerves, eyes, kidneys, heart and blood vessels.\n\nDiabetes is not an infectious disease, like a cold or flu. You can’t "catch" it from someone else, and no one can catch it from you. Diabetes is a lifelong disease.\n\nMen with diabetes often have erectile dysfunction which can begin before the diagnosis of diabetes is made. It is therefore recommended that men with unexplained erectile dysfunction be screened for diabetes with a fasting blood glucose test.\n\nWhat is High Blood Sugar?\n\n    * Normal blood sugar: 65 -140.\n    * High blood sugar: 250-350\n    * Very high blood sugar: (over 350) \n\nWhat happens when blood sugar falls too low?\n\nWhen blood sugar falls too low, the body will begin a process to increase blood sugar. The process is listed below.\n\n   1. The pancreas releases a hormone called glucagon\n   2. The muscles and liver convert their stored glycogen back into glucose.\n   3. When the stored glycogen is used up, the liver, kidneys, and small intestines can break down protein into glucose.\n\nSymptoms of Diabetes?\n\nSymptoms include:\n\n    * excessive thirst\n    * excessive urination\n    * infections (thrush)\n    * extreme hunger\n    * unusual weight loss\n    * extreme fatigue\n    * irritability\n    * nausea\n    * vomiting\n    * sweet smelling breath\n\nTypes of Diabetes\n\nThere are 4 main types of diabetes\n\n    * Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (IDDM)\n    * Non Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (NIDDM)\n    * Gestational Diabetes\n    * Secondary Diabetes \n\nSecondary diabetes mellitus refers to elevated blood sugar levels that develop as the result of another medical condition. Secondary diabetes mellitus also develops when the pancreatic tissue responsible for the production of insulin is absent because it is destroyed by disease, such as chronic pancreatitis, trauma, or surgical removal of the pancreas. Diabetes can also result from other hormonal disturbances, such as excessive growth hormone production (acromegaly) and Cushing's syndrome.\n\nCure for Diabetes?\n\nA cure for Diabetes has not been found yet.  However, it can be controlled. Ways to control diabetes are: maintaining blood glucose levels, blood fat levels and weight.  Blood glucose levels can be maintained by following a diet designed by your doctor, exercising, and eating at regular intervals.\n\nTreatment Options for Diabetes?\n\nSome of the most common treatment options are: oral medicines (Diabetes pills), dietary changes, exercise, insulin and islet Cell Transplantation. The oral medicines may have negative side effects. The side effects of the oral medicines include: nausea, diarrhea, metallic taste in mouth, low blood glucose, skin rash or itching, and weight gain. Rare side effects are Liver failure, Respiratory infection, Headache, and Pain\n\nHow is Diabetes mellitus diagnosed?\n\nDiabetes can be diagnosed by performing a fasting plasma glucose test. The test is as follows: After the person has fasted overnight (at least 8 hours), a sample of blood is drawn and sent to the laboratory for analysis.\n\nNormal fasting plasma glucose levels are less than 110 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl). Fasting plasma glucose levels of more than 126 mg/dl on two or more tests on different da 3

is Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious a real word?is it the longest english word? or which is the longest word  No. it is not. The well-known song title from the movie Mary Poppins, Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, with 34 letters, does appear in several dictionaries, but only as a proper noun, and defined in reference to the song title. Hence it may well be dismissed as not a "real" word.\n\n\nThe Guinness Book of Records, in its 1992 and subsequent editions, declared the "longest real word" in the English language to be floccinaucinihilipilification at 29 letters. Defined as the act of estimating as worthless, its usage has been recorded as far back as 1741. In recent times its usage has been recorded in the proceedings of the United States Senate by Senator Jesse Helms, and at the White House by Bill Clinton's press secretary Mike McCurry. It is the longest non-technical word in the first edition of the Oxford English Dictionary.\n\n\nHowever, There are seemingly endless debates over what is the longest word in English, demonstrating that the idea of what constitutes a word is not as straightforward as it seems. Hyphenated or space-delimited compounds and proper nouns are linguistically considered words, but as they can grow with few limits, they are not counted.\n\nAntidisestablishmentarianism (a 19th century movement in England opposed to the separation of church and state) at 28 letters is often popularly accepted as English's longest word, and is probably the best-known "longest word." Other versions such as Antidisestablishmentarianistically and Pseudoantidisestablishmentarianism are demonstrably longer, though, showing that 'popular acceptance' is not a guarantee of accuracy. (See also the "Constructions" section below.) "Antidisestablishmentarianism" is actually used seriously in academic and ecclesiastical writing about the Church of England when the concept arises, and although one may suspect that authors have gone out of their way not to avoid it, it does thus have a serious claim to be the longest real word in current English.\n\nThe word pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis, also spelled pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanokoniosis, is defined as "a lung disease caused by the inhalation of very fine silica or quartz dust." At 45 letters, it is certainly the longest word ever to appear in a non-technical dictionary of English, the Oxford English Dictionary. However there are strong indications that the word was coined by puzzler Everett Smith in 1935 as a hypothetical long word that could result from the protraction of medical terms. The actual name of the disease is pneumoconiosis, which is 14 letters long.\n\n\n\nA popular joke answer to the 'longest word' question is the word smiles, credited as the longest word because there is a mile between each s. Of course, by this reckoning the word beleaguered, which contains a league, is even longer.\n\nAccording to some, the longest word is the word after the sentence "And now, a word from our sponsors".\n\nAlthough only fourteen letters long, sesquipedalian deserves a mention. It is derived from a nonce word used by the Roman author Horace, in his work "Ars Poetica" (The Art of Poetry). The quote is as follows: "Proicit ampullas et sesquipedalia verba," which means, "He throws aside his paint pots and his words that are a foot and a half long". The Oxford English dictionary lists sesquipedalianism ("the practice of using words one and a half feet long"), and further derivations can be created as described in the "Constructions" section above. 7
This was sent to me in an e-mail, it's not a question, but it's very informative.? Read this... it could save your life!\n  \nLet’s say it's 6:15 PM and you're driving home (alone of course), after an unusually hard day on the job.  You're tired, upset and frustrated.  Suddenly you start experiencing severe pain in your chest that starts to radiate out into your arm and up into your jaw.  You are only about five miles from the hospital nearest your home.  Unfortunately, you don't know if you'll be able to make it that far.  You have been trained in CPR, but the guy that taught the course did not tell you how to perform it on yourself.\n  \nhow to survive a heart attack when alone since many people are alone when they suffer a heart attack, without help, the person whose heart is beating improperly and who begins to feel faint, and/or is nauseous and starts sweating profusely has only about ten seconds left before losing consciousness.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, these victims can help themselves by coughing repeatedly and very vigorously.  Take a deep breath before each cough, and the cough must be deep and prolonged, as when producing sputum from deep inside the chest.\n\n \n\nA breath and a cough must be repeated about every two seconds without let-up until help arrives, or until the heart is felt to be beating normally again.  Deep breaths get oxygen into the lung and coughing movements squeeze the heart and keep the blood circulating.  The squeezing pressure on the heart also helps it regain normal rhythm.  In this way, heart attack victims can get to a hospital. Thank you for this potentially life saving info .. 3
how do familes take it when they found out someone is gay?  When my cousin finally came out, our family actually told him we knew all along. Well some of us did. His dad, who always said he hated gays, accepted him before he passed away of cancer. He said he was afraid of telling us, but we still love him. I know some people feel it is wrong in our family, but we love the person and it is not going to make us stop just because he is gay. 9

What is this pain in my back? For over 3 yrs , I've had a fist sized area in my left middle part of my back.

If it was me, i would update the site as soon as the info is given to you, as far as updating the layout, it wouldn't hurt do redesign the whole thing, i have done it with my own website with great success 5

What is Kane's real name? I want to know what the WWE wrestler Kane's real name is. His real name is Glen Jacobs.  He has previously appeared in the WWE as Isaac Yankem and The New Diesel.  These gimmicks failed of course, but WWE loved his look and size so he was repackaged in late 1997 as the Undertaker's half brother Kane.\n\nHope that answers your question!! 6
why do so many people belive in god? are they just morons or what?  it gives some a reason to keep living, to know its something more to this life than just death and the moments in this life. it also gives them peace,and comfort to know that someone is always with them when it seems like its just them against the world. god is a form of friend to the friendless. its love a mother has for a child. its always knowing to a person, someone or things cares about them when they cant care for them selves. people believing in someone like god doesnt make them morons, its makes them at peace with this crazy world. 1

Why do hurricanes happen?  A hurricane begins when a warm, wet mass of air over the sea begins to rise quickly. Then combined actions of air, water and heat may then produce a huge, spinning system of clouds, rain and wind- a hurricane. The center, or eye, of a hurricane is calm. It is a hole in a dough-nut of wind. \nA hurricane usually lasts 9-12 days. It forms and builds strength over warm sea water. It loses energy as it moves over cooler sea water or land. 2
I have a Fiance from AMMAN Jordan,we are going to marry, what do you think are chances are in him coming to US I met my Fiance over 2 yrs ago over yahoo chat, We decided to meet in person back in 2004 & we spent 2 weeks together getting to know one another in person. we chatted for about 6 1/2 months before we decided we needed to meet each other in person because we found that we were both very attracted to one another. So we met in person & found that we were even more attracted to each other in person, So we decided that we want to be together. Now i plan to return to Jordan in March this year to marry him. So this is why i am asking for your thoughts. dear angel rain, please do some research on the culture in Jordan... to be the newest prettiest wife in a family with several wives is to be  the bottom of the totem pole, unmercifully humiliated and forced to do low rank and disgusting jobs in fear of painful, life threatening punishment.  giving a jordanian access to American citizenship is serious  and makes you of even less value once he gets citizenship. beware girl be careful so careful 9

I am tired most of the time. Any LEGAL suggestions on how to get energy?  Short of amping ones self on caffeine and god knows what else they put in Sobe No Fear (my pick me up of choice). Here's a number of pointers from a registered sleep tech:\n\nEstablish a good routine for you sleep schedule:\nbed at same time, wake at same time sort of business. Don't let weekend get you out of whack.\n\nGet a full 8 hours of sleep. Although, many need somewhat more or less than that based on age and individual differences....8's a good average to start with.\n\nNo caffeine for 6-8 hours prior to bed\n\nDo not work out 1-2 hours prior to bed\n\nNo TV or reading in bed (train to body to only sleep in bed, well and other necessary activities with one's mate)\n\nIf you have difficulty sleeping due to thinking too much about...well anything that keeps you up....things to do etc.  Try to write everything down that you will be doing for the next day before bed so that you won't need to think about it in bed.\n\nIf you are sensitive to noise, try earplugs, or blindfold if having light issues.\n\nStress can always add to the problem, try to relax!  \n\nOK, now the really important stuff...as many mentioned...this could be a health issue. The most common problem (and often undiagnosed) for being tired all the time is obstructive sleep apnea. This is the bread and butter of the sleep field in general. No way I could tell you without a complete history, a couple dozen wires and a few hours, if this is the problem. Go to a sleep lab, they are everywhere, doesn't hurt to have a test run eh. However, here's a few things to red flag ya:\n\nAre you tired all the time...clearly yes\nAre you at all overweight.\nDo you have a 15" neck or larger.\nDo you snore.\nDo you wake up with dry mouth or headaches.\nDo you or anyone in your family have any history of heart problems, particularly Congestive Heart Failure.\nDoes anyone in your family snore or have Obstructive Sleep Apnea.\nDo you get up to go to the bathroom several times a night.\nForgetfullness\nImpotence\nummmm....I'm sure I've left a few things off....anywho...\n\n\nIf anything on this list pops out, and even if they don't for that matter, go have a test at your local sleep lab.\n\nOn a more rare note, there is other sleep disorders that could make you tired all the time....say narcolepsy, insomnia, parasomnias, periodic leg movements, etc.  Everything can be evaluated at a sleep disorders center, generally one doctor referal away. \n\nGood luck! 3

what is GESTAPO?  The "Geheime Staatspolizei", or Secret State Police.  They were a part of the SS of the Nazi regime, derived initially from Department 1A of the Prussian Police.  Compared to other secret state police (those of Soviet Russia, China, etc.) of the 20th century, the Gestapo had a significantly smaller ratio of agents to civilians in the nation...and they relied mainly on "denouncements" by other Germans.  (This refutes the popular notion that the Gestapo were everywhere -- they were not, in fact...but anyone could be an informant.)  These "denouncements" were just accusations by other Germans, and at times were largely used as a weapon against others with whom Germans had a grudge against.  Because of their heavy misuse, such denouncements, if made for the purpose of harming another and not for providing real intelligence, could lead to punishment.  The Gestapo were also responsible for some actions in the Holocaust, including mass executions before the use of mass-creamation.  After the 1939 invasion of Poland, the Gestapo assured Germany that Poland's intelligence network had been destroyed...but amazingly it existed underground and was able to subvert the Gestapo until the end of the war. 10

what did Susan B. Anthony did that was so special?  Susan Brownell Anthony, (February 17, 1820 – March 13, 1906) was a prominent American civil rights leader who, along with Elizabeth Cady Stanton, led the effort to secure Women's suffrage in the United States.\n\nnthony was very self-conscious, both of her looks (one eye always pointed slightly outwards) and of her speaking abilities. She long resisted public speaking for fear her speech would not be good enough. However, throughout her lifetime, Anthony worked endlessly. She traveled thousands of miles each year throughout the United States and Europe giving speeches on suffrage (75 to 100 speeches per year for 45 years). She traveled by carriage, wagon, train, mule, stagecoach, ship, ferry boat and sleigh.\n\nAnthony died at Rochester, New York, on March 13, 1906 and is buried there in Mount Hope Cemetery. Anthony is known as "The Mother of us all." 4
How can I export my calendar from MS Outlook to MS Works Calendar?  Outlook will allow you to export in a number of different formats.  Since I'm not an expert with Works, check its import function to see it you can find what kind of file type it's looking for (Windows comma-delimited, MS Access, etc.).  Outlook can probably export to any of them.\n\nIn Outlook, go to Import and Export from the File Menu.  Choose Export To A File, click Next, then choose your file type, click Next, then choose the Contacts folder to export its contents, click Next, choose a name and path for the file (I suggest saving to your desktop), click Next or Finish and you should be all set.  Then return to Works and go through its import function.  If you picked the right file format, it will likely import for you without any problems.  Good luck! 5
what is 3 second violation in basketball.....?  If you stand inside the paint/key/rectangle in front of the basket for over 3-seconds it is a violation.

THANK YOU CARDS...Do people write them anymore? Does it annoy you when they don't? It seems a natural thing to do, but I am always suprised when so many people don't...any thoughts? I still send them...and it's amazing the impact it has on people.  I'm normally the one in my family that is pretty consistant about it.  My birthday was back in September, and I was very busy with a new job so was delayed in sending out cards.  People were actually shocked in not receiving a thank you.  It's a nice gesture and lost art. 1

Finding a Doctor to treat Lyme Disease?  It depends upon where you are located - not all physicians are familiar with treatment and diagnosis of Lyme Disease.\n\nIt is an infectious disease and therefore an "ID" doc is usually the most qualified.\n\nDavid Spach at the University of Washington is very familiar iwth Lyme Disease and other vector borne illnesses.  If you live near a major city or university, you can find someone local. 3

Why would people want to Migrate to canada from China? Why is our country a good place to live Canada has vast open spaces. While China is geographically large, its huge population certainly diminishes the number of wild and natural landscapes available.\n\nCanada, with its vast and empty boreal forests, is any naturalist's dream. Any Chinese nationals seeking the wide open wilds could do worse in terms of finding somewhere to migrate to. 10
Why did the Oakland A's waste a ton of money on has-beens and almost-was's?  Beane's a calculated risk-taker.  Izzy didn't cost the A's much (the Mets had pretty much given up on him) and he became a heck of a closer.  I think the A's like to get veteran players who can help out in the clubhouse with the younger guys they have to have on their roster (b/c of their small payroll).  Now....Milton Bradley obviously doesn't fit that bill, but past folks like Hatterfield, Eric Karros, Reggie Sanders, etc. certainly do fit the mold. 6
y do Iran looks for nuclear weapon?  I dont think Iran looks for nukes now as they always claim they are looking for nuclear plants for electricity but it is also true that the process of enrichment of uranium will enable Iran to make nukes specially with blue prints that CIA gave Iran for making nukes some years ago.\nit also must be noted that after decompositon of USSR there are vast amount of uranium on sale on underground military black market and Iran was able to buy some and I think it already have and also Iran has missles which can target Israel from its northern borders so if they really want to wipe Israel they can.\nFact that I want to tell is some of famous Israel leaders are born and grown in Iran and Israel is originally enemy of arab countries which Iranians have problems with them for so long.\n The most hostile act of Iranian governments is some support for anti israel groups specially palastinians which I think is comparable with US budget for overthrowing Iran government and I think both parties gain more from each other.\nits exactly similar to cold war where both parties have nukes but the only output was some James Bond movies. 10

Does anyone besides myself believe that the latest female american reporter is actually one of the terroist? I believe she is becasue every time she comes on TV asking to listen to these terroist she is in good spirits. She is clean and well dressed and she is very cool, calm and collected.

Whats wrong with this picture. They have NEVER done this before. And NO, they don't have a problem killing a female. I am thinking.....you are alone or in a very small minority. 10

How can I get help with Trig? Math Many colleges and universities hire tutors from within their student population to help other students with math and science, etc.  Simply ask your local college or university if they also tutor local students.  Mine does, but priority is given to the school's students.  So you might have to wait longer, but it will be free for you since the school is already paying them. It's free at my school anyway.  Ask if they have a slow day. 2
Why did God preferred to appoint an illieterate man -Mohammad- to a literate one as His prophet/?  Well, since God does not answer us directly, and answers our prayers to do so only through his moving in mysterious ways programme, it is impossible to answer your question.\n\nStill, we can guess. And that's what any theologian does for a living. Makes guesses and presents them as infallible facts.\n\nSome people say Mohammad was not and could not be illiterate. He was the son of prominent aristocracy in Mecca, he was in trades business which at least compels you to learn aritmetics, which requires knowledge of written symbols. \n\nBesides Mohammad is considered an intelligent and curious person, it is quite improbable for a person of his grade to be ignorant of letters in the *then* cosmopolite cultural atmosphere of Mecca.  \n\nFurthermore some people consider the word ummi does not mean illiterate, but a person who have not read other holy books (old and new testament) in existence. This one I think is plausible. Because Mohammad is usually mocked by others as an impostor who copies "the ways of the old" and its texts. So it is only natural for Mohammad to call himself ummi, a person who does not know about these books, so he can not possibly copy them for his purposes.\n\nEventually since Islam needed a miracle and had to suppress this obvious connection, invented "the illiterate prophet, who by the sheer will of Allah learns to read and write" story. It caught on.\n\nIt even sound very convincing when you think of Koran as a piece of literature. How can an illiterate man write this beauty? Obviously it is the word of god, etc.\n\nHowever Koran is a very disconnected book, that can hardly stick to a point, full of redundant terms and meaningless drivel. It's very easy to imitate, and even a poet during Mohammad's time imitated one book that reads like Koran as an answer to the challenge, only to be executed for doing so. It quickly killed away the opposition, leaving true believers who can not praise the book more.\n\nAnyhow, ın short we can say: even if Allah picked Mohammad, an illiterate man to be a prophet, it's not strange. Many people believe without reading, an illiterate prophet won't hurt sales that much. 1

Why are we here?  The meaning of life is for us to discover that we are\ntrue children of an infinitely loving and merciful God, \nto find out what our responsibilities are to our Creator, \nand to fulfill those responsibilities. \nIn His infinite goodness, God could not keep all to Himself the happiness of existence He enjoyed. And only His true children, not just creatures, would be fully able to share it with Him. That is why He created us. But complete free will is the essence of His nature. So we, His true children, also had to have complete free will, only without the infinite power and wisdom. That makes things difficult. That makes it possible for some of us to smart under God's authority.\n\nFree will is a tricky thing. It has to really be free. We have to be able to do evil if we wish; we have to be able to do the most outrageously bad things imaginable, like blow up office buildings. Or trick other people into thinking that God wants them to kill in His name. Of course, we are also free to do good. We can forgive people who are mean to us, and give all our possessions to the poor. We must be free from all restraints. \n\nGod knew that He would start out giving us Paradise to live in, but that we would soon think that we were His equal and rebel against Him. He knew that we would not like the idea of anyone in authority over us, and that we would think that we could make the rules for our lives ourselves. He knew that he could not leave us with Him in Paradise, and that once we left that we would be severely tested in this new world, a world of random events and pain and sorrow. \n\nHe knew that some of us would continue to heed our conscience, and be kind and good, and have faith that God knows best. He knew that others would feel pain and sorrow, and blame Him. \n\nBut God, in his infinite goodness, has arranged a way for us to return to Paradise. All it requires is a short stay in this hard world of temptation and pain. All it requires is to prove to Him that we will not rebel against Him again, and to realize that God knows better than we do how to rule the universe. So this life is not what many imagine it to be: what happens to our bodies here is not important. Our lives are eternal, and our goal is to spend them in Paradise, where we all started out so long ago. \n\nWe must trust in His love and His commands. Being obedient to His commands allows us to receive His grace, which in turn will lead to faith and salvation. \n\n\n\nAnd what is God's greatest command? \n\n\n"Love the Lord thy God with your whole heart, and love thy neighbor as thyself." That is how Christ put it. That is what the entire word of God boils down to. You love yourself quite a bit. You go to great trouble to make sure you are fed when you get hungry. Do you do the same for all other people on earth? If not, you are not obeying Christ's command. \nYou go to great trouble to make sure that you have warm clothing and shelter when you are cold. Do you do the same for everyone else on earth? If not, you are not obeying Christ's command. \n\nIn the Bible, Christ said that if you do not feed the hungry and shelter the homeless and comfort the lonely, He will cast you into the eternal fires of Hell Himself. That's what it says, right in the Bible. It is also later on this page with chapter and verse. \n\nIt is not enough to sit like a vegetable and think you are doing nothing wrong. You are commanded to act. You are commanded to relieve the suffering of your fellow human beings. \n\nThe meaning of religion is to do that because God is our common Father, making us all brothers and sisters. We do our best to make life happy for our brethren, out of love and respect for God. For Christians, this is what is meant by living our life in Christ. True peace in this life is knowing that when we do that, we are assured of being eternally happy. \n\n\nBut how can we love God? He does not expect us to be able to love Him in the way that we love o 7

Bad credit choices in past.? I was very stupid with credit while i was younger. I never paid on five different credit cards. There is now five years since the last activity is being reported. I want to purchase a house within the next year and cant wait the seven years that it takes. They all say paid collection or charge-off. Any ideas on how to approach the compainies so they get some money back and upgrade my account? What percentage should I offer them as a settlement. I keep hearing they sell the accounts for pennies on the dollar. Any idea how much they really get? \nOne of the accounts is an open collection account that is reported every month. Should I leave it alone also? Credit is nothing more than an agreement, a promise.  If you failed to pay in the past, and you want to get someone to loan to you again, you have to repay what you borrowed.  If you are going to instead see how little you can pay to eliminate your past debt, your new lender has got to think that you will treat him the same way.\n\nPay your debt...or suffer the consequences.  As you said, you made some bad previous choices.  Either own up to them (and pay) or work through the various options of being a renter until your bankruptcy is discharged, etc.\n\nIt's hard to get a new lender to believe you are credit-worthy (aka, "trustworthy") if your primary goal is to *NOT* pay your debt in full. 7

i need help wit a friend and the guy she loves!!!!? she 7 years older than me shes 22 so i donno really wat to do cus im still a teen anyways her boyfriend broke up with her last night cus he needed to get his life together (money wise) but he told her that he just needed time away for that so.....WAT R THE CHANCES OF THEM GETTING BACK TOGETHER IN UR OPINION?! in my opinion he has found someone else. people do not break up for no reason. if it was money they did not have to break up he just needs to work through it. people break up for a lot of different reasone. they either found someone else or they just simply do not feel the same as they did about that person. if you friend is only 22 she is just starting her life. this is the best thing that could have happened to her. because there is someone out there that will treat her the way she is supose to be treated and have a secure feeling about it not will he leave later. tell her she is free now go live it up and have fun and do not settle for a looser that does not no 9

what do you mean by this that only retired actors and actress should be allowed to run for public office?  Anyone can run for most public offices. Check your local laws. National offices have certain requirements that must be met. For example, to run for Senator the Constitution states:\nNo person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to the age of thirty years, and been nine years a citizen of the United States and who shall not, when elected, be an inhabitant of that state for which he shall be chosen.\n \nThe Constitution is a very interesting and informative document. Every American should read it. 10

Is time continuous or discreet? Can we divide time into ever smaller units or is there a smallest time unit?  The normal answer, and the one which all conventional theories of physics are based on is that time is modelled as a real number.  In relativity theory intervals of time are defined as a kind of generalised distance between two points in a 4-dimensional geometry.  This 4-dimensional geometry (aka space-time) is defined using real numbers, resulting in distances always being real numbers, and so there ends up being no smallest distance.\n\nQuantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics have the same continuum underlying space and time, but the complication is that whilst time is continuous it is not possible to _measure_ time scales less than a certain amount.  But still, the equations of the theory are still written in terms of differentIAL (c.f. difference) equations and are thus fundamentally continuous.\n\nThe impossibility of measuring suficiently small time scales has led _some_ theorists to consider the possibility that spacetime is actually a lattice of discrete points, thus making space and time fundamentally quantised.  It has the advantage that if you make the additional assumption that the overall size of the universe is finite then integrals over the whole of space (which might not converge) end up being just finite sums, which always converge.  Still, the theory has a long way to go simply to catch up with present-day theories, and is certainly not mainstream theoretical physics. 2

Is 19 too young to get married even if you've known the guy for about 5 years? just curious... i'm not even 19 yet Yes. The length of your relationship is not the basis to get married or not.\n\nBoth of you have be SURE you want to marry each other. You marry because you LOVE each other so much and you want to spend the rest of your lives together. You need to be matured enough to understand and deal with the problems and consequences you'll have to face when you get married. You need to be physically, mentally, emotionally and financially ready about it. Make sure that you are ready to give up something (clubbing, you'll have less time with your friends, etc.) for your marriage.\n\nDon't rush, ok? Enjoy being young. You can still do and enjoy so many things. But marrying is not yet one of them. ^_^ 9

how can i find out when my financial aid will come?  Your financial aid should arrive before the semester begins.  If you applied for financial aid past the deadline then you will probably be required to pay for your tuition and books when the semester starts and then wait to be reimbursed.  If you had more financial aid than you had college expenses then you should be sent a refund check in the mail towards the end of the semester.  You should contact your college for more information on exact date they mail the refund checks to students. 4

What is a good gift for a left handed person?  If it's a student, we always appreciate left-handed friendly notebooks - usually those with the spirals at the top.

Most are over-priced gimmicks. 7

What are th roles of a network administrator? How to become one?  A network administrator performs the day to day tasks necessary to keep the network running as well as managing access to resources.  This typically requires a smaller skill set and less experience than a network engineer.\n\nA network engineer is responsible for the design, implementation, and system recovery activities associated with a network.\n\nBecoming a network administrator requires sufficient knowledge about an environment to use the vendor tools and interfaces.  For example, I recommend obtaining the MCSA certification if you want to administer a Microsoft Windows environment.  \n"Microsoft Certified Systems Administrators (MCSAs) administer network and systems environments based on the Microsoft Windows operating systems. Specializations include MCSA: Messaging and MCSA: Security." 5
What ARE Nigerian warlords? You hear about then all the time.  You have a general idea.  But do you ever really know?  NO.  Because the media expects everyone to know these things since the day they start reading.  One day, I shall create a phrase, and when people ask me what it means, I'll be like, "You mean you DON'T KNOW?" and leave them to themselves to try to figure it out, then reuse it.  I bet that's how the Nigerian warlords thing started... Warlords are like the head gang leader, but with bigger weapons.  They control a certain territory in countries that the centralized government has collapse.  They usually appear in countries that fall into civil disorder due to corruption and ineffective government.  Somalia is currently in this state.  The central government has collapsed and warlords run their territory at their discretion.\n\nNigerian warlords would be those warlords in Nigeria (located in Africa). 10
Why does it seem like the court system is set up to protect criminals?  As pathetic as you think this country is, be grateful that if your girlfriend falsely accuses you of, say, domestice violence (and it happens a LOT), that the burden of proof is upon the government, not upon you to prove innocence.  Read your philosophers like Thomas Jefferson; "I would rather be exposed to the inconveniencies attending too much liberty than those attending too small a degree of it."\nEveryone is innnocent until they are proven guilty.  THEN they are a criminal. 1

How many ATPs are created through the Electron Transport Chain in animals?  The answer is either 32 or 34 ATP are produced by the chemiosmotic pump utilized during the Electron Transport Chain (which is 1/3 of the processes involved in cellular respiration). There are a total of 36 or 38 ATP made in the whole of cellular respiration -- there are also 4 net ATP produced by substrate-level phosporylation during glycolsis and the Krebs cycle.\n\nCells differ in how many ATP are produced as a result of the Electron Transport Chain (ETC) depending on which method they use to deliver the 2 NADH molecules produced outside of the mitochandria during glycolysis. If those two NADH molecules are delivered by a shuttle protein system, 2 net ATP are saved resulting in a net total of 34 ATP produced in the ETC. If they are not delivered by a shuttle protein system, an ATP is expended to get each across resulting in a net 32 ATP produced during the ETC. 2

I used up 1200 KWH on my last electric bill. How many solar panels would i need to make that much electricity?  The answer depends on how big or how much each solar panel produces.  But you definetly need at least 1,200 Watts. You can either try to produce the energy Chemically or Mechanically.  Chemically you need Photo Electric Panels Large enough to produce 1,200 watts.  Mechanically you would use mirrors to focus the suns rays onto a boiler to create steam and then turn a turbine generator. 2
How Can Supreme Court decisions be overturned?  The United States Supreme Court is the highest federal court in the United States. It is often referred to as 'the Court of Last Resort' because its decisions are final. Decisions are the formal ruling from the court. \n\nA Supreme Court ruling is final: there is no appeal. However, there are two ways to overturn a Supreme Court ruling:\n\n(1) The Legislature can overturn a Supreme Court opinion by changing the law or passing a new statute that is contrary to the Supreme Court's decision. Even if the prior decision is based on constitutional law, Congress and the states can amend the Constitution to achieve the goal they want. However, this is not an easy thing to do.\n\n(2) Like the other answers have said, another way is for a prior decision to be overturned by the Supreme Court in a subsequent opinion. In this scenario, the Supreme Court overturns "itself".  To "overturn" a decision basically involves a new court case which would be decided one way under "stare decisis", and the Court ignoring the previous decision and ruling a different way. 10
ok if gravity is looked at as two sepeate fields why dont they counter act each other ying and yang? ok another way to look at gravity is kind of reverse centrifical force instead of every thing on the outersurface flying away out into space it is pulled into its center  now consider the possability of a greek symbol for infinity a horizontal figure 8 instead of two seprate forces it is one continuous string and at its intersection the fields cause a form of moleculer fusion capable of generation a field of such energetic force that it starts to implode onto itself and attracting all arourd itself generating friction of such mass that it craetes a core of white heat 1000^2 if this could be proven would it change the veiws of relitivity?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6 This is actually a subtle question. Why is there only one "charge" for gravity? That fundamentally depends on the details of General Relativy and the nature of gravity waves and the graviton. The result, of course, is that there is only one "charge." There is no antimatter.\n\nIt's a little hard to figure out exactly what you mean in the rest of the question. No offense, but punctuation would help. But, suffice it to say that there is only one "charge" of gravity, so the details are moot. 2

how to mirror a unix server? Hello, I would like to setup a live mirror of my inhouse unix server to another offsite server. To clarify this I would like it so that anytime new files or records are created they would be created also on the offsite server at the same time via a internet connection.\nThank you Sounds like your looking for a continuous availability solution.  It depends on the platform.\nAn "active active" clustered solution may do the trick.  Fundamentally were talking about syncing disk across some geographic area.

Can a teacher marry his student? One of my friends who is a teacher is in love with his student. He does not know whether he can marry her or not. If someone knows according to the religion, he or she may kindly assist him. Thanks Well, religeously there's no problem.  Morally, it depends on their ages.  We're going to assume that they are both of age.  In which case, yes they can get married.  But I suggest that either your friend waits until she graduates, or starts looking for a new job.  Marriage while she is still enrolled could cause him to be dismissed. 9
whats next after hep c treatment?  Following up with your physician is important.  Next steps will also depend upon the outcome of your therapy.  Typically, physicians will look at your HCV RNA 6 months after completing therapy to determine if you have cleared the virus (achieved an SVR or sustained virologic response).\n\nIf you have an SVR - congratulations!  \n\nIf you do not, then you will have to talk with you doctor about retreatment or waiting for a clinical trial for non-responders.\n\nHaving HCV Genotype 1 or 4 makes the virus more difficult to eradicate (and therefore ususally require longer therapy)\n\nHCV genotype 2 or 3 is usually easier to treat and easier to clear (usually only 6 months of PegIFN and Ribavirin is required.  Although, sometimes with HCV Genotype 3a there can be fat deposits in the liver making it more difficult to treat).\n\nBest of luck on clearning the virus and achieving an SVR! 3
What is the real meaning of Festivus?  While it first came to the attention of most of America by way of the December 18, 1997 episode of Seinfeld, the celebration of a holiday called Festivus is part of human history throughout the ages, most notably in ancient Rome, nineteenth-century California, and upstate New York in the 1960s.\n\nBy December 2004, when Allen Salkin's article about Festivus as a real holiday appeared in the New York Times, thousands of people around the world were celebrating Festivus with parties, grievance-airing, pole-erecting, beer-brewing and the invention of new Festivus rituals.\n\nFestivus is a non-denominational holiday that has no required rituals or totems, but many celebrants find the pole, the Airing of Grievances and the Feats of Strength essential, especially those Festivus-friendly folk who adhere to the Seinfeld orthodoxy.\n\nFestivus Pole\n\nAn unadorned length of lusterless metal or something that looks like metal, this central totemic element of Festivus can be mighty or meek. Some poles are pinky-short and some tetherball-tall. Erected on a lawn, balanced in a coffee can near a photocopier, stuck in a pail of rocks in the living room or suspended from fishing line on the front porch. the pole symbolizes nothing.\n\nThe Airing of Grievances\n\nLike everything else Festivus, the AOG has evolved some wild variations, but the core of it remains lashing into others and the world about how they have been disappointments. This usually brings participants into a circle of sorts in which each takes turns excoriating friends, enemies, relatives, acquaintances and strangers. When all who care to have taken a turn griping, there is no required hugging or making up.\n\nFeats of Strength\n\nThe FOS generally follows the AOG. Under the Seinfeld orthodoxy, Festivus is not over until the head of the household is wrestled to the floor and pinned. While there is an undeniable classic elegance to this, real world Festivus practitioners have developed other cathartic methods of discharging pent-up energy against one's fellows, including thumb wrestling and washer tossing. 8

what is ppf? economics Production Possibility Frontier. \nEfficiency is one of the central concepts of economics. Efficiency means absence of waste, or using the economy's resources as effectively as possible to satisfy people's needs and desires. More specifically, the economy is producing efficiently when it cannot produce more of one good without producing less of another good- that is, when it is on the Production -Possibility Frontier (PPF).\n\nThe Production- Possibility Frontier (or PPF) shows the maximum amounts of production that can be obtained by an economy, given the technical knowledge and quantity of inputs available. The PPF represents the menu of choices available to society. 4
Sometimes one hemisphere of my head will feel numb and "fall asleep."  Should I be concerned? This usually happens in my brain area, so it never reaches my neck.  First time it ever happened was when I was a child... and happens about once every month now. the same thing happens to me sometimes but it hurts in my right side and in to my right eye and i cant see out of that eye when that happens. I would see a doctor for it to i have not tolded anyone yet and i should do the same as you. 3

Why are there no "B" batteries?  There used to be "B" batteries in antique portable radios.  I believe that they were 45 Volts DC and were used to power vacuum tubes.  They are no longer needed for radios that plug into 110 Volt AC because a transformer can be used to obtain any needed voltage.  Radios that use chips need far less voltage than a B battery.  Incidentally it was called a battery because the casing contained multiple cells connected in series to boost the voltage, just as a cannon battery needs more than one cannon.  But see the source. 7
can you tell me easy methods for calculating rates (i am in jr. high school)? i've got a computers exam tomorrow (jan 25) \ni need easy ways of calculating rates in excel Generally you get rates by dividing change in position by the change in time.  Since differentiation like this tends to amplify noise, observation errors, etc., often some sort of filtering or averaging is used to smooth out the noise. 2
Where did all the water go after the great flood of noahs ark.?  muromets is correct. You can model this yourself using clay. On a cookie sheet, put a half inch of water. On top, put a 1/2 layer of rolled clay. This is what the earth was liked pre-flood. The earth was watered from below. Now break open the center and the water will burst forth (as Genesis describes) and now the clay is covered by the water as the clay sinks. Now pull the clay out toward the corners and the water will display into seas.\nIn order for the continental drift to occur properly, the earth would have had to expand, thus making physics of the covering of the earth with water and its later displacement to be quite possible. 1

Why does my heart hurt when my potassium is low?  There is a sodium potassium atpase enzyme, which is required for the contraction of the heart, the potassium leaves the muscle and sodium enters the muscle, along with sodium, calcium enters, which is required for contraction. \nIn effect when there is low potassium in the body, the heart hurts due to decreased calcium entry into the muscle. 3
When did religion stop a war? I.E. What good does religion actually bring to the world, it only seems to divide us and cause war. Beware of collapsing the two-- religion and those who follow religion. For I posit, that even without "religion", we would be divided over something or other. \n\nObserve two toddlers at play for a few hours and watch them fight over one toy. Very quickly you'll see, it is not their religion that has divided them, but their "idea" that they both own this toy. \n\nWe fight not because of religion, but because of our differing ideologies, beliefs, etc. Throw our heated emotions into the mix, and we can really be hostile, violent people.\n\nHence, don't vilify religion but take note of human nature. For that's what religion does, it illuminates our human nature in hopes that we might be empowered to "be our best" in spite of ourselves. 1

I dont understand my love life.I want to have a bf but whenever i have my mood easily get change.?  It is much easier to manage one person (yourself) than two people. Having a significant other doesn't always mean all sunshine and roses. What it does is it widens the spectrum of your emotions and your life. You will be happier than you ever felt, and other times sadder than you've ever been. 9
me and my mom and dad dont get along at all we always argue and their is never a happy medium what do i do ?  You should step up and be that medium. Be the peace maker. Let your mother have her way. She loves you and only wants to protect you. If you feel an argument coming on about something try to listen to what she has to say. You don't have to believe her or even understand her. Parents just want their kids to listen to what they have to say. I thin kthat it is possible to get along with your parents. I do most of the time. Find something you both enjoy doing and do t together. Like shopping! 9
There is a controversy that Jesus lived after crucifixion and died in Kashmir.  Is it true?  There are so many controversies regarding the actual life of Jesus, or lack thereof, because no one really knows what happened.  There is an extreme lack of physical evidence regarding his life.  The Bible wasn't written during his life, so even that's not a direct source.  You could set your life's work to prove any given controversy about Jesus and perhaps make some headway.  So in answer to your question, no one knows. 1
How do protons all stay together in the nucleus of an atom? If electrons are all repelling each other like crazy outside the nucleus, how is it that the protons can all sit next to eachother without spontaneously breaking apart? The strong force holds quarks together in combinations that make protons and neutrons.  It also holds the protons and neutrons together, but in a more subtle way, because protons and neutrons are color neutral.  This means that protons and neutrons don't have excess color charge (which determines the strength of the strong interaction), and by this logic shouldnt be attracted to each other.  The quarks are not in a point-like configuration, though, so each nucleon has a "dipole" and higher order moments. If you've never heard of this kind of thing, it's the same idea as the electric force holding electrically neutral atoms together to make chemical compounds.\n\nThe differences in mass between atoms and the sum of their particles is a consequence of the strong force... the strong force is not caused by the mass difference.  In fact, atoms above iron have a mass which is larger than the sum of their nucleons, while atoms below iron have mass that is smaller than the the sum of their nucleons.  That's why you can only break large atoms for energetic nuclear fission. 2

What happens when there is not enough water in a human body to run the Kreb's cycle in the same body?  If you don't have the little water needed for that, you're a dehydrated corpse.\n\nCondolences.\n\nEdit: to the next guy, the net reaction is\nAcetyl-CoA + 3 NAD+ + FAD + GDP + Pi + 3 H2O →\n\nCoA-SH + 3 NADH + H+ + FADH2 + GTP + 2 CO2 + 3 H+\n\nmeaning that water is, indeed, consumed; but the consumed amount of water is still far, far, far less than the amount required to solvate the whole system and suspend the enzymes. etc. 2
How do I encrypt my wireless router so that strangers wont connect to it?  There are different ways of securing your wireless network.  The most common methods are by using WEP or WPA-based authentication and encryption.  However, the steps to add security to your wireless network depends on the wireless router you are using.  Usually, the wireless router manufacturers provide software discs and manuals to do so.  Even if you don't have a manual, browse the software installation CD which might have come with your router, it usually contains a .pdf file for instructions.  If you have misplaced your disc, you can access their website or call the tech support of the wireless router manufacturer for detailed instructions on securing the network. 5

how resistance of bacteria to antibioticc emerges??  It emerges due to the antibiotic killing off all bacteria that dont have the natural resistance against the antibiotic in their DNA. Some bacteria is naturally resistant to antibiotic, and when it multiplies it passes this resistance onto its 'children'. Over time the bacteria which isnt resistant dies off, while the resistant bacteria remains unaffected. The result is an increased population of bacteria resistant to antibiotics. 7

Was there a popular predecessor to AOL?  There were lots of things around before AOL mostly things called BBS or bulletin board service, they were run by individuals, and their contents were varied, the largest network I remember was one called Prodigy which was like a very large BBS, but it had many of features that would look familiar today. It was a pay service but instead of paying a monthly fee, you had to pay by the hour, like many of the early internet services. 5
I have been trying for two weeks to find out who to contact in the goverment about headlice in school? The school nor the health department has do anything about this problem.Several kids in a local school has it.What do I do!!!??? Treat your child with a decent over the counter medication. \n\nIf more action is needed for this really rather mild concern, then contact the school's bosses (district HQ or school board, for example) and/or the county public health department.\n\nIf you are still unsatisfied, try a local news station or newspaper. \n\nI am unsure how big of a response you can expect from this however, so you may need to modify your expectations. 3
What is your understanding of what the tree of knowledge of good and evil was?  The Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil is Free Will, our ability to choose.  If God did not set that Tree in the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve would not have free will but would merely be robots.  God's ultimate plan was to give his creation the ability to choose.  Just like a parent would tell their child to beware of something, God did the same for Adam and Eve. God told them to not eat of the Tree just like a parent will tell a child not to do certain things because the parent may know more.  It doesn't mean that the child is not able to do it.  He/she can but the consequences that follow are entirely that child's responsibility.  Unfortunately in the case of Adam and Eve, the consequences of their decision had cosmic-sized consequences.  But the important point is that God wants freely willing people to have a relationship with him.  It's always been a choice and it will always be one.  That's my understanding and hopefully that helps. 1

Do I have the rights to claim my kids on my income tax if I pay child support? My ex-husband have custody of our 4 girls and I pay child support to him, and I need to know if he can stop me from claiming 2 or the 4 kids. I already claim them through the year. Now he is mad at me and said I couldn't claim them at the end of the year even though I pay him over 500.00 dollars a month.What are my rights? By law you can only claim a child if you pay for 51% or greater of their expenses and/or live with them for 51% or more of the year.\n\nThe exception is if the custodial parent allows you to claim them by signing Form 8332. The top source below is a guide for non-custodial parents and the second one is Form 8332. 10
how biodiversity is benificial for wildlife?  One way to look at biodiversity is to view it as the ammount of genetic variation in a population.  The greater the genetic varation is the more likely it is tha an individual in a population will, at random, have the genetic programing capable of overcoming an obstical.  For example, there are some frogs and some are lighter and some are darker and the population spreads into an area where plant cover is darker than the previous habitat. If there is a preadator that cannot see the darker ones because they blend into the plants better, the preadator will remove the lighter ones.  The darker ones will live and reproduce more offspring than the lighter ones.  These offspring  will be darker like thier parents, and in turn produce even more dark offspring.  The lighter ones will produce fewer and fewer each generation because they are getting eaten. If there was no variation in the population and all the frogs were lighter it is likely that the preadator could eat all the frogs and there would be no future generations. 4

What is the daily schedule(rise to bed) of a software professional working in United States?  It depends on what field you're in and how much experience you have.  I have about 10 years of experience and I work in a software development shop developing software for retail businesses.  I get up at 6 AM, take the kid to school by 7:30 and work from around 7:30 (school is VERY close to work) until around 5PM.  I do Aikido (martial arts) twice during the work week for a couple of hours.  The rest of the time I'm spending time with my family or studying to be a better developer.\n\nMany younger coders and those in the game development business work a LOT more hours.  Years ago I worked 50, 60 or even 70 hours a week.  That was too much time away from the family, so I worked myself into a better position.\n\nTo finish answering your question, I'm usually in bed by 11PM. 5

My roommate wants to move into her own place, but our lease isn't up for 6 months. Can she legally move out? She has offered to find another roommate to replace her, but it doesn't seem like I should have to live with some stranger.  She says she would just prefer to live on her own and closer to her job, etc. . . but we signed the lease together through July.  This is in Virginia. you will need to look at the language on your lease, but most likely you have what is called a "joint and several" lease.  if you have both signed the lease, this means that BOTH of you are responsible for the total rent.  if ONE of you skips town, then the OTHER one of you is responsible for the full amount.  you can read more about joint and several here:\nhttp://ezinearticles.com/?Lease-Contracts---The-Meaning-of-Joint-and-Several&id=18975\n\nthis is why it's important to only co-sign on a lease with someone you trust to not screw you.\n\nanyway, the answer to your question depends on what you mean by "legally".  she will not be in violation of any criminal code if she moves out.  however, if she stops paying rent to the landlord, the landlord can hold YOU responsible for the unpaid rent.  and if you don't pay it, they have the right to evict you, since that is a hell of a lot easier than suing her for her share of the rent.  you could claim that you're not responsible, in court, but most certainly the court will find in the landlord's favor when he shows them your joint-and-several lease with your name on it.\n\nif this were to happen, then *you* could turn around and sue your ex-roommate in this situation, in small-claims court, for her share of the rent.  most likely you only have a verbal agreement.  a verbal agreement IS a legally binding contract, but they are difficult to enforce since she could argue that she never made any such agreement with you.  \n\nhowever a copy of the lease with her name and signature on it would certainly imply some level of commitment on her part.  it is not a solid case, but it is possible you could win in small claims court against her.  as always, winning a lawsuit does not necessarily mean you'll see the money.  she could refuse to cough it up, and then you'd have to go through the process of having her wages garnished, and all of this legal stuff costs a lot of money.\n\nthe best thing for everyone is almost always to resolve this without going down the legal route.  you might consider finding a new roommate yourself - that way you could choose who you want to live with.  this would be cutting her a break, but remember that you are in the dangerous position of being hung out to dry if she just bails out.\n\nfinding an amicable solution where nobody gets screwed or goes to court is definitely your best answer.  if you don't think it's right that you have to do the work of finding a roommate, but you don't want to just let her choose, then see if she will compensate you for the work involved in finding her replacement.  then you will either have the new roomate sign a sub-lease with her, or go to the landlord and draw up a new lease with the 2 of you on it.\n\ngood luck! 10

friend had intestinal problems for 3 yrs body has not absorbed needed nutrients now feels betr has muscleaches has had problems for three yrs. doctors don't know exactly what's wrong.  has had many tests done.  his uncle has crohn's and started the same symptoms at about the same time in his life and the doctors did him the same way for years.  I don't think my friend's body has been able to absorb nutrients, b/c his body didn't keep the food long enough.  when this first started he lost 40 lbs. within 2 months.  he has since had times where he has had small patches of hair loss that grows back.  he has felt better and the intestinal symptoms have decreased (which happened to his uncle as well).  ever since he has been feeling better, his leg muscles ache terribly.  he compares it to growing pains. could this be his body trying to restore what it had been losing all this time? please tell your friend to get tested for crohn's,i also have it and this is a big possibility...i was mis-diagnosed for years and nothing that i was treated with helped at all,but when i was finaly dianosed with crohn's and got the proper treatment i started feeling better. 3
Why do Christians feel that their way is the only way? Why is it that they feel they have to convert everyone to their way of thinking?  Can't people have their own personal opinions and beliefs anymore? Jesus made it very clear that He was the only way to the Father. He told us to make this doctrine clear to you. If you have been told, politely tell the person trying to witness to you that you have heard the gospel message and that you have decided with your own free will to reject it. If they keep bugging you, tell them this. "Who saves, you or the Holy Spirit?" They will say, "The Holy Spirit". Then tell them, "Then best let Him handle my salvation and just pray for me... ok?"  If they keep bugging you, they are a cult trying to get converts to their kookie religion.\n\nOh and southern, you have it wrong. We ARE to judge those inside the church. (fruit inspectors) But we are not to judge those outside the church--ie condemn to hell. That is not our place. This is a very important point to remember because too many people tell us not to judge when we are commanded to do just that. - ref 1 Corinthians 5:12 1

how do psat and sat scores compare? I would like to know where I stand if I took my psat test how would I rate on the new sat test... SAT scores are typically somewhat higher (50-100 points overall) than PSAT scores.  Because you're learning all the time, right?  Also, the PSAT results come with a detailed analysis of where your weak spots were, so that a dedicated student can snag a practice book or surf on over to http://www.number2.com/ for some free test prep.  Think twice before spending tons of money and time on test prep; the list of schools that are de-emphasizing standardized tests is getting longer every year (this year's additions include Drew University in NJ and the College of the Holy Cross in MA). 4

I have obtained a Permanent Restraining Order against someone. How can I get local Courts to enforce it?  The exact procedures will vary by jurisdiction, but protection orders are normally enforced by the police and prosecuted by the district attorney's office.  Sometimes you need to provide a certified copy of the order to a centralized authority so any law enforcement agency can verify the existence of the order in order to enforce.\n\nIf the defendant was not present in court when the order was issued, you may need to arrange for a copy to be served on him or her.  You need to file the proof of service with the court and provide a copy to the agency that is the authority to verify the existence of the order. 10
Why should we allow senators and congressmen to remain in Washington? If politicians were residing in their home states, and conducted votes online or over the phone, wouldnt that make them more accessable to the people they represent and less accesable to lobbyists?  We are living in the 21st century people...lets take advantage? I agree with ghostofthe3stoges!\nCan we use Yahoo Answers to change the system?\nI think that should be the featured question. 10

why do we have to suffer when we love?i know that love without suffering doesn't exist but..however..?  There are many levels of suffering when loving. For instance, when parents loose a childe, when a spouse looses his or her partner to accident or decease. And while it's been said that you cannot experience love if you don't experience suffering, or experience the night without a day, etc., it's really just a matter of  embracing everything life throws at you. Problems are nothing but bumps on the road that tell you, "avoid me in the future". To me real suffering has nothing to do with love per say. It has to do with circumstances like poverty, decease, injustice and so on, and even then, there is always the possibility of getting out of that. 9

why did the banks fail during the great depression?  Basically, people were spending what they did not have.  It was a time of easy credit - people borrowed in their personal life and they borrowed to buy stocks - they bought on margin, meaning they only paid for a percentage, say 10%, of the stocks and borrowed the rest.\n\nWhen the value of the stock went down, they needed to pay the investment center money to keep that percentage.  Say they bought a stock worth $100 and paid $10 and borrowed $90.  That stock dropped to $50 and the bank was only willing to loan them 90% or $45 of that, so they had to pay $90 - $45 = $45.\n\nOne person couldn't afford to pay and they defaulted.   It cascaded from there like dominoes - as they couldn't afford to pay their debts, other people weren't getting paid and couldn't pay their debts.\n\nThe times before the great depression were pretty corrupt with some big money players manipulating the markets - getting together to buy stock and make it look like it was a good buy and going to go up, then when the public bought it and it went up, they all sold out and made money.\n\nToo much debt always brings a risk of recession or depression.  Just like today. 4

According to Spendaholics what takes up most of governments spending today?  Health and Human Services (Which includes Urban Development, and Welfare) comes in at number one with a yearly projected budget of 650 Billion Dollars. Department of Defense is number two with a projected budget of around 515 Billion Dollars, and the Treasury Department is number 3 with a projected budget of 415 Billion Dollars (mostly due to the interest we pay on the national debt.)\n\nThe next largest after that is a huge drop with the Department of Agriculture with a projected budget of around 90 Billion.\n\n\nPlease Note that Social Security is not part of the Federal Budget general fund. It is a separate account and has its own source of income. As a comparison though, Social Security has an estimated budget of 500 Billion. \n\nFission 10

why dont you liberals read the question before answering??? i did not ask WHY you think bush should not be elected president for another four years, i asked what would be the blocks in the way of this i dont care about your opinion of him Bush can not be re-elected President because he has already served his two terms... and no one can serve as President for more than 10 years. (the president can not serve a 3rd term because of the 22nd Amendment) \n\n\nTo answer the reworded question... my guess is they see it refers to Bush or the current government and just need to make sure they get a JAB in. 10

why are some people fickle minded and pry into others personal affairs? people dont leave u alone they dont like ur freedom of thoughts and try invading ur thoughts even.

When dealing with others you have to do just that, deal with it. 1
I want to run for President of the United States. NO SERIOUSLY! Question in the details.? 4 things are required to become Pres'.\nMust be born in the U.S.\nMust have lived here at least 14 years.\nMust be 35 yrs of age. I still have a few years yet, but it's never too early to start something this big.\nMust be Elected.\n\nI am most decidedly INDEPENDENT. Therefor, it would be best for me to run an independent party campaign, rather than try to win a party nomination. What I need to know is where to begin. I understand I will have to "jump through certain hoops" such as acquiring a certain number of signitures for nomination. etc...  What I need to know is exactly what steps I need to take, with whom I may need to register, how many signitures are required, are they required to be on a specific form or letterhead who do they need to be from, and who do I give them to.  also what are the other requirements? \n\nIf someone could provide me with this information, provide me with a link to a website where I can get this information, or both, I would greatly appreciate it. It has been almost a century since a third party had enough traction to run a competive race.  A party nomination would be best.\n\nThe first thing to do is volunteer for campaigns.  Then donate money to mainstream canidates.  Have friends that are way more intellegent than you because they are going to be your best advisors.\n\nRead Edmund Burke, John Locke, Machevelli, the Federalist Papers, writings of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and least of all the communist manefesto just so you know what socialists believe.\n\nFollow current events, but when you do ask yourself "why is this person lying to me?"  It will help you figure out what a person's adgenda is.\n\nStudy Truman's decision on dropping the nuclear bombs in case you would ever have to make that decision.\n\nTake up hunting, golf, and fishing.  Those things will help you relate to everyone. 10

Why are drummers at live concerts often playing behind a perspex shield? Just watching a Rod Stewart concert. And as at many other concerts the drummer is hidden behind a shield of perpex. Was wondering why? Drums are loud and will bleed over to the vocal mics in front of them. The sheild will block the sound from resonating out. This allows the soundman control over the mix. 8

What is the best rap song or album???  There's such a wide variety of rap, my advice would be to listen to a bunch of different things until you find what you like.  There's just such a different span ranging from the oldschool stuff of the 80s and 90s to the current scene.  Some favorites off the top of my head that I would reccomend:\n\nOutkast - pretty much anything.  I like the older albums better, check out "Stankonia" for one.\nWu-Tang Clan, NWA, old Snoop Dog, Dr Dre - I like a lot of the older styles of these.\nEminem - he does a lot of different things, but it's good.  Check out old and new stuff.\nThe Roots - again, a group thats unique, but sounds really cool\nLudacris - I like his rapping style and flow...I dunno, it just catches my ear 8
How to find grants and/or scholarships to go back to school? I would like to go back to school, out of state.  I would like to know which website is the best to find grants and or scholarships to pay for this.  If someone out there could help me with this, it would be greatly appreciated. Don't be afraid to call local colleges financial aid offices, they should be able to tell you what options are available, and maybe even help you apply, or at least point you in the right direction....and you can always look on the net under scholarships, I imagine if you look under grants, you'll be getting alot of unwanted emails! so  I'd try scholarships first. 4

should a 85 yearold woman with dementia who hasbeen off her synthroid for 2yrs go back on it she has symptoms? She is in hospice, was not expected to live more than 6 mos. that was two years ago.  At that time they took her off all meds including the synthroid. She is doing pretty well now, but does have symptoms of hypothyroidism.  Should she be put back on now? If she's in hospice for whatever reason, then the focus of your care and healthcare efforts should be comfort.  I don't know what symptoms she may be having, but if treatment of those symptoms by reversing hypothyroidism can make her more comfortable, then it should be done.  However, I would not add a medicine back unless there is a clear reason to do so. 3

Is family law or divorce cases the only place you find the subject of annullment and where is it can i find it I new at this I'm studying to be a paralegal. thanks for all your help.lol Annulment is a procedure of the Catholic church whereby a marriage is considered to have been "null" from the beginning because of some problem ... so from God's point of view, the marriage was not a true marriage when the vows were exchanged.  It looks from an examination of my search page as though the pages explaining the causes for annulment aren't available anymore(!)  This is too bad, as there are many causes, including fraud (somebody tells you they're rich before you marry them, then afterwards it turns out they aren't), mental incompetence (their vow is invalid 'cause they can't think straight), I think even not having been married in the Catholic church was a reason (I had copied it all out a few years back).  Apparently there are also civil annulments in some states.  Here's one webpage ...\nhttp://marriage.about.com/od/annulments/ 10
What are puka shells? What type of shell are they?  Where do they come from? Puka-Puka, is a coral atoll in the northeastern Tuamotu Archipelago, sometimes included as a member of the Disappointment Islands. It is located at 14° 49' S. lat. and 138° 48' W. long.\n\nThe low coral islands are dry and sparsely populated: according to the 2002 census, the total population was 197. The chief town is Te One Mahina, with about 110 inhabitants.\n\nUnlike the rest of the Tuamotus, the language of the islands, Pukapukan, is Marquesic.\n\nPuka Puka was the first of the Tuamotus sighted by Ferdinand Magellan in 1521. The islands were devastated by a typhoon in 1996, however, with French assistance, Te One Mahina has been rebuilt. 2
what is depo? tell me about it Depo-Provera is an injection that works exactly the same way as Norplant -- as a time-release progesterone. One injection of Depo-Provera in the muscle of the arm or buttocks protects you against pregnancy for three months.it prevents pregnancy by hindering ovulation and making the lining of the uterus too thin for the egg to implant itself. Other than IUDs and permanent sterilization (tubal ligation or hysterectomy), Depo Provera is the only contraceptive that works with only periodic use.The main side effect reported with Depo Provera is bleeding. Many women experience unpredictable, periodic flow during the first three to nine months of use. This occurs because the uterine lining becomes too thin in some women, and blood breaks through. Almost all women stop bleeding by the ninth month, provided that they receive regular injections every three months.\n\nOther common side effects are depression, weight gain, and bloating. Unfortunately Depo Provera can't be reversed once it's injected, so women who experience these symptoms can only wait until the injection wears off in three months. Women who want to "test the water" before receiving a shot of Depo Provera can try taking oral, progesterone-only birth control pills for a while. If a woman doesn't experience side effects from these, she probably won't from Depo Provera either.\n\nMost women return to their normal periods and normal fertility four to six months after the last Depo Provera injection. Insurance coverage for all birth control, including Depo Provera, varies by plan, so check with your doctor and insurer regarding costs. 3

What is the "true meaning" of life?  There isn't a true meaning of life, any more than there is a true meaning of rocks, or a true meaning of gravity.\n\nThis is not the same thing as saying life is pointless or worthless. It's what you aim for that counts - as the saying goes, shoot for the moon, and even if you miss you reach the stars. You have to agree with yourself which aims make sense, where you want to go - nobody can do this for you, they won't be the right ones. For me, coming to terms with the fact I can't do everything was the first step towards realising I can do something. \n\nMay you work out what your own personal something is, and exceed it! 7
((n+e)/n)^n=?     when n=too big?  The people who said e^e appear to be correct.\n\nThis is a L'Hopital's rule problem.\n\nf(x) = ((x+e)/x)^x = (1+e/x)^x.\n\nLet y = e/x.\nThen  lim (x->inf) f(x) = (1+e/x)^x \nis the same as\n\nlim (y->0) f(y) = lim (1+y)^(e/y)\n\nInstead of  lim (y->0) f(y)\nlook at lim (y->0) ln(f(y))\n\nln(f(x) = (e/y)ln(1+y) = e(ln(1+y))/y\n\nlim y->0 ln(f(y)) is the form 0/0 so apply L'Hopital\n\nlim y->0 e(ln(1+y))/y = lim e(1/(1+y))/1 = e\n\nlim y->0 ln(f(y)) = e, lim y->0 f(y) = e^e. 2
If I had 7 apples and I gave you 3, how many teeth would a canary have?  What a pity that you cannot answer your own question! I'm getting curious...\n\nIt seems to be a question in pure logics rather than arithmetics: as you don't know me you cannot give me any apple (first proposition: False) \nBut canaries don't have teeth (second proposition: false)\n\nSo the implication is true... \n\nOtherwise, being the postulate contradictory, any proposition can be logically proven: including "lower than 3 and higher than 5"\n\nI'm giving numbers? 2
What type of HDTV should I get. I have a room approx. 16x12, and I will sit app. 6 ft away.?  Well if I've worked this out correctly and assuming that you'll be watching HDTV on this screen then you should be looking at approx 42".\nFormula is:\n\nFor Cable Antenna or Video tape Multiply the number of feet between you and the screen by 4 inches. \n\nFor DVD or Satellite Multiply the number of feet between you and the screen by 6 inches. \n\nFor HDTV Multiply the number of feet between you and the screen by 7 inches.\n\nHope this helps 8

What is the best way to make it into the NHL? What are some ways of getting scouted other than playing in college. is there ever an open tryout opportunity? is there an age limit?

From there you could be recruited by a semi-pro team.\n\nI suspect NHL tryouts are by invitation only. 6

Intel or AMD? And Why? Its really like Coke or Pepsi. I, myslef have always had Intel. But that not b/c I like it but just because I have found better deals with PCs or Laptops that Intels in them. Also some say that AMD is better becasue it takes less battier to run them. So they would be better on a Laptop then an Intel. So I thought I would ask other people out there what you think? It also depends on what you want to do with the laptop.\n\nIntel provides the Pentium M and the Centrino.  AMD offers the Sempron and the Turion.\n\nBetween the 2, Intel leads the pack when it comes to battery life.  However, the Sempron and Pentium M/Centrino run pretty much neck-to-neck in that area.\n\nThe Turion offers the only 64 bit processor in a laptop, but it gives up battery life in order to do this.  In fact, many reviews of the newest generation of processors place Intel barely above AMD, mostly because of battery.  They also wonder why Intel is so slow to offer 64 bit processors. 5

How important does a person have to be before they are considered assassinated instead of just murdered?  I love the way you worded this question! It made me laugh.\n\nAssassinated = kill a prominent POLITICAL person. So either they are a politician, or you’re killing was politically motivated (like the athletes in Munich.)\n\nWhether it is an assassination or not has more to do with the killer than the killee, it's about motivation. 7

Why do Republicans hate illegal immigrants? Why do Republicans hate immigrants so much?\n\nImmigrants come to this country and are forced to take lower paying jobs.  \n\nIf I was a rich Republican fat cat with a degree from Yale, I would never fear that an immigrant could ever steal my job.  I would want more immigrants to provide cheap labor for my company.  Honestly, what is the harm is a poor immigrant wants to come to America? First of all you need to define your terms. in your question you stated "hate" and "illegal". In your support, you stated "immigrants". There is a VERY large difference.\n\nBasically that illegals are here ILLEGALLY!\n\nIt appears that your statements are based on a vile dislike of the word "Republican". Illegals do not steal the jobs of fat cat Republicans, they steal them from the high school kid next door trying to save for college or buy his first car. they steal from the public because they demand serviuces and goods but are not taxed to support those goods and services. In essence, they arent pulling their own weight. Are you stating that you approve of freeloaders? \n\nAs an aside, did you know that if you added up the number of people who you consider fat cats, did you know that 3 of every 4 fat cats are liberal democrats, as stated by the federal General Accounting Office? I use the word "rich" here, and i define it as anyone making over half a million dollars a year.\n\nSo i recommend that you define your terms and your position before you go firing volleys based on hate, and make sure your arguments are complete and accurate. 10
causes of same sex marriage? may i knoe the caeses of commiting in same sex marriage and benifits of it Just like any other marriage: two people decide they want to commit their lives to one another, and share spousal rights and responsibilities.\n\n\nFor example, this includes the right to be with a loved one during an illness, and make critical decisions about their care, just like any other spouse would.  Without marriage, some hospitals would only aknowledge the "next of kin", who may be totally removed from the person's wishes. 4

how did they chose the date of martin luther king day?  The Birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr. , often called Martin Luther King Day, is a United States holiday honoring the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., observed on the third Monday of January each year, around the time of King's birthday, January 15. It is the only United States federal holiday commemorating an African-American.\n\nThe holiday was the result of a large-scale campaign headed by a number of activists. One of the most notable of these was musician Stevie Wonder, who released the single "Happy Birthday" to popularize the campaign in 1980 and hosted the Rally for Peace Press Conference in 1981.\n\nOpposition to the Bill was led by Sen. Jesse Helms who questioned whether King was important enough to receive such an honor. He was also critical of King's opposition to the Vietnam War and alleged Communist connections.\n\nAt the White House Rose Garden on November 2, 1983, U.S. President Ronald Reagan signed a bill creating a federal holiday to honor King. It was observed for the first time on January 20, 1986.\n\nOn January 18, 1999, for the first time, Martin Luther King Day was officially observed in all fifty U.S. states. The day is marked by demonstrations for peace, social justice and racial and class equality, as well as a national day of volunteer community service.\n\nOn January 16, 2006, Greenville County, South Carolina, was the last county in the U.S. to officially adopt Martin Luther King Day as a paid holiday. 1

What is the difference between ch.7& ch.13 bankruptcy and how long does it stay on your credit report?  Chapter 7\n\nChapter 7 bankruptcy, sometimes call a straight bankruptcy is a liquidation proceeding. The debtor turns over all non-exempt property to the bankruptcy trustee who then converts it to cash for distribution to the creditors. The debtor receives a discharge of all dischargeable debts usually within four months. In the vast majority of cases the debtor has no assets that he would lose so Chapter 7 will give that person a relatively quick "fresh start".\n\nOne of the main purposes of Bankruptcy Law is to give a person, who is hopelessly burdened with debt, a fresh start by wiping out his or her debts.\n\nChapter 13\n\nChapter 13 Bankruptcy is also known as a reorganization bankruptcy. Chapter13 bankruptcy is filed by individuals who want to pay off their debts over a period of three to five years. This type of bankruptcy appeals to individuals who have non-exempt property that they want to keep. It is also only an option for individuals who have predictable income and whose income is sufficient to pay their reasonable expenses with some amount left over to pay off their debts. More information on Chapter 13.\n\nNew Bankruptcy Law taking effect on October 17, 2005: The major intent of bankruptcy reform is to require people, who can afford to make some payments towards their debt, to make these payments, while still affording them the right to have the rest of their debt erased. These people MUST file Chapter 13. \n\nCredit Report\n\nBankruptcy filings are public records.  However, under normal circumstances, no one will know you went bankrupt. The Credit Bureaus will record your bankruptcy and it will remain on your credit record for 10 years. 7

How do sponges in the sea multiply?  Sponges can multiply sexually or asexually.  Asexually a piece can bud off, float away, take root elsewhere, and begin to grow.  Sexually spermatozoa can swim through the water, find egg cells on another sponge, and fertilize the egg.  The result is a motile larva which can swim away and take root elsewhere, growing into a new sponge. 2

has anyone done the Master Cleansing 10-day cleansing fast? It is a 10-day fast in which you just drink lemonade w/ maple syrup and cayenne pepper, and it's said to do wonders to your body and cleanse it of all toxins and waste. I have done it a few times, as have several friends.  I highly recommend it.  You get a lot of yucky stuff out, lose about 1.5 lbs a day, feel good, and tend to eat healthier (and less) afterwards.\n\nYou will probably not feel good for the first 3 days.  After that, it gets much better.  More info is here:\n\nhttp://curezone.com/forums/f.asp?f=478 3

do you think that the earth will be destroyed someday...?? just wondering... Absolutely.  \n\nHow long depends on what you consider destroyed.   Chances are we'll be long gone before the planet is left abandoned by our own dieing sun which is about 1/2 way through it's life cycle.  From the linked Wikipedia artical, it claims that the earth won't be engulfed and vaporized by the sun, but it won't be a good thing one way or the other.\n\nWhat happens after we have no sun is tough to say, but you could probably argue that at that point if not long before the earth would be unable to support life. 2

i have a interest in building computers maybe fixing them  what College major should i choose??  I think that these are often two separate majors.\n\nIf you want to build computers (from a design perspective) then computer science or computer engineering is probably the best major. Here is an example page from Washington University Dept of Computer Science and Engineering: http://www.cs.washington.edu/\n\nComputer repair is not necessarily a part of these majors. Repair is more often part of a computer technician training program that is typically part of an associates degree program at at community college. Take a look there.\n\nOf course, one strategy would be to get your four year degree in computer science or computer engineering and then take courses in repair after you graduate from the four year program. Here is an example of one of these certificate program:\nhttp://www.lagcc.cuny.edu/ace/program.asp?Program=Computer+Repair+Certificate+Program\n\nHope this helps. 4

What are the dangers of Cigarette Smoking?  I could copy and paste a ton of information in this box if I were just looking to give you the longest answer so I would get picked for best answer, but I'd rather you were well-informed.  The information I have to offer you is extremely extensive and so it can't all be posted here.  I have included a link.  The information that you are looking for will be on the left-hand side of the page, under the heading, "How Tobacco Destroys the Body."  If you know someone who is a smoker, this site is a wonderful resource for knowledge and information on the effects of smoking and how to quit.  I should know.  I smoked for 7 years and I quit one year ago.  Best of luck to you. 3

are stds common in this world of having multiple sex partners and not considering the consequences?  Depends on what you consider common to be.  About 1% of the US population has HIV now.  That's not common in my book but I wouldn't want to have unprotected sex with that one out of a hundred.  About 25% of women in the US have herpes II - thats really common.  About 20% of men have herpes II.  About 0.5% of the US population has hepatitis C.  Again not common but very deadly if you get it.  Interestingly, bacterial stds like syphillis etc. are less prevalent in this day and age of antibiotics, even though casual sex is much more common than it was 50 or 100 years ago. 3

Which of these team will win the world cup? Germany, France, Italy, Spain, England or the US?  If I had to pick a team out of this group to win, or at least go furthest, I'd pick Germany.  Here's how I rate all these teams' chances.\n\nGermany: Were runners up at last world cup in Korea/Japan.  Not as strong as legendary West (or unified) Germany teams of the past, but will benefit from being hosts.  Need more inspired performances from captain Michael Ballack.\n\nFrance: Another footballing power temporarily underperforming.  Not as dominant as the team from 1998 to 2000.  Zidane's influence is on the wane.  Henry and Trezeguet don't seem to reproduce club form on international stage.\n\nItaly: Have not actually watched Italy live for a while but somehow the same stars seem to be in the squad every time I check.  Euro 2004 and World Cup 2002 were a bit of a disappointment for them.  Seemingly no new young star around to energize.\n\nSpain: Best wishes to the Spanish supporters who have posted.  However, if any team needs to shake the tag of "perennial underachievers", it's them.  Raul, their talisman, is currently injured.  Morientes and Mendieta, among the stars of the 2002 campaign, are blowing hot and cold in England.  Torres to step up?\n\nEngland: Wayne Rooney should carry them pretty far but a part of me says they'll be up a goal in the second half of a knock-out stage match and the manager (Eriksson) will play his usual death-knell move and bring on Phil Neville, Owen Hargreaves, and Kieron Dyer (middling midfielders), leading to a reversal.\n\nUS: I believe they drew a tough group.  Then again, they upset Portugal at the last world cup.  Much depends on whether the core of talents like Donovan, Beasley and McBride can carry them again. 6
Would you delete my yahoo account, please, asap?  Long story short : https://edit.yahoo.com/config/delete_user\n\nTwo ways to delete your Yahoo Account\n\n(1) Get it deleted by inactivity\n(2) Terminate your account manually\n\nFor the first method, just don't login to your account for 4 months, and your account gets deleted. But the waiting period is quiet long. It is a good policy by Yahoo, as it helps maintain an accurate number of users. I remember, when Hotmail used to brag about in its initial days about its huge userbase, most of its accounts were never used by users(who had registered themselves to get a taste of what email is called). Yahoo always gave an accurate picture. Also, for common usernames like amitgupta, emmacooper, etc which are never available (due to large no of people having these names), a chance is available to the new users to get such usernames from users who are inactive( which generally have to be registered as emmacooper1232005 due to unavailability)\n\nFor the second method, I gave you the link above. The advantage is that your account is terminated instantaneously. You can read the explaination at http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/edit/edit-23.html 5

WHAT IS THE DANGER OF MASS BUILD-UP ON THE ADRENAL GLAND?  The adrenal gland is reponsible for alot of hormone (epinephrine, norepinephrine or adrenaline)(sex hormones and also cortisol and aldosterone.  Any one of these hormones can build up causing life threatening problems.\n\nThe most serious would be a tumor that increases the amount of adrenaline because it raises your blood pressure and heart rate and you can die from that. 3

what do girl's like most about a guy?  His eyes and his smile/teeth and lips. I generally like a guy who can look after his general appearance and not look scruffy all the time. A guy who looks good is a guy who takes pride in himself. Other than that I love guys who can teach me something worthwile. Empty vessles never get far with me. There have been some instances where the guy didn't have a nice smile or beautiful eyes but I found myself attracted to him because of his intelligence. A guy who can't take a stand and is too much of a coward to debate with me is not worth my time. It's good to have an opinion about something (even if the opinion is biased or narrow minded, that is how we learn from each other.) 9

Why is there so much bloodshed in Isreal between Muslims and Jews? I recently watched the new Steven Spielberg movie entitled "Munich". My family is German Jewish and some realitive suffered in Auswitz nazi death camps durring the Holocost. I was seeking to find answers from my own family line when I keep comming upon all of this horrid bloodshed and over what? can anyone expound for me this history and why its so hot over there? Why all the bloodshed and is peace possible? I do feel for my own people but I do not condone the masacre of people. Since I was a child I have always been taught the teachings of Christ concerning Love and forgiveness and living in peace. So in the land from where those teachings originated, why aren't they doing this? I really want to know and I want to know just what it is they would all die for like this? Does anyone know or can anyone expound for me these very issues so I might understand why my people resort to these things? This is a thorny question one that no one has found an acceptable compromise to. The begining or Israeli and Palestinian strife came around the end of World War 2. Before then the state of Israel was not even in existance but through lobbying by prominent jews in America and due to a British promise to set up a homeland for displaced European Jews, the state of Israel was founded in Palestine in the British Mandate. Isreal has based this on the pretext that Isreal is the promised land that Moses led the Jewish tribes to after the Exodus and during the time of Babylon and Rome the people were once again exiled by the new conqurers and this the Jews have been a displaced people within Europe ever since. One argument that Israel was founded illegally on land that has already been inhabited by Arabs and thus they are the occupying force and displacing the Arabs. Israelis content that it is their right to have a homeland in the promised land and thus justified for occupation. The animosity intensified after Israel declared independance and thus 6 adjacent Arab states declared war to prevent the formalization of a Zionist state in the Midst of an Arab sea. Isreal prevaled and even captured larger tracts of territory which included the Sinai Peninsular from Egypt, Golan Heights from Syria and small tracts from lebanon. The Yom Kippur War later was proven to be a Israeli victory. Finally Egypt sign a peace treaty through the Camp David Accord whereby Sinai was returned to Egypt and formal recognization of Isreal was acknowledge. At present Palestine consists of the Gaza strip and the West Bank, Jerusalem is still a contested site whereby both states claim it as their capital. Years of infighting from the Hezbollah led by Yasser Arrafat which uses guerilla tactics and suicide bombers targetting US and Israeli sites have seen retaliation by Israel through forced demolition and targeted killing of 'terrorists/freedom fighters'. Also zealots and ultra orthodox jews erecting squatters within clearly marked territories belonging to the Palestine has caused frictions. To date both sides are still at war and peace accords don't last as seen by the last roadmap to peace initiative. It would seem only a miracle would unite these two foes together in peace. 10

Isn’t an anarchist organization oxymoronic?  No.  Anarchists don't believe that no groups or organizations exist, but in the idea that authority rests in the individual rather than society/government.

Do you think that the Super Bowl should be played outside in cold climates? Why or why not? Cold climates included Chicago, Denver, Seattle, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, New Jersey (Where both New York Giants and Jets play), Buffalo, Foxborough (where the New England Patriots play), Kansas City, Seattle, and Landover, MD (where the Washington Redskins play). I do think the Super Bowl should be played outside in cold climates. I love the fact that the weather can be a part of the game and I wish the NFL would give Northern teams without domes a chance to host the Super Bowl. I don't believe that playing in the cold (or snow) is an unfair disadvantage to Southern teams. Players for southern college teams travel north to play during the regular season and in bowl games, so they have experience playing in the cold. And quite a few NFL players went to college or grew up in the north, so they're used to the cold. 6

However, to burn fat, it is necessary to also do some cardio (i.e., treadmill or running).  Otherwise, you can have a nice layer of fat over your muscular abs. 3

If we made a hollow sphere of two mirrror with the refelcting face inside and the transparent face out? and if a ray of light entered it what will happen to it?Will it stay stuck there till the sphere is broken or will the energy of the ray build up on continuous reflection til the sphere breaks unable to contain it??(i accept other possiblities too) Unless the reflective surface is perfect (which is impossible in the real world) the light will loose a little energy with each reflection (the mirror will heat up a little), and in a very short time the light will just get redder until it is merged into whatever infrared energy is inside the sphere. 2

What is scientology? Can you name some celebs who follow it? Scientology is a system of beliefs, teachings and rituals, originally established as a secular philosophy in 1952 by science-fiction author L. Ron Hubbard, then recharacterized by him in 1953 as an "applied religious philosophy."\n\nScientology is officially represented by the controversial Church of Scientology. The Church presents itself as a non-profit religious organization dedicated to encouraging development of the human spirit. Providing counseling and rehabilitation programs, the Church offers itself as an alternative to psychiatry, which Scientologists believe to be a barbaric and corrupt profession. [1] (http://www.scientology.org/en_US/religion/heritage/pg011.html) Church spokespeople attest that Hubbard's teaching (called "technology" or "tech") has freed them from drug and alcohol addictions, depression, learning disabilities, mental disorders and other problems.\n\nScientology, however, has been the object of many allegations that sharply contradict the Church's self-description. Critics—including officials and the courts of several countries—have characterized the Church of Scientology as an unscrupulous commercial organization; it has often been described not as a religion, but a man-made cult that harasses its critics and exploits its members. Many of the Church's most controversial actions are, critics argue, a direct reflection of Hubbard's Scientology teachings.\n\nOrigins of Scientology\n\nScientology was expanded and reworked from Dianetics [2] (http://www.neuereligion.de/ENG/Wolf/pg6.htm), an earlier system of self-improvement techniques originally set out by Hubbard in the 1950 book, Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health. Immediately prior to this work, Hubbard was intensively involved with the occultist Jack Parsons in performing the occult rites developed by Aleister Crowley. Some critics have seen many similarities in Hubbard's writings to the doctrines of Crowley [3] (http://www.xenu.net/archive/lrhbare/lrhbare08.html).\n\nBy the mid-1950s, Hubbard had relegated Dianetics to being a sub-study of Scientology, although it is still promoted and delivered by Scientology organizations. The chief difference between the two is that Dianetics is explicitly secular, focused on the individual's present life and dealing with physical and mental or emotional problems, whereas Scientology adopts a more overtly religious approach [4] (http://victorian.fortunecity.com/finsbury/124/last.htm) focused on dealing with spiritual issues spanning multiple past lives as well as the present day.\n\nHubbard was repeatedly accused of adopting a religious facade for Scientology in order for the organization to maintain tax-exempt status and avoid prosecution for false medical claims; these accusations have dogged the Church of Scientology to the present day, bolstered by numerous accounts from Hubbard's fellow science-fiction authors that on various occasions he stated that the way to get rich was to start a religion [5] (http://www.bible.ca/scientology-1million-start-a-religion.htm).\n\nThe word scientology has a history of its own. Although nowadays associated almost exclusively with Hubbard's work, it was coined by the philologist Alan Upward in 1907 as a synonym for "pseudoscience". [6] (http://www.instinct.org/texts/bluesky/bs3-4.htm) In 1934, the Argentine-German writer Anastasius Nordenholz published a book using the word positively: Scientologie, Wissenschaft von der Beschaffenheit und der Tauglichkeit des Wissens, or Scientology, Science of the Constitution and Usefulness of Knowledge. [7] (http://www.scientologie.de/scientologie/index.htm) Nordenholz's book is a study of consciousness, and its usage of the word is not greatly different from Hubbard's definition, "knowing how to know". However, it is not clear to what extent Hubbard was aware of these earlier usages. The word itself is a pairing of the Latin word sc 1

what are the contrubations of science to improve our lives?  Science is a method involving making assumptions and proving them right or wrong based upon the gathering of data.\nScientists are people who use this method to understand the physical universe and discover new information which can be used by others.\nScience itself has improved nothing.  Scientists have developed many things which help us in our day to day lives.  You do not need me to make this list. 2

What would the square footage be for an octagon with 72feet sides?  So you've got an eight-sided figure and each side is 72-feet.  If you draw horizontal and vertical lines from each vertex (the angles where sides meet) to the other side of the octagon, you'll see that the octagon can be split up into one large square (in the center), four rectangles (up, down, left and right), and four triangles (in the corners).  You following me?  Get out a pencil and get to it!  Okay.  So what are lengths of your square's sides?  You'll note that the square has 72-foot sides, just like the original octagon.  Since you know how to find the area of the square, you're on your way.\n\nNext.  you have four rectangles, each with a length of 72-feet, but the short end - the width, how do we figure out the width of the rectangle?  Okay.  Look at your triangles.  Each triangle has one side of 72 feet - the side which is the outside of the octagon - and then two equal sides - it's an isosceles triangle with a 90-degree angle.\n\nOkay, time to call on pythagoras.  Pythagorean theorem states that a^2 + b^2 = c^2.  What that means is this: If you take the length of sides a and b (the ones we don't know) and square them, and add them together, the answer will be 72-squared (side C).  Too bad I'm not there with you to make this part easier to understand.  We know that a and b are equal in this case because our triangle is isosceles.  Therefore, 2x^2 is equal to 72^2.  This gives us a messy equation wherein our answer is, x is ROUGHLY equal to 51 feet.\n\nSo.  You have a square with sides 72 feet long.  You have 4 rectangles each with length 72 and width 51.  You have 4 triangles each with base 51 feet and height 72 feet.  You know that squares and rectangles have an area equal to length times width, and triangles have an area equal to one-half base times height.\n\nCalculate the area for your 9 figures and add them together.  THAT will be the square footage of your octagon.\n\nWhat... did you think I was going to do it ALL for you? 2
Do plants feel? Do plants have nervous responses (of a sort) similar to those of animals? Bose was a leading physicist of his age and pioneered the investigation of microwave optics in the late 1800s. He made the first public demonstration of radio communication and is also credited with proving plants have nervous responses similar to those of animals.\n\n\n--Indo-Asian News Service\n\nFor clarifications/queries, please contact IANS NEWS DESK at \n2616-5778/8546, 2617-3369 or mail us at\nsupport@eians.com\nDr.J.C.BOSE\n \n \n \nChallenges\n\nWhen anything new is discovered, there will always be people who question it. The results of Bose's work, too, were not accepted by all. There were people who challenged them and even said that there was not much truth in them. Bose gave a lecture at the Linnean Society next year to a gathering of scientists. He explained with suitable experiments how plants respond to stimuli. Even those who had challenged him could not find fault with his experiments or conclusions.\n\nThere is an interesting story about a demonstration that Bose gave in England. On that day he wanted to show some new things that he had found out. He had come to the conclusion that plants can feel pain like animals; that when we pinch them they suffer; and that they die in a few minutes after they are poisoned. Bose wanted to show experiments to prove these conclusions. A number of scientists and other leading men and women had gathered to hear him. Bose started the experiments by injecting poison into a plant. The plant should have shown signs of death in a few minutes. On the contrary, nothing happened. The learned audience started laughing. Even at this adverse moment Bose showed admirable calmness. He thought quickly. The poison that he injected into the plant did not kill it. So, he supposed that it would not hurt him also. With full confidence he got ready to inject the poison into himself. At that instant a man got up and confessed that instead of poison he had put similar colored water. Now, Bose conducted the experiment again with real poison, whereupon the plant withered and died as expected.\n\nJagadishchandra Bose continued his work and made new discoveries. He found that plants shrink a little during the night. He found out why plants always grow towards light even if they have to bend. He also found out the reason why some plants grow straight and some do not. He explained that this was due to the 'pulsation' in plants. This pulsation quickens by heat and slows down by cold in plants.\n\nJagadishchandra Bose did remarkable work, - and scientists outside India had honoured him. Yet there were people who opposed him. As a result even the Royal Society delayed publishing his valuable work in its publications, But nothing could make him give up his work. He was sure that years of research had led him to the truth. So he did not feel that it was very necessary to depend on scientific journals only. He wrote books and published them on his own.\n\nBy this time Bose had made a name for himself as a great scientist. The instruments he had developed were being used in some Western countries too. He visited Europe and America in 1907 and 1914; scientific institutions invited him to explain his discoveries. He visited Japan also.\n\nMost of us have seen a peculiar kind of plant called the mimosa (touch-me-not') which spreads on the ground. It has very small leaves. It is extremely sensitive. If we just touch one leaf, that leaf and the leaves nearby all fold up. The greater the force we use, the larger the number of leaves which fold up. The whole row of leaves of the branch can be made to fold like this by touching it with a little greater force. Why does only this plant react like this? We have often wondered, haven't we? Bose wondered, too. And he went on to find out. He found that other plants also react to a man's touch in the same way. The only difference is this: We cannot see the reaction of other plants but we can see the reaction of the mimosa. But Bose wanted to study th 2

Should we have in Iraq hard separation between religion and life (state..etc)? Explaination:  we see many problems going on, do you think Model Iraq should have hardline separation between religion and state, religion and education, religion and lifestyle.  in order, to keep society oriented more on the loyalty to the country and building it on scientific bases. thanks.\n\nRULES: PLEASE THIS QUESTION is serious, and NOT, intended to offend anybody, AND NOT INTENDED TO OFFEND MUSLIMS AND ISLAM. IT'S POLITICAL AND LEGAL QUESTION... thanks for your cooperation.   Any comment after answering funny but not a violation to the terms is more than welcomed. HOWEVER, any answer violates the terms and use of Yahoo will be reported abuse and will never get best answer or put on voting. I think that the more church is separated from the state, the better. There are maters of religion, and matters of the phisical world. \nPhisical world should be sorted out by pure reason. \nReligion can not be (please anote that I don't mean that religion is something wrong or stupid - merely, that many things in religious matters are a matter of faith).\n\nOf course, religion always does influence the local culture, and that can't be avoided. \n\nIn the case of Iraq, I think it would be a good idea to separate the worldly and religious matters. As Julius Caesar once said, "What belongs to God, give to God. What belongs to Emperor, give to Emperor". \nHowever, taking into consideration the way Islam covers both mundane and religious issues (I'm not a Muslim, nor an expert on the topic, but got interest in the subject to claim that I have an idea of what I'm talking about :)), it would be very, very hard to divide those two matters. Not something that can be done quickly.\n\nNevertheless, I think it would be a good goal to go for. 10

Any ideas on how to keep a very active 2 year old boy entertained during a wedding??? We have 2 weddings to go to in the next 5 months. I don't think we can bring the stroller so he will have to sit on my lap ( Hubby is in one wedding). He is a child that can't sit still very long! Any ideas or suggestions????\n 1st wedding end of March: around 2:00 PM the 2nd July 1st. Hubby is in this one! I went to a few outdoor weddings when my son was younger and he as well was quite the handful himself. To entertain my son I bought some bubbles. Also I got permission from the bride to bring extra bottles with me... the kind I got were the little bottles at the dollar tree in the wedding section. The bride thought it was a great idea to keep the children in the wedding entertain plus it made her wedding really pretty as well with bubbles floating all around. So you might ask the couple that are getting married if it is o.k.Bubbles keep kids occupied for hours. Two other ideas is coloring book and crayons or a little sticker book and stickers,I recommend the sticker books that the stickers can be removed and put back with out tearing. 9

Is there going to be another season of Rome on HBO?  Straight from the HBO Site\n09.12.2005 | HBO renews the epic drama series Rome\n\nHBO has renewed its epic drama series ROME for a second season, it was announced today by Carolyn Strauss, president, HBO Entertainment. Production of the 12-episode second season will begin next March, with the debut set for 2007.\n\n"Although the first season of ROME is just underway, we're affirming our support for this exciting and ambitious series by preparing for a second season now," noted Strauss. "I'm delighted that critics and subscribers share our enthusiasm for the show."\n\nThe initial episodes of ROME have inspired legions of critical praise. TV Guide hailed it as a "feast for the eyes" and a "ripping good story," as well as a "shamelessly enjoyable historical romp." USA Today called ROME "as extravagant, enticing and chaotic as Rome itself," adding, "you may never want to leave." The Washington Post described the series as "ravishing and wickedly shocking," and "a feast for the senses that includes generous portions of food for thought." 8

Why people annoy each other with knowing that’s all people are just looking for the happiness???  In my experience, most people that go out of their way to make others miserable are doing it to make themselves feel superior in some way.  If they cut down your clothes, it makes them feel better about how they're dressed.  If they point out how miserable your life is, it makes them feel like theirs must not be so bad.  Not a way I want to go through my life.  Spread the joy! 1

If Vice President Cheney either dies/becomes unable to "perform his duties", how is his successor chosen?  The U.S. Consitution, as adopted in the 18th century, did provide for succession to the office of the President, but did not provide a way to fill a vacancy in the office of Vice President.\n\nThis was covered by the 25th Amendment, which was adopted in 1967.  The 25th Amendment includes the following text, in section 2: "Whenever there is a vacancy in the office of the Vice President, the President shall nominate a Vice President who shall take office upon confirmation by a majority vote of both Houses of Congress."\n\nAnd quoting from the relevant article in Wikipedia (linked below): "Gerald Ford was the first Vice President selected by this method, after the resignation of Vice President Spiro Agnew in 1974; after succeeding to the Presidency, Ford nominated Nelson Rockefeller as Vice President."\n\nSo the answer is not that the Speaker of the House would become the Vice President, but rather that the President selects someone to fill the vacancy, and Congress confirms the appointment. 10

How do I help my 9 year old daughter with a tough gymnastics coach? My daughter just moved up this month to a competitive level in gymnastics.  She has a new coach for 1/2 hour a week that has a reputation of being very harsh.  I have watched him and he never smiles, and rarely gives any positive feedback.  He is very critical, and is willing to call names (he calls my dd "turtle" or "snail" because she moved slowly, and will discipline kids by making them do extra push-ups etc. for not doing what he wants them to.  My dd is intimidated by him, and frankly, so am I.  His reputation is known in the gym, so he will not change, and the gym won't do anything.  Hence, how can I help her overcome her fear of him? As in any sport discipline is mandatory. It is a fine line between this and abuse. You are in a very very competitive sport where very few make it. If the coach has a reputation of getting kids to the finals or better then take this into consideration. If he just has a reputation for being abusive and most kids loose their enthusiasm then perhaps a new coach is in order. Bottom line buck up or move out seems to be your only options.... How bad does she want it I think that is what he is trying to find out? 6
Two algorithms take n^2 days and 2^n seconds respectively to solve an instance of size n.What is the smallest? Two algorithms take n^2 days and 2^n seconds respectively to solve an instance of size n.What is the smallest instance on which the former algorithm outperforms the latter.approximately how long does such an instance take to solve. n^2 days = 7.46x10^9*n^2 seconds, so the question is asking to find the smallest value of n such that \n7.46x10^9*n^2 < 2^n.  For the first approximation, find\n2^n > 7.46x10^9\nln(2^n) > ln(7.46x10^9)\nn > ln(7.46x10^9)/ln(2) = 33.\nBut n^2 = 33^2 = 1089, which is about 2^10, so second \napproximation is 33+10 = 43.\n7.46x10^9*(43)^2 = 1.38 x 10^13\n2^43 = 8.8 x 10^12, the second algorithm is still faster.\nTry 44,\n7.46x10^9*(44)^2 = 1.44 x 10^13 sec\n2^44 = 1.76 x 10^13 sec.\nSo the answer is 44, and the time is 44^2 = 1936 days 2
Why do my ears keep popping?  How can I treat it? Sometimes it is in one ear, sometimes in both.  It started many months ago and hasn't really stopped.  It tends to do it once every few seconds or when i swallow (or make that motion volutarily or involuntarily). There is no pain or ringing involved. I worked for years with ski mountains in very harsh conditions, could that be the cause? Is all that altitude changing, wind, snow, and everything finally catching up to me? Pinch your nose and it wil equalize your ears. Also chewing gum and yawning helps 3
Did Hitler commit Suicide by shooting himself in the head?  The generally accepted cause of Adolf Hitler's death on April 30, 1945 is suicide by gunshot and cyanide poisoning. The dual method and other circumstances surrounding the event encouraged rumors that Adolf Hitler may have survived the end of World War II along with speculation about what happened to his remains; however, consensus on most of the details was eventually reached among historians, aided by the 1993 opening of records kept by the Russian KGB and FSB. 10
why does it get colder when your on a mountin,you are closer to the sun.? if the weather was going to change when your up in the air wouldn't it make a lot more sense if the air was warmer, you are closer to the sun It's a long winded explanation - see link below.\n\n(snip)\nthe sun's heat acts almost the same as the sun's light — it passes through the air almost as though the air wasn't there.\n\nThis means that almost all of the sun's heat goes into warming up the oceans and the land it hits. As the oceans and ground warm up, they warm the air next to them, and this air warms the air a little higher up and so on. But, as you go higher, there's less and less heat available to go up, and the air gets colder.\n(snip) 2

Does it violate copyright law to use a picture I found online to be displayed with my blog entry? If I don't claim it to be mine, I just like it because it fits what I'm talking about, is it OK to use it, even if I don't credit where it came from? it depends on the particular picture.  if the picture is in the "public domain" then you are free to  duplicate it and use it as you wish.  typically copyrighted work enters the public domain 50 years or so after the creator's death, so most public-domain stuff is old.  images of the mona lisa, for instance, are public domain.\n\nsome copyrighted works lately have been distributed under some special licenses - for instance, the "creative commons license" allows for mostly free use, but i think you have to credit the creator.\n\nmost of the time if you want to use a copyrighted image, you have to contact the creator of the image and ask for their permission to use it.\n\nthere is an exemption to copyright law in the united states called the "fair use" doctrine which applies mostly to educational use.  if your blog is part of an educational project, you may be able to use it legally.\n\nif none of these special cases apply, you are probably in violation of copyright law.  however, odds are that nobody's going to care or even notice.  this kind of thing happens all the time on the internet since digital files can be copied so easily.  however, it's been known to happen - lots of owners of disney fan-sites have received cease & desist letters from disney's lawyers for displaying images of mickey mouse, for instance.  (no kidding)\n\nthe one thing you definitely shouldn't do is link to the image on someone else's site.  this is especially true if your blog is high-traffic, since every visitor to your site downloads the image from some other poor schmuck's web server.  most people pay for internet hosting by the gigabyte, which means you are costing someone money if you do this.  so don't.  it's mean. 10

What is a 'medical emergency' that would neccessitate an abortion? People always talk about abortion laws that fail to exempt if the 'health of the mother' needs it.  I don't understand.  As such an invasive and potentially dangerous procedure, how can an abortion be considered emergency medicine? A pregnancy that implanted in the fallopian tube is a major one.  If allowed to grow, the fetus would burst the tube and both the fetus and mother would die.  There are many other medical reasons why a abortion might be necessary, like incest, malformation and fatal pregnancy induced conditions in the mother. 10

How to make soyu from soybean and the soyu (Japanese Ketchup) history.?  Please don't call shoyu 'the Japanese Ketchup'! Shoyu, as a fermented sauce, is the equal of French vinegar - and you surely wouldn't call THAT 'French Ketchup', would you??! ;-) 2
why is soap lather white no matter the coloring in the soap?  Kevin is correct.  However the lather is colored.  If you ever want to model something like this:\n\nGrab a glass of wine, coffee, juice..etc  Notice the color is really strong with a lot of liquid in the glass but as the glass gets emptier, the amount of light absorbed is less...hence less color. 2
How can to take care of Hockey Skates?  Most importantly is to protect the blade, probably with the stretch skate guards and wiping them off with a towel after every time you skate and sharpening them 1-2 a week if necessary.

How do I build a database to use for my ecomerce program?

How does the sky gets its blue color?  The scientific answer is very long which involves dipole scattering, charged particles vector potential and much more.  There is a simple answer though.  Think of how prism works.  When a light hits the prism, what happens?  The answer is the prism breaks the white light into visible color, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet (these are the rainbow color).  Our atmosphere is filled with dust particles.  So when sun ray hits the particles in the atmosphere, it breaks the white light like the prism.  The color blue has the strongest wavelength out the rainbow colors.  Therefore, it effects more than the red and green wavelength, causing the surrounding air to appear blue.  But during the sunset, the sun light passes farther through the atmosphere causing them to deflect and decrease the blue color. So sunset appear to be red. 2
What's the real story on the death of Bruce Wayne's parents? One "Batman" has Joker killing them, while "Batman Begins" has some random poor guy killing them. I know DC Comics are notorious for continuity flaws, so is there a final word on how his parents actually died? Over the years, Batman's origin story, history and tone have undergone various revisions, both minor and major. Some elements have changed drastically; others, like the death of his parents and his pursuit of justice, have remained constant.\n\nAccording to the Silver Age version\nAs summarized in various stories, including 1980's Untold Tales of the Batman limited series that thoroughly retold Batman's Silver Age origin and history, Bruce Wayne was raised by wealthy socialites Dr. Thomas and Martha Wayne in Wayne Manor. As a child, Bruce saw his parents murdered at the age of eight by small-time criminal Joe Chill, after which he was raised by his uncle Philip Wayne. Bruce swore to seek revenge on all criminals, and launched himself into a lifetime of dedicated training similar to the Golden Age Batman's training. 8

did al gore invent the phrase "the super information highway" ?  I agree with the above poster. Here is some additional information:\n\nThe information highway is a term used especially in the 1990s to describe the Internet. The official project was dubbed the National Information Infrastructure (NII) and went beyond the interconnectivity of just computers; the scope broadened to include all types of data transmissions between a plethora of places, people, and devices. It is often associated with the US politician and former vice president, Al Gore, who promoted funding for programmes that led to aspects of the development of the Internet, although its currency was wider than merely Gore — many policy organisations made pronouncements about the so-called information highway or the variant information superhighway. Both terms are used less frequently now that for many people the Internet has become a less abstract and more concrete thing; the highway analogy, though useful and apt, has perhaps served its purpose.\n\nIt is used in early editions of Wired Magazine as well as Popular Mechanics.\n\nInternet denizens sometimes use these terms in reference to the terms' overuse by traditional popular media (and consequently by non-Internet-users) while the Internet was still becoming mainstream. Compare with the term Interweb. Many geeks often use it in a mocking tone, poking fun at the press for always being hopelessly behind in their description of technical matters. 5

who thinks the bush presidency is the worst ever?  I have been around since Truman and probably started paying attention around Eisnehouer, I have never (including Richard Nixon) seen a more corupt govenment in my life. As for the worst I think he is bar none.  Bill CLinton was a good president in the sense I have never seen so much prosperity. His trouble with his zipper should have not been a problem. It should have been a problem only between him and Hillary. It was brought on by dirty politics, if you remember they started out by investigating white water and how it got to that was pure and mean. Ken Star wherever you are should be a very proud man. 10
diferent time on mail? i dont understand, i receive mails from the same country, with 9 hours of difference on time, some of them i see the real hour  the person is sending with " +9 hours" others not exactly, saying "- 800 hours" all this in the same Pc's, it's confusing! why some mails are correct others with - 8,00 hours?\nThank you for u time I think it mave have something to do with where the mail server is located. When you send an email, the server time stamps it with the time that it recieved it in it's own time zone. So, if the email server is in a different time zone, then the times are going to be that of the server's time zone.\n\nSo, if I was to move a few time zones away and still use our company's email service, the time stamps would be the time zone of the server and not my time zone.\n\nMy friend has a blog and when they post on it, the time stamp on the entry is 2 hours ahead of when they actually posted. I'm guessing that the site's server is a few time zones away. This is what I'm basing my answer on.\n\nThat's my guess 5

What is the basic characteristic of living being? or how would u identify a alein object is a living being? hey is there any sure shot method Even among biologists, there is some debate about what constitutes being "alive", mainly because of viruses. There are four main criteria which are generally accepted. A living organism should:\n\nHave some kind of metabolism (processing "food" into "waste")\nGrow, change or evolve in its lifetime and generations\nInteract with its environment\nReproduce\n\nI would add to this that living things should have a determinate lifespan (that is, they die) and they should use DNA or RNA as a genetic template. 2

how can i use the Bible to teach history and science? i homeschool our 10 year old son. i would like to use the BIble as much as i can for school. You can use it to teach history and science by looking at it's background as a significant literary text.  Linguistics, archaeology, world history; all of these can use the bible as a real object to build lessons around.  Treat it as an artifact, look at it from different perspectives in time and how it has impacted the cultures who wrote it, those it was introduced to, and those who uncovered it and translated it.  For a 10 year old boy, an Indian Jones type expedition through time would be a hoot. 4

i sometimes get a severe itching in my inner thigh area when i start to run what's the cause/remedies?  chafing, pure and simple. a common runner's problem, esp. long distances.

You apply it to inner thighs, etc. Wherever you're prone to chafe. 3

how to rekindle an old flame/ find a lost spark? me and my girl are going through things because we have lost are spark/ are flame that little thing that keeps us going. so now she is telling me its over. but when i look into her eyes i see she still loves me and i can even hear it in her voice. she left to live with her parents but we still gab on the phone for hours on end. we have two kids and she brings them to see me and we talk we do fine with noone around but when someone enters the room she tries to treat me like crap but even her mother says she still loves me. i just feel if we found that spark we would be able to live happily again. Remember what it was like in the begining and don't try to do the same things over again change it up a little. Don't be afraid to try something new, but with your girls consent. Be willing to listen when she wants to talk, or sit her down and ask her why she acts the way she does when other people are around. Tell her you are willing to try new things to rekindle that old flame and if she's not down than it's time to move on, just don't lose touch with your children there whats most important.  Good-Luck. 9
wats the square root of 2?  The square root of 2, , also known as Pythagoras' constant, is the positive real number which, when multiplied by itself, gives the product 2. Its numerical value approximated to 65 decimal places (sequence A002193 in OEIS) is:\n\n1.41421 35623 73095 04880 16887 24209 69807 85696 71875 37694 80731 76679 73799. \n was the first known irrational number. Geometrically,  is the length of a diagonal across a square with sides of one unit of length; this follows from Pythagoras' theorem.\n\nA number called the silver ratio has the same expansion only starting with 2.4 rather than 1.4. 2

power transmission question? if a power plant produces 1000 mw of power but the city uses say only 750 mw what happens to the remaining 250 mw.do they go waste?where does it go? Do you mean what happens in a power plant with a 1000 MW capacity when the demand is only 750 MW?  The answer to that is that he plant only puts out 750 MW.  In a case like that, whatever is providing the energy for the plant (say a turbine engine) will not have to push as hard, and will use less fuel, than when the full capacity is needed.  As an experiment, you can connect a bulb, through a switch, to a little hand-cranked generator.  When the switch is off, it's real easy to turn the crank; but when the switch is turned on, you suddenly have to crank much harder to keep the light lit. 2

can a ins pick some up for having a dwi 2yrs after doing community service?

Driving under the influence is a felony.  Non-citizens who commit felonies are usually required to serve their sentence here in the U.S. before being deported so it is not unusual for someone to be picked up by INS after they have finished their sentence (in this case, community service). 10

The End Times: Great Revival or Great Apostasy? Many prophecies in mainstream Christianity have come out declaring a great influx (revival) of souls into the Kingdom of God before Jesus returns.  Why then does Jesus declare:\n\nAnd then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another. And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many. And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. (Matthew 24:10-13)\n\nAnd why would He ask:\n\n... Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth? (Luke 18:8)\n\nJust curious to hear others' opinions... 2 Thes. 2:1-3 (NKJV)  \n    Now, brethren, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him, we ask you, [2] not to be soon shaken in mind or troubled, either by spirit or by word or by letter, as if from us, as though the day of Christ had come. [3] Let no one deceive you by any means; for that Day will not come unless the falling away comes first, and the man of sin is revealed, the son of perdition, \n______________\n\nI do not believe in the "Left Behind" rapture theory that is being preached in a lot of churches today.\n\nThere will be a great falling away when the tribulation comes upon us all.  It will not be easy being a Christian.  Many will depart from us because they are not Christians.\n\nThe end will not have a great revival.  Even the current revivals are not great.  I do not see many strong Christians.  I see a lot of people professing Christ with their mouths but not with their lives and producing fruit.\n\nWhere's the fruit?  No fruit? No Christian.\n\nLuke 3:9 (NKJV)  \n    And even now the ax is laid to the root of the trees. Therefore every tree which does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire." \nJohn 15:8 (NIV)  \n    This is to my Father's glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples. 1

Gametes are haploid and the process of forming gametes in mammals is spermatogenesis and oogenesis, which are meiotic cycles. 2

Do you think the objectives of Brown v. Board of Education have been fulfilled in today's america?  I think it's really two different questions, the letter of the law and the spirit of the law. Overwhelmingly Brown v. Board was successful in beginning the intergration of the whole of America, not just in education system, overturning the previous SCOTUS decision of "equal but seperate". However when you look at the spirit of the law, I believe it is still lacking, mostly due to geographic and monetary limitations. The disproportion in schools in wealthy, mostly suburban neighborhoods, to the poor mostly urban neighborhoods, is a problem we have yet to deal with. One could easily make an arguement that the system is now not seperate but still unequal due to the ability of communities to fund their local schools, not due to any prejudice. 10

what is a line equation look like? easy 10 point for some one? i need help with a geometry problem this is what is says "Give an example of two different equations that descibe the same line. Such lines are called coincident lines" anybody know this? I'm sure it is easy it is just no were in the book! Any linear combination of x, y and a scalar when is put equal to 0 gives the equation of a line: that is "a term in x + a term in y + a number = 0" is a line.\n\nSo write a line whatsoever's equation:\n\nfor example (but you change it, please)\n\n4x -2y - 5 =0\n\nNow if you multiply all the terms for the same factor, you get an equivalent equation so you get a coincident (= the same) line:\nfor exemple, let's simply change all the signs:\n-4x +2y +5 =0 is always the same line\n\nAnd you can build infinite equations of the same line in this way\n\nP.S. = remember NEVER choose 0 as a multiplicator! 2

The best club in the world may not be the best club for you depending on swing speed, body type etc. \n\nI would highly recommend going to a golf store with a hitting cage or to a range that offers demos and hitting the club before you buy it. \n\nAsk a salesperson and if they are worth their salt they will help fit you with the proper club for your game. Then you can have the option of buying it there, or if that option is too expensive, buying it elsewhere. 6

advantages and disadvantages of friction?  advantage:\n\nfriction, resistance offered to the movement of one body past another body with which it is in contact. In certain situations friction is desired. Without friction the wheels of a locomotive could not “grip” the rails nor could power be transmitted by belts. \n\ndisadvantage:\n\nOn the other hand, in the moving parts of machines a minimum of friction is desired; an excess of friction produces heat, which in turn causes expansion, the locking of the moving parts, and a consequent breakdown of the machinery. Lubrication is important in minimizing friction as are also such devices as ball and roller bearings. 2

what should be the role of foreign  and international law in the U.S. Supreme Court decisions? Particularly those that expand civil liberties? US Supreme court decisions should be based on interpretaion of US law and foreign and international law have no place. Decisions should be based on precedence and current law. By going outside of our laws, they are effectively "creating" new laws. 10
Are undocumented immigrants violating the law the same way that Rosa Parks violated it?  Yes. Hispanics have every right to be here.  They are doing noone harm.

This question is to guys espeically... Do u prefer skinny girls, thick girls, average, what type and why?  It depends. I like skinny-to-medium, my buddy likes to have "some meat on the bones". And we get less picky when deprived of female company long enough. :)\n\nMainstream western culture obviously tends toward skinny (just look at Barbie). In hunger-prone African countries, thick chics are the coolest. Arabs do not care, if the dress their women have to wear is any indication. 7

ilove a girl but her mother is also wants a sex relation with me what can i do? i realy love that girl.?  just have a talk!? communication is the best way... talk to her mother and tell to her that you don't want to have a sex relation with her because she's the mother of your girlfriend,the one that you love. And not only that, explain to her that it is bad to have a sex relation with her because you love her daughter and her daughter is the one you want to be with in your entire life. And her daughter will get hurt if she'll know about it and try to ask if she love her daughter. ok that's it...now it's your turn... 9
pls advice on credit info??????? its my first time getting a credit card.i have 20%apr and i pay $12 finance charge with bank of america? is this fair... Of course it is unfair but thats business.  Your first credit card will have a very high APR.  Creditors want to give you just enough to see if your are responsible enought to either pay it off every month or run charges that will take months to pay off.  In this instance they make boocoos of moola off of you, be careful!!!!!!  Use it for something you know you can afford to pay off monthly, like gas, this will build your credit history, show good payment history and eventually lower you interest rate.  Also a good idea is to periodically call your credit card company and ask them to lower your rate.  If you have good payment history more than likely they will do it for you, you can do the same with a credit increase. 7

Is it their own fault if people in America starve? Isn't that what wellfare is for? No, it is not "their own fault" if people in America starve.  Life is so much more complex than what can be explained in a simple "black & white" answer.  I do think that it is sad that in a country where food is abundant & so very cheap that we still have this problem today, don't you?  Sometimes I believe that some respondents get confused and feel that people can "work their way out of starvation".  If I recall correctly, most of the people who go to bed "hungry" in this nation are children--not strapping young men with strong backs. Will I begrudge a hungry child food for whatever--absolutely not! 10
Can this be done in a batch file? How would I start a program, like Microsoft Access, in a batch file? Also, would it be possible to convert a database created in an earlier version of Access to a newer version by using a batch file? to make the batch file you would start a new page in Notepad.  Then the command you would use is START.  You have to know the location on your computer where the MS Access program is at (not the shortcut).  So it would be START <location of file> 5

How did Bush get into Yale? Did he earn it or something else?  And the timely ramblings of thompj64us once again. Unfounded as always.\n\nConnections play a part in college entrance, as it does in the real job world. But it is not like you can get anyone in anywhere AND have them pass. Bush met the entrance requirements and actually held a slightly higher GPA than his most recent opponent, John Kerry.\n\nBecause Bush went to Yale, does that make him inherently brilliant? Nope. Just as going to community college does not make you inherently mediocre. Bush is not the smartest President, nor do I believe him to be the dumbest in any way, shape, or form.\n\n*******\nHoneydew..

Detroit,Michigan who to write to about stopping juvenile sexual abuse in prisons and dentention centers. Gov? Juveniles are being fed to the prison system as dessert. Childern are coming in dentention centers raped,molested and sold for crack etc. Are their follow ups, prosecutions on the abuser and enabler, or just prostitution. Are their real programs to help the youth deal with the hand, they've been dealt? I know it's an ugly subject, Child abuse is as popular as Nike gym shoes , hot cheetos, cell phones. Wayne County's Robert Ficano, Governor Granham , L Dixon over Michigan juvenile dententions centers must know. I know it's a great problem, but we have so many great Minds in American. When you don't see it, it's not on your list of things to do. It hurts to know, there's no love for some of America's children. Thank You, Please Help This is a seriosu problem in ALL prisons. It seems that peopel seem to think it is added punishment for those that are sent to prison. The fact it is sactioned by many guards and wardens is appaling. It can often ruin the lives of inmates and make minor criminals worse by subjecting to beatings and rape.\n\nIt is not limited to Detroit, but nationwide.\n\nWrite your local Congress Rep and your Sentaors abot this topic. 10

why iran cannt use atomic energy?  A country like Iran that has pursued nuclear weapons and long-range rockets and has vowed to destroy a Democracy (Israel) should not be trusted, noteven with materials that could be used to further their nefarious aims.  Would they even hesitate to supply such weapons to terriorists?  Do you want to take that chance?  Just having nuclear WMD would allow them to intimidate their neighbors.  No one would dare try to stop them from equipping even more suicide bombers or organizing the powers on earth that have no regard for innocent human life, including yours. 2

if exersize in the AM is good, then why not skip breakfast??? SO I agree cardio in the morning on an empty stomach will burn alot of fat... So why would it not be a good idea to skip breakfast on the days you cant make it to the gym?? You will be running off stored fat, right???? But eating breakfast is so highly looked upon. Its the same concept isnt it??? It is and established fact that cardio in the morning on an empty stomack increases your fat burning expodentially. However approx 30 minutes after your session is over your body will begin to go after your muscles for energy rather than your fat cell or carbs and you will be in effect working against your goal. The more muscle your have the more calories you burn so you MUST have breakfast after your morning workout.\n\nSo keep doing your cardio ON AN EMPTY STOMACH but be sure to have at the minimul a protien shake once your are done. Plus, as the other guy mentioned eating every few hours increases your motabolism keeping your internal furnace running on high. 3

Why does milke spoil? help! Because after milk is extracted, it is then cooled in the dairy and transported in refrigerated tankers for processing. Unchilled milk would soon go sour due to acid production by lactobacilli. Even if kept refrigerated, raw milk goes off rapidly due to the action of psychrophilic (cold-tolerant) bacteria. These produce proteinases and lipases which break down both the protein and the fat in milk, causing rancid and bitter tastes and clotting.  \n\nOne unusual type of bacteria which can grow is called Alcaligenes viscolactis – this produces sticky threads of exopolysaccharide in the milk called ropiness.\n\n:)\nPeace 2

Is there anyway to make your own experimental telephone reciever with carbon, some wire, and a speaker?  yes there is.  this is how you do it.  you get a small box.  say a carton of cigarettes.  you push two blades from the inside out so that the blades are sticking up.  put them about 3 inches apart.  connect wires to the blades.  these wires will go to a speaker and batteries.  now, if you connect these two with something conductive, you will get noises coming out the speaker.  now, u throw leads on top.  the ones from automatic pencils.  there you have it, its done.  if you talk to the blades that have the leads on top, you will get a noise like your voice.  if you make 2, you will have a speaker on both sides, and you and your brother can talk from different rooms given that the wires are long enough.  the best way is to invert the box so that the leads dont fall out.  so, u can make ur own box with cardboard and glue.  then flip the box upside down.  like taking the cover off a sneaker box.  then flip it upside down.  now u will poke the blades from the top down and turn the coverup.  you follow?  now throw the blades in.  the thing is, make a box so that its small enough to house the blades and leads.  this will probably cost you less then 20 buxx to make. 2
what is computer networking?  network, in computing, two or more computers connected for the purpose of routing, managing, and storing rapidly changing data. A local area network (LAN), which is restricted by distances of up to one mile, and a metropolitan area network (MAN), which is restricted to distances of up to 60 miles, connect personal computers and workstations (each called a node) over dedicated, private communications links. A wide area network (WAN) connects large numbers of nodes over long-distance communications links, such as common carrier telephone lines, over distances ranging from that between major metropolitan centers to that between continents. An internet is a connection between networks. The Internet is a WAN that connects thousands of disparate networks in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Asia, and elsewhere, providing global communication between nodes on government, educational, and industrial networks. Networks allow for resource sharing (e.g., multiple computers sharing one printer), data sharing, and communication or data exchange (e.g., electronic mail).\n\n\n--\nhi, i have noticed that you are not voting for the answers that you recieve.

is absolute beauty exist?  in the natural world animals develop features to attract a mate - the ones with the most perfect features (according, i assume, to their instinctive values of attraction) are the most attractive as mates. it works to ensure that the strongest/best examples of a species reproduce together, to ensure in turn that the species survives. so yes, in the natural world, an inherent concept of absolute beauty would appear to exist.\n\nhowever.\n\ndifferent animals develop different features, showing that each species has a different concept of beauty. also, in relation to human beings, it's important to remember that we have as a species gone beyond the trials of survival which necessitate mate selection in the natural world - in our secure society we can afford to be attracted to any number of things other than physical strength, cunning, childbearing suitability etc. \n\nso, in short, no, a universal concept of absolute beauty does not exist. on an individual level, i'd say that it does exist, but not only is it different in different people; it is constantly changing as we experience new things which alter our perception of the world. 4
What is you full and honest feeling of President Bush and why do you feel that way?  I believe President George W.

which soccer league is rated number one in the world? i believe that fifa gives a list of all the highly rated clubs in world football It really depends on the criteria. England, Spain, and Italy all have had top teams and allow four teams (currently) to qualify for the Champions League. Smaller strong leagues have a lower quote but have still managed to create plenty of upsets, such as the Bundesliga (Germany), Portugal, and Eredevisie (Netherlands).\n\nThere is no top league, as each year, the champions change hands, but Spain definitely holds the single most successful club in European history (Real Madrid), Italy is a close second by having Juventus, AC Milan and Inter Milan. England have Liverpool, Manchester United and Chelsea who can handle Europe, and smaller leagues such as Portugal (FC Porto, Benfica), Netherlands (PSV Eindhoven in recent years - earlier Ajax Amsterdam) have made it to the top honours.\n\nIn terms of TV revenue, the #1 league now is France, as they signed a record deal of over a billion dollars (not sure of the amount) with Canal+. It used to the Premiership, but not anymore. 6

please i want to what brought the nigeria and biafran civil war and after the war what is the next agreement.. since 1970 after the end of the war ,I can see that the people of biafrans has being emagelanise some how to the nigerian gorvernment and for example (1) Any crisis in nigeria are always being intimdation to biafrans .So in that case there is a kind of traberlistic systerm of gorvernment that makes power to be denied against the biafrans citizens ..So that makes them always feeled chetted in the country so i believe they prifeir to be on there own because of such thing's .And i heard that they arrested there leader raphel uwazuruike ..And now i will like to     hear more abou the case from you people ..So we heard that UN law said that any country that fight for indipendent after 30 years if there are interested to still get there own republic that they are free to go,But now i see no reason why nigerian will still hld them not to go ,And i heard that the formal nigerian head of state yakubu gowun has sign it in abori acall in 1966 in ghana then upon all this, What is the action of UN. The biafran war made people more tribalistic rather than nationalistic. As a result people in the area referred to as 'biafra' still feel marginalised and neglected in terms of social and economic infrastructure.\nSome people have used that opportunity to violently demand reform from the Nigerian government. However, as in most civilised countries armed revolt is a criminal act.\nRalphel Uwaxuruike is not the leader of biafra. He is the leader of an organisation MASOB - Movement for the Actualisation of the State Of Biafra. His organisation as been linked to some acts considered inciting and treasonable. for instance, some youths burnt national and regional landmarks in Anambra state created by people like the late Nnamdi Azikiwe (a biafran too!).\nI believe the due process of cessation should be used by any state wishing to cecede from the Federal republic of Nigeria. There will be less bloodshed and anarchy.\nThe problem Nigeria has is caused by the colonial amalgamation which created a geographical entity without regard to the tribes and feelings of the people involved.\nAnother way the matter could be resolved is if the Nigerian Constitution is amended to ensure that all people of Nigeria including Biafran are treated equally. Policy reformulation will also be necessary. 10
how the  kudupminar piller made out of iron stands without rusting  despite it's exposure for years in open  It is likely due to the high phosphorus content of the iron. Another factor may be that in the ancient wrought iron a certain amount of slag particles which enhance the passivity.  Climate factors may be important too.  It probably does have a coat of rust though. An interesting analysis of the rust and surface film of the Delhi Pillar is here:\nhttp://www.iitk.ac.in/infocell/Archive/dirnov1/iron_pillar.html 2
I have feelings for a dear friend, should I tell him? I'm married and don't feel as though I'm cared about or important anymore, my husband has been caught numerous times on the computer looking at porn, one of his porfiles stated that we are divorced and that the kids live with him part time.  This hurt me so bad, we are still together, but my feelings for him are no longer the same, I love him, but I'm not in love with him.  This other friend, which I have done nothing with, other than just being a friend, makes me feel as though I'm the most important thing, he spoils me, and even though we have known each other for only 3 yrs. He knows what I like, and as for my husband, it's like he don't even know me. of course first of all you must talk to your husband. tell him all that you know about his computer "games" and tell him how he makes you feel and how he has been treating you. give him time to talk. be open honest and blunt. if you are blunt to him he will be to you. don't spare andy feelings this is your life if things don't work out with your husband then take it from there but don't betray him even if things turn for the worse (divorce) my advise is spend less time with the friend ( i know it will be hard) and more time with the family. Try to salvage your mariage before you indulge your short term desires. Be patient and have will power. GOOD LUCK AND GOD BLESS 9
does ex pro wrestler,brock lezner, still play football for the minn. vikings?  Recently Lawyers representing the WWE have filed a new request for a Preliminary Injunction that would prevent Brock Lesnar from "further breaching the Settlement Agreement and General Release of All Claims" (the "Settlement Agreement") between WWE and Lesnar". \n\nThe request is to prevent Lsenar from appearing at the scheduled February 19, New Japan Pro Wrestling event as well as "otherwise performing or appearing in association with New Japan or any other person or entity involved in professional wrestling during the pendency of this litigation". 6

how do you track a package sent via USPS without a tracking number? I sent an insured, priority mail box to Miami Beach more than 20 days ago and "apparently" it has not arrived, but I have no way to find out apparently except trust the receiver, trust the USPS, and wait.  Any ideas? You can request an investigation by the USPS, but unless you insured the package content, I would not get my hopes up. The form is called 1510 (Mail Loss/Rifling Report). 7

what are the best job search sites currently available? do you get responses? Having been a corporate recruiter for a number of years prior to getting involved in education I can tell you that the ones with the greatest recognition are:\n\nhttp://www.monster.com\nhttp://www.hotjobs.com\nhttp://www.carrerbuilder.com\n\nThat being said, if you are involved in a specific industry or profession that has an association (IEEE, ASTD, etc.) their job boards generally lead to higher quality results.\n\nKeep you eye out because there are always good job boards out there, but you have to do some work to get yourself noticed. What works best in my experience is a pretty broad approach that includes posting your resume, applying to positions you are qualified for and networking (this one is important). 5

Your man's only problem seems to be he loves the skin you are in.  Take comfort and joy in knowing that he feels lucky to have you.  His eyes are on you and your booty, instead of every other one in front of you.  And Im sure he didnt propose to your booty, right?  Obviously, there are other things about him or you would not have said yes to his proposal. 9

Why is the first thing you have to do when your house is flooded is to unplug all electrical appliances and... When your house is flooded, the first thing you have to do is to unplug all electrical appliances and turn off all main switches. Why is this so? The water will cause short circuits, and if you are unlucky you can be the object which shortens the circuit.\n\nThe proper sequence ought to be first turn of the main switches and fuses, then go and salvage what electrical appliances there are. 2

Is heaven even real??  The existance of an afterlife is something I am so not qualified to answer, since I have only known this one.  I'd hate to burst peoples' bubbles, but i doubt there is a heaven or hell.  So call me a heathen, whatever, I surely believe in some divine creator... But the reason humans invented such ornate tales is to firstly keep people in line.  People do good and hope for reward.  Secondly, they believe so that the loss of a loved one can be comforted.  I feel that people should find their comforts in other ways.  Death is not a tragety really.  People want something to look forward to.  Thirdly, some might say arrogance; that humans are somehow above all other lifeforms and part of them lives for all eternity.  The forth reason people believe in an afterlife is fear.  Death is one of the most feared things, along with pain and failure.  Why is it feared?  Because no one truly knows what happens.  That's why people might cling to religious descriptions, which are also rather vague and hold few actual details.  So, believe whatever you wish my friend, but there's my two cents. 7

LIMEWIRE? BEAR SHARE? ANY OTHERS? HELP ME PICK A GOOD PROGRAM FOR DOWNLOADING MUSIC, MOVIES, AND GAMES!?  I would go with Limewire and pay the one-time fee for Limewire Pro, as it hasn't been as targeted by the RCAA for suits as much as others. Try to steer clear of BitTorrent though because many complainst of viruses have been filed. 5
REQ: Super simple drag & drop FTP app.? I want to allow clients to upload to my server. The app needs to be really really simple like the Flickr Uploadr. Client would install the app. Open it, enter username and password then just drag and drop files onto the app. Easy. Feedback on upload progress would be good.\n\nTraditional FTP apps like CuteFTP are no good. It needs to be a no brainer. Even my Mum can use the Flickr Uploader!\n\nI'd also prefer if it was not .NET dependant.\n\nThanks. You can use explorer to do this job if you are using Windows 2K or XP.  The only disadvantage is that it is slower to other programs such as cuteftp.  \n\nAll you need to do is to open My Network Places.  \nClick on Add Network Place. .. next\nChoose "another network location ...."  ..next\nEnter the ftp server address starting with ftp://  ..next.\nEnter Log on details.\nand enter the name of the network place to be displayed.\n\nThese settings are only set once.  When you need to connect to the ftp server. go to My network place\nand double click on the icon of the server.  When prompted enter a password. \nTo upload files drop and drag.\nTo delete select and press delete. 5
i wanted to know how many calories i burn after doing 20 minutes of pilates.?  It's not that easy to calculate how many calories you burn in yoga and Pilates since the intensity of the class depends on the kind of exercises being done and the strength level of the class participants.\n\nIn general, a 130-pound person would burn approximately 260 calories an hour for a light to moderate Pilates mat-class. "Intense" Pilates would burn approximately 346 calories.\nYour weight affects how many calories you burn (the more you weigh, the more calories you burn), so use the following formula to make it more accurate: Divide the number of calories burned by 130 pounds. Multiply the answer by your weight in pounds. \n\nFor example, divide 260 calories by 130 pounds. The answer is 2 calories per pound. Multiply that by 110 pounds. The answer is 220 calories.\n\nSince you said 20 minutes then divide your answer by 3 since the calculation above is for an hour.\n\n\nTan-yuh this is how you would figure out yours - if you weighed 192 - its 2 calories per pound per hour\n\nso its 384 for an hour --- 384 *.33 because you worked out for 20 minutes which is .33 of an hour.\n\nThis equals 128 calories burnes for a 20 minutes pilates tape.\n\nPersonally I would say try to work your way up (at your own pace of course) to an hour long... 384 calories is a lot for one workout and thats how much you would burn for an hour. 3
Do you regift?  No.  I think everyone gives me gifts with good intentions.  I would be so insulted if someone regifted the gift I gave to them.  I respect peoples thoughts and keep their gifts. If I don't like the gift, I'll put it somewhere that I don't have to stare at it, but even if its in my closet, whenever I open the closet and see it, it will remind me of that person and the fact that they thought of me and bought me a gift. 7

What did your friends and/or family do to celebrate your 21st birthday.?  Oooh, I hope no one says they drank 21 shots! That would be quite lethal. \n\nFor my 21st birthday, I was in college, away from my family. So some friends of mine from my sorority took me out to a surprise dinner at an Italian restaurant -- we had a full table of 15! At midnight, we went to a pub -- my boyfriend (now husband!) joined us, and everyone bought me some yummy drinks. I had the chance to order my first legitimate drink. We laughed and talked all night. Nothing out of the ordinary, but really fun! 1

How long does it take most people to fall in love with someone?  Love isn't something that is consistant.  It doesnt happen in a set amount of time, every time.  love is something both people have to agree on, and we all know not everyone agrees on something right away. 7

why is outerspace dark?  Only matter can reflect light, so outerspace isn't really dark, it's just an absence of matter. Dark matter, on the other hand, is actually dark. It's so dark, in fact, that it is impossible to see with the backdrop of space.\nKeep in mind, though, that the sky is blue not because air molecules are blue, but because of a refraction of light.\nEverything has to do with light... 2
what can i do with a varsity team who can break a press and still not get the win still throw the ball away? they are quick and lose games in the last half I'd train them to use a shot clock. Make them only take a field goal attempt when there is less than 5 seconds on the clock, not before...try to slow them down. This will make them carry the ball and manage the ball instead of just trying to score as soon as possible. 6
What is the proper way to address a pope--in person and in writing?  Actually, the honorary is "Holy Father." That's the custom of the Catholic Church ... "your grace" and "your emminence" are used for cardinals. Bishops and archbishops are "Bishop Smith," priests are "Father Smith" or "Father Tom," and monsignors are "Monsignor Smith." 7
What cities or towns in the Northeast, including New York,offer ride-alongs? I'm a firefighter/EMT who is looking for fire departments, career or volunteer, that offer ride-along programs. Most of any department will alloy you to do ride alongs.  They might not alloy you to participate but they will alloy you to ride along.  Simply have to stop into any department and let them know what you want.  Some might require you to live within a certain radius or sign specific paperwork. 10
Which will be the best way to treat an old lady with senile madness, besides her medicine? She seems to be trying to control her family just for her, and this is driving everybody crazy. If she is on her daughter´s house, she wants to go to her son´s house, or call him to tell stories which are not true. Sounds like she could have some sort of dementia.  I work with people like this.  It never helps to argue with them!  Go along with the stories, try to keep her busy and distracted from things that upset her.  People with dementia live in a pretend world, mostly disconnected from reality.  Run a search for Alzheimer's services in your area, there should be social workers you can talk to for help. 3

What makes lightning bugs glow, and what purpose does it serve? or "firefly" if you're not southern.\n\nAlso, did anyone else used to take off the 'glowing parts' and wipe them on your face and run around in the dark? Fireflies produce a chemical substance called luciferase that reacts with the oxygen in the air to give off light.  When they let air into their abdomen it glows.  They glow for two reasons.  To attract mates, and to attract other tasty bugs for food.  Depending on the species, fireflies can serve as good thermometers.  They flicker on and off at different rates depending on how cold it is.  By the way, I'm not southern and I usually call them lightning bugs and I don't usually kill them because they probably eat mosquitos...I hate mosquitos. 2
Do church mergers work?  It's possible.\n\nRemember that the church is really just Gods people.  Buildings and Campuses are just places we meet to do stuff, worship and learn.\n\nSo, merging campuses, facilities, buildings is just resource management.  If the people follow the same thing, can work, worship, learn, and grow together then it's cool.  Also, if it's Gods will. 1
What is the smallest headset (earbuds and mic) to use with my computer? Can I use a cellphone headset? The store "experts" keep directing me toward cell phone headsets.  Will those work? If not, what should I buy?

is the failure of prohibition a justification for legalizing marijuana? effects, costs, arrests Based on the HUGE trade deficit in the drug market, and the dollars spent fighting a losing war against drugs, and illeagal sales funding gang activity, I say let's make ALL drugs leagal and controlled like booze.  Sure some folks will overdose initially, but after a while things will calm down. 10
How should I treat a stubborn, reoccurring, and extremely painful stiff neck? I'm also trying to get rid of the remains of Acute Bronchitis, which I caught back on New Year's Day AND I've been having my usually -sporadic ONCE a week at most - Migraine Headaches  on and off every four to six hours EVERY day for around three MONTHS now!\nI'm really at a loss here....... and really weak and not even thinking half straight anymore........HELP!!! Greetings Moonflower. Your response to my question was excellent.So now I will try to help you. There is a product that once it contacts your skin it remains hot for 7 or 8 hours. That stands a chance of loosening stiff muscles anywhere. Next, migraine is best kept in control by a medicine called Imitrex but do you live in a tropical area? Is there a chance a bone is broken or sprained in the area of your pain and needs to heal or can you afford to see a doctor to order xrays?? Please have a doctor expert at reading x-rays give you his opinion. 3
excel error - 1004?  That code usually is returned due a missing object, say, if you have a macro that it's supoused to return a value, but it doesn't, you receive this error.\n\nThat also could be rised if you try to perform an operation on a value, but the cell contains a function. 5
theres a song i hear and a woman sings it part of the lyrics says ,,,on the wings of an angeL? it's  a  soft sounding  song ,,,kinda  sad,i heard it  on a movie Sarah McLachlan has a song called "Angel" which is really soft and slow and beautiful.  It may be what you are talking about and part of it goes like this:\n\nIn the arms of the angel\nFly away from here\nFrom this dark cold hotel room\nAnd the endlessness that you fear\nYou are pulled from the wreckage\nOf your silent reverie\nYou're in the arms of the angel\nMay you find some comfort here 8
Who is George Bush?  an idiot puppet for the people really running the government's agenda. 10
Double Standards in America's Moral System? It seems very condtradictory... if any man or woman were to dress in public like they do in some TV commercials, they'd be arrested for either indecent exposure, or worse, lose custody of their children, being tagged as a pervert... since we're not even supposed to dress like that in front of our own children.  Why is it then acceptable for our children to see 'others' practially naked on regular TV, but taboo in their own home?\n\nWhat's happened to the moral fiber of this country that such contradictions are not erradicated?  Don't give me that "freedom of speech" or "freedom of expression non-sense.  I don't want my kids to see me, or any other adult in their undies... in person, or on TV! Come on! TV doesn't always imitate reality... How much of TV is staged, though? That's why it's important to remember that what you see on TV isn't real life even if the producers want you to believe that it is. 1
does anyone know the cure for pimples/zit? i don't have many pimples on my face but i get them often.i have a great body.i eat lots of fruits and water.i can't wear makeup coz my mom says it would ruin my skin later on.is there something u could do at home to stop this?i would really appreciate if i get a reply coz i hate sittin in class with other gals havin beautiful skin around guys. Sometimes if a zit is really puffy and big icing it for a while with an ice cube works as a quick fix (if your date is going to be there in 5 min. and Mt. Everest is on your chin). Make sure to wash your face about 2x per day to keep it free from dirt and excessive oils. Just don't overdo the wahing. If you do you can end up making too much oil and get really gross skin. Good job with the eating healthy, it helps! 3
an outline of corruption in our government?  JUST 4 YOUR IGNORANCE!\nBlame your government, bcz you are brainwashed a majority of you, just as you believed killing millions in Iraq ,Vietnam ,helping Israel to kill Palestinians ,and killing millions in Japan before of that was necessary,? killing and Enslaving millions of Africans, as well as the destruction of the native Americans(Indians). you used to be proud to be Americans, but the TRUTH MUST SET YOU FREE! Do like most of YOU real Americans do, ignore Bush&Company. Morons and idiots run your country. I'm just glad they do open their fat mouths 4 the Iraqi PETROL ..killing your people there!, that way you know who to ignore as to who to approach. CHEERS and good day! 10
What was the voting percentage of the age group between 18-25 in the last election?  I guess you're talking about the last US election. The report linked below says that 18.4% of the voters were 18-29, meaning that 51.6% of citizens aged 18-29 voted, the highest in the last 4 elections at least. 10
can you break the laws of physics?  Um read a Feynman book he discusses this. Laws of physics are not laws like crimnal laws, they cannot be broken, if you appear to break a law then it means the law is wrong not that it has been broken. The term law isnt really correct they are more just theories of how the world works on a certain scale. You cannot brweak a law, only disprove it.\n\n\nSorry people are missing the point, science laws are unbreakable, to break a scientific law is to show it is in fact not a scientific law but instead just an incorrect hypothesis of (as all current laws are) a generalisation. Laws like Newtons Laws are easyily disproved with quantum mechanics or relativistic phenomena but they are still valid laws when you are looking at stuff at the correct scale (like apples falling out of trees for example). Physical laws just describe how something works at a certain scale, you can find counter examples for them but they are still valid (speed camereas still work even though they dont take time dialation into account!)\n\nBasically it all boils down to a bad choice of words, they shouldn't be called Laws but instead Models. 2

Why do Christians and Those of Other Religions Cling to their Beliefs even when They are Illogical? Are religious people afraid to be alone on this earth without a Higher Being?  Is God their safety net?  Does a God make people feel more secure and less frightened of the bad things that happen?  Is the idea of relying only upon yourself and those who care about you a frightening idea?  In short, is God a Crutch?  Why do you believe in God? Again, no biblical or other "holy" book quotations or references, please.  Also again, there is no need to lose your temper, get upset or call names. To answer this question, you have to ask yourself: is there an inherent need in humans to beleive in God or a deity?  I beleive in God because I acknowledge that something, whatever it may be exists beyond what we know & understand.  That is to say, i beleive that God isn't what the majority of the world would lead us to beleive.  God is there, but we can't possibly understand it.  To understand God is to be God.  This raises another question: are humans their own individual God, just on a different level?  So if you answer yes to the previous question, I think one might be able to take comfort in their own 'Godness,' and the 'Godness' around you. 1

How does a man go about keeping up the attraction of a woman?  My husband always keeps himself well groomed; he smells sooo good, NO nose hairs, hair trimmed; washed; and combed. He never forgets to thank me for little things I have done (because little things mean the most), he leaves me notes every now & then like "Baby, just wanted you to know how lucky I feel to have a wife as beautiful as you! XXOO, or he'll bring me flowers in the middle of the week with a card that says "Just because it's Wednesday!"\n\nNeedless to say I would fight for this man to the death! He is a rare breed! 9

this is for atheists? Im curious to know what your thought are on the beginning of life, the first lifeform and the first human and where did it all come from? Be sure you understand the meaning of the term Atheist.  Atheists generally denouonce the existance of any type of superior diety.  I myself am Agnostic, I am comfortable with the idea that I'm not sure what happened, what will happen, why things are.  I tend to follow the current scientific theories (note the term theory).  Science is continually improving upon itself, realizing that very few things can be proven as fact.  Science often corrects previous assumptions of many things, a few hundred years ago, the world was flat, and the Earth was the center of the universe...tell someone that now and youll get looked at like you didnt make it through Kindergarten.  My opinion on the beginning of time, the "first" human and what not tends to follow the theroy of evolution as it can be demonstrated in everday life, however through out my travels toplaces that i would rather not have gone, I have fouond little evidence for an all powerful and caring god as I watched my friend burn alive while his wife, daughter, and future son were waiting his return home in less than one month.  Sorry.....those are some of my thoughts, I am not a violent man, and I live a very moral life, however, I don't believe in God....but on the same hand, I would be open to believe if I had ever seen any evidence of him/her, I firmly accept the fact that I don't know. 1
what are the new york state laws about violations of custody? i am trying to get my children back and i feel that my ex has violated the custody agreement but i am unsure of the laws on what is considered a violation....Please help If he has done something other than as outlined in the agreement, he has violated it. There aren't really laws that cover custody in general, aside from the major things like a biological parent has automatic custody. Instead, your agreement should contain everything. If he goes against it, contact your local police department (not 911) and tell them that your ex is violating your custody agreement. 10
Who is/was a better US President...G.W. Bush or Bill Clinton?  This is kind of a lopp sided question as it is always easier to complain about whatever we currently have.  However in this case the answer would be George W. Bush.  I have read some of the answers that you have gotten and some are based on complete misconceptions.  Yes our economy was better under the Clinton Administration, however that was due to the fact that the things that Reagan did for the economy were finally bearing fruit.  By the end of the Clinton years we were back into recession that plagued the early Bush Administration.  Clinton campaigned in 1992 promising National Health Insurance, however in his 8 years as President was not even able to get it to the floor of Congress.  Clinton had Congress's approval for the same reasons as Bush did in 1998 to go to war with Iraq, yet he never followed through with it.  If we blame Bush for making mistakes in his reasons for going to war with Iraq, Congress and the President made the same mistake in 1998.  What seems to be a common thing for both the American Public as well as our Politicians is a short attention span and a short memory.  In retrospect most Americans now think of Nixon as being a good President as well as a great statesman, yet in 1974 he was the most hated man in history moving Hitler to number 2 for the first time in over thirty years. 10

Why do prisoners get to "plea bargain" for the crimes they chose to commit? The way I see it, a woman does not get to say, "Look, I really do not want to be raped, so can you just fondle me?"  The clerk at the grocery store who is being robbed doesn't get to say, "I don't feel like getting a serious injury or dying right now, so instead of shooting me in the chest or head, can you just shoot me in the leg?"\n\nSo why do the criminals get to "bargain" and get to have the charges for the crime they committed made to be less than what they actually did? It's a very provocative question with a very mundane answer. I don't think it's fair either, but prosecutors sometimes need information about someone further up the line. If a rapist, for instance, also works with and has knowledge of a white slavery ring and can give credible testimony that will put the leaders and their underlings in jail a prosecutor may offer a lighter sentence in order to stop a larger criminal enterprise.\n\nThe other reasons are more disturbing. Sometimes a prosecutor's office is so overloaded that accepting a plea bargain is a way to make a dent in the case load that the office is carrying. Ideally, that would only occur with non-violent, first time offenders, but sadly that is not always the case.\n\nFinally, some victims are reluctant to testify or are so traumatized by the crime committed against them that they are unable to testify well and the D.A.'s office doesn't want to risk an acquital. In this same vein are cases that can mount a credible reasonable doubt defense and cases where the evidence is weak or tainted.\n\nIt a'int perfect, but its a better system than most others. 10
Does black magic exist? This may seem pretty irrational, but I've been going through a lot of various crisis and problems that are too miraculous to just be coincidence.\nWherever I go I feel like a strange, bad presence and I keep getting bad luck, not once or twice but a whole chain of incidences that seem to plague me wherever I go.\nMy fiance thinks someone has cursed me or placed black magic. My family and I are a case of riches to rags and with so many things happening one after the other it just seems too fixed or 'designed' to be just coincidence! Now the last straw is my mother has developed a serious disease and my brother developed mental problems. I've also came into serious problems in Education.\nIt just all seems to "fixed", like nothing good is happening. Does black magic, curses, or hexes exist, and what can I do to stop this obsession of it or cure myself of it if it exists? magick is magick.  tis the soul of the caster that taints it. 1

How american parents teach very naughty kid ? i live in asia which most of parents think the only way to teach the naughty kid are by punish them like spank, hit em' using belt, any violence thing. they think if they're soft to their kid, the kid will be naughtier. In US, we can end up in jail if hurt a kid physically, it's considered as child abuse. We punish naughty kid by suspending them, give no permissions to leave house or even bedroom, taking away their allowance, phonecalls, their favorite things such as games, comics, movies, etc. If cannot handle on our own, seek professional help from experts or some institutions, a sort of military school is an option. 1

If I like to have sex with transexuals, does that make me gay?? I Just love having sex with them, they feel even more femenine than some women. I also like to be taken by them. It depends on their genetalia. If they have female sexual organs then no you aren't gay but if they have a penis then yes you are probably bisexual with a fetish for transexuals. Some people confuse the term transgender with transexual so I wasn't sure which one you were really asking about. 9

what does a franchise tag mean?  Jerry is mostly right, except that the player can sign with another team, and his current team gets a chance to either match it or let the player go. If they let him go, the other team that signs him has to give up two 1st round picks in compensation. Nobody's going to give up that much to sign a player, so basically the player is locked into his current team. 6

the reading of the verdict was read aloud by the judge; however, a juror yells out " that is not the verdict a agreed upon.  The Judge let the jury go back in the jury room and decide on another verdict.  My Question is did he have the right to allow the jury to redeliberate, when the first verdict was already read in the court room?  My lawyer ask for mistrial, also a dismisal with no evidence; however, the judge ignore the attorney request.  looked at my son and said you're going to prison. by the way the first verdict read, was not quilty. Since the judge let the jury redeliberate within five minute of the second verdict it was quilty.  Oh, I cannot get the court reporter dispositon, it have been eight months. I am African American take that into account.**** Who is holding that diposition report?  this case cost me $12,500. The law is not for African Americans, you are "f".  My Lawyer was wonderful. It is entirely possible the jury foreman simply made a mistake in filling out the verdict form.  The person you should talking to about your questions is the attorney who represented your son at the trial. You need an expert opinion on what grounds, if any, there are for an appeal. 10
Friend and money? A friend owes me money. She got mad at me when I started to collect it from her. We already talked the date when she will pay me. I just left her a message reminding her bout her debt and suddenly got angry at me. I know I said it in a nice and polite manner. Now I am upset at her for acting that way. I don't want our friendship to ruin just because of money. Now what should I do? Now I think I can't confront her coz I am upset and so as she. The two of us might explode. You have 3 choices:\n\n1. Forget about the money and retain the friendship.\n2. Sit down with her one more time and give her another chance to pay you (all the money at once).\n3. End the friendship.\n\nAs Pink Floyd sang, "Money is the Root of all Evil".\n(I'm sure that was written somewhere ;-)\n\nUnless you are married to someone, the subjects you should tread lightly on are: politics, religion, money. 9

I need advice on how to start a grassroots campaign to get a masonry ordinance passed in my community.? we have builders/ developers coming into our twon and throwing up homes with a lick of brick that will not have much durability that brick homes have.  The will also bring down the property values of the homes in the surrounding neighborhoods.  HELP! Find out what city council and the mayor are doing about this situation, call them.  If they're not doing anything then organize community members, call a town meeting to speak about yours and others concerns of the buildings going up.  Get a petition of the parties who wish to be involved or are just in support of your views.  On the petition, ask for phone numbers and or emails or even addresses in case you need to raise funds to support your concerns.  Seek out a Political Analyist or lobbyist to represent your concerns, this part might take money.  If you are a small/medium sized town then just take your petition to the mayor or city council members to address the situation and pass laws accordingly.  If you feel the mayor and council are not doing a good enough job, organize the members of the community to organize a protest at the next city meeting.\n\nFor further inquiries and questions email me at\nwatty_ofthe_wattykins@yahoo.com 10

What philosophy are AMD Cpu's built on?? How was the company started, and how do they compare to intel for quality and performance? AMD was first established on May 1, 1969 and started as a company working out of one of the co-founders living rooms. AMDS's main goal was simple, they wanted to create a successful semiconductor company. By September AMD had raised enough money to open their first permanent home, at 901 Thompson Place in Sunnyrak. By the end of AMD's fifth yaer, there was around fifteen hundred employees making over two hundred different products, in their first five years AMD made nearly $26.5 million in anual sales. AMD's sales steadily grew throughout the years until 1986 when the tides of change swept the industry and Japanese semiconductor makers began to dominate the market. AMD, along with the rest of the industry, began searching for new ways to compete with the market. The solution, AMD began building its submicron capability with the Submicron Development Center. AMD's new ability to compete in the market led to the development of their microprocessors compatible with IBM computers. AMD increased drastically through 1995 - 1999 due mainly to their increasingly competetive product offering. With the development of the AMD - K6 processor AMD was able to become a serious competitor to Intel in the microprocessor market. \n\nAMD vs. Intel\n\nIn 1997 AMD introduced the first of a new line of processors, the k6, which was supposed to compte directly with Intels socket 7 CPU. The k6 processor had a definite edge over Intels chip. The k6 core was much more powerful then Intels and it also held a slight advantage in the MHZ departmant. Intel quikly countered the k6 with the PII putting Intel well infront of the CPU market. AMD began to challenge the market again a year later with the releasal of the K6-2 that had 100 mhz frontside bus and contained a new technology that enanched 3d games without having a graphics accelerator. The k6-2 began selling slowly but it quickly caught on in the OEM matkets and really caught on in the gaming worlds because of the 3D/Now techology that provided the extra edge that the gamers needed. Intel had control over the higher end computers but AMD was making a nice little hole in the gaming market until Intel tried to beat them again with the Celeron processor. At first AMD had no problem out doing the L2 cacheless chip but wiht the intoduction of the Celeron 300A, that could easily be overclocked between 400 and 450 mhz, going as high as 550 - 600 mhz with someluck and alot of cooling, AMD was facing a problem. The only thing that allowed AMD to compete with the Celron chip was its 3D/Now technology that still gave it the edge over the cheap and fast Cleron. A price war between AMD and Intel followed while AMD tried to compete with both the Celron and the PII but ing January of 1999 AMD actually outsold Intel. Though it was only one month of being the leader of the market it still gave the company the consumer confidence they needed to compete with Intel. 5

Any DIET tip[s on controlling appetite?  Yes. \n1. Reduce sugar intake. Intake of sugar will cause an insulin reaction that will lower your blood sugar.  This will cause you to feel hungry and want to eat again. If you then choose a sugary or starchy food, you've started the cycle over again.\n\nTry eating vegetables, cheeses, meats and other low carb options.  When you want to snack, stay away from sugary items.  Stay away from Soft drinks! Stay away from sugar substitutes.  Sometimes your insulin system mistakes these for sugar.\n\n2.  Eat small frequent meals.  Eat about enough to curb your hunger for about 2-3 hours.  Then eat again when your hunger comes back.  You'll find that the total calories you consume will be much lower than if you ate a few big meals.  I reccomend 5-6 small meals per day.\n\n3.  Drink lots of water.  Sometimes your brain will confuse it's signals and you will find yourself eating when you are actually dehydrated.  64-96 ounces per day works great.  That's A LOT, but start small and work up to it.\n\nGood luck and God Bless! 3

How does temperature affect the taste of food and drink? For example, white wine, tap water, Cointreau, lager and even chocolate taste much better cold. On the other hand, tea, coffee and brandy, as well as most cooked meals, taste much better warm or hot. English beer and red wine are better at room or cellar temperature. Why? Heat amplifies smell, and most of "taste" is actually based on smell.  Without smell, coffee and chocolate would just be bitter anf gross.  So aromatic things smell more strongly.  Cold also delays the taste of things, so cold chocolate probably loses enough of the bitterness by being cold, while retaining enough aroma, such that that might make it better.  Of course, if you like your chocolate bitter (like I do) you won't prefer it cold for taste reasons.  I think cold chocolate--especially dark chocolate--is too tasteless.\n\nOccasionally there is a matter of texture as well.  With chocolate, for instance, I'd dispute that it tastes better cold, but it is certainly less melty.  With beer/lager/ale, heat can make it go flat, which affects its taste, but with liquor, the intense burn of the alcohol makes the burn worse.  Aromatic liquors like brandy/cognac and whiskey/scotch are heated to allow the aromas to be stronger, but really, most all alcohol is innately gross, and is an acquired taste--so people tend to learn to like them in particular ways, but I don't think any of it is particularly innate.  Cognac, scotch, and fine wine all take years to "learn" to appreciate. 2

There is a phrase that scientists use called Carrying Capacity which is the amount of a species that the environment can hold due to limiting factors which are any biotic (living factors) or Abiotic (nonliving factors)factors that restrict the existence, reproduction, or distribution of organisms. When the number of a species reaches or exceeds the carrying capacity then limiting factors begin to take effect such as the amount of food available. Also when the carrying capacity is exceeded competition begins for food, shelter, and reproductive rights. There are three types of growths: stable  growth, rapid growth, and slow growth.An example of stable growth would be the U.S. an example of rapid growth would be China. Since not all countries have the same growth rate it is hard to say whether there are too many people in the world. So really it is a matter of opinion. In some countries there are to many people, such as third world countries, but in other countries there are not too many people. As for what we can do about it, there is nothing we really can do besides what China does (limits each household to one child). What happens is when the carrying capacity is exceeded there is not enough food, shelter, etc. for all the individuals in a population. As a result those individuals die and the population's size eventually falls below the carrying capacity(which is what happens in most third world coutries). This is referred to as 'Survival of the Fittest'. It's horrible to imagine but it's the truth and theres not much we can do about it. 10
is it ok to get wellfare?  There is much stigma and shame attached to people who are on welfare because of those who abuse this resource or because of ignorant people who don't understand and are quick to judge.\n\nThere are many reasons people seek help. Some have been displaced from their homes because of abuse and divorce, lost jobs, been displaced by natural disasters, have physical and or mental disabilities and many more legit reasons.\n\nWelfare is designed to help those in need with job training and skills, job retraining, educational needs, life skills, among other resources that may be available depending on individual needs and situation. \n\nHaving to rely on welfare short term to help you get back on your feet is ok and is not a form a laziness. \n\nTaking a job at Burger King or MacDonald's will not support a family but it will help in the short term. 10
I just bought Damien Rice's CD "O." In some parts, I can't hear anything.Is it supposed to sound that way? The song "Eskimo" is especially quiet.  It's a long song, and there are separate parts, but I listened for the first time yesterday and there were whole minutes at a time where I couldn't hear anything.  Is this just how the recording sounds or is there something wrong with mine? It sounds as if there's something wrong with either your CD or the player, I have the CD and although there are parts that are intentionally lower than others, there should be no problem hearing them. If the problem continues, try listening to the CD on another player to determine if the fault is with your system or with the recording.\nIf the system is not the fault then I'd take the CD back to the shop and get a replacement if I were you, it's well worth the extra effort (it's actually my favourite and most played CD). 8
what is the best weather website to get weather? right know i currently browse weather.gov? is there anything better then that choice? okay there is something really cool called KXAN 36-WeatherBug and immediately when you turn on your computer, it will show the actual temperature in your town!

We want next baby after 5 year , what we want to do? what are the birth controlling techniques, safe & easy?  Birth control includes abstinence, withdrawal(though it is not that safe),birth control pills, injectables, condom (for him), diapraghm. You can also try the rhythm method or simply knowing your wet and dry periods yet you can still have sex without worry. All you have to do is count 10 (ten) days since you had your period for this month. On the first day of your period up to the tenth day (incuding your last day of your menstruation) IT IS SAFE. After that ten days until your next menstruation, it is your fertile or your wet period. =) 9

Alcohol,  how are home brews made? I was told that there are simple ways of making alcoholic beverages simply by burying a bottle in a cool shady spot with fruit juices and some water.  and letting it ferment for a few days.  True? >Homebrewing typically refers to the brewing of beer on a very small scale, as a hobby for personal consumption or free distribution at social gatherings.\n\nThe Process:\n \nHomebrewing malt extracts: liquid in a can and spray dried.A typical batch of homebrewed beer is five US gallons (19 l) in volume, which is roughly enough for two cases — or 48 12-ounce (355 mL) bottles — of beer. In Britain homebrew is typically produced in 5 Imperial gallon (23 l) batches. It is produced by boiling water, malt extract and hops together in a large kettle and then cooling the resulting wort and adding yeast for fermenting. Advanced homebrewers make their own extract from crushed malted barley (or sometimes wheat) by a more complicated process of mashing the grain in hot water. In both cases, the wort is boiled for between 15 min and an hour, to remove some volatile impurities, dissolve the character of the hops, and break down some of the sugars. The wort is then cooled down to pitching temperature (70-75 °F or 21-24 °C). Quick cooling is needed to prevent early bacterial contamination or oxidation of the wort. Often, cooling is aided by a variety of wort chillers consisting of copper tubing through which cold water flows, and immersed in the wort. A more primitive method is to immerse the pot in a sink full of ice water.\n\n \nHomebrewing fermentation vessel with fermentation lock.The cooled wort is poured into the primary fermenter in an aggressive manner, so as to aerate the wort for the yeast's growth stage. The yeast is then pitched (sprinkled or poured) into the wort. Primary fermentation takes place in a large food-grade bucket or carboy, sometimes left open but often stoppered with the carbon dioxide gas produced venting through a fermentation lock. During this time, temperatures should be kept at optimum temperature for the fermentation process. For ale this temperature is usually 65-75°F / 18-24°C, and for lager it is usually much colder, around 50°F / 10°C. Starting within 12 hours and continuing over the next few days a vigorous fermentation takes place. During this stage the fermentable sugars (maltose, glucose, and sucrose) in the wort are consumed by the yeast. A layer of sediment, the trub, appears at the bottom of the fermenter, composed of heavy fats, proteins and inactive yeast. A sure sign that primary fermentation has finished is that the head of foam (krausen), built by bubbling of CO2, falls.\n\nOften, the beer is then racked (siphoned) into another container, usually a carboy, for aging or secondary fermentation. Racking is done to separate the batch from the afore-mentioned trub so that it is not used as food, as this can give the beer an off-flavor. During secondary fermentation the chemical byproducts from the primary fermentation are digested, which considerably improves the taste. Secondary fermentation can take from 2 to 4 weeks, sometimes longer, depending on the type of beer. Some homebrewers will keep the batch in the primary fermenter, called single stage fermentation, for the entire precess and simply put up with any off flavors. This eliminates the need for a second container, reduces labor, and reduces the likelihood of contaminating the batch with bacteria, or oxidizing it, during transfer to the second container. This is a good beginner strategy, especially for those not skilled with racking.\n\nOnce this secondary fermentation is finished, the beer is ready for carbonation. There are two methods of carbonation. The first method does not require much capital expenditure per batch but is more time consuming. About 3/4 cup of corn sugar (dextrose) or other fermentable sugar is added to the beer, which is then transferred to bottles and then capped, or placed in a keg. The fermentation of the priming sugar with left-over yeast suspended in the beer causes the carbon dioxide to be forced into solution in the beer. This takes 1-2 weeks. The second method involves pressurizing carbon dioxi 2

What is the most popular kind of music in the U.S.??  Have to agree with Shaun. What a shame, indeed.\nAs far as the charts go, these days it's definitely R&B/Rap/Hip-Hop, follwed by Country, Pop & Rock. As far as live concerts go, however, Rock is way ahead of the pack, followed by Country. Interestingly enough, I just recently read in The Washington Post that most radio stations in the U.S. are, in fact, programmed to Country! 8

Why does like charges repel each other?  This is a very good question. Ultimately it comes down to being one of the fundamental features of our universe. But it can also be broken down a bit.\n\nLike charges repel, and opposite ones attract because of differences in their electric fields. But the electric fields are really part of the larger electromagnetic force. This force is mediated by photons (light) and, indeed light is a self-propagating electromagnetic wave.\n\nBut there are also three other fundamental forces: gravity, the strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force. The strong nuclear force is well, strong, but very short range. It holds the protons and neutrons together in a nucleus (otherwise the like charges from the protons would break up every nucleus except hydrogen). The weak nuclear force is sort of a miscellaneous, and comes into play in certain radioactive decay sequences.\n\nIn the 1980s it was shown that the electromagnetic and weak forces are actually the same thing. The difference we observe is that the universe is, relatively speaking, "cold," and these two parts have separated out. It is sort of like having a glass of steam (one thing) which cools down until there is water and ice (two things). The water and ice look a lot different from each other, but are fundamentally the same. In the same way in the very, very early universe when things were a lot hotter, the electromagnetic and weak forces were identical - like the steam in the analogy.\n\nMore recently it was found that the strong force can also be linked to the "electroweak" force in the same sort of manner. The mathematical and physical details are different from "electroweak unification" but the basic principle is the same. It was from this Grand Unification of the electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces the the theoretical notion of quarks came. This GUT has been tested and the experiments show it is right on target.\n\nThe next step is to connect the electro-weak-strong force with gravity. This is a lot harder because the first three are understood in the context of Quantum Mechanics and gravity is understood with General Relativity. QM and GR are not compatible on some basic principles.\n\nOne approach that is being tried to combine QM and GR is with string theory. To make this work the universe is composed of 11 dimensions, the usual 3-spatial and 1-temporal dimentsion, plus 7 very, very small spatial dimensions. If these extra 7 are looped around themselves so that they are vastly "smaller" than a proton, we'd never really notice them.\n\nWhat string theory seems to suggest is that there are just some ways to make stuff in the universe, and one of these ways is to create the "force particles" that mediate the fundamental forces.\n\nSo, extrapolating that, and realizing that string theory is in no sense proven, we can say that "like charges repel" because of the geometry (the 11-dimensions) of the universe.\n\nBut string theory remains far from being complete mathematically, and no one can really make solid predictions yet to test it. So, you can also fall back on the answer in the first paragraph. 2
Should I give my phone number to a woman or ask for hers? I like a girl I met who works at a department store.  We had a nice chat while I was buying something and I left her my card.  It has been two weeks and I have not heard from her, even though she seemed interested in me when we met.  Should I assume that she is not interested in me or did I make the mistake of not asking for her number?  Should I go back to ask for her number or should I just accept that she isn't interested? You should go back to the store at about the time that she finishes work but not give ask her phone number or ask her why she did not call you. Buy somth and then ask her to go for a beer.\nBe careful it is not good to show to girls that you are offended or that you feel bad that she did not call you. She might have forgot it or was ashamed to call a stranger. 9

What does it mean when a guy saids he needs space, please would like answers from guys?  well Im not a guy---but this is exacly what it means--and this is from experience.\nWhen a guy says that--they are basically not interested anymore--either they have meet someone else or is totally loosing interest in you and wants to know if after the space is given to find out if he cares for you or is just "used" to you.\nabout 4 years ago my boyfriend told me the same thing--I was really confused---so I decided to give him what he was asking for--we both agreed we would give eachother 2 months-----and he dated someone else--but after like 3 weeks he was callign me and I realized how much I had missed him too!  WE got back together and have been happy since--so I think a little of space is good in a relationship. 9
why do girls like to be tied up?  I can only speak for myself. First of all...probably only my husband could get away with it as it is deeply personal and puts you in a very vulnerable place...but it is the idea of giving control up and being taken care of that would turn me on about being tied up...but the whole whips and stuff are not sexy to me so it is not about pain or being abused...it is just the age old concept of being swept off on a white horse and being overwhelmed by masculinity (did I just say this out loud!) There is a caution in this...women also want to be equals with men and respected and treated like they have a brain and can use it... but there is this oxymoron in us that also likes to be taken care of...at least emotionally. 9

Why the shape of rainbow is as a semi-circle?  When light is refracted off of droplets of water it enables you to see all the colors that make up white light (sunlight, even light from bulbs.) creating what people more commonly refer to as a rainbow. \n  Go outside on a sunny day and spray the waterhose if you have one. If you look very carefully, you can see that the rainbow you created is not just a semi-circle, but a full circle! The bottom half is harder to see, but it is there. The reason rainbows don't look like that when we see them outside is because we are too low to the ground to see the rest. 2

Why do I feel like my lungs are filled with chlorine or ammonia after I workout? My lungs burn and feel like I have been cleaning with bleach or a heavy duty chemical and have inhaled the fumes.  I am not working out near a pool or use bleach on my workout clothes.  It happens when my heartrate goes up (I am not overheated) and my lungs expand. If the air is dry or cold, then when you inhale, the moisture gets taken from your lungs into the air (since hot air can hold more moisture - when the air heats in your lungs it needs moisture and takes it).  When you breathe a lot more, like when you exercise, the lungs dry out more than normal.  This drying of the lungs is normally felt as a painful burn, and it's why when people run in cold weather they normally try to breathe through their noses.  The passage through the sinuses is longer, and gives the air more time to heat up and absorb moisture on the way down to the lungs instead of in the lungs themselves.  Try to pay attention and always breathe in through your nose while exercising.  See if this helps.  If it does, and you work out at home, then you could try to get a humidifier. 3

where do southern natives get there accent from. and why do the black people speak different from the white?  By Southern natives, I take it you mean people born and raised in the southern United States?\nMany if not most of the original European settlers in that part of the country were from Scotland, Ireland or Wales.  This mixed with both African influences and a stand-offishness to the more British speakers of the north eventually lead to the Southern American English (SAE) form of speech.\n \nAlthough most African Americans spoke similar to their white counterparts until very recently, an upsurge in differentiation started in the 1950’s and 1960’s which soon separated the speech patterns of many. 1

They told me that I had to come back on Jan.23. Well I came back today and was told the same thing. Now they want me to come back on Feb.14. At what point do they have to drop the charges for lack of a report? I would send a letter to the court and motion the court to dismiss with prejudice the charges for a lack of timely filing.  The prosecutor has time to file these charges.  I hope that you won't get yourself into this jam again. 10

How do I get my husband to "last" longer? I've tried being adventurous (by that I mean REAL adventurous)  and wearing lingerie. We've tried products. Now, what comes next? Choose a way so that you are in control of what's going on (he's not moving).  Believe it or not it's much easier to control if the girl is doing the work.  Then ask him to signal you with a tap or something when you should stop moving until he is OK again.  Keep doing this until you guys get it right.  If you mess up well it's all just fun so don't worry about it.  Just keep practicing.  Soon you'll learn what his queues are and he'll be able to tell further in advance when to tap you.  Eventually you won't have to totally stop, you can just change the movements so that you don't set him off.  Good luck. 9

Most regiments had their own flag, like the Green Mountain Boys. One of the more popular ones today is either the Betsy Ross, which was adopted June 14, 1777  or the Culpeper, used by Colonel Patrick Henry's First Virginia Regiment of 1775. This is the famous 'Liberty or Death Don't Tread on Me' flag. 10

IF YOUR FIANCEE WAS LEAVING TO GO TO IRAQ IN A MONTH WOULD YOU SPEND 150.00 TO go SEE THEM ONE LAST TIME ? BEFORE THEY DEPLOY! You bet I would! Just don't expect the worst! You said "see them one last time" like you were never going to see him again. I know it's a hard thing to swallow, but what you need to do is expect the best! Keep telling yourself that he WILL be coming home safe! We're all rooting for our guys and gals over there! You're not alone, honey! Hopefully, this crap will be behind us soon. 10
Does a minor's mental health record get reported to any agencies? meaning is there a database that shows someone was admitted to a hospital for treatment, etc... You and the hospital are the only ones. And the hopital only knows what is on paper. Hippa, is placed in all the paper work. It lets you know who can review medical info and who can not. The scary thing is that BIG BROTHER has some control on medical records. Though you are to be notified of anyone requesting the information 3

Can animals really predict earthquakes?  There was a PBS program 'Nature', just aired a couple of weeks ago, about whether animals can predict nature disasters like earthquakes and tsunamis. Whether animals can predict earthquakes is not conclusive. But there's a scientist in Berkeley (forgot his name) claimed he had predicted earthquakes accurately in the last few decades. What he used was simply newspaper ads on missing pets. He said normally you'd see about 10-15 missing pets ads, but before earthquakes, the missing pets ads would increase. His theory is contraversial, but it's worth a try. You may want to test that theory. \n\nThe program also mentioned about the terrible tsunami in Asia over a year ago. It mentioned none of the animals got harmed since they 'knew' the waves were coming and escaped from the disaster. \n\nOne theory is that animals can hear low frequency sound from beneath the earth, like grinding sound of moving rocks. \n\nAnyway, you'll find some interesting programs on PBS stations. 2

what do you know about Saudi Arabia?  Sau·di A·ra·bi·a (sou'dē ə-rā'bē-ə, sô'dē, sä-ū'dē) \n\nA country occupying most of the Arabian Peninsula. Inhabited since ancient times by nomadic Semitic tribes, the region was consolidated under Muhammed, who established a theocratic state at Medina and gained control of all Arabia by 630. After the caliphate was moved from Medina to Damascus in 661, the peninsula remained fragmented until most of it was united in the 18th century under the Saud family, who adopted the Wahhabi form of Islam. Crushed by Egyptian and Ottoman opposition in the 19th century, Saudi forces reconquered the peninsula in the early 20th century. The unified kingdom of Saudi Arabia was created in 1932 as an absolute monarchy under Wahhabi law. Oil was discovered in 1932 and soon became the mainstay of the economy. Riyadh is the capital and the largest city. Population: 25,700,000 . 4

~~~~~~~~~~Riddle~~~~~~~~~~? A man just stole 2 jugs weighing 10 pounds each he weighs 90 pounds. The police are chasing him and he comes to a bridge that he know's of and it has a sign that read's "to go across you must weigh 100 pounds NO MORE NO LESS, or the bridge will collaspe. How does the man get across? Presumably the best way would be to juggle the jugs, carefully keeping one in the air and one in his hand at all times.  Of course, I don't think that a ninety-pound man would very easily juggle two ten-pound jugs while running from the police, but this is only a riddle, I suppose. 4

why are the oakland raiders on monday night football anymore?  The Raiders were on Monday Night Football in Week 1 of the current NFL season.  It was the Raiders vs. The Patriots on Sept. 8th.  \n\nThe NFL chooses which teams play on Monday's night when they make up the schedule.  They typically schedule the best teams and biggest stars for that night, so as to gain maximum exposure; however, the league has sometimes been criticized for reflexively excluding teams that had finished near the bottom of the previous season's standings from the Monday night schedule.\n\nSo as far the Raiders being on MNF next year, it's not looking great but you never know. 6
what is marshall law?  "Martial law" is defined by Black's Law Dictionary: "1. The law by which during wartime the army, instead of civil authority, governs a country because of perceived need for military security or public safety. - The military assumes control purportedly until civil authority can be restored. 2. A body of firm, strictly enforced rules that ar eimposed becaues of a perception by the country's rulers that civil government has failed, or might fail, to function. - Martial law is usu[ally] imposed when the rulers foresee an invasion, insurrection, economic collapse, or other breakdown of the rulers' desired social order. 3. The law by which the army in wartime governs foreign territory that it occupies. 4. Loosely, military law."\n\nIf you need further information, or information about specifics of martial law like absolute martial law or qualified martial law, please post a new question and I'd be happy to help. 10

Why are drugs illegal?  Drugs are illegal because of the amount of money the government earns and loses because of them. If we legalized drugs, the government would have great difficulty taxing them. Most drugs are imported illegally from forign countries. Right now, america gets a bunch of money from its war on drugs including busts and payoffs. As a giant corporation, it would be stupid to allow people to purchase outside of your domain. I would never say that america does not allow it because they are bad for you- so are cigarettes, alchohol, most legal diet pills, caffine. Did you know that caffine causes weight gain, the shakes and you can actually overdose and die from it. (granted, that is an extreme and rare case) so, they do allow things that are bad for us as long as it is taxable. 1
If jesus is Lord / God when he died on the cross who kept the universe in order? Is the trinity false? Excellent question.  But unfortunately, I have yet to hear a good answer.  God the Almighty Creator doesn't even blink for a second, nonetheless die.  If this were true and God died on the cross, then ALL existance would cease.\n\nHere's what makes the trinity questionable:  If you have a creature (i.e. a created being), and a third of that creature dies while the other two-thirds are still alive, then that creature hasn't really died.  All parts would have to die for the creature to be considered dead.  \n\nSo if this applies to a created being, how can it not apply to the Creator?  If a third of God dies, but the other two-thirds are still alive, then that third didn't really die; especially when he's resurrected within a number of hours.\n\nThe fact is that death in itself is a creation.  Therefore the dimension of death cannot be applied to an infinite entity which exists outside the realm of all creation.  i.e. No creator, or any part of a creator, dies.\n\nWhat does that mean anyways?  What does it mean that a third of God has died???  This can only indicate that the trinity is not true; it's merely a pagan practice that has filtered down to blemish the noble message of Prophet Jesus (peace be upon him).  (see link below)\n\nFor those who say angels, well who was sustaining the angels in God's absence?  Did you really hear yourself say that?? 1
Will I have a great day tomorrow??  You can increase your chances of having a great day tomorrow, if you plan what you will do tomorrow still tonight, before you sleep.\nIf you already wake up knowing what you have for the day, the chances of having a great and productive day are much higher. 9

i want to know about kinds of workouts to lose weight? give examples plz?  try taboo\nWHAT to eat for losing weight\n\n• Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, especially NC (negative calorie) food.\n\n* Print these lists. They will be your ... "Bible", from now on !\n* Dill and parsely - include them in all your salads. Also ognion + garlic.\n* Try eat mostly fresh vegs & fruits (whenever possible, of course)\n* If you really want a book, then check this out: The Negative Calorie Diet Workbook & Cookbook - eBook (Win95/98 only). Read more about this e-book here.\n\n\n• Eat fish, chicken, beef, pork. (preferences are in this order)\n\n* If you are a vegetarian, then ignore this!\n* Avoid fat meat\n\n\n• Eat 2-3 slices of bread/day. Don't EVER exclude bread from your diet!\n\n• Snacks between meals (if needed): apples, oranges, grepfruits and other NC fruits\n\n* Don't cheat ... NO cookies, chips, candies, brownies etc! \n* EVEN if they have "low fat" indication... They might have low fat, yet they can have lots of CALORIES !!!\n\n\n• About rice, potatoes, beans, [xxx]nuts, pastry, pasta... you know!\n\n* Don't eat too much of those, at least during the first weeks of the diet. I'm not a low carb addict, but I've noticed weight gains if consuming those in large quantities, especially when associated with other foods.\n* If you like them a lot, try and eat them like one meal. A nice delicious plate of spaghetti could be your lunch (never dinner!), followed by a nice big apple. These rich starch foods are not good for dinner!\n* At dinner time, chose mainly large mixed veggies salads... with fish, lean meat or cheese (if you are not a vegetarian). \n\nif u want to lose weight the best food to it are baked potatoes with nothing on it. no salt no nothing just plain. u can eat a 10000000000 baked potatoes till ur stuff and not gain a pound. i heard that from a weight loss tape. the best drink is water or gatorade. thats a start then when you work out do some taeboo. if u want a macine. run with dumbells on a treadmill. u could do the rocky workout. but thats a new story. u could use a butterfly macine i think it works the abs\n\n1) It is not just the amount you eat, but what you eat. Lean meats and vegtables that snap are a good place to start. And by snap I mean fresh and not boiled or doused with better or whatever.\n\n2) Exercise moderatly but for about an hour every other day. Spend half of that walking or running at a good enough pace for you to feel labored. The other half of the time use weights, or exercises such as push ups or situps to get a muscle "burn". A gym is also an option, but I don't know if you have the money for or want to spend the money on it.\n\n3) Sleep well. To bed earlier and up earlier. Exercise in the morning when you wake up, not in the evening before bed. 7 hours of GOOD sleep is a must.\n\n4) Occupy yourself with a hobby that keeps your attention for a long period of time. A hobby like this keeps your mind focused and gives less of a chance for snacking from boredom.\n\nThat is a good place to start... if you see good results, keep it up and modify to fit you... if it does not, see a doctor AND a trainer \n\nKeep working out, drink water a lot, eat 5 to 6 meals a day but in small quantities, vegtables are important specially cucumber and lattice, fruits not be eaten after meals except by 2 to 3 hours, minimize the starch quantities in your meals lots of salad is important, your last meal must be before you sleep by 2 to 3 hours\nthe most important thing is you don't lose patient wait and have a strong will to be as what you want\n\nyou might have some more ideas from www.ivillage.com\n\ngood luck 3
in texas,what percentage of real property does the surviving spouse receive, what percent of mineral rights? decedant married only once and 3 surviving children from marriage. surviving spouse given power of attorney by children. Real property that is heir propery now has a producing well with payments being made. Is spouse entitled to a percentage of monthly royalty payments? As usual with law-related questions on Yahoo! Answers, far too little information has been given to answer this question adequately.  Texas is a community property state, which means that unique laws apply to possession of property.  If the decedant received the real property and mineral rights as premarital property, a gift to one spouse, or through an inheritance, it is considered separate property.  If the property is community property, the decedant has the testamentary capacity to device his half of the community property.  In Texas, community property has a survivorship aspect, and the 1/2 goes to the widow or widower in absence of  a will.  From the limited and incomplete facts presented, the surviving spouse, assuming the decedent died without a will, should receive the entire sum of community property.\n\nWithout more specific information, this is the extent of the information I can offer.  I recommend you seek an inheritance attorney for the specifics of this information. 7
What is the purpose of an appendix?  Currently, the function of the appendix, if any, remains controversial in the field of human physiology.\n\nHypothesized functions for the appendix include lymphatic, exocrine, endocrine, and neuromuscular functions. However, most physicians and scientists believe the appendix lacks significant function, and that it exists primarily as a vestigial remnant of the larger cellulose-digesting cecum found in our herbivorous ancestors. Some people note, however, that the pineal gland which only recently (around 1960) has been found to produce important chemicals like melatonin was once considered a "vestigial remnant" as well. 2
Will the U.S. ever adopt a universal healthcare system? Why, why not?  Canada's government did not fall apart.  Government coordinated healthcare systems are successful in other nations (including the German system, which I know little about, but have heard is probably the best system for the US to look to as a guide).  Health Insurance companies currently waste excessive amounts of money on marketing, administration and other non-healthcare related costs...  That doesn't seem very efficient. 10
What's the eye on the dollar , means ?  "The all seeing eye" this is the eye of god looking down on us. the writing at the bottom of the pyrmid is latin numerals meaning 1776 the date of our independence its at the base because it mean that is the base of our countary and the eye on top it showing god is on top and in control of our lifes and state. our founding fathers wanted us to remeber that god comes first and is even about us and state. 7
what is unpleasant about astronomy?  Actually, contrary to popular belief, most astronomers do NOT stay up all night. In some cases one does (typically if you go to an observatory), but when you are observing with radio telescope arrays or satellites you can essentially e-mail in your observatons and then sit back and watch TV while they're being done. (You can't just send an text e-mail with your requests, you have to work with some fairly complex software to generate the observing information.)\n\nMost of the time for astonomers is spent back at their home institution in front of a computer. That is where all the information from telescopes, satellites or whatnot are analyzed using a wide variety of specialized software packages. That data analysis almost always takes a lot longer than the actual observations.\n\nThen you have to write it all up and show how your data is either just darn interesting, or fits with an established theory, or - if you're lucky - doesn't fit with an established theory.\n\nBut the process for doing this can take months or years. Rarely is anyone in modern science, not just astonomy, working alone. You need to get input and help from your colleagues (and help them when they are taking the lead in writing up papers).\n\nYou need to send the paper in to be printed, realizing that if it is in a hot field it had better be old news by the time the actual print copy appears. You need to send your finished paper out to friends and others in the same sub-field. Post it one electronic document-servers for astronomy and physics. And also go to either specialised or general astronomy conferences. The American Astronomical Society has two big conferences a year. At the confernes you need to meet other people and start to cross connect information as well as promote your own ideas.\n\nLet's see, you also have to write grants. Getting grants for telescope or satellite time is often not that hard. You have to be able to scientifically justify your observations and don't get everything, but it is not terribly difficult to build up more data than you can use in a couple of years. The hard past --- and this is critical --- is that it is much harder to get grant money. If you are a postdoc you may need a lot of grant money just for your salary.\n\nOn top of that, many astronomers have to do something else. Often it is to teach a couple of classes at a university. Or, if you are working at some place like the National Radio Astronomy Observatory you need to work on the various software packages and routines that you and others use to process and analyze data.\n\nAnd on top of that you need a job. My own experience was more or less typical (I was a radio/X-ray astronomer for about a decade after grad school).\n\nAfter college there were 4 more years of grad school in physics (about half of all astronmers have physics degrees). I actually finished slightly faster than some. Then I had two 1-year teaching positions as a Visiting Professor. After that I got a 2-3 year postdoc at Penn State. It turned out to last for 6 years, except that wasn't obvious at the time and except for one year I spent a lot of time looking for a permanent position. I got one, finally, and went the astronomy group at Fermilab outside of Chicago.\n\nNote that by this time others that I had known in college, even some slow ones, had houses and were well established into careers. Boring ones, but careers none the less. We (myself + wife + kid) were still renting and while my salary was okay, it wasn't particually impressive for the amount of effort that had gone into the whole process.\n\nAnd I ended up not liking the work at Fermilab a whole lot (turns out I had a brain tumor - but that's another story).\n\nSo after 2 years at Fermi I, very, very reluctantly left science for various computer and technical writing jobs with various business entities. I make more money, do a lot less work, and still at times regret having to leave science sometimes.\n 2
Is there any area of the US not susceptible to: hurricanes, tornados, earthquakes or other natural disasters?  a natural disaster such as earthquakes are possible anywhere.  just some areas (along fault lines) are more prone to the effects.  For my money, i would be most worried about a large volcano that spews ash into the atmosphere and causes the earth's climate to dramatically change.  Not much you can do about that! 2

What are these yahoo points good for?  The points are a form of reward for participation. As you gain points, you advance in levels. At higher levels, you gain the ability to participate more (ask, answer, and rate more questions, etc.). At really high levels, you can get featured in a section of Yahoo Answers or even on the main page. In the Taiwan version of Answers, this has included pictures and a mini-interview. So if you get enough points, you can become famous, kind of like a rock star of knowledge! 5
How many wars has the US engaged in since the beginning of the 20th century? include those that were undeclared such as the invasion of Granada. Was the fighting in Korea considered a war? That all depends on your definition of war... There were, of course, WWI, WWII, Korean, Vitenam, Iraq I, Bosnia, Mogadishu, Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq II, but Korea, Vietnam, Iraq I, Bosnia, Mogadishu, Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq II were not declared wars, but "police actions" or some such. So, the only declared wars in all of the 20th century were WWI and WWII. Other invasions of import were: The Bay of Pigs Invasion, Grenada, Panama (Operation Just Cause), and Rwanda. So, if you include everything, it would be 14 wars. 10

If you had a gun and Osama Bin Ladin was in your sights would you blast him away or collect the reward or both  Well if he was in a hole like Saddaam, I would "accidentally" drop a bunch of food and water down there, and then "accidentally" cement the opening so that it could never be opened again. We'll let him spend a little time down there thinking about what he REALLY believes. Sounds cruel? It's better than killing him, and better than putting him in jail where someone could help him to escape and plan another attack. I personally would not have any problem with lopping off is head, but I don't think I'll be his judge. Money is no reward either. 10
I have heard Muslims say the Bible has been changed? If so, then can anyone show proof of when and where this happened, and produce the original manuscripts that have been corrupted?\nThis question is only open to serious answers please! This was the value of the Dead sea scrolls.  It gave scholars a chance to see what had changed in time since they were written and modern day editions.  The surprising thing was that there was a remarkable similarlity.\n\nHave you heard the saying, every translator is a liar?  This is because language changes with the culture.  A word like gay has has had its meaning changed dramatically over the last fifty years.\nUnless scholars change the words of scripture to reflect current usage, then the meaning will be lost.  So to stay authentic, the bible translations must change. 1

what to do with used plastic- kitchen bags?  The most common use for them in our house is as garbage bags.  We also use them for:\n\nFiller in packages; they were great at Christmas for mailing the gifts I made\n\nStuffing toys:  I made toy snakes, and the plastic bags "rattle" when they are squeezed.\n\nStuffing a giant Jack o Lantern I made for Halloween.  I can pull them out later to store the "pumpkin" and re-reuse the bags.\n\nThey can be cut up into really long strips by cutting around and around in spiral, and then used to make coasters and cup holders.\n\nMy list could go on and on.  I actually run out them frequently, and have to ask my neighbors to save them for me. 1

I mean seriously, how many times do people need to be told about the risks? Is there some switch that clicks off in their brain when they get on the internet? I just don't get it.\n\nI'm sorry if this sounds like a rant but I can't help but think of the other poor souls this sort of thing affects in the long run. Such as the CSR that has to take the call when there is fraud on a credit card or everyone's rates being forced up because of unresolved claims undermining the card company's bottom line...think about it...\n\nWhat are your thoughts? I agree with your thoughts. \nI have had mild attacks , so to say, asking people to never forward any junk mails to your friends, just because the mail wanted you to do so. The promised gains are just a gimmick to start a mail chain "around the world" or to colletc a lot of email addresses. \nSame with mails/web sites asking for people's persoanl info like cell numbers, credit card numbers etc. \n\nPeople have to understand that there is nothing like a free lunch. Companies can not/ will not gift you for sending random emails. \n\nI just intend to keep on reminding friends about this. All the best to u too. 5
I have some cards,football,basketball,baseball,ect..Im trying to sell them.How can i get prices on them?  In addition to buying the monthly Beckett Price Guide (you can get it any larger bookstore), you should probably pick up the larger quarterly publication Beckett puts out.  \n\nThis publication lists thousands more cards than the monthly, which tends to focus on more current releases.  Beckett also releases an annual price guide, which covers just about every card in existance for the sport you want.\n\nAlternatively, check out Beckett's web site, where you can subscrive to their online price guide for a few bucks a month per sport.\n\nJust bear in mind that the Beckett prives are a guide only; when you're selling to a dealer, for example, they might pay 15-25% of the Beckett value.  Ebay is a good source to sell uncommon cards, and you should typically expect to get about 30-50% of Beckett value. 6

What is the difference between a shampoo and soap? Is it just a marketing gimmick?

How long would it take Wrathpuppet to turn Schneb into a quivering ball of jelly? Intellectually speaking, of course. \n\n5 seconds, tops. Listen, don't get me wrong, I disagree almost 100% with almost every aspect of Schneb's worldview.\n\nHowever, I like the guy. Unlike many Christians he has come to where he is after a tremendous amount of study and reflection. I think that this is admirable.\n\nI've got a lot of respect for Schneb. I think he came up with the wrong solution, but he sure worked hard on the problem. He thinks that I have come up with the wrong solution, but so it goes.\n\nI have a problem with the people who blindly accept what they read or hear, taking the easy way out, and letting someone else do all that hard stuff, like "coming to your own conclusions."\n\nI often feel that it's not so much what you know, but how you think. 1

WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU GET A MEDICAL DISCHARGE FROM THE ARMY?  DO YOU GET ANY BENEFITS OR PAY?  It depends on how long you were in and what type of medical discharge it was. If you're in for more than two years, you're more likely to get medical benefits. If you're discharged because of something that happened to you while in the service, you can apply for "disability" benefits, where you'll be able to have some or all of your medical bills paid for. Mental health discharges get you limited benefits as well, depending on the conditions surrounding the discharge. Generally with a medical discharge, if you were in long enough, you'd still receive Montgomery G.I. Bill benefits as well, if you contributed. 10

Should the government ever have the right to spy on it's own citizens? If so, how does this increase freedom? The government should have the right to observe citizens. The NSA's mission is just that: to observe electronically criminal and terrorist interests. It is largely unlikely that a Big Brother society will develop as a result of this: the government will never have enough resources to listen in on everyone, nor would they want to. \n\nElectronic bugging has caught many criminals where standard investigations failed. These men include John Gotti, other Mafia dons, terrorists, and organized crime rings. It is an essential part of law enforcement and must continue. 10

What type of chemical reaction results in the creation of organic molecules from subunits?  The term is polymerization.  This can refer to the making of polysaccharides from simple sugars as mentioned above.  It can also mean the making of DNA or RNA from single nucleotides, the making of protein peptides from singel amino acids, or the making of polymer plastics from smaller maolecules.  The idea is that several monomers (free units that have a joining point at each end) can link together like a chain making a polymer.  There are more examples than the four here, but those four are the most common. 2
I need a home!? Okay I am 30yrs old, married with two kids. Both my husband and I make $125,000 yearly.  We have $160,000 saved for a home.  We have been in the market for quite sometime, but it seems to be impossible to buy a home in New Jersey.  The prices are outrageous, and a $3500 mortgage really really scares me.  I am very conservative and I like to feel comfortable and not fell tight with money.  Especially with kids, and what if one of us looses one of our jobs.  Currently we are renting an apartment $750 monthly, that is how we have been able to save a good chunk of $$$. We also have approximately $100K in 401K between the both of us... What should we do? Should we just jump in and buy a house for $500k? That's half a million dollars!!   And how is everyone paying these crazy prices for homes?  I really don't understand... Please advise on what we should do...Thank you You must live in North Jersey if you are seeing those kind of prices.  If you put 20% down on a $500,000 house that would be $100,000.  That leaves $60,000 in savings.  Hold on to that.  Setup automatic withdrawl so the mortgage payments come from that account.  Continue to add additional money to that account and you will have a nice buffer if one of you were to loose their job. 7

What are the health risks of drinking too much coffee? People always tell me I should cut back on my coffee intake (yet I think I am much healthier than the people telling me this) - are there truly adverse effects from drinking coffee? or is this a myth?

Hypotetically (use you nice imagination) what did Mother Teresa confess? Mother Teresa went to have the rights of reconcilliation (confession) daily.  Many of us see her well on her way to becoming a saint.  So, she did great stuff, and I just don't understand what she could possibly be doing that would cause her to confess to daily.  Any body have any realistic respectful hypotehtical ideas? Mother Teresa was a sinner just like the rest of us...even the Pope goes to Confession!\n\nUnlike me, and perhaps most everybody else, she was probably more keenly aware of her everyday failings such as impatience with others, lack of charity to some, or her failure to love God as much as possible.\n\nI imagine that most of her sins seemed trivial as viewed by God when compared to others, but a sin is a sin.\n\nThe only human who was ever sinless was Jesus. Until we're able to claim equality with Jesus (God), we'll always have sins to confess... 1

What is the role of JCC in BC, Canada, justice system?  I've included a link below about its role, and an excerpt below:\n\n"In the Supreme Court, a Judicial Case Conference (a "JCC") is scheduled. A JCC is an informal, off-the-record hearing before a judge to discuss the basics of case and whether there is any prospect for a settlement of the issues. A JCC is also useful for setting dates by which things must happen, such as the exchange of financial information, and for setting a trial date. Both parties must attend the JCC in person along with their lawyers." 10
can some one here solve the following question? A certain number of matches are needed to fill 24 boxes, with each box to contain the same number of matches. When less matches are put into each box, there are enough for 28 boxes. Find the total number of matches. In the given qts, the data provided is typical for using an orthodox yet nice method called L.P.P. (Linear programming) which is actually a graph method with the cartesian co-ordinates. I am sorry but i won't be able to provide you with the graph solution. Here is the theory of the required solution.\n\nLet the no of matches per box in the first case be x\nLet the no of matches per box in the second case be (x-y) where y is the number of matches decremented per box.\n\nNumber of matches in first case = 24x\nNumber of matches in second case = 28(x-y)\n\nHowever number of match boxes are equal\nHence, 24x = 28(x-y)\n       24x = 28x - 28y\n       28y = 4x\n        7y = x  ----------- (1)\n\nNote that since the total number of matches is not = 0\n hence,   x > y \n          x > 0\n          y > 0  \n and x,y are integers ----- (2)\n\nHence, x is minimum when y is minimum.\nMinimum integral value of y is 1\nHence minimum value of x = 7y = 7*1 = 7 ----- (3)\n\nFrom (1), (2) and (3), we conclude that...\n\nTotal number of matches required for the given qts should have a minimum value         \n   = 24x \n   = 24*7 \n   = 168   ........ (ANSWER)\n\nThe data provided by you is sufficent for finding minimum no of matches required since that's the limiting case. If you have a more precise condition in the given qts, a unique solution shall be obtained for the same. Graphs would have made the solution more interesting.\n\nI saw someone getting an answer as 672. It's possible if there is a condition in the given qts that "When the number of matches in each box are decremented, number of boxes required are 28. However, the number of matches placed in each box is found to be four less than the intial number of matches placed in each box". Then the solution would be like this :\n\nLet the no of matches per box in the first case be x\nHence, the no of matches per box in the second case be (x-4) \n\nNumber of matches in first case = 24x\nNumber of matches in second case = 28(x-4)\n\nHowever number of match boxes are equal\nHence, 24x = 28(x-4)\n       24x = 28x - 112\n        4x = 112\n         x = 28 \n\nClearly, like in the previous solution, in this case too, \n \n   x > 4\n  and its obvious that x > 0 and x is an integer.\n\nHence, the unique number of matches required in this case is \n         = 24x \n         = 24 * 28 \n         = 672 ... (ANSWER)\n\nI hope that this solution serves its purpose and helps you conquer this question satisfactorily. 2
Creation of this world? Why did GOD created us, sent us to this world and eventually created all those preachers to ask us to do good so that we will eventually be closer to HIM? God created us in his image. If you want to see God, look around. His handiwork is all around you. He sent preachers to us so we may better understand God. It's like learning about your friend so you can become their best friend. God wants to be soooo close to us. He loves us that much. Getting closer to God is up to you. Preachers won't do it for you. It's like training for a sport. You need to practice to get good. You need to pray and read the bible in devotions to get closer to God. Praying is you talking to God, and reading the Bible is him talking to you. The Bible is God's own words. We should know the words of our creator. Therefore, we should read the bible.\nHope this helped,\n~Me 1
Should I lose my virginity to my best friend who is also a virgin? We are both 26, I am female, he is male.?  Interesting to hear the female side of this one...I was 25 and she was my good friend at the time.  She was experienced and we were both well liquored.  Afterwards I wished I had started a bit earlier since sex is very nice.  I had one additional partner before getting married and still feel lacking technique-wise.  Looking back it did impact our relationship but after some time passed we got back to almost normal.  But the one night was not a topic of discussion (yes only one night..I don't know what I was thinking when I said we should chalk it up to experience and stop there). 9

How much wood could a woodchuck chuck, if a woodchuck could chuck wood?  I have to admit, this is a great question. According to the wikipedia.org: "The name woodchuck has nothing etymologically to do with wood. It stems from an Algonquian name for the animal (possibly Narraganset), wuchak.

How long after a nail puncture in my hand before I have to get a tetnis shot?  I don't know the answer to this question, but ASAP sounds like a good plan.\n\nHowever, I will point out that it is not the rust that causes tetanus.  It is microbes in the dirt (usually from feces) where the rusty nails often reside that cause the tetanus, plus the deep puncture wound that allow the spore to reach an environment that is not hostile to them.  So a puncture would from surgical steel or zinc plated nails is just as likely to cause tetanus if they have been in the dirt. 3

Does anyone know what Fibonacci numbers are? If so explain.? if you tell me who invented them I might make you best answer Fibonacci Numbers are the sequence of numbers defined recursively by:\n\nF(0)= 0\n\nF(1)= 1\n\nF(n)= F(n-2)+F(n-1)   for n > 1.\n\ni.e., \n0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55.......\n\nThe earliest known reference to Fibonacci numbers is contained in a book on meters by an Indian mathematician named Pingala called Chhandah-shastra (500 BC). In the West, it was first studied by Leonardo of Pisa, who was also known as Fibonacci (c. 1200) 4
Is the popular Christian attitude towrds homosexualty actually promoting homophobia in congregations?  Yes, they are espousing a hatred of their fellow man and a disrepect of privacy that is damaging to their credibility.  \n\nThe reason it's called homophobia is because every fundamentalist parent deeply fears that their child will be gay and they will be ostracized by their religious peers if they continue to love and respect their child.  This is one of the worst things that can happen to a fundamentalist Christian or Muslim.\n\nFundamentalists belive that they should treat their child as a sinning criminal if they are gay&#92;lesbian.  They say they love their own gay&#92;lesbian child as they love a murderer or a rapist or a terrorist.  Read the comments below, if you don't believe.  \n\nThat is the most warped twisted view of how the world should work that I can imagine.  It is also the reason that they insist that gay families should not be accepted as equals in society.\n\nIf a fundumentalist's gay or lesbian child decides to start a family, either by make a lifetime commitment to their same-sex parnter or adopting or concieving a child using in-vitro fertilization, or both, then the parents strict religious beliefs tell them that they must reject their own child and grandchild's family as sinful and an affront to God.  The same family that will carry on their own name, and will live far longer than the parent themselves.  They curse their own family as evil.\n\nOther church members will vigorously support their rejection of their own flesh and blood.  Fundamentalist christians with gay children live a life of pathetic misery due to their own ignorance and often die in shame, without their children beside them, and are remembered without fondness or love.  All Because they cling to one chapter of the bible which condemns homosexuality and also condones slavery and treating women as property.\n\nThat is why when you see homless, or drug addicted, prostituted or disease-ravaged gay kids, they are more likey to come from a fundamentalist family than any other place.  Love the sinner is just a slogan.  Ask these kids.  And I'm not even going into some of the beatings these kids, espeically boys, have to go through from thier fathers, (again, also proscribed in the bible.) 1

What is incredible about Einstein's brain?  Einstein's brain lacked a particular small wrinkle (the parietal operculum) that most people have. Perhaps in compensation, other regions on each side were a bit enlarged—the inferior parietal lobes. These regions are known to have something to do with visual imagery and mathematical thinking. Thus Einstein was apparently better equipped than most people for a certain type of thinking.\n\nThe website below has more details. 7

If they would have changed, my mindset would be different, but they REFUSE TO CHANGE, so I will. Just as a note to the last individual: yah, Canadians ARE so freakin nice, Dell does not outsource to Canada (has Dell-owned call centers in Canada), and many of the call centers in India are, also, not outsourced.\n\n Maybe your question could be more specific. What happened? WHY are you abandoning Dell? I work for Dell's DOC department, in a NON-OUTSOURCED Canadian call center, and I know Michael Dell cares A LOT about what his consumers think. He will often monitor calls himself or even take calls. \n\nMost large companies, espically those that outsource, have a difficult time controlling ALL of their employees and making sure they are representing the company as a concerned and understanding individual. To handle the flow of calls, so you are not waiting hours to speak to someone, requires a great deal of man-power; the more people you have between the top and the front line, the more difficult it is to ensure everyone is upholding your principles. How far did you go with your experience? Maybe you should try writing to Michael Dell to let him know your concerns. \n\nI find, at least as far as technical support, that some customers have expectations that are unrealistic. Many people think that because you bought -insert the name of any software product made by another company here- with their computer, that Dell should provide support for it. Think about it, if you buy Norton Antivirus from BestBuy, do you complain to them about Norton not working and expect them to fix it? Not likely. you contact the manufacture who is specialised in it. Many people have problems with their systems due to spyware and adware programs, but dont know they need to install anti-spyware software and do not recognise the symptoms. My question is, where you looking for free assistance with a DELL MANUFACTURED PRODUCT? \n\nI am not speaking on behalf of Dell here, but meerly my own experiences and how I look at our service. I would, at least, suggest contacting Michael Dell prior to giving up on Dell completely. I know that we DO hear feed back from him regarding both positive and negative customer experiences.\n\nPS: I have worked for other major comuter manufacturers and I must say Dell is NOT the worst in the industry, by far. The most important statistic agents are graded on here is customer experience, not call time as it is for most (forcing customers through as fast as possible to take more calls). 5

Is WAR a new kind of spectator sport, or don't we as people GET IT???  War has always been a spectator sport.  During the Civil War, crowds of people would ride out on a Sunday to watch the battle from a ridge in the distance.  War correspondents have always reported on the progress of wars, with the news eagerly followed by proponents and opponenets of the war alike.  The word "marathon" remembers a man who ran 26 miles back to Athens to report news of the Greek victory at Marathon, and then died.\n\nIn most ways it is a good thing.  War the the most serious government act, and as much should be known about the conduct of a war by the poeple as possible. Democracy is meaningless otherwise. 10

How to print out a webpage which not allows visiters to print in IE? When print it out --> blank page\nWhen save as --> blank page\nIt also disables highlighting, copy, and paste. http://www.squarefree.com/bookmarklets/zap.html - the "restore selecting" and "restore context menu" bookmarklets should help. As for saving the page, this shouldn't leave it blank, but without the URL I can't work out the exact dirty trick being used, but if you open it in a text editor, and look for display: none or visibility: invisible, and remove them where found, this may restore the page. 5

What cause a warm bottle of carbonated drink to “explode” when placed in a freeze overnight???  When you freeze water it expands, which increases it's volume. With a closed bottle, the pressure gives the expanding water no where to go, therefore the bottle must expand with the water, making it explode. 4
Ladies, If you care about your appearance around coworkers more than your lover what is that saying? You know doing your hair only when you are going to work, I mean you don't even do it for church ummmm? Petals is right. People you work with today, especially if you are young are always trying to be and act better than the other, especially if there are lots of girls. That is all, it has nothing to do with cheating, which, I presume is why you are asking. Plus they are in the public (if its a public type job) and they don't want to look like they are gross and have no hygeine. 9

Help!! Any tips on taking the highschool entrance exam?!? I'm sooooo nervous! Help! Some tips for you:\n\nAsk what type of questions will be on the exam.\n\nPlan ahead. Make a trip to the testing facility a day or two before to get a sense of environment and the location of the testing room. \n\nEat a well-balanced meal before taking the exam. \n\nBring personal identification to the test site. If you know ahead of time that you don't have proper identification, contact the Office of Testing Services before arriving to discuss alternate forms of acceptable identification.\n\nMake a trip to the restroom prior to testing.\n\nListening carefully to the instructions given by the Test Administrator will eliminate most errors in marking answer sheets or misinterpreting important information given out by the Test Administrator.\n\nGood luck! 4
What is the difference between comedy & humour?  Wow...the One, this is going to take some thought.  Is there a difference? Both are things that strike you as funny. I think they segue into each other and it's hard to see a difference but out at the edges, maybe, humor is gentler, and more spontaneous while comedy is more contrived.  I don't know.  I'll have to think some more on this. The first link has four definitions for comedy. The second has three  definitions for humor. 4

I need divorce from my wife she is mad?  Mutual consent is the best option.  This is a non-contested divorce.  Contact your local courthouse for the paperwork to file for a non-contested dissolution of marriage.  Most courthouse will have the paperwork for you to fill out.  I would start by making a list of the stuff that you want and a list of stuff she wants, have it signed and notarized and indicate that you are both not contesting the divorce.  This will protect the both of you if one decides to start being a problem. 10

How much IQ has George Bush got ? according to what the whole world can see, let's estimate his IQ Judging from how you formed your question, I don't think his IQ is the one you should be primarily worried about. There were mass e-mails, that were turned into urban legend about Bush's IQ being the lowest ever, but that was pretty much debunked by snopes. I think when you consider his academic accomplishments, even having high grades than his opponent in the last election, when he was in college, you see that he isn't really a dim guy. Now, if by the whole world means what some guy who couldn't handle a semester at a University of Michigan satellite school in Flint spliced together for film, then you do get a totally different idea. It is totally understandable to come to the conclusion that he's a dope. With an objective eye, looking at what is known about the man as a whole, knowing that when he ran for the Texas House of Representatives, and knowing that he lost because they figured him for a brainiac who would look past the needs of the people he would serve, knowing that he scored a 1206 on his SAT, putting him at about a 129 IQ roughly, I'd say "How much IQ has George Bush got?" isn't what you want to say. You want to say that you want to belong to a group that persecutes without knowledge of facts. Your goal is to feel as though you're making a cogent statement against someone by asking such a half minded question. If you want to ask ant question, ask "Why do I buy into what I am told, and do not seek out the correct information on my own?" 10

what is the main trust of Scriven model of educational evaluation?  Scriven defines “models”: as a term loosely used to refer to a conception or approach or sometimes even a method (e.g., naturalistic, goal-free) of doing evaluation... \n\nModels are to paradigms as hypotheses are to theories, which means less general but with some overlap. \n\nHis best known model is Goals-Free Evaluation which supplements inherent weaknesses in a goals-oriented approach by providing an unbiased perspective of ongoing events. \n\nDeveloped in 1972, this model in this model, the evaluator begins by examining outcomes of the program and attempts to infer the intended objectives from these observations.\n\nThe evaluator then identifies and interviews actual participants rather than program management and staff. Idea is to discover whether evaluator can match observed (implicit) goals with stated (explicit) goals without biasing the evaluation in advance by being told what they are "supposed to be". 4

Do USA have a really good explication to invad Irak and kill many USA people and Irak residents to?  Quite seriously the decision to invade Iraq was a sound decision for the information that we had.  In 1990 Saddam invades his neighbor Kuwait which leads to the Gulf War in 1991.  Following that war their are U.N. sanctions against Iraq as well as participation in arms inspection.  Saddam never completely complied with any of this and in 1998 the Clinton Administration received authority to use force against Iraq under the same information that the Bush Administration had in 2003.  The fact is that Congress had all the same information as the Executive Branch had.  We know that Saddam used WMD's against the Kurd's, so it is a known fact that at one time he had actual WMD's even if they were not present or found after our invasion of 2003.  It is felt by some experts that the actual WMD's were sent to Jordan and Iran prior to the war in 2003.  Why you may ask?  Well the fact is that if we invaded Iraq on faulty intelligence one must assume that our espionage efforts were fed faulty information by Saddam's Regime.  Why?  Saddam has long wanted to be a Martyr for the Islam Cause and any standing up to the evil Western Cause  just makes him more powerful in the eyes of the followers of Mohammad.  His current rantings in court are just a continuation of his power base.\n\nTo give an example of a consise answer as to whether we had a right to invade or not can be tracked back to the end of the first Gulf War and the U.N. Sanctions placed against Iraq.  Quite simply Iraq was not allowed to trade for any arms or other tools of war.  When we tried to get U.N. Support for going to war in 2003 both France and Russia said that they would veto any resolution that would allow us to invade Iraq.  Both of these countries sit on the Security Council and each have veto power, as does the U.S. the British and China.  After our invasion we found that Iraq had traded or received arms from France and Jordan, plus night vission from Russia all of which were against the U.N. sanctions that these countries all agreed upon after the 1991 war.  Therefore Iraq had failed to comply with the U.N. resolutions and we had the right to use up to Military Force to enforce these resolutions.\n\nIraq did not have the ties that we thought he did with Osama bin Laden, however today al-Qaida and Iraq seem to be joined at the hip as there is where all the insurgency is coming from, so one might even argue that there was something going on in that regard as fast as they were able to set up shop in Iraq. 10

deleted account? Has anyone else had their yahoo acct. deleted without warning? I logged into a yahoo chat room & after I'd signed out of yahoo, I wasn't able to sign back in. I even tried to sign into my yahoo mail & my user name & password wasn't accepted. I've had to create a new user name & e-mail account because of it. Does anyone know what happened? Thanks in advance. The Yahoo answer Nazis got you too. For some reason, Yahoo allows a select few to post whatever they want, insult people, etc probably because they are paying Yahoo money. Those of us that utilize Yahoo's free services are subject to deletion whenever one of their whining p*ssies gets their wittle bitty feelings hurt by something we say. Don't bother asking why because Yahoo's Answer team makes Bush look like a genius. 5

What is STD ?  A sexually transmitted disease (STD) is a disease caused by a pathogen (e.g., virus, bacterium, parasite, fungus) that is spread from person to person primarily through sexual contact. STDs can be painful, irritating, debilitating, and life threatening. More than twenty sexually transmitted diseases have been identified. \n\nIncidence and Prevalence \nSTDs occur most commonly in sexually active teenagers and young adults, especially those with multiple sex partners. An estimated 200 to 400 million people worldwide are infected—representing men and women of all economic classes. \n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, in the United States more than 13 million people are infected each year and more than 65 million have an incurable STD. Generally, STD incidence has declined in the United States over the past 15 years, although rates among certain populations, including men who have sex with men, have increased. \n\nCharacteristics \nMost STDs cause relatively harmless disease, producing few or no symptoms. However, some produce persistent asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic disease (e.g., chlamydia). Some people carry the disease for days or weeks, while others carry the disease for longer periods, even for life. During this time, an infected individual, or carrier, can spread disease. \n\nIn persistent infection, the pathogen evades detection by the immune system and remains fairly inactive, causing no overt disease. This inactivity is called latency. However, certain triggers (e.g., stress, immune suppression, injury) can reactivate latent pathogens. In some cases, reactivated disease is asymptomatic (e.g., chlamydia); in others, overt (e.g., genital herpes); and in still others, severe and even fatal (e.g., HIV/AIDS). \n\nComplications of STD infection include pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and inflammation of the cervix (cervicitis) in women, inflammation of the urethra (urethritis) and inflammation of the prostate (prostatitis) in men, and fertility and reproductive system problems in both sexes. \n\nPossible consequences to an infant infected while in the womb or during birth, include stillbirth, blindness, and permanent neurological damage. \n\nA person infected with an STD is more likely to become infected with HIV, and a person infected with HIV and another STD is more likely to transmit HIV. \n\nTreatment \n\nViral STDs, such as genital herpes (HSV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), cannot be cured, but symptoms can be managed with medication. Bacterial STDs, such as gonorrhea and chlamydia, can be cured with antibiotics. Fungal (e.g., vaginal yeast infection) and parasitic (e.g., trichomoniasis) diseases can be cured with antifungal and antihelminthic agents, respectively. Early diagnosis and treatment increase the chances for cure. \n\nPrevention \n\nThe only sure way to avoid becoming infected with an STD is monogamy with an uninfected partner. It is important for partners to discuss their sexual and STD history before having sex. Prevention is possible only if sexually active individuals understand STDs and how they are spread. \n\nThe risk for transmission is dramatically reduced with the use of condoms. The following behaviors and conditions can increase the risk for STDs: \n\nEngaging in sexual activity when either partner has unhealed lesions (e.g., genital herpes sores, genital warts) \nEnema or rectal douching before rectal intercourse \nRectal or vaginal irritation or infection \nSexual activity that may damage the mucosal lining of the vagina or rectum \nTampon use (Tampons can cause vaginal dryness and cellular abnormalities. Sanitary napkins, either disposable or washable cotton pads 3
how can i talk to my mom about using tampons?  just ask your mum anytime you feel like you are ready. she will probably be more nervous and embarrassed than you. You shouldn't be sacred cos she's been through it all and it's her job to help you. If you just can't do it write her a little letter or talk to an older cousin or friend. But just be brave and ask...you'll be really surpirsed at how she reacts...expect tears cos thats her baby girl a woman now!!! She'll be fine and she'll tell you all you need to know 3

Do illegals from Mexico really take American jobs?  Illegal aliens are certainly working in America.  More importantly, they are almost all working at wages far below minimum wage.  \n\nAre they taking jobs from Americans?  If there were no illegal immigrants, there would probably be jobs available at minimum wage, but some of the jobs would simply not exist.  In addition, many products and services would probably cost more, which reduces demand for the services.  \n\nSince economics is a dynamic system, it's hard to say just how many jobs would be available to legal residents if all of the illegal residents were shipped out.*  However, there would be a lot fewer legal residents that would be taking criminal advantage of other human beings, which is certainly a worthwile goal.\n\n*My great-grandparents had a restaurant that went out of business when all the illegals were transported back to Mexico. 10
why is the sky blue?  On a clear sunny day, the sky above us looks bright blue. In the evening, the sunset puts on a brilliant show of reds, pinks and oranges. Why is the sky blue? What makes the sunset red? \n\nTo answer these questions, we must learn about light, and the Earth's atmosphere. \n\nTHE ATMOSPHERE\nThe atmosphere is the mixture of gas molecules and other materials surrounding the earth. It is made mostly of the gases nitrogen (78%), and oxygen (21%). Argon gas and water (in the form of vapor, droplets and ice crystals) are the next most common things. There are also small amounts of other gases, plus many small solid particles, like dust, soot and ashes, pollen, and salt from the oceans. \n\nThe composition of the atmosphere varies, depending on your location, the weather, and many other things. There may be more water in the air after a rainstorm, or near the ocean. Volcanoes can put large amounts of dust particles high into the atmosphere. Pollution can add different gases or dust and soot. \n\nThe atmosphere is densest (thickest) at the bottom, near the Earth. It gradually thins out as you go higher and higher up. There is no sharp break between the atmosphere and space. \n\nLIGHT WAVES\nLight is a kind of energy that radiates, or travels, in waves. Many different kinds of energy travel in waves. For example, sound is a wave of vibrating air. Light is a wave of vibrating electric and magnetic fields. It is one small part of a larger range of vibrating electromagnetic fields. This range is called the electromagnetic spectrum. \n\nElectromagnetic waves travel through space at 299,792 km/sec (186,282 miles/sec). This is called the speed of light. \n\nThe energy of the radiation depends on its wavelength and frequency. Wavelength is the distance between the tops (crests) of the waves. Frequency is the number of waves that pass by each second. The longer the wavelength of the light, the lower the frequency, and the less energy it contains. \n\nCOLORS OF LIGHT\nVisible light is the part of the electromagnetic spectrum that our eyes can see. Light from the sun or a light bulb may look white, but it is actually a combination of many colors. We can see the different colors of the spectrum by splitting the light with a prism. The spectrum is also visible when you see a rainbow in the sky. \n\nThe colors blend continuously into one another. At one end of the spectrum are the reds and oranges. These gradually shade into yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. The colors have different wavelengths, frequencies, and energies. Violet has the shortest wavelength in the visible spectrum. That means it has the highest frequency and energy. Red has the longest wavelength, and lowest frequency and energy. \n\nLIGHT IN THE AIR\nLight travels through space in a straight line as long as nothing disturbs it. As light moves through the atmosphere, it continues to go straight until it bumps into a bit of dust or a gas molecule. Then what happens to the light depends on its wave length and the size of the thing it hits. \n\nDust particles and water droplets are much larger than the wavelength of visible light. When light hits these large particles, it gets reflected, or bounced off, in different directions. The different colors of light are all reflected by the particle in the same way. The reflected light appears white because it still contains all of the same colors. \n\nGas molecules are smaller than the wavelength of visible light. If light bumps into them, it acts differently. When light hits a gas molecule, some of it may get absorbed. After awhile, the molecule radiates (releases, or gives off) the light in a different direction. The color that is radiated is the same color that was absorbed. The different colors of light are affected differently. All of the colors can be absorbed. But the higher frequencies (blues) are absorbed more often than the lower frequencies (reds). This process is called Rayleigh scattering. (It is named after Lord John R 2
Can a Army officer  hand the flag over to the mother at a Marines funeral?  It dosen't really matter but according to protocol it should be the branch of service. If none are available the branch that is nearist to the deceased gets the job.I have presented the flag to many widows and I was enlisted.

how do you know if a woman is interested in you? i am very confused... she will hug on me and be all over me at the movies.. but when we went back to my new house.. she acted like she wasnt even interested... She's just toying with your emotions. She is either playing hard to get... or isn't interested in you. If she just messes around with you in the movies, etc., than that's all you'll ever be to her.

How much will it take us to go on jupiter?  Technology now exists that can send probes (very expensive probes) anywhere in the solar system, including Jupiter.  However, it is doubtful that man will ever go there because the planet is a giant gas planet without land to land on, air to breath or temperatures high enough to sustain life.  Also the planet has a powerful gravitational pull and anyone who goes there will stay there.  Mars is a much more hospitable goal for space travel by men (and women too).  Bring your own air! 2

Are Divisions really fair? If one team has a better record than another shouldn't they get a better spot in the playoffs? I don't think that it's fair that the division leader automatically gets a top seed in the playoffs.  It can, and usually does leave out a team that would have normally made it to the playoffs if it were by record.  Plus, like what was mentioned on an ESPN article that I read about a month or so ago, it works out where the top two teams by record in the conference will never play each other anymore in the conference finals because of the way the divisions are set up now.  So I don't think they are a good idea. 6
How well is the message transmitted?  Probably not as intended, in an audible manner, but it's ok 2
do aliens exist?  All life on Earth is based on the building block element carbon with water as the solvent in which bio-chemical reactions take place. Given their relative abundance and usefulness in sustaining life it has long been assumed that life forms elsewhere in the universe will also utilize these basic components. However, other elements and solvents might be capable of providing a basis for life. Silicon is usually considered the most likely alternative to carbon, though this remains improbable. Life forms based in ammonia rather than water are also considered, though less frequently. Nor can the possibility be rejected that a completely new substance may be found that may react in a similar way to carbon or that wholly unique, non-chemical life-forms may possibly flourish through exotic physics.\n\nAlong with a building block element and a solvent, life also requires an energy source. Energy from a parent star is the most obvious source for extraterrestrial life but this is not the only possibility, as the example of terrestrial extremophiles shows. Geothermal energy from a planet's interior, for instance, may drive sub-surface or oceanic life, while tidal flexing (e.g., for bodies orbiting a gas giant) provides another possible motor to sustain living things.\n\nThe scientific study of the possible biochemical basis for extraterrestrial life is often called xenobiology.\n\nYes Aliens do exist.But more complex life forms than humans are not found yet. 10
What is the Society Known as the Burger Builders, and Who are the Recipients?  Im assuming your talking about the organization commonly known as the "Builderbergers."  Little is know of them because members (if you want to call them that) are sworn to secrecy.  Actually, they dont even have a name that we know of.  This name is one the people who werent part of the organization gave it.  Most assume this secrecy society is up to no good.  Im inclined to agree with those people.  Sorry I couldnt give you much information.  But being a secret society, there is little information available on them. 10
What's the difference between muffins, biscuts, and cookies in England and America? and what other names do the British have for those types of things? All I know is that when some British clients visited me in Canada, and I brought them down for breakfast, and asked them if they would like a muffin, they turned red and looked uncomfortable...with further prodding, I determined in Britain, getting a muffin, means getting a woman to perform certain oral acts of pleasure on you.\n\nThey call our muffins "cakes" in Britain. They also call our "cakes", "cakes" in Britain. confusing. 1
Are the Illumati related to the Freemasons? If so, how? In recent times?  "Robert Alan Goldberg, in his book Enemies Within, summarizes the basic themes of the books by Barruel and Robison:\n"Writing in the aftermath of the French Revolution, these monarchists had created a counterhistory in defense of the aristocracy. Winning the hearts and minds of present and future readers would assuage some of the pain of recent defeat and mobilize defenses. The Revolution, they argued, was not rooted in poverty and despotism. Rather than a rising of the masses, it was the work of Adam Weishaupt’s Illuminati, a secret society that plotted to destroy all civil and religious authority and abolish marriage, the family, and private property. It was the Illuminati who schemed to turn contented peasants 'from Religion to Atheism, from decency to dissoluteness, from loyalty to rebellion.' "\nThe major immediate political effect of allegations of an Illuminati Freemason conspiracy in Europe was to mobilize support for national oligarchies traditionally supported by the Catholic Church hierarchy. Across Europe authoritarian governing elites were coming under attack by reformist and revolutionary movements demanding increased political rights under secular laws. The ideas of the Enlightenment were incorporated by the leaders of both the French and American revolutions, and in a sense, these Enlightenment notions were indeed subversive to the established social order, although they were hardly a secret conspiracy. The special status of the Catholic Church in European nation-states was actually threatened by the ideas being discussed by the Illuminati and the rationalist wing of the Freemasons.\nSeveral common conspiracist themes emerge from these two books. The Enlightenment themes of equality and liberty are designed to destroy respect for property and the natural social hierarchy. Orthodox Christianity is to be destroyed and replaced with universalism, deism...or worse. Persons with a cosmopolitan outlook--encouraging free-thinking and international cooperation--are to be suspect as disloyal subversive traitors out to undermine national sovereignty and promote anarchy.\n\nShortly after the Barruel book was published, conspiracy theories about the Illuminati Freemasons were mixed with antisemitism in Europe. This confluence took place much later in the US." 1

Who is Carmen Sandiego or whatever? I always thought she was a fictional character... or is she? Yes, Carmen Sandiego is a fictional character. She appeared in many games (computer and console, but computer are the best). She also has starred some movies, though I don't follow the movies.\n\nCarmen is a legendary (in her world) thief. No one can arrest her, not even the main character (we, the player). She can steal everything she wants (from a tiny emerald to a huge taj mahal). And she also can disguise herself as anyone (luckily, not anything).\n\nThere are already many games of her, like "Where in the Time Carmen Sandiego?", "Where in the World Carmen Sandiego?", "Where in the Space Carmen Sandiego?", etc, etc. 4
Why is it when you try to sign up on a web site you have to go through all the free offers and junk.?  Because it's the big business corporate way of forcing you to be subjected to looking at their ads and other offers, before they throw you the *carrot* (free website space, e-mail account, file storage, etc.)\n\nThere are few things in life that are truly free, without some kind of obligation. 5

What the difference between a nautical mile and a regular mile? Who uses what and why? The nautical mile is 1.852 km and the regular mile is 1.6093 km, a difference of about 15%. \n\nThe nautical mile is the length of one minute of arc of a great circle. A great circle is the intersection of the surface of a sphere with a (geometric) plane passing through the center of said sphere. The Equator is one great circle, so essentially a nautical mile is the the length of one minute of arc on the Equator. Presumably they felt the need to define it this way because of the impossibility of measuring 5,280 feet on the trackless sea surface. It's just happy coincidence that this distance is approximately the same as a "regular" mile (hey, 15% isn't too far off when you're talking about the ocean). 7
What are some good e-commerce hosting companies? What are some e-commerce hosting companies with turn-key shopping cart systems that I can just input a database of my products and be off and running?

They are pretty basic, but will do all you are currently looking for.\n\nMy webhost is:  Westhost, and they offer it on their plans.  I think there is a one time setup fee though. 7
has you every woken up in the morning and it felt like you had a huge piece of sand lodged in your eye? I have that this morning and my eye is also in pain like i scratched it in my sleep or something. It does not look like anything is in my eye.\n\nIt is also watering and sensitive to light. I am typing this with one eye shut right now because if I do not, and look directly at the computer...my eye starts to water. Anybody have this before? Yes.  This could be 1 of 2 things.  First it could be pink eye [you need to go to a doctor to determine this], OR, it could be very dry eyes.  I made 6 trips to the doctor 2 years ago for pink eye.  1 trip to the eye doctor (not the glasses guy) indicated that my tears begin to dissipate immediately where the average person dissipates in 10 to 15 seconds.  Essentially my tears aren't wet enough -- which caused issues very similar to pink eye. 3

SEALS or Delta Force? In my previous posting, I mistakenly typed-in Green Berets when I really meant Delta Force. Great responses anyway! Navy Seals as well as Deltas all have the capability to insert by sea air or land.  However Delta's in by invitation only.  Meaning not just anyone can become a Delta.  Seals are open to all active duty Navy men.  \n\nThe process of becoming a Seal for what its worth seems easier, (Time and paperwork wise, not physically)  however Seals get all the perks.  \n\nWhen it comes to Seals you get everything from un-FDA regulated performace enhancers, to pills that make you not have to sleep.  Aside from that you get extensive weapon training and the possiblity to earn more confirmed kills.  \n\nDeltas usually return to normal duties after war, however Seals return to thier commands (NAVY SPEC WAR BUDGET WAS 2 Billion Last year)  They get great duty station choices, and the respect that comes with being a Seal.  \n\nWhen Seals walk around in uniform, they are celebrities within the Navy.  The Gold Trident can be seen from 100 meters away.  The girls are all over them.  I dont know about Deltas, however I would rather be a SEAL. 10

Quicktime is busted.? The audio that my quicktime plays from a .mov sounds jagged and choppy. What's wrong with it? I can't tell you what's wrong with it, but we always had a similar problem with playing DVDs on our computer. So we used a different player (InterVideo Win DVD) and that works. My best suggestion would be to try out the same .mov in Windows Media or Real Player.\n\nBTW, are you playing off of a disc, or your computer? That might affect the playback.\n\n\nOK, well... If it's on your computer, then I can only recommend trying another player. 5

What are your thoughts about Prescription Hormone replacement therapy after a full hysterectomy? Hi.\n\nI'm 29 years old, and last April i underwent a full hysterectomy. Since then, I have been on Premarin and Estratest. I have also gained roughly 30 pounds as well, and these hormone replacements seem to be the culprit. I have been (of my own choice) off them for 2 weeks now, and suffer only mild to moderate symptoms (hot flashes, night sweats etc), however, I am a little nervous that perhaps I am weening off to early? Any ideas? I would say consult the advice of your gynecologist before going off of your hormone replacement. But sometimes the cons outweigh the pros of taking the hormone therapy so its really up to you to do the research on whether or not you want to go off of it. I really think 29 is young for a hysterectomy though, was it done for cancer risks?If so I would definitely go off of it. 3
Where to find host POP3? How to know server name in the settings for Outlook Express This is information that your Internet Service Provider should have (or have given you).  They should have that information available to you on their support site, or by calling a tech support number.  I would check their website first.  I wish I could help more, but every ISP has a unique mailserver name, and you have to either obtain it from them, or another subscriber.\n\nI'm assuming you are trying to enter the POP3 server name.  If you're trying to locate it in Outlook Express, go to the Tools menu and select Accounts..., then click the Mail tab.  Select the email account you want, and click Properties.  Click the Servers tab, and the server name will be there. 5

Appendectomy gone bad?  My friends young son needed emergency surgery.? After several days the staples were taken out.   Shortly after, the wound opened up almost in its entirety.  You can stick a nickel in the opening of the wound.  He seems to be in good spirits, and the doctor says it has to heal like that.  But there is a lot of whitish discharge.  Is this all normal for a pediatric appendectomy?  The way it looks now, it will take several weeks to heal, or longer.  Should it not be completely closed?  Doctors, Nurses?  Anyone?\n\nNote he has an appointment for a second opinion, but I am looking for some ammunition for her to take to the doctor.  That is, if anyone is familiar with this. Because the wound "opened up" a few days after the staples were removed does not necessarily mean the appendectomy has gone bad. The strength of the closure is NOT in the staples. The staples or sometimes skin sutures are used only to reapproximate the skin. And yes, if the skin "opens" the wound must heal this way. This is called healing by secondary intention, which is absolutely fine. As for the whitish discharge, I won't comment not having examined the area. If the child has high fevers, purulent drainage (ie. greenish stinky pus), nausea or vomiting, she's probably already been advised to bring the child to the emergency department immediately (shes' probably received similar instructions from the discharge sheet, and should follow these). If it concerns your friend, she should bring this up with her surgeon. \n\nIn some wounds whitish discharge is from the body laying down material to "rebuild" itself, and usually isn't anything to worry about. I have to say again I haven't seen the wound, she should talk to the childs surgeon, or at the very least call the surgeons office and report this if they have not already seen it. It is best to continue going to the surgeon who performed the operation. Continuity of care is ideal in situations like this, since the operating surgeon is more intimately aware of the case.\n\nYou are probably going to get alot of "interesting advice" on this forum. I would ignore 99% of it. Second opinions are fine, but your friend should be prepared to just continue present management, since the description you provided is of the child eating and playing normally. 3
What is the song title or singer of the following song?

Does anyone know how long it takes to get the form approved (I-129)? thanks, 2X97cobra Why don't you check the USCIS.gov website? \nThey have all the forms and how much time it takes. On the website there is a section called processing dates, there should be 3 or 4 processing centers in 4 different states, all the forms should be listed by dates of when the paperwork were received by the gov. check the link below, it should say what paperwork they are working on now and gives you an idea on how long it will take. You might still have to do some reading on the website.\n\nIn which state did he apply? 10

What is flirting? Not much into dating (really shy, actually).  What is flirting? Flirting to me is a form of communication from one party to another or multiple parties.  It's basically saying I'm interested in you for some reason (what ever that may be) and I would like to know more about you.  Some people take flirting too far at times...then it may turn into harrassment or worse...stalking....lol.  They say flirting is healthy for you which I totally agree.  It can help relieve stress or painful break-ups. 9
My friends say that Christian is all a lie, what should I do? I got very upset and told them that everthing is true, you can change me and you can't change what I beleive. Remember that there will always be people or messages that will challenge your beliefs.  If you believe God and in his only Son Jesus Christ in your heart, then nothing or no one can change that.  Don't let them doubt yourself, or even make you angry.  Try to show them how what you believe has affected you, but don't get in a fight.  Most of all, don't let anyone make you doubt your faith. 7

Why does Yahoo shut down Yahoo groups without warning or explanation to the group owners? It would seem to me that if there is a violation being practiced that Yahoo would give the group owner a warning/reason and allow the group owner a chance to straighten it out before closing a Yahoo group down on them.

the book of Black Beauty summary?  Black Beauty Did you ever wondered how a horse feels? well then Black Beauty is a story about a horse feelings. the story takes place in England and its about a horse who has a life with a lot of cruelty and hapiness. This book was publishedat 1977one year before the author Anne Sewell died. Black Beauty was a horse who the more years passed the more she was hurt and the more she felt against the humans. The reason of that was because they had hurt her and had sale her all over and over again. Some characters of this story are Duchness, Black Beautys mum. She is a very wise horse who loves a lot Black Beauty. Ginger is a very independent horse who has suffered a cruel and lonely life. Merrylegs is a good friend of Black Beauty. She is a horse that has a big love with humans. And Black Beauty a very wise horse as her mother and her life is full of hardness and hapiness . A very good event I would recommend to everyone is an event when Black Beauty sees her friend Ginger. They are both old but they see each other in a park so they start talking and Ginger dies. Yes this is very sad but its a very good event. I chose this evenmt because you can see in your mind what theyve both suffered in their life and how much they enjoyed. I liked a lot this book and I also enjoyed making this book report. I think that this book has a very special place in everyone and I recommend people to read this book.\n\n**LIL MISS VIXION** 4
why does internet connection gets crazy sometimes?  Well, this is a very technical question, and difficult to tell it in a small space, bt I will try to be simple and short.\nThe Net is a collection of computers bound togather by phone networks. Hence, just as we experience congestion on phone lines, when many people dial up simultaneously, similarly, when many people go for surfing simultaneously, it creates a load on net connection, and we feel that Net behaves as if its gone crazy. 5

What is UNFPA? This is a United Nations organisation. "The United Nations Fund for Population Activities was started in 1969 and renamed the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in 1987.\n\nThe United Nations Population Fund is the world's largest international source of funding for population and reproductive health programs. The Fund works with governments and non-governmental organizations in over 140 countries with the support of the international community, supporting programs that help women, men and young people:\n\n* plan their families and avoid unwanted pregnancies \n* undergo pregnancy and childbirth safely \n* avoid sexually transmitted infections \n* combat violence against women \n* promote the equality of women \nTogether, these elements promote the human right of "reproductive health", that is physical, mental, and social health in matters related to the reproduction and the reproductive system.\n\nIn addition to direct action, the Fund raises awareness of these needs worldwide, advocates close attention to population problems, and helps needy countries formulate policies and strategies in support of sustainable development. Since 2001, it has been led by Thoraya Ahmed Obaid. The Fund is also represented by UNFPA Goodwill Ambassadors.\n\nUNFPA's work is guided by the Programme of Action adopted by 179 governments at the Cairo International Conference on Population and Development in 1994. The conference agreed that meeting people's needs for education and health, including reproductive health, is a prerequisite of sustainable development.\n\nThe main goals of the Programme of Action are:\n\n* Universal access to reproductive health services by 2015 \n* Universal primary education and closing the gender gap in education by 2015 \n* Reducing maternal mortality by seventy-five percent by 2015 \n* Reducing infant mortality \n* Increasing life expectancy \nThese goals were refined in 1999. One of the most important additions concerned HIV:\n\nHIV infection rates in persons 15-24 years of age should be reduced by twenty-five percent in the most-affected countries by 2005 and by twenty-five percent globally by 2010. \nThe Fund promotes a holistic approach to reproductive health care that includes access to a range of safe and affordable contraceptive methods and to sensitive counselling; prenatal care, attended deliveries, emergency obstetric care and post-natal care; and prevention of sexually transmitted infections by promoting safer sexual behavior.\n\nIn 2000 UNFPA took part in the African Youth Alliance.\n\nAYA is collaboration between:\n\nPathfinder International: Youth Friendly Services (YFS) and Institutional Capacity Building(ICB); \nPATH: Behavior Change Communication (BCC) and Integration of Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Health (ASRH) into Livelihood Programs \nThe United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA): Policy and advocacy, and Coordination and Dissemination. \nIts goals are to improve overall adolescent health and control HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections." 10

Why do all the planets go around the Sun in the same direction? And why do all planets lie in a flat plane?  The planets were formed by the same cloud of swirling rocks and dust, so when they came together and formed the planets they were all going the same direction. And actually, since the sun was made from the same stuff, it actually rotates in the same direction, though it is hard to tell because there are no surface details to see from earth without assistance to see the movement of the sun. I think astronomers see the rotation of the sun by watching sun spots. \n\nAnd actually they do not all lie in a flat plane. There is actually a small difference between the orbital planes of each of the planets. 4
Do atheists pray, and what they believe in?  yes, we pray to Jesus to make his followers shut the hell up and leave the rest of us alone, and while he's at it, remind them what his teachings were really about. \n\n(just kidding. but only sort of.)\n\natheists have hopes and dreams and sometimes express them to the cosmos. but i don't think i have prayed since i was a little girl and still believed in that idea that "faith" would get me candies and heaven and revenge against all those jerks who didn't "believe." i do meditate on occasion, and i believe that prayer is another form of that. (concentration or clearing the mind, for instance.)\n\ni believe in life and the universe and the effort to create a better world. i believe that the impact of my existence is clear, and based on the acts i undertake in this life, and that it is my responsibility to do my part toward a better world. i don't do this because i believe in "god's reward" or heaven, but because it is the right thing to do. and that "right thing" is obvious to me (and all healthy humans). i find it puzzling that anyone would depend on marginally indecipherable ancient texts to decide these things for them. having personal ethics does not depend upon a religious tract, nor should it. \n\ni have a pleasant life, i have plenty of community without going to church, and i personally can't imagine living any other way. and no, i'm not going to, nor have i ever, become "christian" while in a "foxhole." my beliefs are strong, and they are mine. they have foundation in history and in my personal experience. and best of all, i don't need to just "have faith." i have fact. \n\nand BTW, i have read the Bible many times, went to parochial schools my entire childhood, and i find it to be astounding the lengths that "christians" will go to talk themselves around in circles over it. i especially find it amusing that people who espouse themselves to be "christian" use their armageddon idea as a sort of "revenge fantasy" against unbelievers. as if christ would approve. 1

how does long term heavy meth abuse effect women?  Several factors would determine how it would affect different women in different ways.  Some of the factors would be her age and does she make sure to take vitamins, eat fairly healty and make sure to drink plenty of fluids. Pre-existing health conditions may be affected and a woman's sex drive and short term memory can diminish with prolonged use.  The problem I see with most meth users is that they don't take care of themselves and they run around looking like emaciated, wrinkled, rot toothed addicts.  Trust me when I say that you don't have to look like that just because you are a "HEAD." 9

Can we run more than one computer from one system [Central Processing Unit] if so what hard/software required. Suppose you got 3 computer screen and 3 keyboard/mouse and 1 CPU, and you wanna run all those...in 1 CPU... Not really.  You would need to be able to plug in 3 keyboards, etc.  Thats just not possible.\n\nWith three monitors, you could hook in three video cards and have a very big desktop. 5
Why in America is there such a big fuss about  the CIA spying of American's? most free countries have an internal spy agency\n\nMI5= UK\nASIO = Aus The current controversy really boils down to how much evidence & authorization agencies like the CIA need in order to justify spying on someone.\n\nHistorically (in recent decades, anyway), it has never been 'official' policy to authorize spying without probably cause (evidence & good reason to believe someone is engaged in illegal activity), and approval from a judge - this is all part of the USA's system of checks & balances on our government.\n\nCurrent laws & policy statements circumvent these balances of power, and could allow the 'secret' agencies of our law enforcement system to spy on innocent citizen without justification.\n\nThe most disturbing developments have been recent claims from the White House which imply that the current administration considers itself above the law - saying that it does not need to seek approval from the legislative & judicial branches to carry out such activities (even though our Constitution, laws, and legal precendence say that it does). 10

"My Name Is Earl" or "The Office"?  I've only seen 1 episode of "The office" and quite a few of "My name is Earl" and the hands down winner is "The office" because they aren't trying to be funny.

What is iminent domain? just need a simple definition Eminent Domain (not iminent)is when the government can control the use of land directly by acquiring the property itself and exercising the prerogatives towards it. If the current ownr of the land is unwilling to sell, the government, unlike private individuals, can judically compel its transfer through an eminent domain or condemnation action. \n\nThe government must prove that there is a "public use" involved. In other words, the use of the land as to what best serves the public.\n\nThe government is required to pay just compensation for the land taken. This amount is set by a jury after an evidentary hearing. 10
Should I get over her or not? I have known this girl for 4 years and we dated for 2.5 years. I am crazy in love with her since the first moment I saw her in 8th grade. When we are togeather we are like the perfect couple but I live an hour away from her and when we are apart it gets really bad. Like we have broken up I dont know how many times because we cant do the distance or she wants someone else.  I am really crazy for this girl but then we broke for about 9 months and when we talked back and forth we fought and sometimes when I thought I got somewhere I didnt. Now she turns around and says that she doesn't want me in her life. She doesn't love me and she wishes the best of luck with my life. I don't want her to leave. I have poored my heart out to her and she told me that she loves me and cant stay mad at me but her descion still stands: to get out of her life.  So now what do I do. I have loved none before and I sure as hell do not want to love any after. What do I do now? You got to choices, and it's all up to you.\n\n1. Dont listen anything she says cause living 1 hour away from each other is not DISTANCE, believe you have no idea what a distance-relationship is. If you care for her as you say, FIGHT FOR HER, dont' let her go, if she really loves you, she'll stay with you.\n\n2. Move on... there's a milion other girls. Yeah, i know it's really hard and at this moment you probably believe that you can't live without her, than you will never be able to love anyone again and stuff like that... but believe me, in 6 months, you won't even remember her last name. 9

aqua regia? can aqua regia (h2so4 + hno3) dissolve noble metals (gold and silver) for real? First off Aqua regia is a mixture of HNO3 and HCl (not H2SO4). \n\nIf Silver reacts in the same way as gold, then the sivler would be first dissolved by the Nitric acid, and then immediately precipitated by the Hydrochloric acid. Silver chloride is not very soluble in water, but is a white powder.\n\nDepending on the particle size of the silver you may or may not be able to form a white powder from aqua regia. Silver is much more easily oxidized than gold (silver tarnishes), and therefor more easily to dissolve. 2
Why would a man keep telling you that you're special but not ask you out? I met some one last year and we can only keep in contact by email,because we live in different countries, but work for the same co. some times we are in contact up to six or seven time s a day, (personnal emails, not work related) I keep getting told how special I am and I believe this man to be sincere. He is in his late 40's and I'm early 40's.I know he's single as am I, but I keep getting all these mixed signals and I cant get a definite response when I try to delve a little deeper. i would hate to think at my age that I am being made fun of, but I just can't make him out. Any suggestions Why don't you ask him out yourself?  Women always think that men should always make the first move, don't wait till you get past fifty! 9

What do you think about Wells Fargo Bank giving out loans to illegal aliens? I'm kinda stuck in the middle with this one. i think wells fargo is going the right way, they will benefit more than any other bank since its the first bank that helps people in that way, it will also generate more money for the economy, now if they were to give drivers license to them the country will boost in car sales and no car factory will have to close or laid people off.. 10

What technology will replace chemical rockets for space propulsion? Current rockets are based on 40 year old technology.  What will be new? Right now there isn't much. The idea of nuclear power for spacecraft isn't too attractive, given the radiation, fallout, and potential mess after an accident. \n\nThe old chemical rockets have experienced an upgrade recently, thanks to the Russian technology of the closed cycle motor. The energy used to run the pumps used to be jettisoned outside the motor bell, but the Russians needed that extra bit of power for their N1 moon ship, and designed the NK33 closed cycle motor. Thankfully, some of the motors survived the cold war, and ended up in the hands of researchers who used them to construct the closed cycle motors that power the Atlas 5. The New Horizons spacecraft rode out on the Atlas 5, which was the fastest launch in history. The Apollo ships took three days to cover the distance between Earth and Moon; New Horizons did it in 9 hours. That's an improvement. 2

What was Babe Ruth's greatest weight as a player? He's listed in record books as weighing 215 pounds but I suspect he weighed more late in his career. From BaseballLibrary.com:\n\nEverything about the Babe was excessive: his bat - 44 ounces, his frame - top playing weight of 254 pounds, his appetites - food and drink consumed in abundance, salary $75,000 in 1932 - highest in the majors. 6

Unknown firewall?? I had Norton Anti-Virus but it expired, but it won't let me change settings.  I don't think the firewall is on since it's expired.  But before it expired I could sign into msn/yahoo messengers, check e-mail, sign into yahoo stuff, but now I can't.  I checked the windows firewall and that isn't on.  I don't know what else could be on.  I can check my hotmail e-mail with outlook express, but not with Internet Explorer. I get an error signing into msn messenger, but I can still use AOL messenger without any problems. Any help would be greatly appreciated!! Ask me further questions if you need to!! The reason you cant get into MSN messenger or nternet Explorer is that Norton was protecting them.  Now that norton expired, its preventing access when those 2 programs try to use it.\n\nThe norton Internet Security suite is good if you want blanket coverage and can live with a slower computer.  \n\nI reccomed Nod32 as an anti-virus and the just use the windows firewall.  Nod 32 is less than 10 megabytes and hasnt missed a virus in more than 5 years.  Between those two you have just about as much protection as internet security.  Some of the things you may miss with Norton INternet security are, Filtering of websites, running internet explorer semi-safely, a slow computer.\n\nI reccomend that you purchase Nod32 instead of Norton, you will have a faster computing experience, and your wallet wont take as big of a hit. 5
What's the best way to fight a cold?  LISTEN TO YOUR BODY.\n\nI have a HORRIBLE cold right now (why else would I be on this site?!) and I realized that this is the one time I feel like my body has control over me, not the other way around. And it's probably because I wasn't taking good enough care of it to keep it going like I was!\n\nThe two most important things you can do are (1) SLEEP, and (2) DRINK...a LOT. I mean like there will be no water tomorrow. If you're like me, you probably get a fourth of what you're supposed to each day. Which means now is the time to make up, because your body is punishing you. :-)\n\nAside from that, take vitamins (that, again, you should be taking every day). Boost up your immune system with things like Vitamin C (OJ!), Zinc, and Selenium. Go with the Nature's Way echinacea if you would like, but make sure to give your doctor's recommendation dibs.\n\nAlso, stay away from work, school, or other places where you might spread your ickyness. Not for too long, but remember there are other people out there (people with kids!) who will be very unhappy with you if you cramp their style by getting them sick.\n\nKeep the foods you eat pretty bland (is this the rationale behind chicken soup and crackers?) so that you don't put your digestive system through the ringer. The key is nice 'n easy.\n\nI am not sure of this, but I was always told to stay away from dairy products (milk, cheese, etc) as they contribute to the production of phlegm. I'm in the draining process now and don't need any more mucus, thank you.\n\nTake the time (when you're not sleeping) to catch up with movies, books, or online shopping (my personal favorite!) to keep yourself indoors. Try to keep your physical activity to a minimum, but depending on how severe your cold is, this might not be a problem. My body protests every time I try to climb a flight of stairs (and I live on the 3rd floor!) so taking it easy is not difficult for me.\n\nThis is just me, but I like to stay away from over-the-counter medication (unless I need it to sleep at night - NyQuil is my legal drug) because I think I can better gauge if I'm getting better without it.\n\nGood luck and feel better! 3

do any one like subaru impreza wrx? what is the prize of it? I love The WRX! I own a 2002,the first year of it's production. It has been a terrific car, totally reliable and at 120,000 miles, still is as tight and quick as the first day I bought it.  My only complaint is there is a fair amount of turbo lag (OK, it's pretty bad), but if you drive it like you stole it (keeping the rpms around 3500), it's always right on. I have heard that Subaru has addressed this problem in the later models.  And it's a HOOT in the snow!!! I paid about 24,000 for it in 2002-not sure what they sticker at now. 6
What is the offical Currency of Venezuela?  Bolivares. 4
is an oui a felony?  Usually only a felony if bodily harm is caused or if a repeat offender. \nOUI -The next most common acronym for drunk driving is OUI.  This stands for operating under the influence.  The word “operating” is actually more encompassing (and more accurate) than “driving” because almost all states make it illegal to “operate or be in actual physical control” of a motor vehicle.  This means that you can be sitting in your car, off the side of the road, with the engine running and the car in park, and asleep, yet still be charged with OUI (or DUI or DWI, for that matter, in most states).  The states that have OUI as their acronym are Maine, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island.\n\n Maine OUI Laws\nMaine has very tough OUI laws. The lowest level of OUI in Maine can send you to jail for up to 364 days, put you on probation for up to one year, make you pay a fine of up to $2000, and take your license for up to six years. A felony OUI involving serious injury or death can send you to jail for year and revoke your license for life. Obviously, few first offenders can expect to see maximum penalties. Even so, the penalty that is imposed in average case is serious.\n\nWhat is OUI?\n\nOUI/DWI/DUI is a crime involving drinking and driving. In Maine it is called OUI. OUI means either or both of two things: First, OUI is operating or attempting to operate a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicants. "Intoxicants" are any substance, including alcohol and both illegal and prescription drugs. A person is "under the influence" if their mental or physical faculties are impaired to the slightest degree, regardless of whether it affects the a actual operation of the vehicle. Second, OUI is operating or attempting to operate a motor vehicle while having a blood alcohol content (BAC) of .08% by weight or more, regardless of whether that level of alcohol affects the person. The Court's Penalties\n\nIf you have no prior OUI/DWI/DUI's in any state in the last ten years, you are considered a first offender. A first offense OUI with no aggravating circumstances carries a mandatory minimum penalty of 90 days license suspension and a $400 fine. The first sixty days of that suspension are without a work-only license. If you have aggravating circumstances such as a BAC above .14, a passenger under 21 years of age, excessive speeding or an accident, there is a mandatory two-day jail sentence. If you refuse to take a breath or blood test the mandatory minimum sentence is four days in jail and a $600 fine. All fines have substantial surcharges of about 17%. Some judges routinely exceed these minimum sentences.\n\nA second offense carries a minimum seven-day jail sentence (twelve days for a refusal), a $600 fine ($800 for refusal) and an 18-month license suspension without a work-only license.\n\nA third offense carries a minimum thirty-day jail sentence (forty days for a refusal), a $1,000 fine ($1,300 for refusal) and a four-year license suspension without a work-only license.\n\nA fourth offense, or an OUI involving an accident with a serious injury or death of anyone, is a felony even if the OUI did not cause the accident. It carries a possible 5-year sentence and a minimum jail term of six months (six months and twenty days for a refusal), a minimum fine of $2,000 ($2,400 for a refusal) and a six-year license suspension without a work-only license.\n\nA driver who causes the death of another person because the driver is OUI faces 20 years in prison, a $20,000 fine and a lifetime license suspension. 10
Is Jesus descended from David?? The Bible claims so. In Judaism, as one can see in the Bible, Lineage is traced through the father. Every single genealogy in the Bible, as well as in the Christian's New Testament, is traced through the father, and if a female is listed in the genealogy, it is because she is famous, but the lineage, nevertheless, goes through her husband.\n\nSo, to be descended from David means that one can trace one's lineage through one's own biological father back to King David. Unfortunately, those who wrote the Christian's New Testament believed and wrote that Jesus's father was NOT Joseph, the husband of Mary, but rather was Gd. This means that since Joseph did not father Jesus, then his lineage is irrelevant to Jesus. This can be seen in the only two places in the Christian's New Testament where the lineage of Jesus is listed, in Matthew and in Luke.\n\nMatthew wrote it this way::\n\n         Matthew 1:16  And Jacob begat Joseph the \n         husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, \n         who is called Christ. \n\nOne would expect the text to have read, 'And Jacob begat Joseph the father of Jesus,' but it says he was merely the husband of Mary.\n\nIn Luke it reads::\n\n          Luke 3:23  And Jesus himself began to be \n          about thirty years of age, being (as was \n          supposed) the son of Joseph, which was \n          the son of Heli, \n\nand the reason why it reads "as was supposed," it to show that Joseph was not really the father of Jesus.\n\nSome will say that Jesus was a descendant of David through Mary, Jesus's mother, but that is irrelevant. That is why BOTH Matthew and Luke all list the fathers, and, again, only mention women if they were famous, while the lineage went through the husbands of those women. That is why Matthew reads: 'the father of....the father of...the father of....,' and why Luke reads, 'the son of....the son of....the son of...." \n\nFurthermore, Mary is called the kinswoman of Elizabeth, the mother of John The Baptist, but Elizabeth was a Cohen, from the family of Aaron, the priest, a subset of the tribe of Levi, and therefore not even of the same tribe as David, which was, of course, the tribe of Judah.\n\n          Luke 1:5  There was in the days of Herod, \n          the king of Judaea, a certain priest \n          named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: \n          and his wife was of the daughters of \n          Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth. \n\n          Luke 1:36  And, behold, THY COUSIN \n          ELISABETH, she hath also conceived a son \n          in her old age: and this is the sixth \n          month with her, who was called barren. \n\nSome Christians might say that Joseph adopted Jesus into his line. But, Please note that the Bible itself states that someone cannot be adopted into the royal lineage of King David. In II Samuel 7:12-17, the prophet Nathan tells King David that the kings must come forth FROM HIS BODY, and that means that they cannot be adopted into the royal line. If someone could be adopted, then why would Gd say that it had to be from David, ANYONE could be adopted in, and that defeats the purpose of the prophecy that it had to be a descendant of David.\n\n          2 Samuel 7:12-17 And when thy days be \n          fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy \n          fathers, I will set up thy seed after \n          thee, which shall proceed OUT OF THY \n          BODY; and I will establish his kingdom.\n\nSo, no, according to the Christian's New Testament itself, Jesus was not a descendant of David, and, by the way, that is one of the many reasons why he was not the Messiah according to the lineages found in the Christian's New Testament. 1

How do I employ an effective promotion/street team for my music? My music has been getting plenty attention on another networking site - high on the charts consistently and page visits every day - but recent changes in certain features and the fact that I've become much busier are making it more difficult to get more traffic to the page, find new supporters and make consistent monthly sales. What are some other effective ways to increase visibily without taking time away from other parts of the career, and how are the best street teams organized? I have seen groups solicite in their web site. If you have a small but loyal fan base they can really help out. \nOffer them "exclusives", access at a performance or bounus tracks or something. If you don't have a manager ... maybe you need to get one to keep the business side going while you create. 8

How was God made? Our daughter says no one can answer this question. Personally, I don't think anyone can answer this question either.  To answer that question, one would have to define God.  To define God, one would have to define religion.  To define religion, one would have to define beliefs.\n\nEveryone has different beliefs so everyone has different theories on how God was made (if at all).\n\nTherefore, there is no definite answer to this question.\n\n(**  )<|\nDead Fish\nOllec, the Fish Slayer 1

I have good ideas for some inventions. How would I go about submitting these ideas to a company? That is, without fear of them stealing my idea. I would really like to know. Thank you to anyone who can help. You can protect your idea by filing a provisional claim with the USPTO. This is kind of like a "patent lite" and allows you to protect the product for up to a year.  The cost is US$200 and should be done straight away. Visit the PTO website for information on filing applications electronically. \n\nAfter that, prepare yourself for a tremendous uphill battle. If this is a design patent (i.e. a new form of an existing product), you will find it difficult to locate interested buyers. If this is a utility patent (a new product or process), you will need to find companies within the industry and see if they are interested. \n\nYou will want to get a hold of a standard NDA/NC (Non-Disclosure Agreement / Non-Compete). These are fairly boilerplate and should be easy to locate on the 'net. Requiring NDA's is STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE when shopping around an idea and manufacturers are generally comfortable signing them. If a manufacturer refuses to sign, WALK AWAY. There is something wrong. An NDA is no guarantee that a company won't steal your idea, but at least it provides evidence of due dilligence during any potential infringement lawsuit.\n\nSearch the various government department websites for grant applications. The government is always looking to foster the development of new ideas that can potentially benefit the nation. There are grants for both non-profit and for-profit company's available and some even include grants for "concept development and R&D". \n\nBarring that, you may want to consider some form of rapid prototyping. Depending on the invention idea, this could be a short production run of the product, some kind of stereo lithography or other RP, or a "proof of concept" 3-D model, engineering analysis, etc. Having a physical, working prototype that a potential buyer can see, touch and interact with is FAR more impressive than a napkin sketch. Be prepared to spend $1-10K on a prototype. Well worth the investment, because if a picture is worth 1,000 words, a prototype is worth 1,000,000.\n\nGood Luck! 7

How does the yellow first down marker line for football games on TV work? How are they able to show that yellow line on TV and keep it exactly on the spot of the first down? The main TV cameras are equiped with sensors so that keep track of the angles they are pointed and the amount they are zoomed in on the action. That information is set to a computer that computes where to add the yellow line to the picture. It is designed to only add the yellow line over the green grass on the field. If you watch a game where one of the teams has green on their uniform, you will sometimes see the yellow line show up over part of the uniform. See the article at the site listed below. 6
Anyone know what mystogogy means? (It's related to Catholic theology)?  Yes, it is related to Catholicism.\n\n"Fourth Period: Postbaptismal Catechesis or Mystogogy\n\nThis fourth period takes place after the Sacraments of Initiation and the Rite of Reception into Full Communion of the Catholic Church. This time is referred to as Mystogogy, derived from mystery....that is, the Mystery of all that God has given us through His Son, Jesus. It is a time where the newly-initiated continue to dwell on this great mystery and be nourished, especially through the deepening of sacramental life, with emphasis in the Gospel, the Eucharist, and Mission. The new members are called neophytes, which means "newly planted", so that the seed now planted within them will be deeply rooted. This period ends at the one-year anniversary of initiation." 1

Will there be a third kill bill?  there have been widespread rumors about Tarantino's desire to revisit the character of the Bride in a third installment. most of these stemmed from an interview published in Entertainment Weekly, in which Quentin expressed his desire to revisit the Bride in 15 years:    "The star will be Vernita Green's (Vivica A. Fox's) daughter, Nikki (Ambrosia Kelley). I've already got the whole mythology: Sofie Fatale (Julie Dreyfus) will get all of Bill's money. She'll raise Nikki, who'll take on The Bride," he says. "Nikki deserves her revenge every bit as much as The Bride deserved hers. I might even shoot a couple of scenes for it now so I can get the actresses while they're this age."    Tarantino's idea is an excellent one, and in tune with the ambitious nature of the Kill Bill project itself. however, it is important to note that Tarantino is well known for announcing interest in projects that could never see the light of day, so there is no certainty that this will come about. 8

How do I subtly encourage her with God's love? One of my best friends just lost her mom this week. She's not a Christian, and she knows I am. I want to help her out by encouraging her with God's love, without it seeming like im being pushy with my faith. I just want her to go to Heaven. I'm not exactly sure where her mom went, but I want to know for sure where she'll be going. Please, any suggestions are helpful, but be serious. I want her to know that both God and I are there for her fully. I know that you just really want your friend to go to heaven and sometimes it's like if you can make that decision for them you would. But the fact remains that it's a decision she has to make on her own. The best way to show God's love is through example. Exibit the characteristics of God to her and remember all the things love is and is not...patient, always protects, never fails... Keep praying for her too, prayer reaches places we can't begin to imagine. Be there for her and continue to be a friend despite what decision she decides to make. 1

Is it true that you have to replace your breast implants every 5years? If so, is it worth it?Also is it worth the health risks that go along with it.A friend of mine with small breast is thinking about the procedure.I tell her that she looks great the way she is, but shes not trying to hear that!So I want her to get the best info.on this process. I have a friend who has had her implants for almost 10 years and only until recently has her doctor mentioned getting them done again. I really think it depends on the person and their overall health. Also, it depends on the doctor. Make sure she does extensive research on the procedure itself AND the doctor she may choose. 3
Actually I just wanted to say...? that you seem to be an interesting person fuzzy_zoeller. I take it you are a golf fan.
