Pink Lemonade is one of my all time favorite drinks, so when I saw Pilsbury had this beautifully pink "Pink Lemonade" frosting, I had to get it. I paired it with their "Pink Lemonade" cake mix.<br /><br />I think I died and went to pink lemonade heaven! Actual lemon flavoring gives this just a hint of tartness, while the sweetness drives you mad! The gorgeous pink color says "Easter" and "Spring"!<br /><br />Perfect for dessert for the family, or the ladies tea.<br /><br />I highly recommend this yummy frosting! [Try it with the cake mix too!] 5
The candy came on time.  There was nothing the company or organization did wrong in my opinion.  The candy just did not taste the way I thought it would.  I could taste barely taste the mango.  Also, I think what turned me off was the "chili". I didn't realize until I receive the candy that's what it was. My fault not theirs! 2
Sometimes you want some goldfish crackers, but you don't want to cheat on your diet. These are good for those moments. They are really really salty, but it fulfills that craving. Tastes like baked cheese--which is exactly what it is. 4
Maybe I'm daft, but I can't make a decent espresso with these pods in my machine. I've tried tamping them, which doesn't work well and I've tried just placing them in the filter. In both cases I get watery dribble but no espresso.<br /><br />As with other European products (think IKEA) there are no printed instructions in English, just line art drawings. Perhaps I'm just doing something wrong.<br /><br />I like the concept of pods, but I'll stick to beans instead. 2
I had recently tried a similar product from Trader Joe's and, not having a TJ's around me presently, I decided to try this more readily-available variation.  I didn't really like this thing too much.  For starters, there is too much packaging for my liking.  Too many things to throw away.  And I agree with a previous reviewer that they're kind of big cartons for how much they hold.  Inside the container are 4 packages - one for noodles, and three for various seasonings.  Then you have to add water.  They give you a fill line, but it's kind of awkward.  Then microwave for 3 minutes.  Then stir, then microwave again for one minute.  The one from Trader Joe's only has two packets - one for noodles, one for sauce - and no water involved.  Just microwave for 2 minutes and you're done.  And those are a lot tastier.  I didn't like the texture of this thing (everything clumped together too much) and it really didn't have much taste, especially considering the three different packets of seasoning I put in.  Time to try a couple of the other brands of these things... 2
Do not waste your money on this. I waited anxiously for the mail to deliver. Made a fresh 12 oz cup of coffee, dropped in two tablets. Nothing. I dropped in two more. Changed the flavor of the black coffee, but not for the better. I had wanted this so I didn't have to use cream for flavor with all the calories. Not even a hint of CHOCOLATE flavor. 1
These taste great and and being able to use subscribe and save to keep them in supply is an added bonus. I add them to a protein shake as a part of my morning routine. 4
Twelve six-ounce packages equals 72 ounces, or 4.5 lbs. At $99, that's about $22 per pound.<br /><br />I love pork roll as much as the next guy, but I wouldn't pay $22 a pound for a Wagyu standing rib roast, let alone pork scraps and spices.<br /><br />For comparison, I can get a 6-lb roll at my local butcher shop for 17.99. Maybe I should start selling it online, lol. 1
It does not taste like chipotle.  I do like spicy foods, but the hot spicy flavor was a bit one-dimentional, in other words, there was no depth to the taste.  I could replicate the same flavor by just adding a bunch of crushed chili peppers into a plain can of tuna. 2
I have tried a few different Clear shampoos and conditioners and so far, I have not liked any of them particularly well. This one is no different.<br /><br />While the scent is nice - it smells like shea butter of course - it just doesn't perform well for me. I need to use a whole lot of it to get any kind of good detangling and softening/conditioning. After I shampoo, I add conditioner, comb it through with a wide tooth comb and then put my hair up in a clip with the conditioner still in my hair, while I wash my body. So, conditioner always sits in my hair for a good 5 minutes or so. With this conditioner, I felt like I had to use so many heaping piles of it to get just a tad bit of detangling action. Once I rinse it out, it almost feels like I never even used conditioner. Most of the time I use my other conditioner (Infusium23 or Redken Extreme) after rinsing this Clear one out. If not, I use a leave in because my hair just doesn't feel moisturized or soft enough after using the Clear. My hair is not particularly rough or damaged, so I shouldn't really need to use so much. I definitely don't need to use as much when using my regular brands.<br /><br />It does smell good and rinse well, but there are no benefits to using it. It also does not seem to coat or weigh my hair down, but again no other benefits. I need a conditioner to help me detangle and soften my hair - things a conditioner typically does - this one just doesn't do any of that for me. 2
OK, I do love popcorn, but I'm definitely not in the gourmet category.  I'd been using a store brand white popcorn, but decided to try the "gourmet" variety to see what I had been missing.  I still pop the old fashioned stove top way, so consider that when you read the rest of this review.  I like the look of the various colors, the popcorn tastes quite good, is it better than my store version, I don't really think so.  What surprised me was that when popped, it makes about 1/2 as much as the store bought, so I have to use at least twice as much to get the same amount of popped popcorn.  So, all in all, I'm going back to the store brand and I'll save some money 3
This is a great product. Great flavors and very fresh. I received it quickly and damage free. It is my opinion that this is a great value and I highly recommend it. 5
I ordered these for work and they came all in a box, no problem.<br />There was a problem with some of them being broken and leaking all over. I wrote an email to the seller letting them know that but to this date, still havent heard a word from, them.. Good customer service. 1
Just started using this and the smell is a little odd at first but its not too bad. I got some on my lips by accident and my lips started feeling numb. Not sure what that was about. I like that its not a mask that you have to scrub off. This one just rinses right off. After I rinsed it off I instantly saw my skin look a little more brighter and glowy after the first use. 4
I like black pepper. When I cook, I grind my own and use as much as is called for by the recipe. On those recipes that I consider "keepers" and decide to tweak, one of the most freqent changes I make is to add more pepper. I tell you all this so you will understand that I'm not a Casper Milquetoast who can't tolerate anything spicier than corn flakes. I am fond of spicy foods, and when I order them in restaurants I do NOT tell the waiter, "Mild, please".<br /><br />The idea of putting pepper on nuts is, I think, a good one and could work well. But there is just too much pepper in these. And not a little too much, a LOT too much.<br /><br />The nuts themselves seem fine. Nice and fresh with good texture. I think the amount of salt is good, but that's difficult to determine with taste buds overwhelmed by pepper.<br /><br />If Emerald would use a quarter to a half as much pepper, I think this could be a winner. 2
I have two young dogs, a dachshund (1yr) and  a chihuahua (6mths).  I use these to crate train them.  This treat seems to cause them to be overly excited and even after eating, they would go to extremes to try to get more.  Good motivator.  But I am not sure if it's the natural sugar from the banana. I have many different treats for them before but this treat seems to make them super "high" and they had to race many laps in the yard to get off that energy.  Maybe someone who has the same experience can comment on this observation.  Overall, I am satisfied with the price of the item.  I wish the pieces were a little smaller since they are about a quarter size (too big for my small dogs). Recommended not more than 2 pcs a day for small dog under 20lbs. 4
I have bought the old Spearmint Altoids and they had a wonderful flavor. The new Spearmint Altoids are terrible. You cannot tell the difference between the new spearmint, peppermint and wintergreen mints.<br /><br />Altoids needs to investigate why the New Spearmint does not come close to tasting like Spearmint. I would have been better off just buying Spearmint Tic Tacks. 1
I use the Crystal Light Lemonade mix  with Sugar free Tang (one tub ea) with a gallon of water and 4 Tbsp Sweet N Low to make an excellent sugar free orange drink. No other mix gives this excellent results. 5
I am soooo disappointed when I tried at first.<br />It has no aroma and taste at all.<br />I really don't know why many people recommend this...  I'll try to contact the customer service and ask if I can return rest of the bags. 1
I have purchased this item before.  Once they were all dented and once they were not.  I would bet that if they run out of their dented product they are clearing out then they ship the undented ones. 3
I use Nespresso Roma, and my wife uses Nespresso Ristretto.  We bought Cremosa and Espressivo as possible substitutes, because lower per-capsule price, free shipping with my Amazon Prime, and I don't have to use the Outpresso to recycle.  But we don't like the coffee. Others may prefer it, I'm sure but its not for us. Too weak and we don't like the flavor.  I'm cheap and maybe not as picky  so I will use them up over time, but after trying both Cremosa and Espressivo, my wife will have none of it.  One of life's little pleasures especially for her is good coffee, and these are no substitute. 3
I wish some of these companies would say whether the rice is white or brown rice. I try very hard to just eat the whole grain version of any grain as they are more nutrient dense(plus lower glycemic). I've not tried this yet, but if it was listed as brown rice flour, I would have put it in my cart. 4
Really tasty, similar to a Mounds Bar or Almond Joy but without the nuts or chocolate, so I think it is really tasty.  There are 230+ calories for one bar and not a lot of protein (1.3 grams)so keep that in mind when you decide to eat one. Good Luck... 4
I remember the Space Craze of the late 60s early 70s, and Mom buying Space Food Sticks. Originally they were long round tuby looking things. The box rarely made it home before being completely consumed. I like the Astronaut ice creams too. My only wish is that it had the Astronaut pizza. They used to sell the pizza at the Air Force Museum in Ohio where I worked. Anyway, the box of goodies is a bit small but enjoyable. 4
Never liked regular breakfast bars when I tried them because the filling was so sweet. These bars follow in the footsteps of regular ones. The surrounding pastry was tasty though. 1
It's hard to find crackers and other traditionally wheat products that are gluten free.  These crackers are a poor substitute.  They don't have a good taste- just starchy and, well, blah.  No amount of cheese or cracker topping can fix it.  I recommend Crunchmasters Multigrain GF crackers. They are the best that I have found. 1
While Nana's makes generally excellent cookies, this particular formula is quite strange.  The orange zest flavor is incredibly strong and it has oddly crunchy rice-like bits in it that aren't great.  I'm sure that there are probably fans of this recipe out there, but I wouldn't order it again. 3
i ordered mint chocolate and got supreme. i am very unhappy, becouse you cant return it.. 1
Certainly a great British tea product. Traditionally, such products come to the customers with at least one to two years for shelf life freshness. This end-of-the-2009-year purchase (six big boxes!) provided me with the product expiring in June 2010. Somewhat short of my expectations; all the more so, expiration dates are clearly written on the boxes and, I am sure, processing staff could easily note this. 3
The first bite was horribly rancid, and I rushed to the garbage can to spit it out.  Then I rushed to the bathroom to brush my teeth and get rid of the last foul particles.  Even though this was not a normally refundable item through Amazon, they did give me a full refund, but they were not interested in my offer to ship it back to them at their expense to find out what went so horribly wrong.  The food safety system in this country is horribly broken.  After the peanut scancal of last year, it would be nice if something had changed and people were more responsible for what they put out there.<br />  In my opinion, the problem was improper storage temp. at the ware house, or ingredients too old.<br />Really a shame because it is such a good cause otherwise, and I love nuts. 1
I have three dogs. Two of them loved it, one so much that she tried to swallow the whole bottle, or run away with it and rip into it as she might a bone. They were definitely confused by it, they weren't sure what to do with it, but once they caught the smell of bacon they couldn't get enough. The third wasn't so keen on it, but I feel like that was more because he was abused before we took him in and he doesn't like something being held in front of his face like you have to do with this treat. I did eventually get him to try some, but after one lick he refused anymore, I will attribute this to his fear rather than any misgivings he might've had about taste as he eats everything.<br /><br />I think this would work better if you have just one dog. When you pass out treats or food, sometimes squabbles can happen, and that definitely happens here when you're focus is on just one dog and the others get jealous. Also, dogs generally do prefer to grab their treat then be able to go, take it somewhere and spend some time with it, maybe hide it for later, can't really do that with this.<br /><br />This is also drippy, so be careful or you could end up with a bit of a mess.<br /><br />I'm not sure how well this would work for training though. I would probably stick with regular treats for that, but if anyone can test that, please comment and let us know if it worked!<br /><br />Edit: I noticed that my dogs try to go after pill bottles now because the bottles kind of looks like the tube (have a similar shape) so if you get this, might want to watch out for that. 3
Certain fragrances put my sinuses in a spin the minute my nose invites them in. That's just what happened the moment I smelled this shampoo.  If you happen to be sensitive to odors, I doubt you'll want Clear Scalp.  I don't know what the chemical is that bothers me, but it's a synthetic throb of a smell that's become less common as fruiter scents entered the market.  It's hard to describe, but years ago, Clairol's after-coloring conditioner had it, as did Pantene.  (I sniffed the latter in the market today -- like Clairol, it no longer contains that odor.)<br /><br />To be fair to Clear Scalp, I'm an extreme overachiever when it comes to having a picky nose, but my encounter with this particular product ended with me popping a sinus pill and a couple aspirin after getting a dab of shampoo on my hand.  (I rinsed it off quickly but the odor clung to me for hours, faint but twinge-inducing if I got my hand near my face.)  Consequently, I didn't dare use it or the conditioner on my hair.  I'd have to give it one star.<br /><br />My husband, however gives it four stars, knocking one off because he doesn't love the fragrance. (He doesn't actively dislike it, but prefers coconutty scents.)  He loves what it does to his hair -- and I can see (and feel) why: his hair feels silky and thicker because the shampoo (and conditioner) give it more body.  It looks good.<br /><br />As for the odor, he there wasn't a trace of scent left tonight, nor are my sinuses bothered when I sniff his hair.<br /><br />The shampoo definitely does nice things to your hair, but I'd suggest a test-sniff before purchasing. 3
I purchased this tub as a way to try out some new Crystal Light flavors.  I was told I had to cut back on caffeine, and I don't need the calories associated with sugared soft drinks.  These work well, for the most part.<br /><br />My favorite flavor is the raspberry lemonade.  I like the hint of raspberry flavor, and find that I can drink quite a lot of it during the day without getting bored.  I mix up a 32-oz water bottle of the stuff, using 2 packets of mix.  This seems to work well, especially when i down 2-3 bottles of the stuff per day.<br /><br />I also like the lemonade flavor, and the cherry pomegranate.  The strawberry - not so much.  It's their "energy" formulation, so it contains some "extras" that I think add to a slightly bitter "sharp" flavor - and it contains caffeine, which sort of defeats the purpose of my drinking Crystal Light in the first place.<br /><br />I've managed to lose 23 pounds in a little over 3 months using this along with cooking everything from "scratch" - no processed foods, lots of fruits and veggies, fresh meats and fish.  I do understand the controversy about aspartame, but given the choice between carrying WAY too much weight and consuming something that may or may not kill me eventually, I'll choose the latter.  Plain water just doesn't do it for me, and this stuff IS tasty. 4
According to the manufacturer's website, this (and many of their other products) contains menadione sodium bisulfite complex.<br /><br />Menadione is a synthetic precursor for Vitamin K and has been reported to have toxic effects. The use of menadione over the natural alternatives (such as leafy greens and kelp) is only for cost-saving reasons, hence usually only found in cheaper and lower quality animal food. It's surprising that pet food at this high of a price actually contains this substance.<br /><br />Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity. It's also banned in Europe for human consumption.<br /><br />A study in rats showed that exposure to menadione "produced lesions in the kidney, heart, liver and lung." Chiou et al. Toxicology 1997.<br /><br />Menadione's toxicity seems to be due to its ability to induce oxidative stress in cells.<br /><br />Do an online search for menadione and you'll find more info from a pet food watchdog trying to stop the inclusion of this substance.<br /><br />In light of recent episodes of toxic pet food and the questionable behaviors of manufacturers and our regulatory agencies, I would advise you to avoid feeding this to your cats. 1
Great treats! I tear each one into 10 small pieces for training my 4.5lb 8 week Puggle. The only problem with these treats is that they dry up quickly. Within an hour or so the outside is dry, hard to rip with my fingers, and I imagine not easy for a little puppy. 4
Over the years I have eaten MANY "health" bars, fiber bars, protein bars, etc.  I usually eat a protein bar a day, and I am very used to the chalky texture and taste of protein bars and have learned to overcome them.  The Pure Natural Chocolate Almond bar is not a protein bar, but tastes almost as bad as that. Correction, it tastes, worse than a protein bar.  There is no real chocolate taste to it at all, and the protein chunks that are in it taste like these cheap almond pieces they used to shove into candy bars 30 years ago, way too small to offer any real taste.  Actually, they taste just like the nuts you get in brownies. I love almonds, but hated the taste of these. I forced myself to eat three of these bars so I could give them an accurate review, and that was extremely difficult.<br /><br />The selling point of Pure Bars are that they are made with natural, whole ingredients and are vegetarian and gluten-free.  As someone who is trying to avoid High Fructose Corn Syrup and added sugar, I like that, however it doesn't do me any good if I can't enjoy the product enough to consume it.  I know some reviews have claimed that these are "health bars" and that they have too much sugar, but they are not marketed as a "health bar."  Too many people confuse the ideas of "whole" and "natural" foods as "health" foods, which is entirely not the case. The idea is that these bars are for people who don't want additives and a lot of over-processing in their food, it's just unfortunately that they taste so bad.  If you're looking for a better-tasting alternative, I'd suggestion the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00199KYSO">-  Kashi Go Lean Crunchy Variety Bars (All Natural) - 24 ct. (meal Replacement Bars)</a> or maybe the Clif Builders Bars. 1
Perfect mid morning snack for someone like me who is currently doing a meal replacement drink for breakfast. One of these and piece of fruit is just what you need to get you to through to lunch. 5
i love chicken teriyaki and sesame chicken heatlhy choice meals, so i figured i would give this a try. BIG MISTAKE. the rice does cook the be nice and fluffy but the sauce and chicken taste horrible. for one there is not enough chicken in it and the sauce was far to overwhelming. had trouble swallowing it and threw the rest away. Yuck!! 1
We bought this because we have two cats and were trying to save some money.  Problem is, this is not the same as the 5.5 oz cans - this stuff is much more wet.  The cats didn't like it.  It is almost soupy.  We tried four of the cans and they were all the same.  We ended up taking it back to a Petco store and there was no problem with the return.  Otherwise we love the Wellness cat food OUR cats just don't like the consistency of the large cans. 4
PLEASE research, on the web! This product nearly killed my dog! All of Dogswell jerky treats are Poison!! Made in China! This Dist. does not seem to care he is killing our pets. Fda told me 70 dogs have died from these kind of dog treats. BEWARE! I have over 1,000.00 in vet bills. Amazon please don't sell this line to us, talk with the FDA,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AJ1ULS">Dogswell Happy Hips for Dogs, Chicken Breast,15-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3)</a> find another product made in the USA, before more of our furry friends get sick or die. 1
My 70lbs. lab/hound mix likes this toy OK. He hasn't figured out how it works to get the food out but he does like to carry it around in his mouth by the rope. Not as entertaining for him as I hoped but we're still giving him time to figure it out. We've tried to show him but he's never gotten the food out on his own and he's a pretty smart dog. -B 3
This like all Krusteaz products is simply outstanding, which can't be said for most "add water only" mixes. It is particularly well suited for a really large family or a vacation cottage not continually used. Kids actually prefer this to time consuming scratch 'cakes, although adding a few fresh berries, a little corn or oatmeal is popular, too. Only poor packing that resulted in minor spillage prevents a five star review. 4
My dog can be a picky eater and she really proved it with this dog food. She literally picked out the Grilled Sirloin bits and left the rest. Luckily my cats aren't picky and they ate the leftovers.<br /><br />This dog food also has some strange textures and smells, at least to my senses. Also as some other reviews mentioned, there is a lot of Soy products in this and that can give some dogs gas.<br /><br />Price wise, it is a little expensive for the size of the bag. For its price, I would want a dog food I know she will eat and that is not this one. 3
I've now tried several of the Switch drinks. They're not bad, for a carbonated juice drink, especially. This, actually, was one of the better flavors I've tried. It's got a nice orange juice type flavor that I enjoyed. Ultimately, these drinks remind me of Apple Beer, which is essentially carbonated apple juice. I love that drink, and think Switch could try an apple version of their product. I'm sure I'd love it as well...<br /><br />That being said, give it a try. It will quench your thirst, and I'm sure it'll do well in the marketplace. It fills a void where very few drink manufacturers have entered. 4
We got this coffee for my wife, who is nearing the end of her pregnancy and is slowly starting to resume coffee drinking. As someone who will be giving birth in a month, she was starting to experience minor heartburn.<br /><br />As far as the heartburn goes, this coffee made no difference in the positive or negative directions. So we're just rating it as coffee, not as a lower-acid alternative. As coffee, it was pretty average, with a mild, wimpy sort of taste. It wasn't unpalatable by any means, it was just sort of ho-hum.<br /><br />This might be worth a try if you have serious issues with reflux or acid in your diet. But it's a pretty bland cup of coffee, all told. 3
If you have been deprived of sandwiches for a long time because of a gluten sensitivity , this bread mix may seem like a treat. On the other hand, if you have found Whole Foods gluten-free loaves, such as the Prairie bread with pumpkin and sunflower seeds, then I think you'll be disappointed as I was. I tried the manual mixing method, and took special care to allow the bread to rise as I would a non-GF bread. The instructions say only to let it rise 1 hr. which I believe is inadequate. Perhaps the yeast in the supplied packet was not as active as it should have been -- in any event the resulting bread did not rise properly in several attempts. Flavor is not that great, but I did make some "everything" bagels which were fairly tasty if not very light. 3
I cook two packages together and exactly 7min as the package instruction but it comes out too soft and falling apart.  I bought some from Naples October,2011. after I boil for 7 min it comes out firm and nice.<br />This product comes out soft and falling apart. 3
Not a fan! We drink A LOT of canned coconut milk. This first off, has other ingredients then just the normal coconut, water and guar gum. It has mystery things... not a fan. Second, the stuff never mixes together at room temp. It has floating hard chunks in it. The fat never really melts in with it. It's drinkable, and works well in soups and stuff, but really, not worth it. 2
As far as buttered popcorn goes, it's what you'd expect. Nothing special taste wise, does NOT taste anything like cheese. It tastes just like normal buttered popcorn. It does however smell VERY funny when it is being cooked. I've noticed that this popcorn pops much faster than any other brand i've tried.<br /><br />All in all, horrible cheese popcorn, standard for buttered. 2
i cannot live without this citron falksalt, it is wonderful on watermelon, fish, almost any food requiring salt and in my world it all does.  just try it on red juicy watermelon, wonderful experience. 5
I order these olives a lot. They are un-like any other olives out there. The subtle flavors of the brine go great with cheeses. One of my favorite appetizer treats for guests. 5
The tea tastes fine.<br />I just don't know for how long...<br />The tea bags came (loose) in a cardboard box.<br />(Must be institutional packaging.)<br />We'll see how it lasts. 2
I have a son who is allergic to milk, eggs, peanuts, and tree nuts; however, he can eat wheat.  We have tried lots of allergy-friendly products and are sometimes disappointed with the wheat-free ones as the texture and taste is often very different from products made with traditional ingredients.  That is not the case with these cookies.  They are by far the best allergy-friendly cookies that we have tried yet!  They have a nice, crisp (but not hard) cookie texture.  I was also impressed with the shelf-life on the cookies that we tried.  Many allergy-friendly cookies have a very short shelf-life, but the Lucy's cookies that we tried today didn't expire until October.  Way to go Dr. Lucy on creating an excellent allergy-friendly product! 5
The pack of six bottles was delivered in a timely manner but when I opened up a bottle, the juice tasted sour.  I thought that it had spoiled in transit and considered returning the remaining bottles but then I noticed the very bottom line on the product label,"Enriched with Organic Lemon Juice".  It was too much trouble to return and, while I do not totally enjoy the tartness that the lemon juice adds, it is at least still pure and organic and healthy.<br /><br />I would not have ordered the product had I known that it was not JUST carrot juice but carrot juice with "organic lemon juice" added to it.  Perhaps this is why the price is so very right but I feel misled.<br /><br />It takes some getting used to if you are seeking the taste of carrot juice.  Before you order this item, I would suggest you buy a small bottle of carrot juice and squeeze some lemon juice into it to preview the effect of having lemon juice flavored carrot juice. 3
I've been pleased with all of the Davidson's offerings I've tried up until this point.  This one just wasn't that good for me.  And as a newly converted tea drinker, it's got to be good if it's going to keep me out of the soda aisle.<br /><br />The flavor was very very weak in this tea.  Which rather surprised me considering the ingredients in it.  I prepared it like all others, letting it steep for awhile in boiling hot water, but it didn't even give off the nice scent that most of Davidson's teas do at this point.  Sipping it I could taste the bitter aftertaste of the tea, but none of the other flavors were present and it just tasted like hot water.  I'd like to think that maybe it was just an old teabag, but it was freshly purchased and that didn't seem to be the case.<br /><br />The ingredients, like all Davidson's teas, were very good at least.  Organic Rooibos, peppermint, cinnamon, orange peel, lemon peel and natural flavors were the entire list.  And I am pleased that they attempted to use some organic products.  But as said before, with all the other flavors, it really surprised me that this tea was so weak.  I've had the rooibos tea in other mixtures and liked it, so I know it wasn't that I just didn't like this type of tea.<br /><br />Not my favorite for sure.  I will continue to enjoy my other Davidson's teas, but not this particular flavor.  The rest are being taken to work and tossed in the shared food pile in the hopes that someone else will like it more.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012 2
Nice serving size, good complement to breakfast.  Low in fat, high in protein, and taste great.  I keep the unused portion in the freezer and microwave them, or heat them in a pan if you want a crispier outside.  They are pre-cooked.  Love 'em! 5
These are a good mincemeat tart, but I don't feel the Glenfiddich adds that much to the taste. I would probably just go with the regular Walker's, which I rank one star higher, instead of these. 4
I was very excited when my Husband ordered my favorite flowers for Valentine's Day. When I received the flowers none had bloomed yet so I thought that I would have them for at least a week or more. I followed the care instructions exactly but they still wilted and died within only a few short days. They also didn't open at the same time so it never looked like the picture at any point in time. I think next time I will order from a local florist so that I can actually get to see a beautiful bouquet like in the picture. 1
the reason for the poor evaluation is not because of the item.  The lollipops are wonderful BUT, a 1 lb 5 oz box which costs $16.20 has a shipping cost of $15.25!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Almost the same as the cost of the item.<br /><br />If you go to the website (www.sees.com) in the shipping section you will see that there are a variety of shipping costs depending upon when you want the item.  I just paid $7.25 rather than $15.25 and I'll have to wait a week which is probably as long as I'd have to wait if I had ordered the box from Amazon since there is a disclaimer that says "Processing takes an additional 2 to 3 days for orders from this seller"<br /><br />Don't get cheated! 1
Bad tasting bold coffee. No comparison to Newmans Bold Or Emerils bold. Never would I buy this again. Should have known just from the name, Jet Fuel, that it would be bad. 2
Like others have said it tastes like yellow powerade with a bit of a twist. Very refreshing but I very much prefer the regular version with pulp. 3
Strong, a little bitter.  Enough sweetness to make it drinkable.  But there was nothing to savor here.  If you like strong black coffee you might really enjoy this.  I don't and I didn't. 2
If you're just interested in a cup of good coffee, this is fine.  If you really want the taste of pumpkin spice, I would not select this particular brand. I couldn't really taste the pumpkin spice, and that's why I am disappointed. I was torn between giving it a one star or a two star.  I give it a 2 star for decent coffee, but a 1 star for the lack of pumpkin spice flavor.  I based my purchase on other reviews, and am surprised that others really liked it.  I've had pumpkin spice coffee at other places, and this doesn't compare at all. Perhaps I got a bad batch.  Big disappointment!! 2
When I drink this, it tastes like flavored hot water. I think the powdered stuff you add water to that you get in the grocery store tastes way better. Won't be ordering this again. 3
Just an FYI that "Yeast Extract" is one of the titles that MSG hides behind. MSG IS a preservative and a dangerous one at that. The package lies... these contain preservatives. I will not be eating these! 1
Product looks nothing like the picture  It has only one small branch  Nowhere in product description does it say it needs a humidity tray and special fertilizer  When you get the plant then it says immediately contact us to get these needed products.I will not purchase from this vendor again 2
If you like pork rinds these are the best...... I buy these for the bar that I own and they are a favorite with the customers. So simple, pop them in the microwave for 2 minutes and you have fresh hot pork rinds. I have these on scheduled delivery so I will never run out, nice option. Great snack. 5
The chips were great...for the first few bags. However, after the first bag or two, I noticed that the remaining bags were damaged. There were holes in each bag and black, sticky stains on the outside. Other reviewers who bought around the same time that I did are now claiming that they found rodent holes in their bags of chips.<br /><br />The chips came in a sealed Kettle box, so it's hard to say who screwed up. But someone somewhere screwed up. These chips were a health hazard before the holes in the bag. Now? It's like a game of roulette. 1
Still debating whether Dream Fields Pasta is better than Al Dente Carba-Nada Egg Fettuccine, 10-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6). I have tried their different kinds and I find them to be an acceptable option and to me much better than regular pasta. I am happy that another low carb pasta is available for purchase for it is to my advantage to eat the low carb pasta. The last time I had regular pasta was a long time ago. Between the two pastas mentioned above I no longer feel I am missing much. 4 Stars! 4
Love the smell of the ghee, just reminded me of the authentic ghee we used to get back in India. The fact that the ghee is made of grass-fed cows is for me a huge relief. I am so glad I found this treasure. Hope they reduce the price a little so that I can buy more with out guilt. 4
My boyfriend tried these gummy bears at our favorite frozen yogurt place and said they were the best gummy bears ever. I sued them to tell me what kind they were and found them on amazon. Then bought a 5 lb. bag of them for him haha. He wanted to go get frozen yogurt every other day just for the gummy bears. Anyway, they are really flavorful gummy bears! 5
As I wrote in the title it is a good grab-and-go snack. It's perfect to in your purse to have a healther snack then thinking about eating fast food. It has a soft chewy texture with the chrunch of the nuts. But it's nothing that you must get unless you love love love bananna nut bread. But sadly I'm just not one of those lovers. I love the health and quick snack to it. I do recommend it but it's not a big deal to get it, well atleast to me. 3
Okay, so my daughter was having a friend over who has celiac disease so I thought I would try these cookies.  Oh my, what a horrible aftertaste.  I made these last night and still have this aftertaste this morning.  I will be throwing out the batch immediately. 1
This product is excellent. It's also a nut snack that my wife, who has celiac disease, and is allergic to wheat and glueton can enjoy. I however can eat anything and this is the tastiest and most unique nut snack I've ever tried.  Al & Virginia Weatherly  53996 Luzerne Dr. Macomb, Mi 48042 5
My husband is a pretzel lover and has become addicted to these. I don't see the draw, being firmly in the potato chip camp myself, but to each his own. Our local stores only stock these occasionally, so he has tried all the other flavors, and while he does like the jalapeno, they don't like him back. It's nice to be able to buy them here and not have to run all over town looking for them. 5
I guess the fault's all my own for thinking that they could get me chocolate through the mail without it all being melted, but that was the case. Two packs of truffles all melted. Watches out these are highly addictive!!!! 2
This popcorn is not good with an air popper, because the kernels are too light. 3
I was looking forward to having these stuffed grape leaves and serving them to guests (thank goodness I tasted them first), but was extremely disappointed. I opened the first can and found every one of the stuffed grape leaves were very tough (center vein was unchewable). Well, I thought, maybe it's just this can - so I opened the second can. Exact same complaint - the grape leaves are old and tough and I couldn't chew it. I had to spit it out. I will say the flavor was good on the whole but when you can't chew it that's a big "no no"! 2
I loved the vanilla sandwich cookies. I was not happy with these. I love chocolate so I tried these too. The chocolate filling was dry<br />and crumbly. I will not buy these again. I am sticking with the vanilla. 2
Of my three cats, only one likes this food. I suspect the problem is that there are actual chunks of carrot in the food, and most cats aren't fond of carrots blocking the smell of the chicken in their meal. While the ingredients list is admirable, the chunks of chicken are very appetizing-looking, and it does appear to be as advertised- All natural- it's also not very popular in my household.<br /><br />The Chicken Pot Pie flavor is especially disliked by my cats, as it's very watery. The label describes this as a sauce, but it's really more like a weak broth that apparently tastes more like carrots than chicken, because even my chicken-mooching cat will not consume it. The Sesame Chicken flavor is a little more interesting to him, but he still just picks out the bigger chunks of chicken when he's really desperate, and leaves the carrots behind.<br /><br />Honestly, I really can't believe any cat would eat those carrots!<br /><br />My suggestion is to try before you commit to this size of a package, because cats' tastes vary, and in my experience, 2 out of 3 cats will only eat it if they're very, very hungry. The third is the kind of cat that will eat anything, and so she'll dig in. If you have a cat that will eat anything, then you might have some luck with this food. If your cats are a bit more picky about their food, then you may want to hold back and see if you can dig up a single can before buying a 24-pack like this.<br /><br />I respect what the company is trying to do with their food, but I really question the person who decided they were going to put chunks of vegetables in a cat food. Cats are carnivores, and sticking a carrot in their bowl is kind of an insult to them.<br /><br />...And we all know that insulting a cat when it comes to food is one of the greatest sins against cat pride one can commit.<br /><br />Remove the carrots, thicken the "sauce" and you might have something here. 3
Bought these based on the glowing reviews (4 1/2 Stars), and the fact that they were heavily discounted from the regular price. First of all .8 oz. per bag equals about 15 or 16 chips per bag, which is not many. While this may be fine for those who are trying to cut back on calories, fat or sodium, the fact is that .8 of an ounce is not much, and that might tempt people to eat more than one bag at a time.  Due to the discounted price each bag was around $.55 each, not to bad until you figure that equals $10 per pound. At the regular price its about $16 per pound. As far as the taste, all of the flavors were good, none that I absolutely disliked, but none that really rocked my socks either. Bottom line, at the discounted price I paid I was not disappointed, but if I had paid the regular price for these I would have felt cheated. 3
very disappointed with this product. Although the taste is good it was difficult to serve these crackers with a topping of hummus to other celiac friends. The two foil pkgs in each box does not guarantee is whole cracker. From one foil pkg. in the first box I ordered I had 5 whole crackers...the rest of the foil pkg. was broken pieces. This does not speak well for Glutino products. I will never order them from Amazon again. 1
If your child is picky take note:  the apple and pear look the same but the strawberry & banana are in tiny pieces and are red colored.  For some reason, my 2 1/2 year old did not eat those.  I'm not giving up, don't get me wrong, I think he will eventually eat them, but I'm just letting everyone know.  I think these are a GREAT travel snack especially if you don't want to be cutting fruit.  They kind of melt in your  mouth which is cool.  I would not say these will fill you up, even for a busy boy toddler, so you may want to add a protein or fat with this as a snack.  That said, it will curb any minor munchies in a healthy way and on the go. 4
I own a bread machine and use honey for my whole wheat loaves.  This product works great for a few weeks, but then something happens to the honey.  It gets thicker.  (And this was in bottles that were sealed and unopened).  This resulted in my bread not mixing properly.  The dough would get clumpy and would not blend together properly.  I had to throw out half of the honey. 1
I love the vanilla and chocolate arctic zero. The grey color of the cookies and cream is a turn off. It's bearable but I will not be ordering it again. 3
I recently received a sample through Influenster and really enjoyed it.  The one that I received is 1.48 oz and 140 calories. It is absolutely delicious. It's super soft but also has crunchy bits like a health bar. The banana nut flavor is prominent. It suggests warming it up on the package and I'm sure that is delicious, but after the first little bite, I kept on eating till my bar was gone, so I didn't get a chance to try it warmed up. I'll keep my eye out for it in the stores to get me a couple boxes and let the whole family try it. 4
I have had 2 German Shorthairs with allergies, requiring daily medication durning Spring and Summer.  Not only do these things work like a charm, but Pill Pockets have actually become one of their preferred treats.  The pups have no idea they are getting medicine.  I have been completely happy with all Greenies products I've purchased, and they come recommended by my veterinarian as well.  No complaints. 5
I hope you are reading these reviews.  I did not.  This is instant coffee inside a K-cup container.  The description is deceptive. 1
I bought a box of this recently.  Even though it sounded pretty "healthy", I figured, how bad can it be.<br /><br />Well, I just had my first serving, and decided that I would share a recipe that very closely approximates the taste and texture of this cereal.  Here it is:<br /><br />4 cups course saw dust<br />1 cup raisins<br />2 Tablespoons sugar<br />1 Teaspoon ground cinnamon<br /><br />Blend all ingredients, serve with cold milk.<br /><br />How on earth can anyone give this stuff more than one star?  The serving size listed on the box is 1/2 cup. First of all, who eats 1/2 cup of cereal?  I doubled up on the serving, and poured a full cup in the bowl... added some 2% organic milk..... yummmm!  Wrong!  Now I know why the serving size is specified at 1/2 cup..... anybody that can gag down more than a half cup of this stuff in one sitting, is a better man than I am. Seriously.... what possible reason could anyone have for eating this stuff?  I tried my best to choke down this stuff, but the more I ate, the worse the experience became.  About a third of the way through, I cried uncle and dumped the remaining meal in the trash.<br /><br />There may be a use for this cereal, but eating it, is not a viable option.  I don't even think birds or small rodents would want to eat it.  I may mix it with some water, and fill some of the cracks in my driveway with it. 1
No seriously, this is ridiculous, $45 for a bag of corn for obligate carnivores? brewers rice, corn gluten meal? wheres the meat?<br />Not to mention unnamed animal fat which could be anything including roadkill and euthanized shelter animals. There are much better quality grain free foods that cost less then this. 1
Finally, a product that gives you that extra boost you need for anything from travel delays to the overdue stack of paperwork. You feel the effects instantly with more energy and a higher concentration level.  It stays with you and does not leave you feeling dopey or spent when it wears off. 5
The tree is very ugly... was not cut in away to look like a little tree.. the tree is huge which is nice but has a very very ugly top.. looks like some one potted a bush.. Cheap to buy but nothing like a bonsai. Looks like my 4 year old made this. Sad this was a present. :( 1
My baby does not like this kind. I do not like it either, it tastes fishy. Salmon is good for baby brain development. I tried to put butter or some seasoning to cover the fishy taste, but my son still does not want to eat it. He like other happy baby product like spinah, mango and pear, blue berries, banana and beet and broccoli, pear and peas. This one needs seasoning or I will not eat it either. 2
I like Lapsang Souchong tea and like to buy the loose tea so that I can make a pot rather than just a cup at a time. This brand is all right, but I wish it were more "smoky." In my opinion, this is too much like ordinary black tea. Though I do not usually sweeten black tea, this does well with a spoonful of honey. 3
This cream is more for normal to oily skin rather then dry/mature skin.  It goes on nicely and gets absorbed quickly.  It leaves a nice smooth feel on your skin like the more expensive creams do.  However this cream has an overpowering sweet jasmine smell.  The smell does not fade.  People will only smell your face cream.  This could be used as face cream/cheap perfume. I thought I can get used to the smell but it's too strong and rather unpleasent. 2
what a disapointing item!...I am too embarassed by this to give as a gift!sooooo small<br />from now on I will buy from winebaskets.com 1
I am hooked.  This is a great way to get more fluids into my day without making it seem like a chore.  This powder tastes great without any additional sweeteners.  It is just what I have been looking for.  Also try the Blueberry version.  Delicious! 5
The fragrance is strong and floral - lovely.  The tea is dark golden brown  and much more like a fermented Oolong than green tea.  I didn't like it at first, because it lacks the gentle subtlety of the blend of green and jasmine.  It's almost like an afternoon tea with jasmine added.  Over time, this tea has grown on me, and I like that it is a bit stronger than a typical jasmine green.  However, when I want that delicate flavored, I look for something else, even the Bigelow (and I'm not a great Bigelow fan). 3
As an experienced Lavazza and Illy coffee consumer I can tell you that this thing tastes like a used cigarette filter.<br />Dark roast, very bitter, quite coarse grind all together make an ugly espresso. very similar to Starbucks and friends(excuse me Seattle but Italian blends are MUCH better)<br />Skip if you can. go with Lavazza Qualita Orro (light),Cafe Espresso (stronger) or Tierra (refined) blends, you won't be disappointed 2
I've used a lot of WP coffee pods, and this is my least favorite. It made a weak cup of coffee, and was inconsistant from cup to cup. Some were weaker than others.<br />I would not buy it again. 3
Kids thought it was just "okay", but I did not like it at all.  Odd taste.  Love their white cake/cookie mix.  That's fabulous. 1
I notice from the labels that the net weight of this is actually lower than the net weight for their organic white tea. This implies somewhat less tea proper per bag, since the mint is also part of the weight. If drinking white tea for the health benefits, this may be important. It would be nice if it was easy to determine the exact amount of tea being bought. 4
These cups work for the most part except for the fact that all most all of them leak out the top of the cap. All seem to wick some leakage through the paper filter at the cap and cup joint and approximately 10-15% overflow and leak around the cup and down the sides providing some grounds with the coffee. 3
This jam has little fruit taste. If you love damson jam this is not the one for you. It could have been any flavor. All you taste is sweetness. 2
I store my mugs, creamer, splenda packets and napkins on top of this  and just love it. My coffee maker is next to it (it's like my little coffee station :-)) I didn't buy it here though because it's CHEAPER at Bed Bath & Beyond (24.99 + 5.99 shipping = 30.98) Here it's 47.95. I am gonna get a 2nd one to stack on top of my first and then put the same stuff i had on it back on top. I recommend this stackable drawer type unit.<br /><br />[....] 5
Gold Kili All Natural Instant Beverage mix (Ginger & Lemon) is an all right drink-in-a-powder.  I have drank similar types of drinks in the past (Chrysanthemum, herbal and tea) and I thought I give this one a try.  I wasn't turned off by the taste but it wasn't lip smacking good either.  Its an acquired taste and if you enjoy drinking instant beverages (just add water) then you'll want to try this one out.  Veterans of powdered drinks need not apply. 3
Previously I bought some mustard seed that was unbearably bitter, but the mustard I made with this seed is very tasty and (after mellowing a few days) not bitter at all. Pleasantly spicy. 5
I am very excited that I have found this oatmeal.  It tastes great and it is quick to make.  When looking to go gluten free, so many of the books I was reading were offering eggs as a morning breakfast item.  I don't like eggs so my life seemed pretty much doomed to Silk milk smoothies.  This is a great breakfast option for me now.  My only gripe is that my grocery store cannot seem to keep it on the shelf so when I see if, I buy a couple of boxes. 5
As others have mentioned, these arent k-cups.  Its a paper top with a filter bag full of coffee stuck to it, no plastic bottom.  So the coffee will go stale far faster than a real k-cup and they dont fit properly in my k-cup rack.<br /><br />You have to license the patented k-cup design and pay green mountain a couple of pennies per cup made in royalties, these guys seem to have tried to cut that corner.  But I wont buy them again, I buy k-cups because I want a fresh cup of coffee not something thats been exposed to circulating air until I use it. 1
Delicious sunflower nuts, I mix the Honey Roasted with the Unsalted<br /><br />I have tried most of the varieties of Good Sense Sunflower Nuts, and have enjoyed them all.  My two favorites--so far--are the Honey Roasted & Unsalted.  But I have found that a 50/50 mix of these two varieties is what I enjoy most.  The mixture is the just right compromise. 4
Too pricy for what you get. I was expecting something delicious but unfortunately it's just a plain tortilla taste with a different look. You could get the same thing with any other brand name without having to pay a lot for it. 1
I purchased the product for a Christmas gift and assumed that coming from Bellagio it would be perfect.  The person I gave it to tried one packet and gave the rest away.  She said it smelled great but tasted chalky and wouldn't drink any more of it. 2
Our pediatrician recommended switching formula to Nutramigen because switching to Soy did not seem to help my son's atopic eczema. Compared to standard Enfamil Lipil or Similac Soy it seems to cause more spit ups even though the claim is that Nutramigen is supposed to help with spit ups. Currently the only thing that is working for my son is Aquaphor moisturizing cream regardless of the formula. On the plus side, my son has not rejected this (or any of Enfamil Lipil or Similac Soy) formula outright. I'll update this posting if the pediatrician has a different observation. 3
Easy to make a meal out of this by adding some meat and veggies.  Easy and tastes good too. 4
I opened a bag of this treat a week ago. It was a part of the Christmas present I gave to my 5-month old miniature schnauzer. My pet is crazy over this treat! I would have given this product five stars because my puppy loves it and it's highly nutritious (as claimed by the manufacturer). But I reduced my scoring to two-stars because it makes my puppy pass obnoxious-smelling gas. It doesn't bother him but it does me! When I reviewed the list of ingredients, I found a possible culprit: sweet potato. This is a root crop known to cause flatulence. 2
I purchased the Peruvian coffee and it is only "okay." It has a smooth flavor but it is a bit weak and it definitely doesn't brew a `full-body' cup of coffee.  Also, the plastic cup and lid are a little stronger than all the other k-cups that I've tried and every time I put it in the coffeemaker I have to apply enough pressure that I worry that it might damage it.  So, I will still use the product that I have but I will certainly not be purchasing it again. 3
There is no way I would have known beforehand exactly how Greek coffee tasted.  I went on the recommendation of an article citing it's medicinal qualities. I'm sorry but this was the worst tasting coffee I've EVER had! The seller was quick and had a good price but again, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS COFFEE! 1
Hard to find item, but don't buy too many. They either came stale or they got that way quickly. But a classic nonetheless 4
When I bought this, I believed it was the exact same product I was getting from my grocery store, but instead, it is a poor substitute that is thickened with guar gum.  Bleah. 1
In the past I have purchased these cookie bars through Amazon and have had good business. However, Amazon has not kept up with the ingredients changing in these cookie bars. It is very important to me what ingredients are in the foods I purchase. I am not happy with Amazon's business this time. Ingredients change often! Amazon needs to keep up to date with the ingredients if they are going to have them listed on their website. 3
It was shipped in a very nice package and I have no complain with the seller. My plant growing bigger and now I am looking for a bigger pot to transplant. It's good....if you are looking for a a workspace plant that needs minimal maintenance this is the plant you might need. 5
These bags never close well, so if you are a compulsive bag-closer, forget about it. Ah, the taste you ask? Dry, and dusted with its own carnation in powderized form. Snack creators branching out by offering traditional products in slightly different forms results in me expressing negative comments via reviews. And why, oh, why does everything have to be miniaturized in order to appeal to rugrats and the type of people who have to proclaim their brood with stick figure-ish stickers on the back of their vehicle? Please, just go straight for the original "Chips Ahoy!" in standard size, pig out, and forget about the kids for six minutes. 2
I really like other flavors of Stash (peach, lemongrass green and breakfast blend).  But, this has two types of cloves which I knew weren't my favorite but it also had cardomon oil which is my favorite spice.  But the cloves overpower everything else.  Numi golden chai has no cloves whatsoever so I recommend it if you want to avoid those pesky cloves.  Oh, Numi also does not have black pepper which is traditional in chai tea but is also a taste I don't like in my tea. 1
Whole peas may seem appetizing to a human but to cats, they're junk food. Cats get all their nutrition by eating the whole animal. Cats have hard time digesting plant matter. This is closer to dog food than cat food since dog's physiology will allow digestion of many plant based food itms. My cats ate about half of the yellow goo around the peas and carrots. If you want a true holistic approach for cats, veggies gotta go. 2
The Chips Ahoy! Chewy Gooey Chocofudge along with their cousins, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004U49QU2">Chips Ahoy! Chewy Gooey Megafudge, 10-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> have been a disappointment. There is something off with the taste. It tastes flat and overprocessed, and on top of that each cookie is 75 calories. These are fairly small cookies, around 2 inches in diameter.<br /><br />Too bad because the description sounded promising. These Chocofudge actually taste slightly better than the Megafudge, perhaps because they have less of the uninspiring fudgeness.<br /><br />They arrive in a package that opens and reseals at the top. The cookies are arranged in three rows of six cookies each.<br /><br />They get 2.5 stars for the taste, but 75 calories for a 2-inch cookie drops them down to 2 stars.<br /><br />If I had to chose between these Chewy Gooey and the regular Chips Ahoy cookies, I would definitely go with the regular tried and true Chips Ahoys. 2
Not as good as some of the other beef jerky brands. The taste is a little to bland. Not enough flavor. 3
It tastes like it has an artificial sweetener or is sugar free. I wouldn't recommend it. But it will do in a pinch either by adding it to coffee or adding a flavored creamer. 2
My baby is a wonderful eater and has loved all of the variety I've given him until this food. He tried it and vomited instantly. I tried the next day and just let him smell it and he vomited again - lol. I tried it too and it was not tasty to me at all. I had two of these packs left so I waited a couple of weeks to try again. He liked it that time. Anyway, don't give up and keep trying because they just may like it after a few tries (or even 15 tries). It's a healthy meal. 3
These are tasty jelly beans that are not tasty enough to be worth $13 per lb. Otherwise, it's a good product, just a tad overpriced. 3
Purchased for the boyfriend and he says it is very, very good. The beans have a nice sheen to them and are a bit larger. He likes the re-sealable cans and will re-use them. These really make great gifts and I highly recommend them for your coffee snob friends. You won't be disappointed! 4
The mouth says, "How do I love thee, let me count the ways..."<br />If you like apple products a must have item.  The only draw back, shipping cost.  These are very heavy. 5
For those reviews that say the coffee wasn't strong enough or the cup leaked, they simply don't know what they're doing.  First of all, use the right kind of coffee.  The first time I used it, I put in a medium roast that wasn't ground very fine.  And yes, the coffee was weak.  So I switched to a VERY FINELY ground dark roast and it was perfect.  And yes, they will leak and leave grounds in your Keurig if you don't let some of the filter hang over the edge and seal it correctly.  I had no problem with sealing the cup...so far so good.  Makes as good a cup of coffee as the more expensive ready-made k-cups and have yet to find any grounds in my coffee or in the Keurig.  Really a good deal, plus I had them three days after ordering.  Very quick shipping. 5
I got this for free through a rebate offer and my cat really just didn't care for it that much.  It cost at least twice as much as other good brands.  Won't be buying it again. 3
This was once a delicious popcorn treat.  It is lousy now. What's more, the description shown by Amazon is a lie.<br /><br />It says, "Made with real Land O' lakes Butter".  WRONG! This new stuff has plenty of fat, is very greasy actually, but the grease is "Hydrogenated Soybean Oil". It does not resemble real butter in any way whatsoever. It doesn't smell good and it doesn't taste good.<br /><br />Now I am stuck with 23 packages of this junk because I'm disabled and can't manage sending it back.<br /><br />If you need a popcorn fix, buy something else. 1
I became a fan for Dave's Gourmet Dave's Burning Nuts about 3 years ago.  This is a very addicting snack. A hefty dose of heat with just the right amount of saltiness. I've introduced them to a number of my co-workers who are now big fans.  I have tried the other spicy nut products on the market, but so far, Dave's is by far the champ! 5
My daughter loves this even more than the Quaker brand oatmeal (that has twice as much sugar).  Thumbs up. 5
This is the first low carb bagel that I have tried.  It was quite good toasted.  The texture was slightly different from regular bagels, but not in a bad way.  It seemed a little spongier than a normal bagel, and might not be as good if not toasted.  I recommend these bagels.  The price seems high, unless you consider how much you would pay for one bagel in a bagel shop - and then it's not that much more.  Shipping is the big problem.  You should order more than one package or order other items so that the cost per item is less.  I ordered mine from Linda's Diet Delites. 4
If you like stuffed olives get this.  Only compliant is pain to clean.  Easy to use.  You can make much better olives then expensive ones in store. 5
That tastes much better and more filling, and I think they're healthier.  I have been buying these Oats N' Dark Chocolate for a while until I saw a big package of these granola thins at Costco... it was interesting at first, but I realize it tastes more like milk chocolate than dark. Plus, pay attention to the interesting comparison to the Snickers Fun Size by another commenter. 2
Not bitter but strong, best decaf ever by far. Can't compare to lavazza, which I think is overrated and terrible. 4 stars because of the high cost even though is cheaper here at amazon that in my area,  the Bay Area in California, can't even find it here. BEST TASTING DECAF. 4
What I expected were almonds covered with a chocolate glaze, like the ones you'd get at the movies, except dark instead of milk chocolate. These aren't that. The almonds are instead covered with a very light, only subtly sweet powdering of chocolate - only one gram of sugar per quarter-cup serving, which is hardly any. It's not really a sweet and you don't feel like you're eating candy. If you have these around, the kids won't eat them. They'll leave them for you. 4
If you like ginger, there is not much here. We were trying to find large ginger pieces surrounded by chocolate like that found at a small candy store in Hilo. These were nothing like that. Look for an Australian supplier. 1
I thought that I'd really enjoy these but they're so overrated!! I usually like gummi bears but these just aren't that good, I could have bought Walmart's brand and been just as happy! I will now be ordering these or buying these again EVER!! I spent too much and they didn't taste that good, too bad I didn't know how awful they were before I bought... Yuck a real waste of money!!:( 2
These are a must have for syrups.  It makes measuring a lot easier and it eliminates a lot of mess rather than pouring right from the bottle.  My only complaint would be that it's nearly impossible to put a pump into a full bottle of syrup.  It has overflowed every time I have tried.  Other than that, they work great.  Just make sure to clean them regularly :) 4
Living on Guam can at times leave much to be desired. We were sitting here talking about when we visited our family in Wisconsin and had some home made ice cream at an Amish farm. I remembered how good it tasted and I remembered I had some Maple syrup ice cream while there, sooooo. I got on line and found this 1/2 gallon, price wasn't bad  (here at a local store a pint of REAL Maple syrup will cost $12.00) and it had free shipping. I had it in a few days, and made the ice cream right away. By the way I also made pancakes and sausage for dinner, and this here Maple syrup was as good if not better than what I had 8 years ago. VERY well packaged, and really fast shipping. Nice bouqet, great light amber color, great job to the cooker. Oh yea, by the way, the ice cream came out wonderfully. 5
Everybodys taste is different.  This is a good variety pack to sample the different kinds to see what you like.  A few of the flavors were not good. I could not drink the Mt Zevia taste was very sharp metallic.  Best of them were DR Zevia, Black Cherry, and Cream. 3
Small enough to carry in my purse, and a great addition to seltzer or soda water so I can avoid artificial sweeteners when I am out and want something to drink. Great stuff! 4
I was looking for an alternative meat source for a backpacking trip my husband and I are taking soon and discovered this great tasting vegan meat jerky. It tastes great, but is a bit to salty for my tastebuds 4
I have always been somewhat of a soda aficionado since the days of Pepsi, Dr pepper etc. My grandparents owned a little corner grocery store so I'd get to try some of the new sodas that came out.  I really enjoyed Switch Soda .its something different. Taking juice, putting some carbonation in it. Almost in a vague way reminds me of those sparkling grape juice drinks you get around the holidays if you don't drink wine. Its very good. I would definitely buy it again. However the no sugar added part can be a bit "misleading" as you as the label states 33 grams per serving but it's only one serving per can but us diabetics should probably only drink this when we have low sugars like I just did bonus is no high fructose corn syrup which isn't very good anyhow. I liked this and would buy more to keep around the house the days I have my sugar lows as It didn't seem to be to overpowering to me. I liked the kiwi,berry as I am a fan of strawberry and kiwi both. I thought personally it was a very interesting soft drink . I really like this infusion stuff they have these days like Dr pepper put  cherry. chocolate diet one year ago and such. Switch kind if is like that. I personally prefer a fruited flavored carbonated beverage anyhow over say a plain cola type flavored one. I thought this was a change from the regular diet Pepsi and diet sierra mist i am used to drinking .I would pick these up if i seen them in a market or on here someday.  Only con I can really think of at the moment for a case off here its 22 bucks that is kinda steep for the economy were living in right now but if they sold them individual it be easier on the pocket book or pick one up in a store now and then when I see it. I really enjoyed the blends of the fruit flavor and the carbonation, like I mentioned it was really good and something different. I would definitely try this again. 4
The Switch Orange-Tangerine beverage is a mix of orange and tangerine juices with carbonated water, and, I must say, it tastes AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's similar to soda, but without all the unhealthy artificial ingredients and high-fructose corn syrup. If you find it, buy it!!!!!!!!!! 5
A bunch of flax seed in a sealed plastic bag.  I grind these up and put them in my morning oatmeal.  Nice source of fiber and good fats.  Barry Farms was great as always (3 orders with them so far), and I'm really liking the idea of flax seed in my diet. 5
I'm not sure I'm qualified to review dog treats, but my little dachschund-beagle mix Bella is, and she scarfed these up with gusto.  I was somewhat surprised because she's pretty picky, especially about dry treats, which these are. So I'm happy to recommend them to anyone with "picky eater" type dogs and I'm sure it will bring a smile to your face when you see your pup wolfing them down with gusto.  A perfect training treat as well. 5
My 4 jars were shipped in lots of bubble wrap, it took me a while to open.  Anyways, it is real artichoke spread, made in Italy.  Claims all natural ingredients and no preservatives.  My first shock is the size of the jars.  4.5 oz ain't much - think baby food.  The other thing I didn't like is that nowhere on any of the jars could I find an expiration date!!  Looks like Amazon took individual jars not labeled for resale from a large box.  Maybe it is OK to sell stuff in Italy without a date, but I am sure some law is being violated selling it here in the US.  Anyways, I opened a jar and it tastes OK, so I'm keeping it this time, but have doubts about re-ordering in the future.<br /><br />My recommendation for Amazon: if you want to get into the online food-selling business, please make sure that not only the products are labeled properly, but the expiration date is noted on the product page. 3
I love the Beef Teriyaki Nuggets and the Buffalo Chicken Nuggets. Now I have a 3rd kind to eat. These are great tasting and easy to eat (important for post bariatric surgery people). I love Jack Link's Nuggets line! 5
Granted, I tried to doctor this mix up based upon some other reviews and my own baking experience pre-gluten-free, but I imagine if these muffins tasted as bad as they did doctored up, this is a pretty sorry mix.  It is possible that I just got a bad bag, but the expiration date was still 11 months away so no excuse.  I added orange juice and yogurt in place of water for moisture, and added 1/3C brown sugar as a sweetener.  I threw in a large dash of flax seed meal (which I add to everything I bake GF for fiber and protein).  I added butter (whirred with the brown sugar to start) in place of oil, and 1C frozen blueberries since the goal was blueberry muffins.  They were awful enough, literally like paste, that I had to spit out what I ate and so did my husband.  But the kids had fun making them and actually like them.  Good thing I made banana bread muffins from scratch the same day or I would have been really disappointed. 1
During my Christmas vacation visiting family, I feasted on Aguadito. (Peruvian Chicken Soup)  This was one of the very best soups I have ever tasted in my forty seven years on this earth.  My mom told me that the Aji Amarillo was the key ingredient to this recipe.  Upon my return home, I ordered two jars.  Sadly, my cat knocked over and destroyed one of the jars.  I just made a batch of that awesome soup last night and it's a hit with my husband and sister.  I will now look forward to my 5 jar order and will find more recipes to use this 'magical' pepper paste.  Truly a must have for the kitchen! 5
This is an excellent tea.  One of the best I have ever had.  It is especially great when you prepare it with a samovar. 5
Have to give it 3 stars as I thought it wasn't bad but my husband hated the after taste. It does have a little bit of an after taste but I didn't think it was too bad. My husband disagreed. So if you want something different than plain water or soda give this a try. 3
I was underwhelmed by this product. It's not chocolatey enough, the filling is bland, and so the entire finished result is just sort of.... bland. I ate two and threw the rest away on principle that it wasn't delicious enough to waste the calories on it. Don't expect this to taste like a Hostess filled cupcake, because it really doesn't. Children will probably like it for the novelty. Be sure to cool them 20 minutes like it states in the instructions, or they'll burn their little tongues. 2
We're used some Velveeta products in our house from time to time ranging from the boxed cheeselike form to the newer pasta mixes.  This is another of the pasta mixes they currently offer and clearly these are designed to compete with the Hamburger Helper brand that you add meat, water and sometimes butter to as well.  Since this is a competitor, it makes sense to compare them.<br /><br />Frankly this Velveeta version of the Cheeseburger variety falls far short of the Hamburger Helper version.  The steps are almost identical except for the added foil packet of Velveeta sauce that you add at the end.  I'm not sure what caused the sour taste that no one in the family liked, but since we have liked the plain boxed pastas versions before, I'm thinking it must be the seasonings packet.  Not only did this not stand up to the level of Hamburger Helper but it also fell short of the store brand of this particular variety which we've also had several times, thus the 2 instead of 3 stars I would have given it had it pleased my family as much as s the store brand.<br /><br />The final result is that the product is OK but certainly not as good a taste as other brands of this exact same variety. Since these box mixes tend to cost more than either Hamburger Helper or store brands, the value is even less.  You'd do better just adding your own ingredients to pasta and cheese you had around the house. 2
I'd continue to buy but I'm moving over to more home made finger foods and away from glass jars...shattered too many. They like all the flavors though. Great textures too. 5
Tge first bag I had was good and a nice change from chips but as I had these every day for lunch for a month I quickly tired of them. The jalepeno one is the best. They all leave a residue on your fingers. 3
I innocently started giving these to my cats - had no idea they would begin to control my life.  Run out of treats?  you're screwed.  One cat cries so loud in the morning it sounds like someone is torturing her.  Eventually, the other cat jumps up on my face to wake me up...for treats.  It's like I'm living in a nightmare if I don't give them their fix.  C'mon...we know big corporations put addictive substances in candy, sodas & chips - - - of course they're in our cat treats.  And, seriously....they've hit the kitty crack jackpot w/ these.  Do yourself & your cat a favor:  Save your mental & your cat's physical HEALTH. 1
I love a high quality French roast. Since I was in college, coming home to visit my parents and drinking my mom's amazing coffee has never been beat by my Keurig.  Until now.  I love it.  It's super rich and flavorful.  It's not overly dark and there is no burnt taste like "other" coffees (you know who I'm talking about).  This is truly a lovely coffee. 5
We will not be purchasing this product again. Items arrived broken as the boxes were packed into boxes much too large.  The quality was not up to par with most Pop Tarts. 2
I used to love this milk but now I have to change my tune, watery product from Sri Lanka started coming and it's just not the same. Tried to make Thai curry and smoothies and it's just not the same. Will be cancelling my subscription this month. 1
This product is NOT beef jerky or anything remotely like it. This product is neither spicy, nor beefy or meaty.<br /><br />What this product amounts to is a sour, salty, mushy, meat-based concoction pressed into stick form.<br /><br />And the ingredients*, to whom it may concern, are troubling to say the least.<br /><br />I'm currently inquiring in my social network about anyone with a dog who should like to have it. ('Who' may refer to the dog as well.)<br /><br />*Ingredients: Beef, Beef Hearts, Water, Soy Protein Concentrate, Salt, Dextrose, Spices, Corn Syrup, Smoke Flavoring, Paprika, Monosodium Glutamate, Flavoring, Sodium Erythorbate, Lactic Acid Starter Culture, Sodium Nitrite. (Appetizing, ahem.) 1
I was excited to find this oatmeal made of real, easy to pronounce ingredients which came in a short list.  The oatmeal cooks up well and tastes great.  Unfortunately the amount of flax seed in this oatmeal made me nauseous.  Unfortunately the flax seeds were also whole, which means they're offering very little nutritional benefit.  Whole flax seeds are most likely to pass through mostly undigested.  Needless to say, I won't be purchasing the oatmeal again, but I've now been inspired to make my own, healthier version.  It is as simple as tweaking the recipe to my liking, and measuring out the dry ingredients into snack sized ziploc bags.  Super easy to grab a bag for work and it's not hard to estimate the amount of water needed.  If it weren't for the amount of (whole) flax seeds, I'd definitely buy this oatmeal again. 3
For some reason the dog will only eat half of these so we have 2 halves around the house. But I think the dog is the issue... 4
Amazon refunded my purchase price for these, but I thought I should still warn others against ordering. The ones I ordered arrived as furry, rancid walnuts. Unfortunately, I dumped the first cannister into my existing walnut storage without looking (since the packaging was in date). This caused me to have to throw away about 2 pounds of good walnuts because they were touched by these rancid ones. (Perhaps buying food online isn't the best idea...) 1
I haven't had Mallomars in a long time, so when I saw these were available, I had to get some. The same delicious cookie that I enjoyed years ago is still just as tasty. A crisp cookie, topped with a marshmallow and covered in pure chocolate. I can't say the box lasted very long in my house. Guess I'll have to buy some more! 4
Great tasty product and great price, but Roland has a packaging problem with the pail which had cracked and seemed too weak for the contents.<br /><br />The top of the pail was completely snapped off and the protective foil seal burst open during transit - the entire glaze contents spilled out like slime - Fed-X wrapped the box in a plastic bag to prevent further leakage. There was adequate bubble wrap from Amazon, but the box they used for shipping was too big and the pail had room to smash around inside the box. So, this is an EXCELLENT product, but Roland's plastic pail is just too thin.  Amazon is looking into the issue - I sure hope they resolve it!  And then I'll gladly order again.  By the way, Amazon's customer service Rocks - they are the best company to deal with when things go kapooey!<br /><br />** UPDATE: Ordered another one a few months later and it arrived in perfect condition with much better packaging.  It looks like Amazon resolved the shipping issue. Order with confidence. 4
Kellogg's new "Crunchy Nut" cereal isn't particularly innovative from a flavor/texture perspective, but it is pretty tasty.  It's flavor is like a hybrid of Kix and Honey Smacks with the texture of Oh!s.  If you like any (or better yet, all) of these cereals, "Crunchy Nut" will probably be a hit at your breakfast table.<br /><br />Don't be caught up in the "Nuts in Every Bite!" hype, though.  You'll barely taste 'em, and they certainly don't raise the nutritional value.  (See below.)  For reference nutritionally speaking, this product very similar to Froot Loops.<br /><br />In short, this cereal is crunchy, not particularly nutty, with a nice mild honey flavor.  It's unlikely you'll be able to use this as a gateway cereal for your kids to start eating muesli regularly.  ;-)<br /><br />NUTRITIONAL INFO:<br /><br />Serving size:  3/4 Cup<br /><br />Calories: 100<br />Total Fat:  1g<br />Cholesterol: 0mg<br />Sodium: 125mg<br />Potassium: 25mg<br />Total Carbs: 23g<br />Fiber: 2g<br />Sugars: 10g<br />Protein: 2g 3
If you put two teaspoons of chia seeds in a bowl of vanilla almond milk and let it sit for a couple of hours, it makes the seeds more bearable to eat. 5
sparkles are ok - but melt into the frosting and don't show up as nicely as they should, container was 1/3 empty. Packaged nicely, shipped on time, just was disappointed iwth the product itself. 3
I was thought they would be softer than they are, therefore I was disappointed when trying them. 2
I bought this for my 20lb puppy on the advice of my trainer.  What a disaster!  Not only was I bruised from her swinging it around trying to get the treats out, but so were my walls and furniture.  Within a week the plastic jug broke and that was the end of it. 1
These gave me a headache, too much sugar, and other ingredients that didn't sit well.  I would not recommend to someone trying to eat healthier. 1
My dog always loved these.  And now I can buy them in bulk on Amazon, instead of overpaying for these at the Vet's office.  Am still concerned a bit that they are made in China, but as long as my dog is doing well and still eats her dry food, we are ok with them. 4
I was expecting a larger granual suger and am dissapointed in this product. I might as well have used normal grocery store ganular sugar (i.e., Domino).  Not worth returning and I would not buy again. It certainly doesn't fit my description of "sanding" sugar. 2
These are absolutely the best peanuts ever! This was not my first time buying them. It most definetly won't be the last. They are huge and lightly salted. Very very flavorful. 5
This is very good but I prefer the liquid cherry juice.  Less messy to deal with and the concentrate doesn't seem to go as far as the liquid juice.  Just my preference. 4
My pomeranian is 11 and will eat any treats. Heck, she eats more produce than most people do. So we bought the duck jerky and peanut butter bits. She won't touch either one. Now, she has never been given duck food so I'm not shocked that she wouldn't put it in her mouth, but she eats peanut butter like crazy. So, I looked at the ingredients and both packages contain tumeric, rosemary, and sage. I think that the seasoning may be what turn many dogs off. My dog won't eat seasoned meat. I'm not positive that this is the problem, or everyone's problem, but I don't see any other ingredients that would turn off dogs. Our pet supply store gave us a full refund and we chose another treat that she goes crazy over. 1
Although I did not go through Amazon for this company, I did order direct from them and found the service awful.  First order was lost,2nd order had a wrong item and then no response to my e-mails about the error.  Just not worth it.  The actual product was fine, service terrible.  Maybe going through Amazon would had afforded me better service. 2
Both of those sugars can be purchased cheap at any low carb online store (netrition has it for $7.50 for 1 lb!), and if I can purchase it that cheap, then you KNOW they're getting it dirt cheap.  The price is high because low-carbers are desperate for sweets that won't add much to their daily carb intake; and Low carb specialties (the makers of these bars) know it. I've purchased these bars twice before and loved them; but I took the price personally.  Yes, it's true, no one forced me to purchase them, but that's besides the point.  You end up feeling like prey every time you see the price of your favorite items through the roof when you're desperate for something sweet.  EVERY producer of low carb sweets pull that stunt; however, you'll find all your "non-sweet" products, such as condiments, etc., moderately priced.  It's no coincidence.  If you have the time, purchase ghirardelli unsweetened chocolate from Amazon, add a sucralose sweetener (Please see JJ's recommendation below)-preferably in liquid form, so there's no carbs-, add some cream, melt and you're done.  You just saved 2/3 what you would've payed for these chocolates. Any other sweets you find online can be duplicated with minimal effort as well.  Just google it and fatten that purse. 3
Not the best but O.k. if you like mild coffee.If New England Decaf was on sale this would be a better choice for Columbian coffee. 3
This is an 'on the go" pick-me-up coffee drink made by Coca-Cola company.<br /><br />According to the bottle it's made with 100% Arabica coffee, the coffee is very much espresso -- dark and strong on the coffee. There's added sugar in this so it tastes palatable. 4
Very think chews, cut unevenly, many with holes like swiss cheese. Not appropriate for use unless you cull through the bag removing the discards. 2
I thought I didn't care for decaf espresso since it always had a bitter flavor that ranged from a moderate undertone to an overwhelming bite. I enjoy strong-flavored coffee, but bitter coffee is another story.<br /><br />Well, it turns out that I was just drinking the wrong stuff. Lavazza decaf is absolutely delightful. Strong, full-bodied, but no bitterness. Nice crema, smooth and rich. Really hits the spot!<br /><br />It does, however, have a bit more caffeine than other decafs. Not much, but I can feel it a bit (I'm very sensitive to caffeine - if you're not, you probably won't notice it). Not enough that it causes a problem. But even if it did, I'd probably still drink this - it's that good!<br /><br />Highly recommend. 5
Bear Creek "Darn Good" Chili is some of the best chili I've ever had. It is quick and easy by just following the instructions on the back of the packet. My family enjoys chili just a little spicier and a little meatier so I've added a few items to kick the chili up another notch. So here it is....<br /><br />(2) packs of Bear Creek "Darn Good" Chili Mix<br />(2) cans of Tomato Paste<br />(2) cans of Rotel Tomatoes<br />(2) Small Onions (Chopped)<br />(1) Bellpepper (Chopped)<br />(4) cloves of Garlic (Chopped)<br />(1.5) lbs. of Ground Beef or Ground Chuck<br />(2) lbs. of Smoked Sausage (Finely Chopped)<br />Hint of Cayenne Pepper (To your taste)<br />Hint of liquid smoke<br /><br />In a large pot, add both chili mixes to boiling water (As directed), then add the tomato paste. Stir well and turn fire down to a medium heat. In a large sauce pan, brown your ground beef and chopped sausage, then add to your pot. In the same large sauce pan, saute chopped onion, bellpeppers, and garlic (10-15 min) and then add to your pot. Add the Rotel Tomatoes, turn heat down to a simmer and let cook about 30 minutes (Stirring occasionally). Add cayenne pepper to taste and a hint of Liquid Smoke and let simmer for about 30 more minutes (Still stirring). In this last few minutes while the chili is cooking,  bake up your favorite cornbread (I like "Jiffy"). Gather your family and friends for a "Darn Good" Chili time.<br /><br />Recipe is even better in a CrockPot.....And I don't know why I added the Liquid Smoke (But it worked)<br /><br />Hope ya like it!!! 4
I am a rice junkie and so glad that the getting heirloom and unique rices are becoming easy to get in the States.  I was given a bag of this rice as a gift and think it is pretty good.  The flavor is not much different than normal white rice (though I think I can tell a difference).  Also the rice does not stay as green as you would think it would.  I tried some other rice at a fancy foods show by another small company called Lotus Food.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019S6XR6">Lotus Foods Organic Jade Pearl Rice, 15 Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a> I think the Lotus Food product is perhaps better in taste and color.  If you are willing to buy a 12 pack then the Lotus price is a lot less per pound ($3.15 vs $7.00+).  Overall this product is pretty good and I would encourage anybody to use it to add a little flair to their rice dishes, however I will be buying it from Lotus. 3
as a real german person ( and sorry for my englis, but i try my best ) i have to say these gummy bears taste not like the gummy bears back here in Germany. i come to the US twice a year and the one year i was a bit "homesick", so i bought a bag of my fave german gummy bears. what can i say, the taste was like the original but actually not, even the colors aren`t right. my american friend loves the gummy bears from Germany, so i carry every 6months 30bags into the US. if you love the american version, fine, but if you ever have the chance to get a bag from Germany, try the "original", much better. 2
Not only does this "coffee" (instant crystals" taste terrible, but it clogged up my machine so badly that it took me about 2 hours to get it clean.  Avoid at ALL cost. 1
I like this hemp milk a lot. It's available in my area at Bed Bath & Beyond for cheaper than the current Amazon price. In terms of taste, consistency, and flavor, this is a great product. It's smooth and delicious. To me, it tastes like soy milk and the hemp ingredients are not detectable. It goes great in coffee.<br /><br />One thing to be aware of, however, is the health claims of the product. The carton touts the high omega-6 content of this product and even shows a bar graph comparing it to soy milk and almond and rice milk. This product contains beneficial Omega-3 as well (found in things like fish oil an grains), but high omega-6 is not a good thing. Too much omega-6 can have negative effects on health because it is inflammatory. Most Americans already get too much omega-6 because it is very common in our diet (from plant oils). A University of Maryland Medical Center study found that Americans get 14-25x more omega-6 than omega-3 fatty acids.<br /><br />It is important to keep the ratio in balance, and some health researchers believe the optimal ratio is closer to 4:1 of omega-6 to omega-3 for lowering the risk for certain kinds of cancer. On PubMed, look for article ID: 12442909, "The importance of the ratio of omega-6/omega-3 essential fatty acids." 4
Taste is good if you like vinegar based hot sauce. It's not very spicy; perhaps the pepper sauce novice would like it. 2
These only fit if you use one pod in the 2pod container, they are too large for the Senseo  machine and almost broke it.<br />Coffee is weak also. 1
This is a good product.  The price at Amazon is excellent and I really like it just coming to my door.  Subscribe and save is an excellent way to shop 4
The sauce was somewhat flavorful, but thin and runny with a weak flavor.  Would not buy this again.  I expected more from Mannheim Steamroller. 2
This chili is pretty good, seems to have a slight tomato taste to it which actually works well.<br /><br />Unfortunatly, it tries to fake it like it has ground beef, which makes it sort of strange to get used to.  If you know what i'm talking about here and are ok with that, I'd guess this is something you would enjoy. 3
These K-cups come unsealed around the edges during use, and as a result cause coffee and grounds to spew everywhere. Because of this, I tend to get a cupful of grounds which is not drinkable, thus I can't comment on the taste/strength of the coffee. 1
I had this cheese during the summer on a hiking trip through the French Alps.  We were able to go to a small producer and watch its preparation.  It is really delicious, better than Gruyere, to which it is often compared. When oh when can I get it in the U.S? 5
Expected good, full flavor from this tea, recently having finished 2 packets of Japanese Gyokuro. It is bland, and the color of the steeped tea, an unattractive dark brown - with no hint of green. 2
I've always enjoyed the Arnold Palmer Lite but that still has more calories than I like to consume from beverages. I recently switched from Mt Dew to Diet Mt Dew so I am on a quest to find as many low or no calorie drinks that I like as possible.<br />This stuff is great. One of the few drinks that I cannot detect any artificial sweeteners in.  To me, it tastes more like sweet tea with lemon in it as opposed to half tea/half lemonade but is still great. 4
this came to me all melted couldnt even eat it had to throw it out was all over the bad it came in 1
This is the first time I tasted the silk, try it...you'll like it! really great looking for more. 5
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LRIJC8">Gyro Meat (LOAF) approx. 5lb</a><br />Finally i can enjoy Gyros at home without going out.With gasoline pushing five dollars a gallon it is nice to know that this gourmet food is just a few feet away in the ice box.<br />Now how about Greek olives and Feta cheese so we can have a nice Greek salad with our Gyro. 5
I have a 4 year old Border Collie/Australian Cattle Dog mix, who is very food motivated.<br />I bought this toy after reading all the positive reviews from dog owners on this site.<br />A lot of the dogs referenced were Labs or Retrievers.. so I assumed this would be perfect for my pooch.<br />He figured it out rather quickly.. and even though he still loves to play it. Is done finding the treats in less than 2 mins. And if I am not right there with him (on the floor next to him), he will throw the toy around to just get the treats out.<br /><br />I will continue to use this toy with him, mostly to work on patience with him, but as far as "challenging" this toy did not prove effective. 4
This is consistently one of my favorite cups of coffee for my Keurig. Not too bold, not too light, just a good regular cup of coffee that this regular guy likes. 4
Don't buy this stevia.  It has a bad aftertaste.  Now I find that I can't return it AND it comes in a 2-pack.  YUCK!!! 1
I have been drinking Keemun Congou tea for more than 20 years. My first taste of Keemun was from Harrod's and the bright red color and the fabulous bouquet of Keemun made me a fan for life. In my opinion, the taste should be slightly astringent but sweet on your tongue. I love to open my jar of tea in the morning and inhale the slightly smoky, winey aroma of my tea much like coffee drinkers enjoy the smell of a newly opened can of coffee. Keemun really is the Bordeaux of tea.<br />Then the inevitable finally occurred the company I normally buy my Keemun tea from (Special Teas) went out of business, selling out to Teavana and Teavana has chosen not to carry the Keemun I prefer. Alas I found myself looking for a tea to replace the now unavailable Special Tea's Keemun, so I bought two pounds of the Davidson's Keemun because the price was right. Unfortunately this tea is nothing like the Keemun I love and look forward to every morning. The Davidson Keemun smells green and unfermented, almost like a green tea or perhaps slightly fermented like an oolong. The brew does not have that slight smokiness to it and is not sweet on my tongue.<br />I tried brewing it with more tea but that tasted like I had just used more green straw (someone equated it to being barny) and was not at all pleasing even to my husband who is less particular. In the end I am wondering what to do with the enormous amount of tea I have left and have to give this product a thumbs down. 2
Just what it says and perfect for grossing out your 3rd graders! The flavors, though, leave something to be desired. But really, how flavorful do you really need your halloween prop to be? It was fine and good for the purpose I needed. 3
I am not much on stuff like this, but having some issued that I think this item will take care of, I got some here - local shops did not carry it, prices at flea markets and food shops were - just to high. The price from Amazon was very good.<br />I no longer have need of this item - but if the condition returns - so will I, HERE! 4
I have the Beaba baby food maker and two of the trays.  I also use my food processor to make food.  I have twins and make a lot of organic food to freeze.  I freeze the food in the trays and then transfer then to FoodSaver bags so they never get freezer burned.  The one thing I HATE about the trays is that they have a weird, unpleasant odor to them.  The odor does not smell like the foods I stored in them.  For the most part, I wash them by hand. I tried soaking them in vinegar and figured the steam from the dishwasher might help, but nothing gets rid of the odor.  When I first got the trays, I had to run hot water over them to pop the food out.<br /><br />Now that I've been using them for a while, I can easily pop the food out without water.  I do try to transfer the food as soon as possible b/c the seal on the trays is not perfect and freezer burn can happen if you let them sit for too long.  I do feel the trays are overpriced.  I have 2 trays and could easily use 2-4 more to freeze the batches I make.  It's annoying to have to keep rotating the food to try to freeze it before it goes bad. 4
I love a good cup of hot cocoa now and then.  However, this product tastes awful!  My Keurig machine has two cups sizes and even on the smaller size the hot cocoa tastes very watered down.  We have to brew a k cup AND add half a packet of regular hot cocoa to make it drinkable!  I think that this is unacceptable especially since these cups cost more than the coffee ones.  We are gradually using our pack up, but WILL NEVER buy this product again! 1
I enjoy this gum. It tastes great and lasts much longer than I can chew it. That's more than I can say about most gums! Recommend it! 4
I love coconut macaroons and chocolate but I don't like to put on a lot of calories. These bars are a delightful snack, especially if you are trying to avoid gluten and/or dairy. The amount of sugar in a bar is low, probably in part due to the use of agave. I'm not really fond of agave and don't feel they really need it, since there is also some sugar in the chocolate chips. There is also a little too much salt for my taste but I still think this is a great quick snack for rare occasions.<br /><br /> I make my own cookies with apple sauce, using a variation of a recipe on the side of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EDDS6Q">Bob's Red Mill Old Country Style Muesli, 40-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a> but I leave out the sugar and salt and I add some coconut. These are even better and chewer than Pamela's but then, of course, they DO take about 20 minutes to make. If you don't want to go through that bother, Pamela's Oat Chocolate Chip Coconut bar should do the trick for a quick snack.<br /><br />The Amazon listing says there are six bars in a box. However, the box is clearly labeled and says five. The box is right. 4
The kettle chip itself is crisp, crunchy and good, although somewhat greasy.  Over coated with the flavoring causing mouth burn when it was not expected in a chip with Rosemary flavoring.  Leaves greasy, gritty residue on fingers after two or three chips. 2
Great tasting coffee. Exactly the flavor it says. Not too much flavor, but perfect. Great dessert coffee. Very pleased and will purchase again! 4
Package claims these treats are soft, marketing towards very young and senior dogs.<br />I used the treat as a back up hammer!!!!!  Three different packages, all with the same results.<br />I expected "Gourmet Treats" were just that, based on the cost.....Buyer beware!!!! 1
I absolutely love these Beaba Multiportion Freezer Trays!!! They are wonderful for children, grandchildren of several age levels. My daughter and I are using them for her 3 mo. old for home made food. We prepare food, portion out, and chill or freeze and needed. We can mix multiple items in one tray and it is ready for the babysitter to use.<br /><br />I love the soft bottoms because we can pop out the frozen portions we need. I love the close fitting top which keeps in freshness. I wish I'd had these when my girls were little<br /><br />We also use these as carry along snack trays for the 3 1/2 year old. She gets to choose and portion her snacks for the day. Wonderful! 5
I started reading the reviews to find out if there is caffeine in the Vega Chai Vanilla.  Low and behold 65 mg per serving.  If you are sensitive to caffeine, beware.  I have yet to sleep and it is 3 am! 1
This is really good with a rich and intense lemon flavor. I did not want to use alone as much as I wanted to use for a base for a dressing or glaze (ala recipes seen on cooking channel). I am well satisfied. 5
My husband & I have been on a tight budget & miss our "good" coffee(Starbucks.)  We've been drinking Folgers.  When I saw this deal I figured how bad could it be?  Honestly, I would rather drink our Folgers.  This coffee was so weak that we had to add an extra scoop of grinds.  I can't believe this stuff has good reviews. 1
I have a special needs teen, newly diagnosed that loves these crackers. I have eaten them also, pretty good! I save the broken crackers for his soups. We pack the whole ones for his tuna and crackers for at school. If you buy a case (6) I believe, at Whole Foods it is cheaper. Love 'em!!!<br />We even do PB and J with them. (You know how most of the breads are!) 5
It does not taste like chocolate, not even a little bit. It does taste fermented. And burned. If it were a good, carmelized kind of burned, that would be understandable. Everyone burns the sugar now and then. This just tastes BAD. Everything I have tried it in has had to be tossed, unsalvagable. My advice: Stay away. 1
Compared to other Fussie premium cat foods we tried this seems to have less in the can. We had them in 3 different occasions and cans do not have as much food so our cats feel hungry very soon. 2
I had not seen this item before in the stores, and did not know it is not a clumping litter. Be sure that is what you want before ordering. 2
This soup is incredibly good!  But honestly, I was looking for a better deal through Amazon. The free shipping is great, but it's over 3 bucks a can, and I can get it cheaper through my grocery store. They are always having WP sales for 2 bucks a can, 2.50 a can... so does anyone know about a better deal than this? It's a really good tasting soup! 5
A very tasty and well made cheese. Quality was as good as any other version of this I've had. Came well wrapped and chilled. 5
They look nice, but taste is bland and feel is rubbery. I simply satue'd them with onions in oil for 15 min on low heat until they became golden brown. The smaller pieces are tasty but big ones are very tough. I have not tried them in stong sauces, but no far it's dissapointing 3
I love the other Nana's cookie bars and cookies, so I thought I'd give these a try even though they are "No Gluten" and made with rice flour instead of wheat flour. They look nice, but the texture is a bit strange (it's kind of like eating really fine sand) and they are too dry and crumble at the slightest touch. They don't taste bad, which is a plus, but I won't be buying these again. 2
As for the taste of the product, it tastes just like evaporated whole milk to me.  It does not have the creamy mouth-feel of regular half-n-half.  I know that this is from treating it for long term shelf life, but I would not invest the money in it when you can get evaporated milk on sale quite often and it has a much longer shelf life.<br /><br />I ordered 2 boxes of this and one box was leaking so bad that FedEx would not deliver it.  The other appeared fine but inside had leaked everywhere and it took forever for me to find one container that wasn't leaking to try the product. The box was packed pretty good, the flat of cartons were wrapped in bubble wrap but with a bit of empty space in the box; so it is a 50/50 chance the cartons are just leaky or damage happened during shipping from shifting around in empty space during transit.<br /><br />Either way, Amazon customer service was wonderful about fixing the problem, but I will not be reordering. 2
I am a salty snack person, but this is over the top salty.  The chip is flavorful, and it is not greasy (just as you would expect).  I did not hate them, but I will not be buying any more. 4
I do love coconut water, it is very refreshing on a hot day. This one was on sale and sounded pretty good. Well it is not that good. The coconut uses must not be YOUNG coconuts. Water from young coconuts have the sweetest flavor. This had an almost stale flavor the was slightly covered up by the tropical fruit added. Usually I have to hide the coconut water from my 3 kids or they will drink all of it in a few days. I put all of this one in the fridge and now, 2 weeks later, there is still more than half left. The base coconut flavor was just not right. I have tried several different brands using subscribe and save and the best is "Taste Nirvana Real Coconut Water With Pulp" I have been to SE Asia and had coconut water there from street vendors and restaurants, it is simply delicious. Taste Nirvana is a close the that FRESH wonderful flavor that I have found so far. I would not buy this one if you are not sure, there are much better ones out there. 2
I tried successfully to make fresh rolls first time. Very easy. Good product. Worked consistently since. I recommend it highly. 5
The boxes arrived undamaged but when I opened the box to eat the cereal, the chocolate pieces had all melted due to the extreme summer heat during shipment in the UPS trucks and, as a result, it was large solid chunks of chocolate matted with the flakes so, even with milk, the cereal was not edible. Apparently, certain items should not be shipped during the summer heat. 1
My brother owns a Keurig one cup coffee maker, which is an amazing device. I, however, don't drink coffee. When I came across these Hot Cocoa K-cups, I took a chance. They're incredibly good, and it gives me a chance to share a hot drink with the coffee crowd without having to boil water or milk. This 24-pack is priced well against the coffee K-cups as well. 5
I bought this for all my deck containers this year, and I'm not really that impressed with it. The plants look fine, but I have way fewer flowers than I've ever had using regular potting soil. I also had two plants die, and I have no idea why. I read one other review that said her plants were cooking in the sun - that the contents of her containers felt HOT to her. This could be my exact problem as well. Both plants that died were in full sun. Next year I will buy regular potting soil and a big package of Miracle Grow plant food instead! 2
I agree the jerky is way too salty and it has an unusual flavor.  The package says hickory, but I have no idea what it is.  I will try another brand next time. 2
This is the second time I have ordered this product.  I was happy enough the first time to place an order again.  Cookies were fine and delivery was very quick. Thank you. 5
When I saw this, I thought it would be rather appealing to dogs.  It looks as though it is full of taste and flavorful with the different tastes and textures combined.  When I filled my shih tzu's bowl with this, however, he simply looked at me, down at the bowl, gave it a sniff and walked away.  Granted, he is a very very very picky dog.  So far the only dog food that I have found that he really loves is Purina Beneful.  I have tried giving him this a couple of times and none of the times has he taken any interest in eating it.  Our cats, on the other hand, have nibbled on it and they don't seem to mind it.  I think this will end up going out to our big outside dogs - they love and eat anything, lol.  Bottom line, I will not be purchasing this in the future. 2
Sorry to say I thought it was tastless...not good at all...I even through out part of the one cup I made...unfortunately I am stuck with 5 of them I cannot eat because they will not take them back...JudyK 2
How this tea could get any stars is beyond me.  I tried one bag and could not taste anything...you got it nothing.  So next I used two bags in a cup to see if that improved the taste...still no taste.  At my age I will not waste time on useless things so I gave the rest of my order to a friend who also enjoys Earl Grey Tea without my comment.  The next day she asked if I wanted my tea back saying it was the worse tea ever!!!<br />I will bet they do not publish this review but hope they will.<br />Do not buy this tea. 1
The coffee is rich dark and beautifully low acid, meaning not stomach ache.<br /><br />However, that format of 3 once bags that are not resealable can be a challenge to deal with.<br /><br />They remind of the bags I used at restaurants to make coffee for the diners. 3 oz is enough to make one 12 cup pot of week coffee or 8 cups of tasty brew.<br /><br />But I am just one guy and 8 cups a day is a bit much for me.<br /><br />So, I decided to use a french press and that was a mistake, the grind is too fine, and I got some sludge at the bottom of my cup.<br /><br />Then the following day, I made a small pot, but since the pack was not resealable, I thought it had lost some of the aroma.<br /><br />This could be solved with a ziploc baggie I guess.<br /><br />Regardless of the wonky format, the coffee is good and it is low acid.  But then so is coffee made with a cold toddy tool like: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006H0JVW">Toddy T2N Cold Brew System</a>. The only draw back of the Toddy, is that coffee tastes like a different animal, but it is tasty, and low acid too (due to the cold brew process).  The Puroast Low Acid Coffee maintains that hot brewed coffee taste. 3
I love flavored coffee but I don't like the flavor to be too strong because I can get tired of it quickly.  This coffee is just enough flavor that allows me to drink it more often than most flavored coffees.  I don't like flavor to mask or hide the fact that i'm drinking coffee!  This is perfect.  You can drink cup after cup siimply because the flavor is not overwhelming...but it's definitly there! I can add flavored cream to this to create an interesting cup of coffee (although i prefer not to right now). This will make a great iced coffee because the flavor is already there. 4
I asked six people to test out these nuts (three adults and three teenagers).  Four liked the flavor.  One didn't like the pepper flavor and one found it too salty to eat.  Five found it salty and one didn't find it salty at all. 3
I loved this product, and it was better than what I thought it was going to be. My favorite was teh salt and vinger flavor (yum yum) but I hated the cheddar, and salt & pepper ones. 4
Being a huge fan of the "subscribe and save" program through Amazon, I decided to add coffee to an ever growing list of products delivered.  This coffee, however, is the worst my husband and I have ever tried!  Beware. 1
I purchased these because of the low salt, and they were indeed low in salt. However, many, many of the chips in the bag were literally dripping in oil. I have never encountered this problem with other potato chip brands. It was very unappetizing, and who wants all that oil? I will never buy these again, and I would not recommend them to others. 1
this is a good SV, but, the price of shipping makes this a senseless buy. 3
I just picked up a tin of this at the minimart because I didn't want chips and I was feeling adventurous. This stuff is surprisingly delicious! I don't like canned sardines, but I love those snack-packages of smoked salmon when I can get them, (which is not often) and this tastes closer to the salmon. Very tasty. The texture is nice too. I got full eating it on crackers with cream cheese, and there's still a lot left. It goes a long way. 4
This is the only dog treat that my terrier will eat. We crumble over his dry food and he LOVES it. 5
I love sour candy.  The more sour, the better.  And these sour belts are SOUR!!<br /><br />They also turn your mouth completely blue.  Lips, tongue, and even your teeth.  Especially if you overdo it, like I tend to do.  They so addictive!<br /><br />The blue food coloring is easily brushed off the teeth, but expect at least a full day before your tongue and lips turn back to normal.<br /><br />These babies contain malic acid, the secret to their incredible sourness.  Taken in too great a quantity, malic acid can have an odd effect on the taste buds.  Nothing you eat later will taste right.  The effect goes away after about a day, too.<br /><br />Sounds like an awful lot of fuss just to have sour belts, huh?  But if you like sour like I like sour, it's definitely worth it.<br /><br />These belts are not delivered in a hard plastic case, but in a clear plastic bag.  You get a lot of them!  Store them in a resealable container to keep them soft and fresh. 5
I love raspberrys but this mix was a bit sharp and bitter not at all i want in a raspberry syrup 2
I had bought a Black and Decker one-cup coffee maker that used these pods.  It didn't work properly, but I have managed to use the pods with my old, stand-by coffee maker and am please with the flavor and convenience.  Someone had commented about a problem with some of the pods being sealed in the outer packaging.  I have not encountered that problem.  Overall, I am pleased with this purchase. 4
I bought these because they are made in America and my dogs are worth it.  What I don't like about them is that there is a thick string, or maybe just a thick vain of some kind, going through each piece. A much smaller issues is that these are very hard, even hard to break by hand.  We have been using a pliers to break the pieces up before serving and then a scissors to cut the string part!  A dog could choke to death with these.<br /><br />My biggest problem is that I am looking for an alternative USA raised chicken solution for treats. 1
I like the taste, but the store does not always has this.  Some-how it tastes different from the one in the store, much weaker caffeine and aroma... 3
I just ordered this, came today and thought I would just try it, well to my amazement,My little Daisy ate it and wanted more.My little Dog is just 8 yrs but has trouble with Flare-ups with her pancreas, I have to avoid fats and corn with her and she needs more fiber. I have been making her dog food ,but she missed eating the dry,I wondered if it was small enough for her to chew , but it was. 5
This chai is more flavorful than the Stash black tea chai I had ordered before. Also has the bonus of being organic. Can recommend the Good Earth brand  basically across the board. Almost all of their teas exceed expectations. 5
La carte noire coffee is good and very popular in France.<br />However, it is a bit expensive for the amount and the shipping charges added on to the total.<br />I must say that we have several brands of coffee here in America that we have to choose from and just as flavorful.<br /><br />(you may not want to post this since it is a bit negative but that's my opinion). And I understand if you don't. 3
I have been a connoisseur of quality green, oolong for many moons, and I also enjoy a good cup of morning Joe. I had tried loose Pu-erh previously and was bitten by the smooth coffee like mouth feel of the variety. This is not green tea taste be prepared, but is very earthy and rich especially during the first and second flushes. These nuggets of goodness have replaced my boring coffee routine. I prefer it strong and thick usually dropping two Tuo Cha nugs in my tea pot. I'm here to report the following; calm alertness, healthy as green and if you believe might help drop a few points on your disappointing cholesterol numbers  before your next visit.<br /><br />It's true......strong earthy aroma is apparent primarily during the first flush, but is very part of the brew process, brew is clear not cloudy and taste is never sharp or tannic. Be warned I've tried the flavored varieties, and filler is not my cup of tea. If you like it sweet add a little honey and say goodbye to the beans! 4
This is the best thing from Gevalia.  I was drinking the Starbucks Africa and Verona before "the breakup."  I tried the Dark Breakfast from Gevalia, but it's horrible.  I can only drink it after adding the Maestro Lorenzo Espresso Intensivo.  That makes quite a nice cup with a good kick to it.  I even need a little cream in it to smooth it out a bit.<br /><br />But this one is just right.  It's a nice strong cup that doesn't need cream, but can take cream without losing flavor.  This is the first hope I have had for saving my Tassimo machine.  I don't want to go back to the Keurig.<br /><br />p.s.  I would still like a good decaf option.  Right now I use the Gevalia Signature decaf and add a shot of Gevalia decaf espresso to jazz it up. 5
I've tried Illy cappuccino and it was tasty, creamy and a bit sweet. Having Illy espresso in the fridge to try I was ready for refreshment and some kick in taste and energy. This coffee drink went down the drain after 2-3 sips. I love lattes and I could drink hot fresh espresso, but this was just unbearable. VERY bitter, despite of having sugar it (and I don't sweeten tea and coffe). Also there is 50 calories in the can, not 45 (small difference), but fot many that count calories might matter.<br /><br />Anyway I wouldn't recommend Issimo espresso, unless you love very very bitter coffee. 2
This is a good shampoo with a pleasant, apple-y scent. I don't think a shampoo that claims to be for "color repair" should contain sodium laureth sulfate -- I'd rather have less lather and have my color last longer. That said, the lather is generous, and the shampoo left my hair feeling clean and not stripped of moisture.<br /><br />I ordered three shampoo/conditioner products from Amazon, and all three leaked during shipping. They were wrapped in plastic, so it wasn't a huge mess, but it would be nice if Amazon could find a way to ship shampoo without it leaking.<br /><br />I don't think this shampoo is anything special, and probably not worth paying extra for. 3
My dog has severe allergies, and I'm always looking for superior dog food to try on her.  I ordered Canidae Lamb and Rice canned formula; she really loves it, and she's quite picky.  It arrived quickly, and I'm very pleased, with both the service and the dog food. 4
While the overall idea behind the product is laudable, they blew it by using sucralose instead of pure trustworthy cane sugar. The sweetener leaves an aftertaste that to me, tastes disgusting and ruins what would have otherwise been an enjoyable and flavorful cup of cappuccino. Will not be ordering this product again (or anything else sweetened with sugar-free alternatives). 2
This is a sweet, mild flavored and lightly carbonated juice mix which is dominated by the flavor of apple juice and white grape juice.  These clearly make up at least 80% of this juice by volume. I was hoping for something with both more flavor punch and a more noticeable cherry flavor. I also prefer more carbonation than the very low level in this sparkling juice.  Instead this juice mix has a very light red or pink (blush) color due to the minimal amount of Acerola present (also called Barbados Cherry) followed by even less cherry juice.  To my taste, this juice mix has less zing and character than even a good non-alcoholic sparkling cider or sparkling grape juice.  What I look for in a sparkling beverage is a good sweet/sour contrast enhanced by the carbonation.  Instead the Switch folks have chosen to call a juice mix that is primarily apple and  grape juices "Black Cherry" when in fact it doesn't even have the flavor intensity of a good Black Cherry soda.<br /><br />If you enjoy a juice which is sweet without much tartness and with a low level of carbonation this is not horrible stuff by any means. I personally prefer stronger flavors and more carbonation.  What you are getting is primarily the taste of apple juice and white grape juice with just a touch of cherry flavor and color. Sparking juices are expensive and this one is no exception so overall I have no intent to get it again.<br /><br />While the marketing suggestion ("No Sugar Added" and "No Preservatives" is that the natural ingredients make these juices healthy that idea is negated by the high level of completely "natural" sugar in this or most any juice. The healthy alterative to overly sugared fruit juices is to have a glass of cold water and a piece of fresh fruit. Fruit has less calories than juice but overall more vitamins, minerals and fiber and a variety of natural antioxidants that most likely really are good for you. 3
This is my second favorite after the breakfast in bed flavor. I love Wolfgang Puck coffee. It's a little bolder then the breakfast in bed, but still smooth. 5
I have limited experience with sencha but I know what I like, and that is a fresh and somewhat flowery smooth taste.  I ordered this on a chance it would be good and am not disappointed. I followed the directions for water temperature and timing and I think that is important. I was then surprised at some immediate side benefits to drinking a few cups of this each day for the first two weeks I received it.  Without having changed anything else about my diet or health supplements, I noticed a minor skin rash that has plagued e for months began to diminish drastically.  It is not totally gone but is no longer noticeable to the casual observer and it has retreated significantly.  It is worth it for just this benefit alone.  I will reorder it but want to find larger quantities i the hope of getting a better price per ounce. 4
Dynasty brand green tea is the best green tea I've ever tasted.  It never tastes stale, unlike brands I've bought in grocery stores.  This is because each tea bag is packed in a sealed envelope with a metallic lining.  The metal apparently keeps out moisture. 5
Wow. Really weak and bitter taste. It tastes like a grassy pack of lipton tea. Disgusting. Its not black tea, its definitely not green. 3
Although these are fat free, they were much to sweet to my taste. Sugar can be just as bad as fat for you... but for being fat free, they are good for those of us who get an hunger attack for something wont make you feel TOO guilty. I can only take it in very small portions because of its sugar content. 3
This is the first Redued-Fat Peanut Butter that I have thought was a good peanut butter.  I will buy it again when this is gone. 5
I've tried an awful lot (and sometimes awful is just the right word) of ginger chews, candies, teas and brews (ginger is great for nausea).  This is the best ginger beverage I've tried yet.  It almost has the same flavor as ginger snaps.  My 4 and 6 year old loved it. 4
Fly traps were for a science fair experiment. They arrived promptly and were in very good shape.All approximately the same size-important for the experiment. 5
The first time I tried these, I thought, "WOW!" but I quickly found they were just too darn spicy and tart... Hard to enjoy the potato-chippiness of them when your mouth is under seige. 3
We use these crackers on a limited basis; they are great for packing in a picnic lunch when others will be having sandwiches, and they add crunch to split pea soup.  They are really great, however, in meat loaf if you can't have gluten -or- yeast, or in meatballs, or any other recipe that calls for crushed crackers. 4
We have a variety of treats for our two shitzus.  Their favorite are the freeze-dried livers.  Nice big container that always has the dogs running when they hear me opening the lid.  Bought two of these. 5
My local store frequently runs out of these. They are very tasty, and, wheat-gluten free. My "Pack of 12" shipping/handling is about $7.80 (30.8% of the item cost) to a major US Metro area. As I ordered two boxes which Amazon decided needed to come from two different distribution centers, I'm paying this rather high shipping/handling fee twice! Amazon does do groceries - but at what shipping and handling cost? 4
The title of this product is deceptive.  It says giant but they are only 1/4 of the size of the an actual GIANT pixy stick.  Be careful that you know which ones you order since they have the same name.  Read the size further down the page. 2
While certainly not as awful as Ginger People's ginger beer, I don't recommend it.  I love a good ginger beer, and this is all that my local grocery store carries and I still won't buy it.  To be fair, there are different styles of ginger beer and taste IS subjective.  But I can't help but feeling that something like Cock and Bull or Barritts is MUCH better and more "authentic".  (Although they are not nearly as natural.) 2
Last year I gave this along with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1845979125">Salt: Cooking with the World's Favorite Seasoning</a> to my foodie friends and family. They all loved it! The salt tubes were well packaged and I ordered 10 sets and had no broken tubes. The package also came with salt samples which I really appreciate. I have Collection Sets 1 and 2 on my counter and get lots of comments about them when people visit. 5
These are some of the best cookies I've found without allergens in them.  I love that they come individually packed so I can grab them to go or put them in my lunch. 5
I've read the reviews and I agree that Yuban is absolutely the best coffee but at $100 for 12 cans comes to over $8 a can.  That's $3 more a can than I pay at my local store.  I don't understand the high price? 1
I hope Amazon always carries this product too. I have ordered it twice. Excellent product for the price. Yum-O! 5
Not what we were expecting in a k-cup.  This is weak coffee that tastes like instant coffee.  There is a reason it is cheap - buyer beware!  I would have given it a negtaive rating if it was possible to do so. 1
I decided to try this tea based on the description and reviews, but found it weak, with little flavor. For reference, I like my tea very strong and normally buy the Davidsonas English breakfast tea. 3
I was excited to find Nana's line of gluten-free cookies, and have tried all the varieties that they offer. Of the various flavors and styles of cookies, these are my favorite. I find their individually packaged cookies (the large, round ones) to be way too heavy for one meal and end up splitting them for two snacks. These 8 pack cookies are the perfect size for a little snack or to keep in your purse. I can understand why some reviewers might not like these cookies because they do have a very healthy taste, and some might object to the texture of the berry crystals. I happen to like the berry crystals, and it's nice to eat a cookie that you don't have to feel dietary guilt over! A great "hearty" cookie that goes well with coffee or tea.  Also, I am gluten intolerant and have never had any negative reaction to these cookies whatsoever. In my opinion, a good product. However, because it is natural and doesn't have preservatives, the faster the item is shipped to you after packaging, the better. I have noticed that Nana's cookies do become more dry the longer you keep them around, even sealed. Probably a good idea to try this product before buying a case of it, because I have noticed that people either seem to love or hate the Nana cookies. 4
I love ginger in every form, so I was really looking foward to drinking this beverage.  I thought it was OK, but not that special.  The lemon flavor was good and the honey did add some sweetness.  But, I prefer a stronger ginger flavor. 3
These are deliciously soft and yummy. I could do without the nuts though!! They taste even better warmed up as well. 4
I love this brand of Dandelion Root tea.  The tea is so good for your health and keeps you regular.  Transaction went smooth like always.  So glad to hear Amazon may soon have home delivery of groceries to my door.  I have some disabilities that require someone to shop for me but I do a lot of it on Amazon.com 5
I purchased this product to be able to use my own coffee and tea in the Keurig. The product does what it says. The only drawback that I can tell exists is the expensive shipping. I'd also like to have some suggested measurements for coffee and tea to fill the cup. Perhaps a section on their website where people can just start recording their experiences with different amounts of product... Just my 2 cents. 4
For starters, I'm not salt or msg averse. I enjoy salty food like chips, jerky, and bacon. However, these pork rinds are ridiculously salty tasting. To give you a better idea of what I'm referring to, Kettle Chips Sea Salt variety have 55 mg of salt per 1/2 oz of chips. Lowrey's pork rinds have 310 mg of sodium per 1/2 oz serving. That's roughly six times the salt content of a food considered relatively salty by most people. I read a review on here saying that they were too salty and decided to order them anyway thinking the reviewer was some salt hating baby. Boy, was I mistaken. I wish I hadn't ordered these. 1
I do not like sour taste and this has a sour kind of taste which i don't like. The smell isn't that great either 1
I love metromint water, and I was really excited to try the new one. It tastes kind of like a minty bubble gum. It isn't bad, but it doesn't have the same intense mint flavor that makes the other ones so refreshing. 3
not as good as i expected from the ratings on here. they are not sweet at all & kind of too tart but has over 20 grams of sugar in 1 bar???  but they are made with raw, healthy ingredients so i will eat them. maybe i'll try another flavor next time. 3
This could be a nice beverage alternate to sodas, but with 33 grams of natural sugar it is worse than a soda pop.  The taste was unique and refreshing and not too sweet consider the amount of sugars.  Maybe it's the natural fruit juices that add to the sugar content.<br /><br />One thing that is not good is that the first and second ingredients are not kiwi or berry juice but apple and grape juice concentrates.  This add loads of sugar and calories, and, the 135 in this small can might be better spent elsewhere for us dieting officinados. But, the taste is fairly undefined and could be confused with others, like the cherry which I also got. 4
Getting 2 boxes of the Classic Twinings Earl Grey decaf k-cups for such a low price is awesome.  Love the taste of Earl Grey and the convenience of k-cups and autoship. 5
My husband has to limit the amount of sugar he takes in and these contain no sugar, and they taste great! 5
No...  I didn't try it myself and my dog loves eating it, but it smells like it has too much flavoring, seasoning and salt added. Smells like canned spam. Its mostly corn and mystery meats, but it has so much stuff added to make the dog like it that they become quite picky afterwards. This stuff is like human fast food. It's hard to feed them human grade dog food after they're given this stuff. Now, my dog spits out the all-natural kibble -which I assume he thinks tastes like cardboard after having his taste buds desensitized by all the salt. Kinda like a Pandora's box.<br /><br />The stool is softened soft serve ice cream consistency. After first week when he became accustomed to it, which was more runny.<br /><br />The price is good, but your dog will become more picky with blander foods afterwards. 3
This product is NOT lemon zest.  Bears no resemblance to lemon zest - does not look like lemon zest, does not smell like lemon zest, nor does it taste like lemon zest.  In fact the label says 'Contains granules of dehydrated lemon peel'.  The picture of lush, juicy lemons is hugely misleading and if I was able to give this product no stars, I would.  I thought I would give it a try, but the consistency of the rehydrated whatever it is was mushy, tasteless and without smell.  I did not risk putting it in my ginger cookies and had to make a quick trip to the store to get some real lemons.  Don't waste your money as I did. 1
I ordered this coffee because we were having guests for a week from out of town.  I knew they liked French Roast coffee.  Well it was a total success.  Great coffee and conversations.  Thanks. 4
These sea salted and peppered Cashews would make a great snack for the guys and gals that like Cashews.  I didn't really find anything about them remarkable, but I'm not a huge fan of Cashews. Also, I'm not sure that the  salt and pepper really added to the taste... I think they would've tasted fine without the extra spices.<br /><br />The Cashews themselves did seem like they were of high quality and fresh. So if you love Cashews (or nuts in general... no pun intended) you'll probably enjoy this product.  As for me, I'm enjoying the dark chocolate powdered Almonds made from the same company... much more. 4
Upon recommendation by a cousin, I decided to give it a shot. It turned out that this kibble is good--high protein source (even slightly higher than Blue Buffalo), good size (medium), smells delicious, but just too smoky. The color of the kibble is pretty dark, I guess it's overcooked. My dog, a Belgium Malinois, still likes it. But she loves Orijen better. Over the past year, we have tried many brands such as: Blue Buffalo, NutroMax, Purina (Beef), Taste of the Wild, Canidae, and Orijen. By far, Orijen seems to be the best. Second being Blue Buffalo--but I am suspecting that my dog is allergic to the ingredients in it--she has bad dandruff and dried skin. So I decided to try Nutromax and Purina--both are pretty decent good kibbles (based on the price). Canidae is almost as good as Blue Buffalo. I will see after I am feeding her with Taste and Orijen mix would help her skin and coat. Hopefully it works. We've tried so many things you can name: fish oil (the real one, not the pills), weekly grooming with application of moisturizer spray specially designed for dogs, real meat, and skin tablets. Will update about this later on. The only thing my dad doesn't like Taste of the Wild is that it's too smoky--almost plungent, not sure if it's healthy. Therefore, 4 star! btw, all the above mentioned kibbles except Purina and Nutromax are natural and grain free.<br /><br />Base on what I learned from my experienced German Shepherd Trainer, the following are good kibbles:<br /><br />1. Orijen<br />2. Go! Dry Dog Food, Natural Grain Free (haven't tried this)<br />3. Wellness = Blue Buffalo<br />5. Evo Red Meat 4
These things are just too darn cheesy. If you like a lot of flavor, you'll love these. Otherwise, you will overdose on their cheddary goodness. 3
Unfortunately the batch of Sumac I received had very little flavor to it at all. I expected it to have it's usual fresh, potent citrus flavor and instead it's mostly bland. I've added more than three times the usual dose to my dishes and I can still barely taste it. 2
When I saw this product on the shelf at Wal-Mart, I instantly tossed it into my cart (both medium and light roast).  I like to have a supply of different coffees on hand.  I immediately made a cup when I got home from the store.  Actually, I love the flavor.  It is easy on the tongue, and leaves the mouth refreshed.  I thought there was something odd about the K-Cup itself, different sound when shaken, and appeared to be empty after use!  I did some quick surgery on the Cup and realized that I have been duped.  While I would still drink this had it been advertised honestly, because it has great flavor, I do not care to reward dishonesty and deceptive advertising.  It seems that rather than conducting any research to find the best combination of flavors, they chose to use word-tricks and lies.  Shame on them! 2
El gastroenterologo pediatra recomendo este tipo de leche para mis hijos, ya que las demas formulas lacteas le causaban una alergia que les hacia vomitar. 5
While visiting my daughter in Seattle, WA she introduced me to these wonderful Wasa wafers (alliteration intentional).  I really like them and they are an ideal substitute for bread.  I couldn't find this product in the stores around Fresno, CA.  I decided to give Amazon a try and sure enough, they came through.  I subscribed to have shipments sent to my home quarterly and again Amazon came through.  You AMAZE me!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EUJLHE">Wasa Crisp 'n Light 7 Grain, 4.9-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 10)</a> 5
We love Annie's bunny crackers and cookies- in fact, pretty much every other product. These crackers were horrible, though. The saltine-type crackers taste very bad. 2
These are the best gluten free crackers I have had so far.  I saved $5.00 by buying them through amazon than buying them at the grocery stores. 5
Bought the Jumbo Greenies for my Black Lab. He loved them, but at $2.66 each they are way too expensive for regular use.  Didn't notice any difference in breath which was the primary reason for buying. 3
I probably should have my cats do this as they are the comsumers.  I was glad to see Amazon offer this as it has always been a favorite of my numerous cats and not easy to find in this area.  Of course, being contrary felines as soon as I ordered them on a monthly basis they quit eating it and I have cancelled my subscription..nothing wrong with the product, just finicky cats. 2
I was excited to try this product after reading all of the good reviews. I wasn't really impressed when my son tried the food. The consistency was WAY too thin, and my son would hardly eat the whole jar. I would recommend making your own baby food, or use the Gerber organic. 2
I thought I would purchase this product to try as it was economical.Well, I purchased 2 boxes.The K-Cups in the 2 boxes were empty. No coffee in them at all.I tried 2 cups and both just hot water,no coffee. Do not buy this product it is a rip-off. 2
I ordered the complete set of Totonac sugar free syrups and tested them out with my morning Kellogg's Eggo waffles.<br /><br />Some of the syrups are pretty good; others are really not my thing and I threw them out. My verdict/opinion is: Almond, Maple Syrup and Vanilla are pretty good; the Raspberry is okay (if you crave some fruit taste); but I couldn't handle the taste of the Blueberry, Butter Pecan, Caramel, Hazelnut and Vanilla Cinnamon.<br /><br />The syrup is not thick like most syrups on the market; it's more runny and I find myself pouring some syrup out on to a plate and then dipping pieces of torn waffles. 2
There is no other brand is comparable to this brand.  Whoever I gave the crackers to, would become addicted.  I keep order them over and over again. 5
My daughter thinks this tastes nasty, and I agree. She is sensitive to carrot, so I was looking for a food for travel that delivers protein but doesn't contain carrot. Though she eats homemade turkey and peas all the time, she wouldn't even take a full bite of this. I tasted a little bit, and I can see why. 1
This coffee smells amazing when brewed but is so weak that all flavor and aroma is lost if you put anything in it. I was hoping for a little more boldness and wouldn't recommend this to anyone who likes medium or dark roast coffee because they will be sorely disappointed. 2
Coffee drinkers tastes are wide and varied, like all coffee drinkers, I like my coffee a certain way, strong, black, with a touch a sweetness. This canned coffee drink is strong, black, but too sweet for me. I liked that it was more like coffee rather than a cream drink with some coffee mixed in, but the sweetness of it killed it for me. It wasn't terrible to the point of "I can't drink this" but it also wasn't so good that I would go out and buy it. I do love iced coffee though and I would consider buying an unsweetened version. I never let the coffee shop put the sweetener in my coffee, I want to do it myself to my taste and feel the same with a bottled or canned coffee such as this. I could tell there was a good expresso coffee flavor to this drink and would definitely like to try a plain version I could make to my own taste. 3
The claim that this is the best vanilla flavored coffee I have ever had is JUST NOT SO.  This product does not even taste like good coffee.  It does not smell like vanilla and does not even taste like coffee.  It is overpriced and terrible as far as I am concerned. 1
This was a good price for so much pepper.  It keeps me from having to keep buying pepper which is expensive at the stores. 4
THE CAN: The can itself says it's a "Super Energy, Supplement". Nothing about which flavor it is or is not. Sounds like they are trying to market to those that are addicted to 5 Hour Energy, Liquid Energy Berry, 2-Ounce (12 Pack) shots and the like.<br /><br />SMELL: Yes, I wanted to know how it smelled before I drank it. It completely smelled like I was about to drink a grapefruit drink. I'm personally okay with that but know others may not be too excited and wonder if it would have a bitter bite to it like grapefruit.<br /><br />TASTE: I was pleasantly surprised! Drinking the other brands there is always this "bite" that makes them sometimes hard to drink. This has the best flavor of them all!! And it did NOT taste like grapefruit, but sort of a fruit punch flavor.<br /><br />COST: Currently at $2.33 per can on Amazon (includes shipping), I guess the prices is average. But for about the same price I could get a grande house coffee with an extra shot of espresso from the overpriced Starbucks. I would still get a boost from Starbucks AND with less ingredients going into my body.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS: First three ingredients are: Water, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Citric Acid.<br />Really? The cheapest and one of the worst product to put in your body is, HFCS.<br />An easy Google search on the health dangers of HFCS will reveal that HFCS is related to health problems as weight gain, dental cavities, poor nutrition, and increased triglyceride levels, which can boost your heart attack risk. No thanks!<br /><br />The print on the can was very difficult to read, so I couldn't really tell you what other ingredients are in this thing. It does have an allergen warning of "Contains Soy".<br /><br />ENERGY BOOST: I'm use to having one(1) cup of coffee a day at that. So when I drank this I was wired within 15 minutes. It definitely had the boost!!<br /><br />OVERALL: Still nothing replaces healthy eating, exercise and a good night's rest for living a high energy life. But since we don't always get that, a supplement such as this drink does come in handy.<br />It taste great and gives a good boost, but at the cost of damaging ingredients. 3
this took way too long to get here but we love the pretzels! they are light and airy and delicious, and are always sold out at whole foods. 3
I picked up a box of this GoodEarth Caffeine Free Original tea at a discount store lately. I drank several cups. I was really impressed by the intensity of the flavor. How could it be so sweet with no sugar? If you look at the packaging it "looks" natural and healthy, but then read the ingredients - number three is "ARTIFICIAL FLAVOR." Considering that the order of the ingredient listing indicates relative percentage of contents, a significant portion of this tea is "Artifical Flavor." Which means what? What the heck is it made of? Who knows - this stuff is getting tossed in the trash and I'll never trust GoodEarth again. By the way, this is manufactured by Tata Enterprises out of India - you might want to do some research about them. 2
This is expensive for a 50 lb bag.  I looked around for a long time, found that it was the most economical at cos*co, one of the membership stores.  It isn't available at the regular warehouses, but at 'cos*co business' store.  You don't need to have a business membership card to go there.  Price - $ 14.21 for a 25 lb bag, I live in Phoenix, AZ and there is one such store near I-17 and Indian School road.<br />J 1
The Beaba Multiportion Freezer Tray is perfect for freezing baby food.  I made my own baby food for my two children, and this is a simple way of getting it done quick and easy.  Plus, it is easy to push the frozen portions out after freezing because the tray is flexible. 5
Whole family loves this hot chocolate. We went through the entire box in less than a week. It is smooth, creamy, chocolate delight. And if you combine it with a k-cup of coffee it makes a perfect cafe mocha! Must buy more, more, more... 5
well it was nice that they showed up early but they were all broken into itty bitty pieces. i didnt order pieces of cookies i ordered whole cookies. 2
Reasonable in price, tastes good.  Prefect for Keurig, which can be pricey.  We will probably buy this again.  It is mostly for the kiddos anyway! 4
I have to say that I was pretty excited about getting this tea.  The name and description sounded wonderfully healthy and quite tasty.  I am a big proponent of Green Tea and Aloe Vera juice, but this drink has way to many sugars.  19 grams of sugar is quite a bit of sugar to qualify as a healthy drink.  In all honesty, though, this company hasn't touted this as a "healthy" drink, but the inclusion of Aloe Vera made me assume that it was.  Its ingredients are water, cane sugar, green tea infusion, aloe vera, citric acid and passion fruit flavor.  It has a sweet flavor and added pulp of some sort.  I don't taste the tea at all, but rather it tastes like sugar water with pulp.  I just don't care for it at all.  Maybe it is just my taste buds, but this didn't do it for me at all. 2
Welcome to heaven, Judy.<br />What?<br />Yes, you have arrived.<br />What?<br />You are asleep now, thanks to Celestial Seasonings Sleepytime tea.<br />But I don't remember going to sleep.<br />My point exactly. That's why I call it heaven.<br />But who are you?<br />I am Sleepytime Judy and I am asleep.<br /><br />What welcome relief, knowing there is a pleasant, calming antidote to the stresses of a relentlessly busy mind that sometimes refuses to shut down. Just walk to the kitchen, put the kettle on, pull out a Celestial Seasonings Sleepytime teabag, place in a favorite cup--mine is a slender version of a Blue Willow cup, pour on water at just the boiling point, and wait for the tea to steep.<br /><br />Meanwhile, pick up the box--how many times now--and read the the words.<br />"100% Natural Herb Tea, Caffeine Free."<br />"a comforting blend of chamomile and spearmint creates a lullaby of tender flavor to soothe your senses..."<br />"...it lets you curl up under a quilt of flavor and quiet the tensions of your world..."<br />'The sweetest way I think of you is when the day is done.' Emily Dickinson<br />Ingredients: Chamomile, spearmint, lemon grass, tilia flowers, blackberry leaves, orange blossoms, hawthorn berries, and rosebuds.<br /><br />But before I take my cup back to bed, I look at the last panel of the box. There's papa bear asleep in his cozy chair in front of the fire, Mama is carrying the baby and holding the hand of another, taking them to bed. Through an open door one can see two little bears already asleep in their bed. All in all, a cozy room of happiness and warmth and the promise of sleep.<br /><br />I sip my cup of Sleepytime tea quickly, almost gulping. I have learned that if I sip my usual slow sipping, I will fall asleep only halfway finished. That is how efficacious the tea... really... is..... 5
whenever you buy these types of microwave meals you go into it not expecting much.  Often, they're not very flavorful and the pasta tastes llike cardboard.  Well this product didn't disappoint.  The sauce was rather bland and eating the noodles was like eating paper. Quite honestly I would never try this again. 2
Very smooth and rewarding to have a decaff that does not bite the taste buds. Simply an enjoyable coffee. dz 5
The gingerbread house comes pre-assembled. The problem with that is that ours came broken in about 10 places. Basically unusable. 1
The stargazer lillies in this bouquet have an amazing scent that fills a room, which the recepient told me was "heavenly". They live quite long when cared for properly, but it's important to remember that these particular flowers ship in bud form -- on delivery day, they aren't like the picture on the page here, but will reach that point in 3 or 4 days' time. Take that into account and plan ahead.<br /><br />The reason to choose this one over the standard version is the extra stems of the stargazer lillies because, as I mentioned earlier, the scent they carry is fantastic (the more the merrier!). 5
service was great, but I meant to buy Swiss Chalet chicken SAUCE not the Marinade :)<br /><br />Love the sauce - have yet to try the marinade 5
The texture of the bar is good, like all Lara Bars.  The flavor on the other hand was gross.  One of my children likened it to "Chewing on a rotten Banana Peel". 2
Smiles... Thank you Lord, for I have found another healthy snack food that is unsalted, and tastes great. I almost gave up on finding a potato chip like this. The only thing i would ask Kettle to change is the texture. It's slightly hard/crunchy, but not a problem at all. I would just prefer it to be softer. Kettle if you do make that happen, please keep everything else the same. Thank you. 5
This toy is not so good if the treats or kibble is too big.....  even small kibbles have a hard time getting out of the jug.  I think this toy needs to be re-designed----My dog kept trying to pick up the jug from it's base so he can tip it up side down but the jug was too big to be picked up and made of slippery plastic (he's a Newfoundland with a big mouth).  He learned how to dump the food out with empty soda bottles that I would put kibble in.  It took a long time for him to get his food out and then at the end when there was only a little left he didn't want to play anymore because they would not come out.  I think I will either take the rope out or drill a small hole at the tid of the jug to make it more fun. 3
Just returned an unopened bag to local pet supplier who kindly took it back.<br /><br />A couple of our cats seem to like it at first, but soon lost interest in it for some odd reason. I did keep it airtight as suggested by the pet store.<br /><br />I've since switched to dry cat food that contains no fruits,  vegetables, corn, wheat, or soy & all 5 cats are happy as all get out. My new consultant is a homeopath for small animals and she said to avoid all canned cat food, and all but 3 dry cat foods, as all contain ingredients which are toxic to most cats, and especially those with immune-compromised systems. (avoid fruits/veggies/herbs in particular)<br /><br />And why the  acidolphilus?<br /><br />Bottom line: the cats didn't like it and too expensive to keep throwing uneaten bowlfuls of it out. 3
I must be doing something wrong because I feel this coffee is way too strong for a single 8oz. cup of coffee.  But, I bought it so I'm shoveling some of the coffee out of the container before I put it in my Rival single cup maker (which has no piercing device).  Some have called this a full bodied medium roast coffee; I call it strong.  The cups are more rounded on the bottom but they do fit in my device.  I'll use up the ocffee and then try something even milder as this is too strong for my taste buds. 3
I haven't used this product, but people seem to be slightly in the dark about how to acquire orange flower water without difficulty or great expense, so here it is.  Think outside the box and go to an Indian or Pakistan grocer.  They'll have super-cheap, big bottles of decent rose and orange flower water for a few bucks.  This is really not the kind of thing you have to throw money at unless you're in a small or non-diverse area. 1
We made this purchase based on our daughter's recommendation and it is as good as she promised. We have a new flip-style waffle iron and this mix provides us with a wonderful breakfast. We add fresh strawberries or blueberries to the top along with syrup and it is scrumdiddlyumptous! 5
Sometimes I feel when I reach for a decaffeinated K-cup that I'm going to settle for less flavor. However, I'm completely happy with this product. I don't feel I'm missing anything. Everyday I treat myself to a relaxing cup of coffee after work before starting dinner. This product just fits  what I'm looking for. 5
The taste is not great, but it's bearable. I could not get used to the smell, the unfinished box is still sitting in my drawer and I've no plans to stock up in future. 2
This Kitchens of India discount purchase was disappointing. It is lacking in taste and texture.  While the product has a lot of salt, I stilll found it rather tasteless.  The curry's texture was not pleasant.  Many curries that I enjoy most are thick and have a tomato paste type texture.  This one was watery with semi-mashed up chunks of vegetables.  It was not pleasant on the tongue and even combining it with rice and naan did not make it something I would want to eat again.<br /><br />This product is packaged in the ever-popular pouch inside of a box. I don't really like pouches because the contents are usually difficult to remove. True to my previous experience with pouches, I had to use a spatula to remove the contents that had stuck to the pouch's walls. Another reason for my disdain of pouches is they are not typically recyclable.<br /><br />Nutritionally, this product is lacking.  Each container has 2 1/2 servings and a serving is about ? cup.  So, let's look at the numbers for a container, which would realistically serve two people when paired with rice, naan, or vegetables; the total fat per container is 37.5 grams, total sodium is 2300 mg, total saturated fat is 6.25 grams, total carbs of 40 grams.<br /><br />I've found Kitchens of India products to be hit or miss in terms of taste.  I like Jyoti products (come in a can for the most part) MTR products (come in a pouch) better.  Disclaimer: While some Jyoti products (their saag, for example) are healthy, MTR products are typically full fat but at least they taste better.<br /><br />This product is vegetarian but not vegan.<br /><br />This product is made in India.<br /><br />If you really want to try this product and only want one pouch, consider iherb.com.  You can use code LEK375 for a discount. 2
This burger is OK. You can do better at a local store. Omaha's steaks are good.<br />Buy the steaks. 2
The variety pack has two flavors and styles of cat food. Chicken Pot Pie:  be careful when you open the can because it is mostly filled with liquid that could easily spill out. it seems to be little square bite size (for cats) pieces of a chicken-like item, in a broth, mostly broth. Each of my cats, one of whom is a fairly picky eater, both seemed to enjoy this food and ate it straight way. Seemed to enjoy I say, since it turns out my picky eater was actually only lapping up the "soup" or the sauce, and leaving behind the 8 or so little bits of meat like substance (it could actually be chicken, sure looked like it). And frankly, even with the manufacturer's recommendation of what would amount to 6 or more cans a day for my larger 12 lb cat, just not enough food there to satisfy him, mostly liquid.<br /><br />Chinese Chicken: Once again, fairly saucy, but with a much higher meat:sauce ratio, with what looked like a fair amount of shredded chicken. Once again, my picky eater just lapped up the sauce, and my other big guy, who eats anything, really was not interested, no matter how hungry he was.<br /><br />And please tell me why there are little tiny chunks of carrots in each of these? Cats have no interest in carrots, do they have some need for Vit A that is not fulfilled in the supplementation of this food? I doubt it, that is in there for us humans... stupid.<br />I gave this two stars instead of one, because one of my cats quite liked the sauce. 2
This is a very good gluten free pasta, you need to cook with it a couple of times to get your cooking method right but it is worth the learning curve.  Use plenty of water to cook it. 4
I read other reviews before buying and they are not encoraging.. But still for some reasons, I got  to buy (to use my amazon gift card).  But then I am very happy with the purchase. Delivery is prompt. Quantity is correct . Over all a few bucks savings than you buy at a retail shop. 5
I haven't ever had any actual Mallomars, so I thought I'd give them a try since there was nothing else good in the newsletter.  I like chocolate and marshmallow and cookies, so this should have been good.  They might be if you buy them from a real store.  The box I got though tasted stale.  The chocolate had that white stuff on it and the cookies were kind of dried out.  Some were broken from the shipping too.  So my advice would be if you want some Mallomars to get them fresh from the store and don't buy them off a website. 3
Ive been looking for this brown rice tea like forever! I just can't seem to find this in the groceries so i didn't hesitate getting one when i found out it was on amazon. thank goodness! it's so YUMMY! it feels like I'm in Japan 5
The Kili drink (Ginger, honey and lemon) was pretty good for what it was. Nothing over the top and nothing to complain about. Some might prefer ginger tea so they could control the sweetness level themselves, but it wasn't too sweet as is. Good with a little milk too. Tasted good cold and hot. Since many of the reviews did give the drink a poor rating, I suggest looking at a few reviews to better know if it would appeal to someone new to the drink. 4
The smell and taste of the Lickety Stik was an instant success with our dog.<br />But the dispensing ball dosen't move easily, very much of the time,<br />and it's a nuisance for us to keep helping the ball turn for our dog to get this treat.<br />We get more on our hands then our Golden gets in his mouth.<br />When we try to turn the ball for our dog, even we find it difficult.<br /><br />The roller BALL is a concern, we don't consider it 'pet safe'.<br />If our Golden Retriver got this bottle,<br />he could easily bite this roller ball out and would try to eat it.<br /><br />The ball requires a strong tounge to move it, even at that it gets stuck.<br />We can't imagine this stik being at all compatible with small dogs.<br />If you squeeze the bottle to force the liquid out around the ball<br />most of that drops to the ground between licks.<br /><br />This would be a great idea if it worked, and was truely 'pet safe'. 2
I'm not too sure about some of the negative reviews.  This is a good, basic, beef jerky.  Thicker than some, but good tender strips of meat.  Not hard to chew at all, good taste and an overall solid value.  Definitely beats some of the brands available at your local grocery. 4
I ordered the review product but got another product instead and consequently cannot comment.<br /><br />Horatio Dias 2
These Chips Ahoy cookies are not very appealing nor appetizing.  When we first opened up the package, we noticed the majority of the cookies were broken or in crumbles.  One of them even looked like it had a bite taken out of it.  You can't always judge a cookie by its appearance, so we tried a few.  The exterior is soft and the fudge inside isn't bad.  But it just didn't mesh well together and it won't be a cookie you crave.<br /><br />The other negative is that each cookie is fairly small and contains 75 calories, which is pretty high considering the size.  You can get other chocolate desserts that will bring you more satisfaction at lower calories. 2
These are weird tasting in a way I can't really figure out; I think it's the honey that's off. Regardless, there are better honey glazed/roasted cashews out there. 3
Salt and vinegar chips are definitely my favorite type of any potato chip. These ones made by Kettle were very tasty and I enjoyed them thoroughly. I just wish there was a more healthy option with the same great taste. 4
If you are looking for a nutty snack that is not too sweet, this might be for you.  My husband and I both tried them.  He thinks this is more of a 5 star item.  He liked the fresh nuts with just a bit of a cocoa taste, and though I liked them, I would say they are maybe in the three star category, because I was hoping for something slightly sweeter.  We both liked that the coating was not a "come off in your hand" kind of variety that makes you look for something to wipe your hands on.<br /><br />We both enjoyed them though I don't know that I would purchase them for myself again.  Nothing wrong with them, just not sweet enough for me.  I would however purchase for my husband.<br /><br />As with any nut product, they are high in fiber and the good kind of fat, but you don't want to dip into too many if you are dieting as they run 150 calories for 1/4 cup, so portion accordingly. 4
I am actually surprised at how good this product is. I am a Cuisinart Keurig owner with two teens that love to drink hot cocoa and cider pretty much year round.<br /><br />Price point: The price for these at the store ( exact brand ) is almost triple of what we pay here for the same amount, with subscribe and save this makes these quite affordable for my family use. In comparison to other more expensive brands it's a great bargain without sacrificing quality over quantity.<br /><br />Flavor wise: My kids love it, and have already asked me to purchase more. My daughter says that the peppermint is right on and not too weak even if using a larger cup. I love the dark chocolate in my coffee to make a mocha ( 10oz coffee to 4 oz chocolate ) and it's much better than some other brands that I have tried in the past.<br /><br />Overall impression:  Great value, good flavor, excellent price point I will be purchasing more. 5
These bags are supposed to compost away after being used, however they also decompose while being used causing leaks in the bin. Quite messy when removed from bin. 2
I guess I've never had roasted pecans before.  My experience has been whatever is on the shelf at the grocery store, which have been raw.<br /><br />Roasting imparts a distinctly different flavor and texture.  These pecans are kinda dry and brittle (not like raw pecans, which are a little bit oily and chewy).  And I prefer the flavor of raw pecans - the roasting imparts a kinda smokey flavor that doesn't work (for me) with pecans (almonds are a different matter).<br /><br />I have bought other products from Azar - always top quality.  No doubt these pecans would be top-rated by people who prefer roasted pecans.  If that's what you like, buy these nuts!<br /><br />But if you are looking for typical grocery-store raw pecans, look elsewhere.  I didn't think that roasting would matter very much - but it makes a HUGE difference. 4
This is one of the few products I would buy even if I could have wheat products.  The cookie is not a "soft" type cookie.  I've had good luck with shipping, they are packaged well from the factory, and amazon does a fair job in packaging for shipping. 5
Tastes like drinking a cherry pie. I purchased this for my mother's gout and she told me it works quickly. It's also supposed to help lower blood pressure. Speedy delivery. It's not 5 stars because of the high price. 4
These are alright.  Def. have to rinse them the odor is not pleasant.  The texture is strange a little chewy. They are filling and need to be spiced up with something.  Not sure if I will buy again. 3
No disappointments with this coffee. I have always been fond of Melitta coffee and this lived up to their great reputation, although a bit pricey. 4
You know that bitter after taste you get while eating Kashi or drinking Almased?<br />Yup just as gross as that- & I love Kashi, don't get me wrong.<br />Tried it a few different ways: fat free milk, soy milk, vanilla & chocolate SlimFast, filtered Water...<br />Just like Alamsed, that nasty taste cannot be tamed.<br />My taste buds simply disapprove!<br /><br />If you are looking for high protein diet source, I am taking a Multi-Vitamin every day, eating MetRx meal replacement bars: Apple pie flavor washed down with a bottle of Slimfast for breakfast & again for Lunch. Drinking water & eating plain veggies as in between meal snacks followed by a light Dinner of less than 600 calories. I walk the track every other day & have managed to lose 14 pounds in 2 months without ever going to the gym.<br />Good luck to everyone out there. 2
I received Old Country licorice in a gift basket for Valentine's day and fell in love. I ordered it in the 4/ 1 lb. tubs shown here and received it this past week. It is not soft, in fact it is a bit on the tough side. If you are considering making an order, wait for the bags. I do not think that the tubs are airtight. 1
I was surprised when eating these bars (which I did, happily), that they were much more fruity than you would have thought. I mean heck, these are chocolate almond bars, and yet they taste like dates (dates are listed as one of the first ingredients, for goodness sake!).<br /><br />Basically, if you like chewy, chocolatey, fruity-tasting brownie bars, you're in for a treat! 4
If you are trying to get off sugar, this is the product for you. I has a great sweet taste without spiking your insulin, and no bitter aftertaste.  Great for diabetics and anyone trying to eat healthy.  I love this product. 5
First of all, I'm a licorice fiend - and not the so-called licorice typically sold in the US.  I grew up in Sweden with the real deal - I even bought ultra-bitter licorice sticks from the pharmacy, back when they sold that.<br /><br />My favorites range from Malaco to Fazer - with ammonium chloride filled licorice candy like Turkish Pepper at the top.<br /><br />Bassett's is the substitute of choice in the US - not much available here.<br /><br />With that said, here's what I thought about Gustaf's - and I bought a whole case.  It's too flat, it hits a very narrow band of licorice flavor - something missing to make it bloom.<br /><br />Great chewability, lots of licorice flavor, but no depth - if that makes sense to you.  Most other licorice versions that I like hit a much broader range.<br /><br />It's worth a try, but I suggest that you make this a small portion of a mixed plate of various licorice types. 3
K-cups are marginally better than good coffee that I can buy at the store for 1/2 the price or less. This product was offered at $19.95 and I was willing to purchase it but it immediately went up to $26.95. It is not really worth $19.95 and is certainly not worth any increase. Additionally, what's the deal on offering INSTANT COFFEE in K-cups for $15.99 leaving us to think it's a good deal on REAL coffee. Do you want to lose our trust (business)???? That's a good way to do it!!!!!!!!!!<br />jb 3
This oatmeal is a good choice on very busy, cool mornings. I make it with a little less water than recommended, and it's ready in 60 seconds. The serving size is good, the oatmeal's not overly sweet, and I like the maple/brown sugar flavor.<br /><br />On the con side, the oat size is too small for my preferences. Some other brands have larger pieces. I've found a few pieces of the scratchy part in my bowl, now and then. And the flavor isn't all that well distributed even after I stir well. 3
I have been making black tea in my bodum iced tea pitcher and wanted to try a nice loose green. This one works perfectly. It has a mild taste that is very fresh. 4
I am of the curious sort when it comes to dog treats and new ways to reward dogs so I jumped at getting this product.<br /><br />Lickety Stick arrived and three dogs were eagerly sitting in front of me; a cocker spaniel, a norwegian elkhound, and an australian shepherd.<br /><br />I unwrapped the stick and squeezed a little juice out of the tube onto the roller. I presented it to all three dogs. The cocker spaniel and the aussie eagerly licked away. The aussie licked away so much the cocker needed a wet cloth over the top of her head due to dropping juice on her head. The elkhound however, wanted no part in it.<br /><br />After a couple days of using it and trying it out I am left with the premise that it's an interesting take on a a dog reward - but in the end, the execution and possibility of making a mess leave this treat stuck in the treat drawer. I don't see myself buying these in the future. 2
Tastes like cat food and has a similar consistency. The other mixer flavors are much better. 1
This coffee is good. I have tried a lot of hazelnut coffees and this is one of the best I got from amazon. It has a darker and richer flavor than most hazelnut coffee. It was fresh and tasty and the price was great at about $6 per pound with subscribe and save. I will order it again 5
I added it sliced into sauteed veggies and onions.  Made a delcious appetizer - no real cooking and great lunch and dinner for myself. 4
I was disappointed to find out that the LIDS of Earth's Best jarred foods are coated with an epoxy lining that contains BPA :(<br />I thought I was avoiding the whole BPA issue because these are in glass rather than plastic containers. If it's in the lids, it's going to get in the food as the food moves around in the jar during packaging, shipping, storage, etc. I was planning on being a devoted Earth's Best jarred food user because it was organic and in glass, but then I found out about the BPA. As a note, if BPA doesn't bother you, most of Earth's Best food is tasty enough- but there are tastier out there, like Plum. 1
To everyone worried about not getting a full cup to run through your machine with these k-cups, here's the trick.  Put it in your machine, close the lid, open the lid, turn 90 degrees, close the lid and repeat two more times.  You should have closed the lid on the k-cup four times by now.  Next step is to hit the brew button.  The problem is the needle is too small to run the chocolate through.  With the extra three holes it all flows out very quick and turns out good.  Would have given them five stars if it was able to run through the needle like it is supposed to.  Could have been a little thicker overall, but not bad. 4
I have tried using this product with my new son and it has brought mixed results.  I recommend that when using this product with your baby that you exclusively use it during a feeding without mixing in breast milk or another formula.  On more than one occasion my son has spit this right up or just plain thrown it all up.  I'm not sure if this is because it is a water mixed formula, being a powdered formula, or because of the mixing.  Some of the time he seems to keep it down and be alright, but I have discontinued use of this product in favor of another Enfamil product - the milk-based ready-to-go 6-pack bottles with nipples.  Those ready-to-go bottles are much better than this powder formula you mix with water, although more expensive.  I would really really recommend sticking to breast feeding ladies because my son craves his mom's milk and goes right to sleep, happy as can be.  However, I understand that breast feeding may not always be possible so that is why I would like to direct you to find a milk-based formula instead of this water/powder mix.  I think your baby will much happier! 3
Cause this stuff has it, Lea & Perrins doesn't!<br /><br />But thats not why I'm rating this so low. It gets two stars because its terrible,<br />a thin watery pitiful substitute for L&P that does no justice to any dish, and<br />especially not to a Bloody Mary.<br /><br />Heinz is a pretty good brand name, I have never understood why they cant get this<br />right. Check it yourself, pull a bottle from the shelf, turn it upside down and see<br />how quickly it runs down the sides leaving nothing behind. I suppose if you cooked<br />this down to about a 60% solution it would be ready to use, but right out of the<br />bottle its a pretty weak substitute for real Worcestershire sauce. I did have a<br />bottle of this that I fortified with a Tsp of anchovy paste and it tasted much better. 2
As someone who has been at this for a very long time...wheat free that is... I have tried dozens and dozens of gluten free cookies.<br />A cookie-a-holic I have to have my morning coffee with a cookie.<br />Up until this point most of the gluten free cookies have been huge disappointments..<br />I have thrown more practically full boxes of cookies in the trash than I care to remember...they were just not worth the calories, they were that bad.<br />I do like Pamela's brand Biscotti cookies...but they are the only other cookie I've found good enough to spend the money on.<br />And lets face it prejudice abounds in the gluten free aisle...everything is outrageously expensive.<br />But these..they are lovely, crunchy, no grainy texture, no strange after taste, vegan, low calorie and low fat...actually a miracle of a cookie.<br />Most gluten free cookies are loaded with fat...and as I limit fat content that was another big draw back.<br />No problem here though, only 1.5-2 grams of fat per 4 cookie serving.<br />I have tried all 4 flavors and each is excellent, I don't think any would disappoint. 5
If you're a fan of full-bodied coffees, give this one a shot.<br /><br />For my taste, the vast majority of k-cups are too watery and weak (even on the small cup setting), so I gravitate towards the extra-bold varieties.  I had previously been enjoying Newman's Own Extra Bold and GM Dark Magic.  After reading some favorable comparisons between those and Mahogany, I decided to give it a chance.<br /><br />I find that it's slightly less bitter (not that bitter is bad) than Newman's EB or Dark Magic, and a little smoother.  I also think it's more full bodied without any burned bean flavor.  I've tried the Mahogany on the larger cup setting and actually still liked it -- something I've never said before. 5
I highly recommend the hearty satisfying Chia seeds, for a snack or a meal, packed with protein and fiber - I often add it to waffles and other recipes! 5
I was taking a break from my regular coffee, and took one of my wife's Stash Green Chai Tea packs. Very pleasantly surprised. Would recommend without hesitation, and have since added it to my rotation of hot drinks. 4
I was excited about buying these in bulk at the special price Amazon was offering. However, when I received my case of 24 8 oz bags (purchased 2 sets), I was extremely disappointed to see a use by date of 1 month later.  Even more so, when I tasted them, and like a few others pointed out, they have a very distinct burnt taste.<br /><br />Pretzels last just about forever. Realizing these are organic would allow for a shorter shelf life, but the real issue is that the shelf life was used up before the sale. So, in short, these were essentially a waste of money as I had to coax people to take them away. 1
the smell of spices from this tea is awesome, but the tea itself is weak, if you try to let it soak in the cup for extra seconds it will leave bitter taste,I tried to  add a packet of lipton tea but the taste still bitter, so<br />I'm still practicing with it, it also didn't work with half&half, not much with coffee mate. nothing like the original or made from scratch.<br /> MY RECOMMENDATIONS: since it is huge quantity that you can't return, try one package from the store first and see if it works for you. 3
I love this sauce. Sweet but hot too. I use it on checken wings instead of buffalo sauce and with pan seared scallops, shrimp. It's very versitile and delicious! 5
My father could no longer take care of his beloved 6 year old Cocker Spaniel, so I decided to take her into my family. When I brought her to NYC she had ear and eye discharge. She was also  slightly overweight. After a check up with a vet that ruled out infection, I decided to try Royal Canin based on the numerous good reviews.Within a week her ear and eye problems were gone and she dropped a good amount of weight. This is going to be the only food that we will be feeding her! 5
I love ginger in general & I really like ginger tea, so I expected good things from this drink mix. I was disappointed. The mix dissolved instantly, which was great. The first sip was almost okay, but the flavor seemed to get stronger and less pleasant with every sip. Neither the ginger nor the lemon nor the honey came through. All of thr favors were dark and muddy. The  drink itself was murky, cloyingly sweet & medicinal. It really reminded me of Thera-Flu, which is fine if you have a bad cold and will suffer a kinda awful drink because you know it will knock you out right away. But I wouldn't drink Thera-flu for pleasure, and the same holds true for this drink. I couldn't even finish the cup. 1
This is distinctly different than Gran Riserva!  While this is good balsamic vinegar, it is not great.  We had previously purchased Fattoria Estense's Gran Riserva in the short squat bottle (same # of oz)and it was amazing.  This vinegar is much sharper and thinner.  It does not have the thick sweet quality of the Gran Riserva.  The Gran Riserva you could easily serve on ice cream - this, no. 2
Love this tea. Has a very mild flavor but that's enough for me. Received some as a Christmas gift a few years ago. Been addicted ever since. Just can't find it in a store any more. Have to order it here. 4
When I opened the back, the overwhelming alcohol based like smell was extremely disturbing.  After brewing, the alcohol smell has been cleared, yet the hazelnut flavor is not as good as I expected.  Too bad, I can't return food item due to amazon's policy.  I will go back to San Francisco Bay Hazelnut Creame coffee beans. 2
The idea for weight management foods is great, but I never like them.  I love the regular of this type of oatmeal and made the mistake of ordering such a big quantity of this assuming the family and I found like it.  We dont.  It is not the same and has that same artificial sweetener taste I cannot stand in diet foods.  I'd rather be overweight and enjoy my food... but if you arent as picky as I am, maybe you'll like this.  Buy a smaller quantity first thought to be sure. 2
Tastes great, but MSG? Really? I will have to make my own stock or find a company that does not use this unhealthy ingredient. C'mon Knorr, you can make a fantastic bouillon without it! 1
I am not happy with Gerber at all.  I researched their products and they do not have to list ingredients if below a certain percentage.  (LIKE IF GREEN BEANS WERE MADE ON A CONVEYER OF WHERE RICE WAS MADE AND THE RICE WAS UNDER A CERTAIN AMOUNT TRACED THEY DO NOT LIST IT ON THE INGREDIENTS).  The beans I did not know have fish oil in it.  It is now listed on the product ingredients. 1
I took my 10 year old cat in to the vet today for his yearly check up.  Turns out my cat is the picture of health, but needs to drop about 2 pounds.  The vet recommended I switch my cat over to this cat food. I checked it out at the store, but after reading the ingredients I thought this can't be right.  First, its labeled for cats up to 6 years old, second it appears to be jammed will fillers, and third, its rather pricey.  I'm glad I came home and started researching this product and reading about others experiences with this food, and I'm definitely not feeding this stuff to my cat! 1
Very good flavor and texture. Excellent wholesome snack. One of the best all natural oatmeal cookies I've ever tried. Plus, all natural ingredients. 5
Wolfgang Puck Hawaiian Hazelnut Coffee for Keurig brewer.  Good medium strength coffee with Hazelnut flavor. Full-body, enjoyable anytime of the day. I really like this coffee. 5
I don't know why in the world they do this, but once again the inadequate packaging resulted in the bottom half of the box with broken shells.  Crushed to oblivion to be exact.  They are replacing them no problem, but really, people, just package them better and you won't have to replace them!  UPDATE:  Just got my replacement and once again tons of broken shells.  Aggravated!  No fragile marking whatsoever and just thrown into the box.  Idiots win 1
Tea is OK in flavor but not as<br />earthy as some. The Teavana<br />blend is much stronger with greater<br />fragrance and more molasses and<br />chocolate flavors. Pu-erh is<br />expensive and this tea is at the<br />high end. 3
I purchased a sampler package which included the Phat Beets.  I found the spices used overwhelmed the taste of the beets to the point that you could not taste the beets. 2
These taste wonderful!  Guilt free if you can stop at one bag.  Will definitly buy again! 5
I can hardly contain my excitement so I had to post a review. My baby is almost 17 months old. When she first started solids at around 6 months, she was adventurous and tried and ate everything, including a great amount of veggies. When she turned a year old, she got really fussy and turned her little nose up at every single veggie we tried to give her. She would only eat fruit and yogurt with her cereal in the morning and for the rest of the day she would only accept meat. This has been going on for so long now that I began to get really really worried that she wasn't getting enough good nutrition. I had seen Ella's pouches, but hadn't tried them. A friend highly recommended them to us this weekend so I figured we should try it. I decided to go full on veggie and try this flavor (spinach, apple, rutabaga), and just give them away if she really hated it.<br /><br />Ok, so I'm only giving it 4 stars just in case things change, BUT i tasted one just now and thought, yuck, ok, this is REALLY strongly spinach flavored, she is NOT going to eat this, but I gave her the pouch and she gobbled it DOWN! She was still trying to get some out of the empty pouch! I can't believe it. I'm a very pleased mama. My fussy baby ate spinach, woohoo! :)<br /><br />I'll see how things go over the next few pouches, but so far I recommend them for fussy eaters. If she continues to like this one, I will try a few more. Thanks Ella's kitchen! 4
The seller did a very good job with packaging.Only thing is that the producer company filled the big jar with a half of stevia powder.In this size 2 pound could fit.But this is not the sellers fault!!!!!They are honest,and reliable shop.Nice to deal with! 4
I like this tea. It's very fruity, even more so than expected. Almost berry like. But it's not a taste I can take all the time. But I don't regret having bought this tea. Good one to have around. 4
Reminds me of grandmas kitchen early morning on a cold day. Great aroma, some after taste, not bitter. Good coffee. 4
Not bad for a prepackaged and quickie meal. If you're looking for authentic Thai, this will give you only half the flavor, so the name that it is only a taste of Thai is quite accurate. Cartons are fancy, but big for the amount they hold. It is definitely enough for a meal, but if you're looking for a full takeout carton of food to eat, you had better grab two. It is tasty enough for a meal, but if you can get yourself to an authentic Asian supermarket, I guarantee you will find much tastier options that are also quick and easy to make with more substance and flavor and at a much lower price (ie 6 boxes of noodles for $6) - and I'm not talking about Cup O' Noodles or things you find at American supermarkets. But overall, my husband and I, being the noodle-mongers that we are, did enjoy these as something new for the palate. However, we will probably opt to order Thai takeout for fresh noodles next time we have a craving. 3
Our dogs love this stuff and we keep it in the motorhome and on the boat to eliminate the bulk and waste of cans.<br /><br />The only issue I have is that I can buy Old Roy from Walmart for 1/2 the price and it is the exact same prpduct.<br /><br />That being said, the box is heavy and they do leave it at the top of my 23 steps to the house. 3
These used to be pretty good.  Some stores used to keep them in a refrigerated case - I suppose to keep them fresh.  I had the impression they were shipped here (Florida) from some place up north like New York City.  Now they are apparently made by a franchise bakery somewhere nearby.<br /><br />Now they are kept on the bread shelves near hamburger buns where we shop.  I don't know if they absorb flavors from the other buns.  Probably not, but they taste somewhere half way between a hamburger bun and what an English muffin used to taste like.<br /><br />I wish I could find some good tasting English muffins, but these aren't them. 2
Why can't they promote this product honestly?<br /><br />It's not a *bad* product. I didn't find it actually objectionable. It's mildly sweet, and has a sort of nondescript, chocolate-simulating flavor. On its own merits, If I were in a really great mood I might even give it four stars in spite of its relative synthetic blandness and the lack of peanut butter or any resemblance to its flavor. They've actually accomplished something fairly worthwhile in creating a frozen dessert with so few calories, and I'd give it some appreciation on that basis.<br /><br />But ... "ice cream replacement"?  "Smooth and creamy"?  It is neither of these, by any estimation. It's an "ice cream replacement" only in the sense that yogurt or pudding or a ham sandwich are -- as things one might eat instead of ice cream. It's objectively not "smooth", and anyone expecting it to be (for example, because they read the label) is going to be highly upset to find that it is instead gritty and grainy, so much so that it actually makes sound when you pass a spoon through it, similar to scooping packed wet sand. It has a mouthfeel more like a poorly-made sherbet; the ice crystals are large enough that you can almost see them. This doesn't mean it can't be "good" -- snow cones are super gritty with huge ice crystals and they're still well-liked.<br /><br />Overall, it was okay. I definitely like that I can eat small amounts of this stuff even on a keto diet. I think they've got a good product idea, and it deserves a slot on the shelf next to the other frozen desserts.<br /><br />But, a note to the Arctic Zero folks -- celebrate your product and promote it for what it IS. Why spoil your efforts by lying about what you've made? 2
This bread tastes great and keeps well, but it is way too sweet for anyone with a sensitive gut or recovering from CD.  Cane sugar is the 3rd ingredient! (Can make you gassy too, though maybe that is the xanthum gum.) Anyway, our gfcf household is looking for another brand. 3
Rocky looks forward to getting the chews.  I hope they are helping with his oral hygiene. 4
its more expensive than the rest but let me tell you....great quality, easy to clean, to use and works great cuz i have the meals ready to go....WELL PRESERVED 5
This is probably my favorite k-cup so far. I'm no professional taster so talk of flavor notes in coffee or elsewhere usually leaves me scratching my head and thinking, "if you say so...". But at my first sip of this dark, smooth coffee, I though chocolate. It's not flavored or sweet but, for me, it has a "note" of good, dark chocolate. Highly recommended if you like your coffee strong and full of flavor. 5
two cans were horribly dented. I did not contact seller, not worth the hassle. will see how the next shipment goes. the un-dented cans were, as expected, delicious.<br />should the next ones come in where i have to dispose of half , i will cancel subscription 2
I didn't like this coffee at all.  I like strong, full-flavored coffee and this is not it.  There is mild bitterness and the coffee was slightly weak.  So far the only K-cup coffee that I enjoy is the Barista Prima Italian Roast (I think that's the brand), but I wanted something I could order on subscribe and save, so I always had coffee.<br /><br />I ordered the Tully's Italian Roast to see how it is, but it too isn't as good as the other. 1
These are pretty good, but you've gotta realize that each pack is the size of a pack of peanuts.  A lot of the space in each bag is air.  I suppose it is to keep the puffs from breaking.<br /><br />Flavorwise, they're alright.  Cheesy, crunchy, and a bit too salty to eat a lot of.  They're not amazing though.  You could probably get more concentrated flavor by baking your own cheese, but the problem is of course time.  This is very light flavored. 4
There are things that I recall from my childhood that I would rather not - being stung by a bee, chicken pox, all the attempts to learn to ride a bike before I actually learned to ride it, and Tang.  Tang was that chalky, never quite dissolved in the water, powdered drink that schools and company picnics would try to pawn off on kids as Kool-aid.  It wasn't Kool-Aid by any stretch of the imagination - it was Tang.  I've never heard anyone ASK for Tang... it was just what was there.<br /><br />So I get my can of Switch in the mail, eyeball the can... it's the same size and shape as an energy drink can... one of those "single shot" type cans.  Fearing that it was an energy drink I checked the label... says it's pretty much all juice, carbonation, and some natural flavors (including soy?!?) so I pop it open and take a swig.<br /><br />Now it MAY be 100% natural juices with some natural flavoring - but I know Tang when I taste it.  This is carbonated Tang... I know it is.  Somewhere out there is a giant warehouse filled with cannisters of powdered Tang and someone thought to themselves - what do we do with all of this stuff?  I know, mix it with carbonated water and voila! Now it's not Tang, it's Switch!<br /><br />In all honesty there are probably people out there who will love this drink - but for the price they are asking and the small size of the can - I would suggest whipping up your own Tang with fizzy water.<br /><br />Pros- Pretty much all natural - Juices, natural flavors and no unnatural dyes (good for the ADHD kids).<br /><br />Cons- I personally didn't care at all for the taste, a bit overpriced for what you are actually getting, can will trick many into believing they are buying an energy drink. 3
My son is in MCC in Washington State, he received these items, and so far, no complains. 4
I really enjoy this tea because it's not to sweet and it's easy to use.  I carry it and my mug with me and just add hot or cold water, depending upon my mood.  I find that it gives me just the right kind of energy and it can even hold my hunger between meals. A real great thing because I watch my calories.  And of course, green tea is full of antioxidants. 4
I love this pancake mix. Can not find this exact one in any stores so I always order online and keep in stock at home. All you do is mix with water (I add fresh chopped banana's or strawberries for a healthy option, and swap syrup for honey) and cook in a lil butter and you have an awesome breakfast. 3
Received this product and upon opening the package, I found over 30 percent of the cookies or fruit thins broken. They were broken into two pieces and some were smashed into many pieces. I found the taste to be OK, but the fruit content was of the consistency of "gummy bears" and tended to be excessively chewy and to stick to my teeth. The product had a sugary taste and a crumbly consistency. The Thins were easily broken. This is not a product that I would purchase again. Other Nabisco cookie products and the famous Fig Newtons are superior in flavor and durability. The packaging was not strong enough to protect the product. You can see images which I will post on the main product page.<br />Thin and easily broken product ought to be packaged in stronger boxes and not in flimsy plastic trays and paper bags. I gave a 2 star rating because of mediocre taste, poor mouth feel and flimsy packaging.  But, in fairness, the Vine product was shipped as an individual bag inside a larger shipping box with only two pieces of bubble pack so it is possible it rattled around and pieces of cookies broke.  The full size multi-pack that one would receive on a regular order should not suffer as much in transit. 2
I just tried Patak's Madras Curry Paste, and am surprised (but not too surprised) that another reviewer also found Patak's Tikka Masala paste too sour.  I have found two other reviewers that also found Patak's Madras Curry Paste too sour, so perhaps that's a Patak quirk.  Even my husband, who normally likes sour tastes and likes to squeeze lemon juice into nearly everything he eats, finds the results too sour. 2
I received the Quaker Soft Baked Banana Nut bread compliments of Influenster.  Wow!  This bread is amazingly good, soft, chewy, delectable -- a real morning treat!!  It also contains 5g of fiber content -- that is 20% of the RDA of fiber!!  Most people don't get the recommended 25-30g of fiber per day, so this is an excellent way to increase your fiber intake easily because it tastes so good! 4
I purchased Falim because I was looking for a completely carb-free gum. I didn't want a sugar-free gum with sweeteners.  I just wanted something to chew on when I was craving something. That is exactly what this is. It is virtually flavorless, completely sugarless gum. Once in a while you can taste a bit of a piney flavor but overall it's just like a normal piece of gum that has lost it's flavor.<br /><br />There are 5 small pieces in each pack so you get 25 pieces of gum for the price which is a little steep when you include shipping.  So, if you know you will use it, I recommend buying in volume to bring the overall cost per piece down by sharing the shipping cost among numerous packs. 4
Just be aware that it's quite expensive for the amount that you're getting (less than a pound of pasta per package). 5
If you are a bacon lover and like mayonnaise on sandwiches, this is for you.  It is great as a dip too.  I have mixed it with cream cheese and it still holds its flavor. 4
Two little Yorkies basically love these little chicken wrapped biscuits.  Each morning each one gets 2 of them and they start the process of enjoying them.  Then after a few minutes they finish with a nice little mess.  I do not understand but near the end of the process they either just get tired of eating them or do not like them or they are suggesting that they want to share the leftovers with us.  Regardless, we always have a few pieces on the floor that have to be vacuumed.  No big deal, however.  There are three treats these critters love:  these biscuits, pig snouts and freeze dried livers.  I would love to have a return of all the money we have spent on other treats that did not make it to the eating condition.  Yorkies are blatantly picky (or at least these ones) and it's one sniff and eaten or gone to the neighbor's dogs.  Maybe that's where the expression "gone to the dogs" originates.  If you buy food and do not like it then give it to the dogs.  Bottom line:  great for us, love the little plastic container and they love the treats.  We'll be back for more. 4
Could do with a touch of sweetness as the salt is far too over powering and it seems over dried. I bought a box and can't get rid of the rest 2
It clearly states on the description, pack of 6!  But I only got 5!  And I cannot find how to complain about this.  I don't want to return. 2
let me first say that i love sour candies, but these worms were way too sour, to the point that you can't really taste much flavor because the sourness overpowers everything.  there are only 3 color combos, as seen in the picture (yellow/green, red/yellow, and orange/blue).  that's right, there is NO blue/pink combo like the trolli ones, which is quite disappointing.  and even if you put the red half with the blue half, it wouldn't taste like the trolli ones either.  in the case of sour worms, albanese &lt; trolli, hands down. 2
This product really deserves 4 or 5 stars for the product itself.  However, as others have noted, Amazon has WAY overpriced it.  The manufacturer has its own website where it is much, much cheaper. 3
I wanted to like this tea, but it's pretty blah. I tried using two bags in a cup, with different brewing times, and still couldn't get a satisfying sip. On the other hand, I do prefer teas with a lot of flavor, like a good Assam, so maybe that's why I differ so much from the other reviewers, or maybe I got a bad batch. 2
This product comes up in a search for Keurig K-Cups by calling itself a "Pod". It is not a pod, not a K-cup, and there is nothing in the product description that clearly states what the product really is--a single serve coffee filter bag. I sincerely doubt that the deception is accidental. Bad form, Puck. 1
I purchased these very large cans of chili because they were priced ridiculously cheaply at the time. I planned to split the cans up into smaller portions and freeze the smaller portions to make a large number of meals. The first can I opened looked a little different from other Hormel chili I have had in the past. The beans were all mashed up and there were large chunks of cubed meat in the chili. Normally the meat resembles little pieces of ground meat. These were weird unappetizing chunks. The chili had no chili taste. It tasted like slightly burned re-fried beans. The night after eating this and the next day, there were numerous trips to the bathroom. Won't give details - but it wasn't pleasant.<br />A few days later, I opened a second can hoping the first was just a one time thing. The second had the same mashed up beans and meat chunks. I tossed it and now have four large cans of chili that I will never use.<br />Maybe this was just a bad batch. It almost seems as if they scraped the old chili residue off of their pots, threw in some leftover meat chunks, canned it and sent it to me. Needless to say, I will never purchase this product again. 1
There is a nice strong coffee flavor and the right amount of sweetness to the drink but the additives leave an acidic aftertaste that is a little off-putting.  Maybe a little cream or vanilla flavoring could help? 3
I like to purchase chocolates for my Mom. She is 79 years old, and does enjoy a piece of chocolate after dinner. I wanted to get something special for her, so Naturally I went to one of the more expensive items in this area. I waited for her to get the package and had her call me as she opened the box and tasted her first piece of very expensive chocolate. She was very happy to get the gift and thrilled that I had remembered her in this way. And that is about as far as the excitement went. She ate no more than one or a half of the chocolates a day. As each piece of chocolate is two servings. She kept the slip of paper from the box that told of each chocolate and what you were getting. As the days went on and she was telling me how she enjoyed the chocolates, the truth came out. These were nice chocolates. Nice, but not worth the money you spend on them. I told her that the next box of chocolates I get would be DIFFERENT. When she had finished the box I ordered her TWO boxes of the variety of Kirkland Chocolates. I actually spent less on TWO boxes than I had on this one small box of Chocolates. She was thrilled  not only with the fact of a gift again, but at the taste of the chocolates. She loved the Kirkland chocolates, and requested that I never spend the money on the Moonstruck Chocolates again. Although I didn't sample the candy, I believe that if you want more for your money, and a good piece of candy, skip the Moonstruck and go for the Kirkland box of chocolates. Variety PLUS a very happy Mom.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042TO03I">Kirkland Signature Classic American Chocolate Holiday Gift Box 16 oz.</a> 2
I was introduced to this sauce by a good friend of mine from Cambodia, who runs a Thai restaurant and bar.  I wondered what sauce was used in their ramikens when they served their delicious crispy spring rolls.  Their actual sauce was handmade, but I was directed to try this brand.  Since then, (about 5 yrs ago) my mother, friends, and I have all used this sauce on fried chicken wings, grilled and sauteed chicken, pork, spring/egg rolls, and even sushi!  I keep the large 25 oz bottle in my fridge year-round, and this is the best brand I've used thus far.  Not too hot for those not accustomed to very spicy foods, but is mostly sweet.  Try it, you won't be disappointed!! :o) 5
If you are looking for a fairly healthy snack, these are a good bet. They are quite tasty and crunchy not to mention pretty good for you as well. I removed one star only based on the fact that they are quite expensive but if you are willing to pay for them, you do get what you pay for. Will be re-ordering more. 4
These treats are certainly a new and different idea, but ease of use needs to be improved before they can become something we'd purchase on a regular basis.<br /><br />Certainly, the concept is clever and has potential. The treats are liquid, contained in a tube with a roller ball at the top. The pet licks the ball and gets a measured dose, so to speak. But the problems begin right there.<br /><br />First, the two dogs (one medium, one large) both want to eat the tube rather than lick it, and getting the "lick but don't bite" idea across has proved a challenge. Second, you can give them one treat and then it seems the roller ball has to rotate to dispense the next treat. How do you do this? You can rotate the ball by hand, which is inconvenient and often messy. Or you can squeeze the tube and hope to get the pressure right and not spray the liquid on the ground.<br /><br />We plan on trying this as a leash training aid, a quick reward for proper behavior. The product seems ideal at least in theory for that purpose. Maybe we'll learn to use it better, but right now, it's a little more trouble than it's worth.<br /><br />By the way: We had three flavors. The dogs didn't distinguish among them so unless you have a finicky pet, choice of flavor may not matter. 3
I bought this thinking it would taste at least a little like the restaurants version. It was NOTHING like it. I tried it with the water first. It doesn't even tell you how much liquid to add, just a glass of water and one tbsp. of the mix. I used a large glass. It was horrible so I added another tbsp. It was still REALLY bad. It was so watery. Then the next time I used skim milk (only because that's what's in my house). This tasted better, but nothing I'd want to drink again. Also it says on the package in the picture 'sweetened,' and it says it has sugar in it and my package was, so I agree with the other lady as to why people assume it's not sweetened when it clearly is. I would NEVER buy this again. 1
I sometimes prefer not to have to grind the beans! This is a good price for Starbucks Sumatra coffee, and it tastes the same as the beans. It does not lose any of the flavor that it would from being ground. I did dock it one star because you have to order something else to get the super saver free shipping because of five measly cents!! 4
Well, I love hard candies, but not the sugar. My husband & I saw these and thought we'd found the perfect solution. Unfortunately, the candies -- while very tasty -- played havoc with our systems. We couldn't eat more than 8 at one time (5 for me) without getting crampy & gaseous. At first we didn't realize it was the candies causing the effect, but that changed quickly. We had to discard the rest of the product. What a shame. 2
I bought several brands of microwave pork rinds and Lowrey's is the best.<br />They're very quick to heat (pending microwave) and the rinds actually<br />take shape. Available in original and hot & spicy.  Good deal through<br />Amazon.com 5
This comes in powdered form that you mix with water to the consistancy that you like.  It is by far the best low cal/low fat peanut butter product.  I've tried them all, and although it's not as good as full fat/full cal peanut butter - it's pretty good. 4
I bought these bags b/c I thought they were tough, thick nylon.  I guess these bags would work perfectly fine if you're just using them for transport.  I needed a really tough one like the KBR guys try to sell us for $8 here in Afghanistan...2 of these bags are already in the trash after only 2 uses each.  They wash the laundry in the bag and both have ripped after only 2 uses.  I gave them a 3 b/c they are not that bad..just not what I was needing.  The seller was awesome!  I received the bags here in Afghanistan after only 6 days from the original order date so I have to say the seller was very expedient. 3
I bought this item assuming they would be authentic Southern grits(cooking time 10-15 minutes), however I was mistaken for Instant Grits. The cooking time on the bag says 3-5 Minutes. They taste fine, but I wouldnt waste my money on these grits when you can get the same quality from Quaker Oats. 2
I was looking for an alternative meat source for a backpacking trip my husband and I are taking soon and discovered this great tasting vegan meat jerky. It tastes great, but is a bit to salty for my tastebuds 4
I like these chips, even though they are a little different than chips I am used to. I love that they are reduced fat, but be warned, they are extremely crunchy. So crunchy that I have to turn the volume up on the TV to hear it when I'm chewing them. The taste is quite good though and I like crunchy salty food. I will probably order them again. 4
wish I would of tasted one before i bought this half & half.<br />just to sum it up, it tasted like chemicals. The southern Ice Tea on the other hand is very good. 1
Bought a set of two when my son was about 6 months, and we started taking them with us whenever we went out to eat.  I cut up cantaloupe, apple, banana (even used sweet potatoes a few times)-- just whatever I could get at the restaurant-- and it would keep my son busy long enough that I could actually eat!  It's great because I didn't have to be overly worried about him choking on big chunks, and he got to try out new foods.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy this again. 5
Since a DOP product is not readily available at my local grocery stores, I got really excited when I saw the photo of this product at the Amazon website because the photo states that this product is "D.O.P. Certified."<br /><br />But when I received the shipment, it was a huge disappointment.  It was a different product than what the photo promised.  (I can buy the one that was delivered to me at my local grocery stores very easily.)  Very disappointing............. 1
Wonderful. I love everything about Mango and this is quite a treat. It was soft and flavorful. Two thumbs up! 4
I like my crystallized ginger in the form of natural looking slices that are big and sort of chewy.  These are perfect little uniform cubical pieces that are more like ginger gumdrops than anything else.  It was impossible to tell that from the package illustration, so I'm rather disappointed, especially because crystallized ginger can be had for way less money.<br /><br />They are tasty, however.  This is a high quality product, just not in the form that I like best. 3
I used this marinade exactly as the instructions say on the label.  I marinated two pounds of chicken breast, chopped up for couscous.  Now I will admit that the marinade smells amazing when you open the bottle, but it left me disappointed.  There is so much liquid smoke in this marinade, that my chicken ended up tasting like a chicken flavored ash tray.  Perhaps if I had used a smaller amount it would have worked out better?  I don't know.  I think perhaps the company needs to modify their cooking instructions. 1
Although this product is better for you than pasta, nothing beats the taste of real pasta. I just can't get past the texture of these noodles, they are chewy and gummy and gelatin all at the same time. 2
My ten pound Yorkie is very food centric when it comes to games - if there isn't food, he isn't playing.  We have several bumble balls and kongs that he loves to play with and thought this treat wheel would be a fun new game for him.  The yellow playing pieces were much too big for him to get his mouth around and he was unable to master using his paws to flip them out of the holders.  For a dog that LOVES any game that involves food, this just proved much too frustrating for him. And believe me, we tried to help our little guy out with this. We left the yellow cups off and just slightly rotated the wheel, but even that was too difficult for him to "spin" as it did not move easily.  And it's not like our dog isn't "Paw-centric" as he is actually quite adept at using his paws to move and flip his Kong, and to fish treats out from under furniture, etc.  We tried over the course of several weeks to try and help our pal get the hang of this toy, but all parties finally agreed that this just wasn't fun the way a toy should be. Perhaps if you have a bigger dog this will work for you, but it received two paws down from our little buddy.<br /><br />One other concern that I had was the fact that the small hole in the top of the yellow cups seemed just the right opening for a dog to catch a nail in and get stuck on his paw. Granted that on one should ever leave a pet and a toy unattended, but something for people to keep in mind if they do buy this product. (yes I'm a worry wart pet parent, but you'd be amazed at the predicaments our pets have gotten themselves into...) 2
Not only does this store all those annoying little Kcups, but I put sugar packs and creamers it it too.  The black top is great because it doesn't show every little splash of coffee. A much better solution that the tree-type stands! 5
I generally grill pork chops, but this was a nice change. The Shake 'n Bake didn't stick quite as well as I remembered when Mom made it as a kid, and since other reviewers have no mention of the problem, I'm chalking that up to my lack of culinary skill. Still, the taste was a really nice change of pace. I generally don't like sauces or gravies or anything that changes the flavor of my meat considerably, and this didn't. It was a nice departure from normal, but not so much that I tasted Shake 'n Bake and not my chops. It added to the flavor of the meat instead of overpowering it. I'm glad I rediscovered this old favorite and will use it again soon. 4
I love the soup and convenience, but TWICE I have had the container fall over while it was heating in the microwave.  The first time I thought it was a fluke, but the second time (in a different oven) was just too much.  Now I pour it into a bowl to heat (which defeats the purpose of Soup At Hand). 3
Hi,<br /> Online it says 100% pure lavender oil.  I use lavender oil religously and this does not smell like other pure lavender oils I've recieved in the past. The smell is faint and it is a little more 'perfume' smelling. I did notice on the bottle it says a 100% natural oil not a 100% pure lavender oil.  Online it states that it is a 100% pure lavender oil.  I wrote them and they wrote, "Thanks. We are sorry to hear that. Your can return for refund. But this is 100% Pure lavender oil, no mixed, no chemical.".. Too return it you would have to pay shipping back plus you are out the shipping you paid to recieve it too.  All in all if you are looking for a strong lavender smell this is not it. There responce was fast so I will give them the benifit of dout, so giving 3 stars for an okay rating. Thanks 3
This item is good but way overpriced from this vendor.  You can buy the mix directly from Trader Joe's for $2.99 (selling here for $17.95). 1
Close to tasteless with zero floral fragrance. I could not believe the poor quality of this product, my wife's comments were even less complementary. Even at the price, there was no value in my purchase of Durkee Vanilla Initation. 1
My dog, a Great Pyrenees, has a few food allergies (rice, chicken, eggs, soy, nuts) and is picky about the food he eats. I was feeding him Orijen 6-Fish and, after a few months, he decided to stop eating it.  After trying a few different foods I heard about Pinnacle Trout and Sweet Potato.  He loves it and it agrees with his digestive system.  I order it from Amazon because the price is lower than the local pet stores in my area. With Amazon Prime, it arrives in 2 days.<br /><br />Four stars because I do need to mix the last quarter of the food with the next bag (treating it like a new dog food - I didn't need to do that with Orijen 6 Fish).  Highly recommended. 4
These chocolates are absolutely the best, smooth in taste and almost delicate in texture. Their an absolute MUST for any chocolate fan, I've never been a fan of milk chocolate, but these Fazer chocolates are the absolute exception! I highly recommend these chocolates to anyone who loves chocolate as much as i do! 5
I thought it would have been thicker. Its actually just like the soy milk instead. I was disappointed. 2
My first box came with some of the packets opened and they were all sticky.  I contacted you and the recieved another box free.  They were packed much better, and arrived intact.  Thank you so much.  We love these!! 5
This mix is pretty good, made with water.  The texture can be strange if you add extras... If you add blueberries, don't make 12 large muffins, make about 16 small ones, or they will be gooey. And you need to cook them at 375 (rather than 400) for approx. 10 minutes longer than it says. 2
I love this tea. I make it strong and mix it with a splash of lemonade.  I copied a similar tea from Starbucks.  I like mine better, plus...it costs less! 5
Bernie, my 60-65 pound labrador retriever, loves these strips. I give her about 1 per day. The rawhide strips are on the order of 2-3 inches by 5-7 inches. They vary in thickness, but I'd say the majority of the strips are of slightly thin to normal thickness.<br /><br />The five pound bag is resealable, though it's not the toughest of plastics. I've received some bags that have some small holes from being punctured by the rawhide strips.<br /><br />The strips come from Brazil, purportedly from grass fed cows, which is excellent. I've noticed that most of the options I have in local stores are made in China. I'm not comfortable getting food products from China, given their recent past history with tainted pet foods.<br /><br />The Amazon price at more than a quarter of a Benjamin feels steep, though when you consider you're getting five pounds and consider the price per pound, it's actually a good value compared to local options (at least for me). 4
Bought this at Ralphs, 1 for $4.49 to try and was unimpressed. The high protein is great, but you can find that in other grocery store products. The high fiber is great for diets, and you can't find this high in any other pasta, but it tastes and is the texture like macaroni for kids. It definitely tastes and feels better than some "healthy" pastas available, but I'm just not sold on this. If you want low net carbs and that's your main goal, definitely use this and add in meats, veggies, and cheese to your dish for a good meal. 3
The Gold Kili is just okay to me. I'm not a huge fan of the flavor, it too bold for me. It will settle a stomach, as the other reviewers stated. For that alone, it would be perfect for those sick days or hangover days or any day you have a little stomach bug! 3
I have a wheat allergy and have tried just about every type of gluten and wheat free cookie mix out there. I have to say that this cookie mix is a-m-a-z-i-n-g and the BEST.<br /><br />Prep and Baking:<br />Super easy, you add butter and an egg, that's it. You want to bake them until the bottom of the cookie is a light brown, be sure not to over bake. I knew they would taste good, as even the dry mix was super yummy, not overly sweet, but more buttery and chocolaty tasting.<br /><br />Texture:<br />The texture of these cookies is so light and fluffy; they simply melt in your mouth. They also have the perfect combination of an ever so slight chewiness and a hint of crunch. Basically they look and feel just like a "real" chocolate chip cookie.<br /><br />Taste: These cookies are not overly sweet, which I really like. They have more of a delicious, rich, buttery / chocolaty taste, with a good amount of dark chocolate chunks throughout, simply perfect.<br /><br />CONS: As someone who does not like to over indulge in sweets and focuses on eating healthy, I normally bake and share. The con is I found it hard to part with these yummy cookies, as I wanted them all for myself. 5
These are great little snack packs - flavorful chips and fairly low fat and low cal. 4
These are great treats, but the dog I bought them for wouldn't even huff on them. Had I known that, I could've saved the $6+ dollars I payed for them, and bought my cat a gift instead.<br /><br />Ingredients: Dried potatoes, sweet potatoes, potato protein, dried cane molasses, salmon, canola oil, whitefish meal, dried apple, flaxseed, vitamins/natural preservatives. 3
What a wonderful starter kit this is.  While I am and was familiar with some varieties of exotic sea salts, I certainly had not had the opportunity to try this many at one time.  Tather than chance buying a product that I did not like and being stuck with it, this allowed me to give each and everyone a try.<br /><br />I plan to order at least three more sets for presents this coming year for friends that, like me, are foodies.<br /><br />This is an excellent product. 5
I bought the Whirley-Pop Stovetop Popcorn Popper several months ago, which (of course) the Wabash Valley popcorn came recommended (same company). I thought...what the heck; I've always wondered how "gourmet" popcorn differed from Orville or other everyday popcorn brands.<br /><br />Let me tell you...IT IS WORTH THE EXTRA MONEY! I can really taste the difference in quality. AND, "normal" popcorn just doesn't taste right when you make it in the Whirley-Pop.<br /><br />This popcorn is so tender and tasty. It was a little weird to see and eat at first because it's about half the size of regular popcorn. But, I believe this characteristic is essential in helping the seasonings completely coat the corn.<br /><br />My favorite prep methods include using the Whirley-Pop and Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil (see my review for that for more details!) I add a little peanut oil, sea salt, black pepper, and a good amount of Vegaline Garlic Mist Cooking & Seasoning Spray. YUMMY!!!!<br /><br />I've tried the other Amish Country popcorn, and they're all good. This is my favorite, though! 5
Was so disappointed in this coffee.  I gave several k-cups to my family for their use and not one of them liked it, nor did I.  Tried using the small cup and large cup size, but was still very bitter and had a funny aroma. 1
My daughter, who had used Quaker Instant Oatmeal and liked it a lot a long time ago, tried this version and didn't like it at all, in fact didn't want to finish it. Not sure why, maybe lots of new ingredients, some artificial. 2
We really love these crackers.  They taste a lot better than the regular peanut butter crackers.  But when you add shipping costs, they are much more expensive on Amazon than in other stores.  We generally buy a box with 8 individual packs for $2.00.  I bought these thinking that there must be a mistake in the description, and there would be more boxes.  I admit, that was my mistake!  But the packing slip said it was 6 boxes of 8 individual packets.  So there is a disconnect between what is on the site, and what the packing slip says.  My recommendation - check your grocery store before you buy.  Chances are you will get them at a much more reasonable price. 4
We ordered a popcorn machine as a fundraiser and use these packets.  They are great tasting, easy, and it takes all the 'guesswork' of how much of any ingredient you should add. They have it all worked out for you. Save yourself some aggravation and order these. 4
I bought 12 boxes of Sugar Twin from Amazon. It was hard and clumpy where it had been exposed to moisture. The product is good but I would never order it from Amazon again. 1
I have this coffee. It is not the best coffee I ever had. It not as strong as other coffees. I would prefer French roast.It does not give you much energy.<br />  THE END 3
This carbonated product has a nice natural juice taste to it that makes you feel like you're drinking something that might be a little healthier than all the other carbonated stuff out there on the shelves but I couldn't help but notice the amount of sugar this thing has listed on the nutrition facts:<br /><br />34g per 8.3 oz can of the stuff. 36g total carbs.<br /><br />Like I said, it's good but don't get fooled into thinking its any healthier for you. There's no artificial stuff in here according to the can at least. 3
I recently purchased the Keurig B-60 Special Edition Brewer from Amazon.  It came with a sample variety pack of 12 different K-cup blends (note no light blends included).  I tried all of them and found this particular blend to be the best to my liking although I do prefer a light blend.  It has a nice coffee aroma (like one you would smell at a good restaurant but can't produce at home) and surprised me by tasting as good as it smelled.  It is a medium blend and tastes relatively smooth without an excessively strong or acidic aftertaste.  Recommend to fellow Amazon customers that prefer a  medium blend coffee.  I recently found the Green Mountain Breakfast Blend available at my local Walmart and plan to write a review on it. 5
These are decent cookies when bought at a discount from Amazon. They're light and not too sweet, but unfortunately are pretty crumbly. While it's nice that Bahlsen doesn't use trans fat, the hydrogenated filling has the cheap and greasy consistency of Crisco, and is loaded with saturated fat. Palm oil would make these a little healthier, butter would make them taste much better, but alas manufacturers must always use the cheapest ingredients possible. Since Bahlsen's price is much more reasonable than other manufacturers, and since they are superior to most brands (except the crumbs!), they are worth considering.<br /><br />The reviewers who claim these have a hazelnut filling have sensitive palates. While these cookies may or may not contain traces of hazelnuts, their filling tastes mundanely of cocoa. 3
Great taste!  Today, we can have different flavored cereals that some of us remembers from eating its' original more than a generation ago.  The Apple Cinnamon taste gives it more pizzazz, even though some of us might recall a hint of the old familiar oat taste; it was healthy for us back then, just like it is today.  Anyway, kids of all ages love it! 4
Our family has been wheat-free for 3 years and gluten-free for 1 1/2 so we've tried just about every mix out there.  I just found that Bisquick has a GF mix while in the grocery store and decided to give it a try.  This is DEFINITELY the best mix that we have ever tasted: smooth, not grainy.  I don't know that side-by-side with regular wheat pancakes that you would notice the difference! 5
My husband just read on the box that Raisin Bran is now made in Mexico. I was shocked.  I don't feel confident that the quality is the same as if it was made in the USA.  We cancelled our subscription. 1
i found these in california  and i remembered them when  i was a kid.  they dontsell them in florida<br />(where i live)  so i bought them  on amazon, and whenever my children visist me of i go west, i load up on them.<br />nothing better!!!! 5
The product description says 100% Juice when the actual can says 15% juice! Pricey bait & switch, don't be fooled like I was duped. 2
I introduced my daughter to Earth's Best Organic Turkey Vegetable Dinner at 4 months. A bit early, but she's advanced, as she was 6 weeks overdue.  She loved it at first.  But, I bought every other kind and now this is her least favorite.  I've tried some of it as well.  Of all of them, this is also my least favorite. 3
I bought the 12 pack of Italian roast decaf at the nearby Starbucks store, which I love and go to frequently, for those rare occasions when I want a cup of decaf at night but don't want to brew it.  But this product is not SB's best effort.  First, the packaging isn't well designed.  Tearing the top off at the "tear here" line always leaves part of the top intact, making getting the coffee out a chore, and trying to tear off the rest of the sticky top is not worth the effort.  Next, the flavor.  I know Italian is supposed to be bold and bitter, but this stuff takes bitter to a whole new level.  Not good.  Then there's the expiration.  I didn't plan to use this very often, but I'd better, because it expires in less than a month.  What?  Finally, the cost.  At nearly a dollar a cup, this wouldn't be worth it even if it didn't suffer from its other inadequacies.  A definite DO NOT RECOMMEND. 2
I have tried a couple flavors of this, Pomegranate is my favorite, and I think they work great! I have a busy 3 year old and work full time, so there are times I need an extra boost.  I have tried other energy drinks and always feel anxious and jittery.  I didn't get that with 5 Hour Energy.  I felt a noticeable boost in energy about 10 minutes after drinking it and it tapered off throughout the day, I never had the crash I was expecting. I wouldn't use these everyday, but for when you need the extra boost, it's perfect!<br /><br />I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY? from Smiley360. 4
I have been drinking this Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Coffee for quite a while and recommending it to all my friends.  I LOVED it!  My first conscious thought every morning would be of that great-tasting cup of coffee.  YUM!  So what happened to it?  The last few boxes have been absolutely tastless :(  There is no wonderful aroma either.  I might as well be drinking hot water.  This is SUCH a disappointment.  That wonderful flavor is now only a memory.  Sadly, I am giving up on Chocolate Raspberry Truffle and will purchase another flavor from now on. 1
I purchased this for Christmas 2011.  I love peppermint bark and like to try a new kind every year.  Its a very special yearly treat for me, so I expect a lot from the product.<br /><br />Pros for Scott's Cakes version:  Good organization and logistics:  the package arrived quickly, the candy was well wrapped in the shipping box and shrink-wrapped in a box of its own.  Candy was in good condition (i.e., no broken pieces) and fresh.<br /><br />This seller's peppermint bark achieves a nice mix of peppermint and white chocolate flavor.  White chocolate gives off a nice mellow tone; it is good quality.  There is no dark chocolate layer to upset the balance of peppermint and white chocolate flavors in one's mouth.  This attracted me to Scott's Cakes.<br /><br />Cons:  The quality of the peppermint pieces in the chocolate was very disappointing.  The ad mentions that the buyer should expect to see pieces of candy cane/peppermint starlight mints mixed with white chocolate.  The photo seems to support this claim, showing robustly sized pieces of candy cane in the bark.  I expected a very crunchy chewing experience, which I think is the hallmark of the best types of peppermint bark.  However, the pieces of peppermint candy are in reality very small; there is no sensation of crispness when taking a bite.  The peppermint candy has a chewy consistency, making it seem more like taffy.  Thus, there is no auditory pleasure in consuming this version of peppermint bark. 3
The actual package received is not at all as shown in the product picture.  This seriously reduces the value.<br /><br />Beware the other Black Friday or Cyber Monday savings from this company.<br /><br />Shame on Amazon for kicking off the holiday season with this bait and switch.<br /><br />I'm happy with Amazon 95% of the time.  They missed on this one.<br /><br />Postscript:  Amazon refunded a large enough portion of the purchase price to satisfy me.  Kudos for their honorable response. 2
If you love orange soda but don't want to drink soda this is the perfect product for you.  This taste just like orange soda but is actually made of 100% real fruit juice.  no joke.  It really tastes good.  I loved it.<br /><br />However just b/c you don't have all the "fake" soda ingredients it still has tons of calories for 8.3 ounces 140 to be exact.  A can of soda has 150 for 12 ounces so I am not sure what the trade off is unles you want 100% of your vitamin C! 4
My shipment arrived with no broken or leaking containers. The product was well packed as to prevent a lot of movement to could cause damage and it worked out well. the only thing I found wrong was the shipment was seven (7) containers short, should have been 192 received 185, but for the price I paid I still came out far ahead on this sell. No complaints, and I would order from them again if given the chance. 5
This granola is really quite good. In fact, it may be one of my favorite commercial granolas (sometimes I buy, sometimes I make my own) and it may be my new go-to brand when I do buy granola. It's rich and full of flavor and not overly sweet. The sweetness level is perfect (and the sugars weigh in at 6 g per serving, which isn't too shabby for granola - sometimes it can be loaded with sugar). The chocolate is dark and rich (my favorite kind) and the berries are a nice addition. So why not 5 stars? Well, the berries are my only gripe - there aren't enough of them! I snagged some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002JLT66M">Just Tomatoes Organic Just Strawberries, 1.2 Ounce  Pouch (Pack of 4)</a> to mix in and now it's perfect. I know those berries are pricey, so I get it, but it does feel a little lacking.<br /><br />I would like to try the other varieties of granola in this line. I'm sure they are tasty. Really, I haven't had anything made by Nature's Path that I didn't really like. 4
Happy Hips are one of my little monster's favorite treats.  She is a very finicky eater but she will obey and be sweet for a chance at these chip like treats.<br /><br />This product was recommended to me by another dog owner as a healthy treat because it contains no fillers, byproducts, antibiotics, or added hormones. It also has vitamins and minerals to maintain healthy joints, which for a French Bulldog that has problems with hips and joints, is a plus.  I feel better about giving the little critter a healthy treat instead of the garbage contained in brand name treats on the market.<br /><br />One huge red flag is they are made in China, which certainly gives me pause, but I will keep buying them.<br />I have only tried the beef liver variety and will stick with it since my little creature likes them so much. 4
This product is exactly what I wanted.  Pumpkin is not found very easliy and it was great to find and buy what I needed. 4
I have three cats.  Now mind you, all three of theses cats LOVE to eat.  One cat is part Maine Coon and weighs about 28lbs, one is 17-years with a thyroid condition and constantly wants to eat, the third is the Coon's twin and she is a bit of a glutton.  ANyway, each of these cans has about the equivalent of two tablespoons of food and the rest is all liquid.  That was a reall turnoff for my guys.  The actual protein content LOOKS good, but they all three pretty much turned their noses up at it.  I have been using it as my "emergency supply" but have to say, I would never buy. 2
ingredients: sugar,brown sugar,molasses,soy lecithin, salt, artificial flavors, fd&c yellow no. 5(e102) fd&c red 40(127), fd&c blue no. 1 (e133)<br />it makes a brown very slightly sweet popcorn.  its ok.  clean up is easy even if you burn the sugar. 3
I am a dog trainer and this was a cool vine item to review. I always need new cool dog stuff. The dogs liked the toy /reward once they got a few licks. I love the ease of portablitiy,no pocket mess!!!!! ease of use.<br />dogs like it!!! will work for the bacon one.<br />*****bad news, single use container, no refills, nada. Formed plastic one time use. so 1990s sigh. sigh . sigh . very bad for the planet. please do not buy a plastic waste like this. I would pay extra for refillable container. anyone have one? 3
It is beyond me why anyone owning a keurig coffee brewer would want instant coffee.<br />I usually read all reviews (unfortunately I did not have time that day and did not want to<br />miss this "friday special.)"  This is the way it was marketed to buyers on Amazon-<br />"Grove Square (TM) Single Cup Coffee - Dark Roast - 24 ct Box".  I find this deceptive and unfair<br />to unsuspecting customers.  This is instant coffee.  If you go onto Amazon, it now 2/22 it states on some<br />of the grove square products that it is instant coffee.  I use my keurig for making<br />tea and hot chocolate and have even bought the chai cups.  Don't buy it is worse than<br />any instant coffee I have ever tasted and amazon will not let you return!  It does not<br />deserve the 1 rating I had to give it to get this to post!  Thank you and I hope this is helpful. 1
These reviews are all from sometime ago, and perhaps what was said was true at that time. But let me warn anyone looking for some good Rwandan coffee right now, do not waste your money. I have tasted true good Rwandan coffee, which is very similar to Kenyan coffee. Most African coffees taste naturally citrus sweet. I don't know what was in the bag I got. The aroma was terrible (like the beans had partially absorbed some odd flavor from something else) and it tasted just the same. I had to toss the 3 pound bag. 2
Woeber's Hot & Spicy Mustard is oh so good!  I'll buy another case when this gone.  Makes a great gift as well! 5
The texture of the pineapple was nice.  Unfortunately, the taste was not.  I could barely taste the pineapple.  There was a strong taste of oil that overpowered the pineapple.  I ate 2 pieces then threw the rest out. 1
We bought the 32 oz. vanilla extract.  Here are the ingredients, as listed on the label: Water, Alcohol, Sugar, Vanilla Bean Extractives.<br /><br />As others have noted, the added sugar was a big disappointment to us as well. 3
I have 2 large dogs, one of which is rather picky with treats.  They eat these up.  I like the fact they are organic and healthier than rangular dog treats you get at the grocery store, which you have no idea what some of the ingredients are in a lot of those.  These treats aren't very good smelling or nice to look at, dry brown squares, but I'm not the one eating them. I would definitely choose these over other crap that is on the shelves. 5
These Bigelow "Earl Grey Tea" K-Cups are quite good when made in our <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQPMHA">Keurig B-40 B40 Elite Gourmet Single-Cup Home-Brewing System</a>, on both the Small and Large cup settings. While I have had better Earl Grey tea, the speed and convenience more than compensates.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH 4
I got the coffee for 12.50 per box.  Ordered 4 boxes!!  Such a great deal, as the coffee is a great blend.<br /><br />If anyone is upset because of the website having issues when they were trying to buy it, they shouldn't review the product poorly, as it is not the product that is the problem.<br /><br />The problem is that you're jealous you didn't get such a great deal on the coffee.  Grow up kids, this coffee is great!!!  Will buy from Amazon.com, LLC again for more K-Cups for my Keurig.<br /><br />ALL OF MY COFFEE ARRIVED PACKAGED WELL AND IN NEW CONDITION, NOTHING WRONG WITH IT!! 5
We just bought this toy, and it is definetly something our dog loves and is interested in for a good period of time. It took her less than 20 minutes to figure out she just had to chew through the rope. If they could do a second version with a rope made of Kevlar or a metal chain with knots -that would be much better! 3
I bought the 6-flavor variety pack.  They are pretty good... nice thing is that I'm not 100% sure if I'm crazy about the texture so by the end of an 0.8 oz bag I don't really want anymore.  However in my quest for different snack foods I found the "Food Should Taste Good" line of cracker chips.  My money will be spent on those rather than pop chips.  However I think that people should give these a try as well. 4
I made these cookies today for my daughter who has a gluten allergy and the rest of my family.  The kids were so excited to try these and boy...were we disappointed!  The substitute for flour in this mixture is garbanzo bean flour.  Really?  There are so many flour alternatives on the market and they put beans in this recipe.  And the dough really does have a bean aftertaste.  It starts off sweet and then the lasting effect is garbazo beans.  Not what I want in a cookie.  To make them better, we added more vanilla and then rolled the cookie dough in sugar.  It was the only way to cut the bean flavoring. Also I think they only add 25 chips so be sure and add more to your own recipe.  Betty Crocker's gluten free version is so much better! 2
the Bergamot used here smells and tastes like rancid Lychee nuts, so if you are just looking for a pleasant black tea, pick something else.  A tea at this price point should not be using "flavoring" but the real essence, oil or dehydrated Bergamot citrus fruit.  The leaves are cut up into 2mm bits, so you must use a paper filter when seeping this loose tea.  The double capped tin does a fine job of air sealing the tea, so there is no need for an inner foil wrapper as others have contested. 3
Another popular seafood flavor that Sophie and Samson won't share.  When I bend down to place their bowls in front of them, they are on their back legs trying to get to it before I can put the bowl on the floor.  They act like they have not been fed in days. Nothing will disturb them - not even their favorite UPS man who brings them treats.  Can't beat Amazon prices !!! 5
Not very pleased with the performance of this machine: the espresso is very good but it doesn't come out hot, you have to preheat the cup ahead of time in order to be OK. 3
I bought this brewer because we have one at work that is awesome.  This one doesn't brew a large enough cup of coffee.  It fills your cup up about to the 1/2 or less mark.  The K Cups are too expensive to just get 1/2 cup of coffee!  The taste of the coffee in this one is kind of a chemical taste.  Not a good cup of coffee at all.  Very dissapointed.  Now they tell me this is an item that can't be returned either.  Ughhh!! 1
My husband I both like a mild tasting coffee.  We thought we would give Wolfgang Puck Breakfast in Bed a try.  We were pleasantly surprised by the full bodied taste but without the bitterness of some of the stronger tasting coffee's.  We are very satisfied and will be drinking this for a long time!  Now if I can only get my husband to take the name literally! 4
This has a very good flavor, but if you want meat this is not for you. This is mainly noodles, and I mean noodles. Have to take half out to enjoy the soup. I found two teeny pieces of meat, chicken I think? 3
This is a very small bag.  It has 6 servings of 3 pieces.  I did not understand the amount before I bought it. 3
I guess I have seent this many times on tv and etc .. i think its overhyped fro what it was and we are all underimpressed. 2
Desperation led me to try this food although I wasn't crazy about the brewers dried yeast or potatoes. I needed to try something without fish in it for my kitties when 2 of my 3 cats started to get flaky skin from food that did contain fish. I found it quite a challenge to find a good food that doesn't include some type of seafood.  As this one did not, I reluctantly decided to give it a try.  All 3 cats seemed to enjoy it, but I will not be buying it again.  Even though the moisture is only the usual 78%, it is so mushy and just awful to work with.  My girls didn't seem to mind, but between the consistency, yeast and potatoes this just doesn't cut it for my cats.  I'll have to be satisfied with fewer foods in their rotation. 2
I have a kid who comes home from school, when Dr. Oz comes on, so she pays a lot of attention to nutrition information and ingredients wants to eat healthier.  We saw these at Costco and read some reviews on Amazon for a healthier alternative to Twizzlers because she really likes Twizzlers and it got a low score on the Fooducate App.  My daughter ripped them open and tasted them, but she didn't like them, said there was an after taste.  However, I did give them to my other daughter's track coach and they have become pretty popular with some of the middle school kids, which will probably be the only reason why I would buy these again. 3
I a using these pods in my single cup coffee maker and if I could use 2 and not cause the water to overflow I would.  This coffee is very weak. 2
Nice, gingery bite kind of like you get with strong ginger cookies. VERY sweet beverage. This is worth trying if you like pungent, aromatic, tangy, bitey, spicy, sweet beverages (I do). The ginger flavor seems to overwhelm the lemon flavor. I don't drink ginger drinks, but enjoy the pickled ginger you get with some dishes at Japanese restaurants.<br /><br />I poured this into a coffee mug with hot water microwaved for two and one half minutes (shy of boiling). My son (post teenager, just a man) sipped it and said, "blechhh." My wife and I (over 50 each) sipped it and said, "Hmmm ... this would be nice on a cold day."<br /><br />I'm sipping it  now, enjoying it quite nicely as I write this review. I think you'll have to try it to see if you'll like it. Recommended for people who like ginger who personally may not like it, but worth trying. If you're not into pungent and tangy beverages, consider passing.<br /><br />FAST UPDATE: Mmmmm ... kind of nice with an ounce of tequila! 4
I purchased 6 boxes of Sun Maid Zante Currants 2/12.  They expire 7/13 however 5 out of 6 of the boxes had either furry mold or weird grainy things growing on it.  Also, when you smell the contents they smell vinegary and strange.  I just wanted to let you know about my disappointment. 3
This is very sturdy and not as some reviews were that stated this was flimsy.<br />I have no issues with it at all and would highly recommend it to anyone of my friends. 5
Do not waste your money on this drink. It doesn't taste very good and it doesn't have any effect. I had previously tried neurosleep with success so I thought I would give this drink a try. It is definitely not worth it. 2
This is the worst coffee I have ever bought , it has to be the stuff that fell on<br />the floor & they swept up & put in a can .I even tried mixing it with other coffee<br />to try and use it , It is just nasty ! 1
What can I say....Luscious milk chocolate, melt in your mouth ecstasy, with yummy crunchy hazelnuts.....10.5 ounces of pleasure!  Even better than that, a five pack, with FREE SHIPPING! That's the cheapest price I have found anywhere! 5
They were indeed tasty, but I guess I just don't understand the appeal. A small amount of liquid encased in wax. It has a certain novelty to it, but mostly it's just odd. I am sorry if my rating seems undeserved by people who like this candy. It's not that I don't appreciate old-fashioned candy. Some of it is great. But some of it went out of style for a reason. 2
This goat's milk has been a godsend for our granddaughter who seemed to get sick on every formula we tried.  The goat milk with a little coconut oil and extra DHA became a fantastic infant formula.  Once she started using the goat milk, almost all of her "issues" resolved themselves.  Her skin cleared up completely and her scalp didn't look all scaly and dry.  She looked like the perfect child we knew her to be!  She's now 7 months and has been using it since she's a month old.  She has been growing beautifully and perfectly on this powdered goat milk.  The powder is very convenient too.  Twenty years ago my nephew used goat milk in place of cow's milk and also did great!  His allergies also became a thing of the past.  All I can say is this is an excellent product! 5
It's got the typical Jif taste, which to me is unremarkable -- it's ... just peanut butter -- however, the single serve containers are convenient and transport well. The consistency is great -- it's not runny yet it's also not a solid hunk-a peanut butter with floating oil either. Good for dipping pretzels or celery/other veggies, and -- in the absence of a spreder -- you can just tear off the top and squuush the contents onto bread.<br /><br />The price is right. 3
My dog loves the treats, but they don't stay in the ball long enough and once out they disappear quickly.  The treats are pretty expensive for the short time they last (10-15 minutes).  I was looking for something to keep the dog busy and entertained for awhile.  If you're paying attention you can put the treat back in place and extend the time a little.  The ball itself is quality material and hasn't gotten chewed up.  Unless the treats drop in price significantly I probably won't buy anymore. 2
Perhaps there is too much yeast extract in it; I don't know if it is common to add yeast extract to olive spread, but I didn't care for this at all. 2
Guys - can't call it coconut water if the the product contains sugar.  That beverage would than be JUICE. After yoga, I went to Whole Foods to pick up dinner and to hydrate. I thought this could be a good one - the minute I tasted it I KNEW it! Sugar. Gross. Kinda the last thing I wanted to put in my body after a bikram session. 1
My little girl jammed her shoulder and her physical therapist recommended this.  She loves the little medicated treats.  As a human, they really smell awful but it does not matter to the dogs.  I only give it a 4 rating because it is a bit pricey. 4
Living in Germany for several years, I acquired a taste for Apfelsaftschorle or schorle for short, apple juice and sparkling water.  The soda water cuts the sweetness, gives the juice a little tang, and makes the drink a better hydrator; the juice makes the soda water a little more interesting.  I usually drink any fruit juice this way now.<br /><br />Switch premakes my schorle.  The blend was and orange citrus rather than apple, but very good regardless.  I tried it straight, but it would have been better over ice or if it had been mixed with a little more soda water and a little less juice.  The ingredients were juice, sparkling water, and a couple of stabilizers, without two of my pet peeves; artificial color, especially red 40, and high fructose corn syrup.<br /><br />I enjoyed it and can recommend it as an excellent alternative to conventional soda.<br /><br />E.

Dingo Munchy Stick / B000FPM5DA<br /><br />When I first bought these, my puppy was 3 months old and 6 pounds heavy. I wanted something that he could chew on to keep him interested and out of trouble when I couldn't watch him for short periods of time, for instance, when I take a shower. The treats didn't quite last the entire shower, but they did the trick for a time. Now he's a month older and another 6 pounds heavier and I'm lucky if the treat lasts long enough for me to get to the shower!<br /><br />Obviously, my dog likes these. He finishes them very quickly, maybe too quickly for the price, but the Amazon 4-for-3 deal still makes it worthwhile. I'm a little concerned about the rawhide in the sticks - I have been told by our trainer that rawhide can cause impaction in the digestive tract - but I think that the small shreds of rawhide in these sticks are probably safe. Still, I'm considering phasing these out to beef-hide sticks (not the same as rawhide), especially since the Dingo Stix do not last very long.<br /><br />As usual, I had no trouble with Amazon shipping, and the Stix look and smell the same as the ones from the local pet store - no weird odor or any signs of spoilage from sitting in a warehouse too long. I will probably continue to order these for as long as the 4-for-3 deal lasts.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll 4
I ordered the jerky for the variety and all I got was a bunch of beef sticks and a piece of venison jerky. Incredibly upset and regretful. Definitely not worth it in the least. 1
This coffee smells incredible, but the taste doesn't deliver.  There is an odd after taste that is really disappointing.  I'll try a different flavor next time. 2
I don't understand why I had to wait almost two months to receive this case order. Delicious, easy to prepare item.  Best if you add your own additional lentils since there aren't that many in the sauce.  The sauce is wonderful and spicy. 3
Chips Ahoy, chewy oatmeal cookies are so moist that it is difficult to separate a single cookie from the package without it breaking into pieces.  My tastebuds say they are too sweet, not cooked enough, lack ample chocolate chips and oatmeal flakes.  If you like cookie dough, you most likely will enjoy these.  I'll stick with a crunchy, less sweet cookie. 2
The choco/almond Pure Natural Bar is a good energy alternative for times when one can't sit down for a real meal. I work from 8am-3pm at one job then ride my bike to my second job, 3:30-8pm. These bars are perfect to toss in my bag and eat at 5 or 6pm. The taste is perfectly ok, although I wouldn't be sorry if it had an even more chocolatey flavor. It's nice and moist, which my old standby, powerbars are not... Each bar is filling and satisfies hunger pangs. I wish a single bar wasn't so calorie dense, but that's probably due to all the nutty goodness, which is what provides the sustaining energy. So as long as one doesn't eat them by twos and threes, it's probably all good. 3
We go through a lot of dressing and my husband HAS to have this brand only, so I saw this and said GREAT! 5
I tried Tropical Pineapple it was delicious. I gave a bad review for Tropical Fruit Salad becuase it had watermelon and pineapple in it I think the two of these were competeing for the flavor. I see now thats what I think it was, probably not a bad product at all. Sue 3
This is my diet secret> I needed soething salty and crunchy in my bag of tricks to help keep me on my diet, I love these things! Even if I eat a whole large bag it's still about 300 calories! I like all the flavors and I really like the samll snack size bags. I couldn't get them anywhere but on AMAZON! 4
I'm a huge popcorn fan and have tried all sorts, and the Amish Country brand popcorn is the best I've ever eaten.  Absolutely delicious! 5
I am writing this because this product KILLED my in-laws 2 year old YORKIE. They have been breeding Yorkies for 18 years and this was the first product they have used, that KILLED one of there dogs. They started using this product this past summer. Sweetie (the dog) was chewing on the GREENIE chew in front of both of them, when she started convulsing.  They immediately took her a 1/2 mile to the vet, by the time they arrived there, Sweetie was DEAD.  The Greenie had Pierced her TRACHEA.  Please be aware od how dangerous these could be to small dogs. 1
Freeze dried liver has a hypnotic effect on dogs. They LOVE it and will do just about anything for it, so it is a great treat to use for training. (Powdered freeze dried liver is even added to many dog medicines nowadays-- heartworm and arthritis tablets, etc.-- because it causes the dog to scarf the medicine down like a treat.)<br /><br />Freeze dried liver has a dry, hard, yet powdery/easy to chew consistency. It comes chopped/cubed. It is extremely lightweight due to the fact there is so little moisture in the product (thus the low weights on product labels).<br /><br />Even though your dog will love liver treats, you shouldn't overfeed it. The manufacturer recommends 1-2 cubes daily for small dogs, 2-3 cubes for medium dogs, and 3-4 cubes for large dogs.<br /><br />The largest package sizes of liver treats tend to be far more economical. I recommend buying the larger tubs, as you will save lots of money, you'll have a handy treat supply around for a longer time, and your dog will never tire of this product.<br /><br />There is really zero waste with this product. When you near the end of the tub you'll find some powdery bits of dried liver at the bottom. Your dogs will go CRAZY if you sprinkle this dust over their dog food-- it's a wonderful reward that is easy to use.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Here's the nutritional analysis:<br /><br />-100% freeze dried liver<br />-NO additives or preservatives.<br /><br />-Crude protein..... not less than 50%<br />-Crude fat..... not less than 5%<br />-Crude fiber..... not more than 3%<br />-Moisture..... not more than 6% 5
I purchased 2 bags, and one bag was just crawling with bugs.  I contacted the company, and they did nothing! 1
Do Not Buy!<br />I bought this case of 12 bottles 2 months ago and have consumed a few of them. At first I noticed that the bottle looked different than the ones I've seen before. The bottles are opaque instead of the clear plastic I have seen in the past and is pictured. Secondly I thought the taste wasn't as strong as I had remembered but I didn't have any other mustard to compare it to. The more I used it the more convinced I became that it was not truly Grey Poupon since it just tasted like cheap dijon mustard to me. At Christmas I received a jar of real Grey Poupon and compared the two, no question they are not the same. I cannot return this item and I have used a few bottles. I would not buy again and I would not recommend it to anyone.<br />One note, I purchased this product through Amazon but Sold by: J&M Goods, LLC<br />Not sure if that makes any difference now you can buy direct. 1
I did not like these potatoe chips. It's hot, and sweet, with an overwhelming taste of garlic. It's also a bit salty. 2
I'm going to guess that 'Yuck' didn't mix it up right, because, frankly, these taste surprisingly good considering they're supposed to be lo-carb. They're easy to make, and the non-diabetic in the house thinks they're just as tasty as I do. I do agree that the price is pretty outrageous, though. 4
I use this coffee with my toddy cold press system and it makes a very smooth cup of coffee. I so far have only used Folgers coffee with the system and see no reason to change as the end result is so very good. 5
Not very pleased with this product.  First thing the writing on the package is so small, I could not read it.  Therefore I did not have a good idea of how to prepare on use these noodles.  Upon delivery since it as a hot day and the noodles are packed in water, they were very hot, not sure if that makes a difference but I would feel better if these were package differently. 2
I empty the coffee from my K-cups into a container to use on my lawn and after opening these K-Cups little white specs caught my attention because I have been doing this for months and have never seen anything white in my coffee before. Upon further inspection I noticed that they look a lot like larva and then I was horrified as I saw larger bugs in my coffee grounds.<br /><br />I am very upset about this, I use to love coffee from my brewer but have had a very hard time trying to drink a cup now, knowing that I could be drinking another cup of bug juice, makes me want to gag really. I do not understand how this was allowed to happen. You would think The Green Mountain Coffee Company would have a quality control department? 1
Out of all the commercial grade dog foods, this one is a higher quality, but do not let that fool you. First, the ingredients are listed by weight, not by content so there is not as much chicken in the product as you might think. To make matters worse, there is only chicken and chicken meal in this product for protein. Soy meal is only a filler for dogs so they get no nutritional value out of it. If there were more meats and less fillers I would be more pleased with this product. I have a beagle puppy who chows this product down, however, this really means nothing. Just because your dog eats it doesn't make it good for them. Make sure the first few ingredients are meat, and the product has little to no grain (rice, oats, barley are GOOD; corn, wheat, soy, etc are NOT). 2
I bought these for my candy buffet at my wedding. The packaging is pretty poor, they are basically free in a box with no shrink wrap around the box itself, so sugar was all over the packaging and I worry about the candy going stale. The slices themselves are also smaller than what you'd typically find, which isn't necessarily bad, but just a word to the wise. The product does have good flavor and a very nice texture, a bit firmer than most fruit slices I've tried. 3
They said the salt and vinegar were horrible! Blecht! Couldn't get the awful taste out of their mouth. Now i'm stuck with this box of popchips! lol. 1
This product is sometimes advertised as having no aspertame in it, which is true. But it still has an artificial sweetener in it - sucralose. So instead of Satan, you are getting the Devil here ... and they also let this product sail under a false flag, by putting "Tea&Honey" in BIG letters up front. So naturally, you might think that this is an actual healthy product, organic even. Just read the ingredients list and you will quickly recognize what it really is: sugared water with some flavors in it.<br /><br />A brave self-test revealed a strong artificial taste, root-canal-pain inducing sweetness, immediate scratching and itching in the back of my throat, chemical aftertaste - just totally and utterly horrible.<br />A burst of flavor, as the advertising claims? Rubbish.<br /><br />And something else happened to me, which was already described by other reviewers - as soon as I opened the package, a very fine dust emitted which immediately made me cough and gasp for air. I just hope, this stuff is just bad tasting and not toxic on top of it ...<br />Very rarely, I bemoan the  fact that Amazon makes you give at least one star at the review. For this product, I would like to have the opportunity to give no star at all ... 1
I have been giving these chews to my Mini-Pincher and Mini-Dauchand for the past 3 years to help support their joints and hips.  The last batch I bought is darker in color to the point of almost being burnt and smells a lot more.  It made my Mini-Pincher sick to the point of vomiting and liquid stools.  I am going to shop for a better product that is made here in the US . . . I have been looking at GNC products for Dogs and that is probably the route I will take. 1
Of 6 cans, 5 cans were badly dented. It looked like someone may have dented them with a hammer. Don't take a chance. Stay away from this product. 1
I am not sure if it is tea-kind related, but neither me or my husband liked the weird after taste of tobacco. 2
My dog sometimes eats this and sometimes walks away. What can I say...looks good to me, but hes the dog. 3
They taste pretty good. I eat one of these with some of the poultry selections from Omaha Steaks. It makes a great meal. 4
A great alternative to Carb full popcorn!  Warm and satisfying snack.  Salty and crispy.  Remember to watch carefully in the microwave, the bag does not pop up so its a little trial & error the first time or two.  You'll know when theyre done when you open the bag and everybody looks fluffy. 5
I was particularly excited to try Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds when they arrived in the mail today as I love chocolate and I love nuts.<br /><br />Five individuals ranging in age from 2 to 50 tried these together and shared feedback. A few common threads emerged.<br /><br />1. Chocolate doesn't come off on your hands: Very convenient as there is almost no residue left on hands even after holding a handful of nuts for a minute.<br /><br />2. Very subtle chocolate flavor: For some this is a plus and for some this is a negative. You know the chocolate is there, but in my opinion it just leave you wanting more chocolate. I couldn't eat more than 10 or so for that reason. They were just plain frustrating. This was the consensus of 4 out of the 5 taste testers. The fifth loved them and plans on finishing off my canister and probably ordering more. They are definitely not milk chocolately, but have barely discernible, subtle dark chocolate undertones.<br /><br />3. Dry: We all needed to drink water immediately after tasting the nuts as they dried our mouths out, much more than normal salted or roasted almost or any other nut for that matter. Three of us described them as tasting "burnt" or "too roasted".<br /><br />4. We keep eating them: Even though I'm not crazy about these nuts -  in fact only one of us was - we keep coming back for more about every hour or so. I get frustrated every time I do, either wanting a chocolate bar or just some plain old chocolate. Perhaps this is a good trait in a snack, that you can't keep eating them ad nauseum.<br /><br />Other observations<br />The 11 oz ergonomically comfortable container is about 8 inches tall and fits perfectly in your hand or in the cup holder of the car. The lid is screw-on rather than flip-top. The package contains 11 servings of 150 calories apiece (120 calories from fat), 13 grams of fat, six grams of carbs, and 6 grams of protein. Very much the same as other nut products.<br /><br />The conclusion? If you aren't sure already that you love these nuts, buying a four-pack might be too much for you. But if you love them, you love them, as evidenced by our one taste tester and many of the other reviews. I'd recommend trying a smaller volume before ordering in bulk here. 3
I bought this cherry juice from a local Harris Twitter and loved it.  It taste very fresh, clearly better than juice reconstituted from concentrate.  But it's too expensive here at Amazon!  I think I bought it for $6-7/bottle from the local store.  Was hoping to find it here cheaper but quite the opposite.  Disappointed. 4
This is a challenging review because it is a product for an important member of the family, our 13 year old dog.<br /> As she has aged, she has come to prefer moist canned food and we balance it with dry to help her teeth, breath and overall diet.<br /><br />I find I agree that " Chef Michael's Sirloin Steak" product does appear to be candy-like  for dogs. The product, while seemingly liked, does seem to be varied in overall value when one looks at the total  ingredients.  A product called " Chef Michael's Sirloin Steak" does sound balanced, but the bag content shows a large amount of soy and corn and by-products.  Other reviewers have commented on the specifics of what many of those by-products actually contain, and it gives one pause.<br /><br />I do wonder why the product has "added colors" as I was always told dogs were color blind, which implies a marketing spin rather than a quality perspective. One must understand the spin to the ones who make the actual purchase.<br /><br />The positives:  dogs seem to like the product and beef (as contrasted with fillers and by products) is listed as the #1 ingredient<br /><br />The negatives:  the supplementary fillers, a less than great aroma and the cost at $2.20+ per pound makes one need to evaluate<br /><br />Dr. John Hogan CHA CHE CMHS<br />HospitalityEducators<br />Hogan Hospitality 3
The order came in as expected but just being curious, we decided to count the amounts of each of the flavors which come in the "varied assortment" as stated by the supplier.  We received 36 strawberry yogurt, 33 watermelon, 24 cherry, 21 strawberries & cream, 18 fresh strawberries, 18 vanilla/chocolate, 17 mango, 13 orange.<br /> Seems I used to remember more vanilla, vanilla & chocolate, and chocolate flavors, but there weren't enough in the "selection" sent and it's not like you can ask for any particular ones. You get what you get.<br />  Probably won't order this again.  Never been a fan of watermelon. Wish I could find the ice cream flavors Chupa Chups used to make. I had a huge tin container ages ago.<br />Oh Well, maybe your selections of flavors will be different. 3
The Dagoba dark chocolate bar did not taste good. They taste like artificial chocolate. I had to throw them away. Learn and live. 1
Got this for my dog as the vet advised that she go on a low-protein/low-phosperous diet to maintain kidney health. Dog LOOOVVVVESSSS it, but don't sniff the can, just trust that it smells bad, and keep your nose away!!! Otherwise, you WILL have regrets!!!!<br /><br />Would give this a 5-star except that it doesn't outline how much regular dogfood to feed with it. I'm having to play by ear. 4
This is the only food my daughter will eat consistly. She really enjoys it. The packaging is great. Never had any broken (having ordered 4 times). 5
This product should be taken off the market!  It tasted fine, I had a small piece and had the most terrible gas,<br />bloating, pain and diarhea! I took Imodium and it finally calmed down after a couple of hours.  DON'T eat ANY if you have any type of digestive issues! 3
I bought this item and it doesn't work on my Nespresso Citiz which I bought in 2010. And this is unreturnable item. Want to save money and actually lost money. 1
I made this coffee and shared it with people in my office.  The consensus opinion was that it has the flavor found in many other brands identified as french roast, but is not as overpowering as brands like Starbucks.  It was difficult to judge the lower acidity.  I usually drink decaf, partially due to acidity issues, and reacted about the same to the Puroast Low Acid as I do to most decafs. 4
I heard of these through my weight watchers magazine. They a had a $5 coupon code so I figured "what the heck!". WOW -- pop chips are amazing - every flavor is AWESOME! I particularly liked the salt & pepper. If you want crunch and flavor - these are for you!! 5
I inadvertently purchased this product instead of Spry brand (my sister - unfamiliar with unhealthy additives - had purchased XyloBurst and the name must've stuck in my brain when I went to reorder my usual Spry and I got the two confused).<br /><br />It's very irritating when these items sold on Amazon do NOT contain the product label listing the ingredients.  This forces quality/health-concious individuals to waste valuable time locating this information on the web.  (I've learned that if it's not listed in their ad to just keep on moving because every product I've ever had to FIND the information myself ended up being something I would NOT buy.  Quality manufacturers proudly 'boast' their ingredients.  Some do that as well as proudly list the 'unsavory' ingredients NOT in their product.)<br /><br />Other than having ARTIFICIAL flavors and TITANIUM DIOXIDE, it DOES have Xylitol and a robust cinnamon "flavor" but I'll be sticking with the Spry brand. 3
My daughter likes a little pick me up in the am before school.  She likes the cute little bottle of this Oolong shot. 4
Being a gluten sensitive individual, I was lured into a false sense of security when I read the simple ingredients on this Amazon info page.<br /><br />Because I didn't first do my homework, and read the labels before I began consuming these, I ended up having a massive asthma attack.  Just wanted to let everyone who has these sensitivities/allergies to avoid this product. 1
I am happy with this purchase. Shiitake mushrooms are supposed to be a very healthy food, and these 1 oz packages make it easy to keep a supply on hand. They taste fine too. 4
I agree with the others and had them resend it to me requesting better packaging.  Nothing changed and I received the next 2 shipments in the same condition as my first. 1
trying out different pods and this is a delicious one. service was excellent. no hassle at all. will buy from again 4
A look at the seasoning ingredients and I thought I would love this mix-organic jalapeno, organic cilantro, organic lime juice, organic spices- it's full of things I love. However, when I received the mix and tasted it I was overwhelmed. I thought maybe it was just too concentrated so I also purchased a bag of the go raw naked seed mix and mixed them half and half. There's just something off about the flavor, it doesn't taste right. I have only eaten them by themselves however, so they might be okay if sprinkled on a salad, but definitely not something I could just snack on by themselves. I won't purchase them again. 2
Something changed in the past year (it's December 2011) and Eight O'Clock Columbian has officially fallen off of the great-coffee radar.  What a shame, I'm off to find something that's as good as this once was. 2
Always a winner, been around for decades of enjoyment!  Two flavors included in box. 4
FunBites MiniCongo's for digestive support are the perfect size treat for my 30lbs mutt, Tuna.  She went nuts over them, and think it is because of the peanut butter flavor.  She had quite a few hours of fun.<br /><br />Like other FunBite products they are a huge mess.  There are large chunks all over the place! Unlike other treats, Tuna did not go back to lick up her crumbs, she just abandoned them.  I though this was odd.  Also, I am not sure exactly how these are supposed to sooth digestion, but it seems to give Tuna diarrhea.<br /><br />She liked them, but it does not look like they liked her.  I am not sure if I can give her any more, especially now that I see all these other reviews.  Please use your best judgment and monitor your dog after use. 3
These are great, but I read horror stories about dogs choking or being unable to digest it so I have decided not to give them to my dog anymore. However, there was an article indicating that they changed the ingredients so that there wouldn't be a choking hazard, but I would rather be safe than sorry. 3
As an avid tea drinker of all corners of the earth, I have had hundreds of teas, and everything from this company as well. I read about this tea as a very powerful health herb but all the reviews said it tastes bad. What do I care? I'd rather be healthy. I never take sugar in my tea either. If you've read this far you are waiting for me to say how bad it was. You can't imagine how bad it is. Without exaggeration I would describe the flavor as a very bitter tasting dirt. Yes, as a 32 year old with children I know what dirt tastes like and this tastes like dirt but with a super bitter taste that makes it hard to drink. My recommendation is to let it steep for a shorter amount of time as to not make a rich bold tea. As you know, the longer it steeps the bolder the tea becomes. Yea, don't do that with this. Four stars because it is apparently very good for you and I thank the company for bringing it to us regardless of the taste of death when other tea companies are using Artificial ingredients to make their teas taste better. 4
I purchased one pound of Now brand stevia extract for $63.61. The overly large container is labeled "Better Stevia" "Certified Organic". Ingredient:Organic Stevia Extract Powder. I found I needed to use at least five times more stevia powder to get a similar sweetness as the Kal brand. I returned it for a refund.<br />Avoid this. Buy:[[ASIN:B000VRSR84 Pure Stevia Extract Powder - 3.5 oz - Powder] 1
This stuff is transcendence in a can!  I swear its that good.  The vanilla flavor is perfect, not too sweet to be artifical, and not too malted to taste funky.<br />Its velvety smooth and absolutely perfect around the holidays. (although we drink it year 'round.) Like other fans, I order it by the case for myself and my family at home, I take a can or two to work, and usually giving more away as parts of gift baskets and things like that.  Its perfect paired with fresh baked cookies or alone with a good book when you want to snuggle up and feel relaxed.<br />I dont drink coffee, so Im a connesiur of cocoa-type drinks...this stuff is amazing!  Get some and you will see exactly what I mean. 5
It says Habenero peppers on the ingredients, but my guess is they just waved it over the closed bottle. Smells like molasses and soy sauce. Taste like molasses and soy sauce. Absolutely boring. 1
I love ramen type soups.  I've tried many over the years.  This Gourmet Spicy Picante is ok. The noodles are your regular, fried ramen...a tad thicker then common grocery store noodles.  One trick I use is after cooking the noodles, I rinse with water well...it takes that starchy flavor away that I don't care for and makes a fresher tasting soup.  The heat of this is strong, use a quarter packet to start, you can always build up.  Not much more flavor going on except the heat of the chili.<br /><br />I do love the Hoo Roo Rook noodles; they aren't fried and the noodles are round to fit your saucepan.  They aren't in the same heat category as these noodles, but they are nice for a more 'tender' palate that likes things not-so-spicy.<br /><br />*NEWSFLASH*  Okay, I'm coming to the end of this box of Spicy Picante and realized that I would sort of miss having my mouth burning while eating soup this winter...so on that note, I just may buy this noodle again -- it's a heat that kind of grows on you.  I did order the spicy seafood flavor and will see how that one goes.  All in all, this is an acquired hotness that takes getting used to if you're not used to heat (like me). 3
Consider purchasing a different product, this juice is contained in plastic #7, one known for BPA and is widely told to avoid, especially for babies!!! 1
I was expecting cheese as it states. I can't even tell you how salty these cheese crisps are. I brought them in to my job has three different people try them and I couldn't give then away. Every person I had try said they were gross.... Please re think this product. 1
My packages came with tiny pits and pieces. :-(  Not one piece was bigger than my thumb nail.  The picture is deceiving.  The texture is good, but the overly salty flavor seems like it actually masks the taste of salmon.  And believe me I LOVE SALTY foods, which is why i was drawn to this.  I would not order this again because only the color resembled salmon, the rest was too small and salty to tell.  Very disappointed. 2
This package of dried fruits and nuts is the same one you find at COSTCO, but I purchased via Amazon because I currently don't have a COSTCO store nearby.  The dried fruits are all sweet and tasty.  I am not a big nut lover so I only gave 4 star rating.  Overall a good deal if you compare prices to grocery stores. 4
For reference, my "morning coffee" is a doubleshot of espresso, hot and very lightly sweetened with brown sugar in the winter, unsweetened over ice in the summer.<br /><br />This morning, I had this, first on its own (ick), and then over ice (slightly better). There is no part of me that's tempted to replace my morning routing with a can of this, easy as it might be.<br /><br />Really, it wasn't horrible. It tasted an awful lot like the other big brand's version of this, which, unfortunately (and I know this sounds horrible), tastes to me like, well, like coffee smells when it's exiting the body. Maybe this is just me, but it's something of a turn-off, and is true for both that other brand and for this one.<br /><br />I didn't really enjoy the texture of this drink, either -- kind of syrupy and thick, when it seems like without cream it should be pretty watery. It was also waaaay sweeter than I would ever want my coffee to be, but given that I generally prefer an unsweetened cold coffee, I'm not sure how much stock you want to put in that.<br /><br />Overall, if you like that other brand's version of this product, I don't see why you wouldn't like this, but if you're hoping for something better -- I don't think this is it. 3
In the past I was able to get a simular product from the grocery store.  And since that product is no longer being made by Nabisco I branched out.  In my searching is when I found Crawford's Garibaldi Biscuits.<br /><br />They are definitely not the same, but I really enjoyed these and will order more. 4
ok, maybe the worst flavor of the 6 I have tried Mio flavors; loved all of them except this one. Strange aftertaste, very chemically. Interesting one other reviewer and family loved it. Wonder if its like how asparagus reacts different in different people's bodies. Anyway, had high hopes for this as love blueberries, lemonade, and other Mio flavors, but didn't pan out. Favorites so far are the two Teas, Strawberry Watermelon, and the plain Lemonade. 2
Sorry but I think natural organic and Made in China does not mix for my children. I think American apple concentrate is what I want. 1
I HATED this coffee.  I'm much more of a Starbucks or Peet's loyalist, so maybe I'm a bit spoiled.  But after reading many positive reviews of this company I decided to give it a try.  Big mistake.  I had a hard time giving it away.  It definitely tastes like chicory.  Blagk.  Bad news. 1
I repeat, carbonated fruit drinks can be too sugary. This drink reminds me of other orange soda brands without the extra sugar that combined with the metallic can always leaves an odd taste in my mouth. Orangina has a bit more flavor, but Switch Tangerine Orange is light and refreshing,. 4
I must not be enough of a salt afficionado to be able to tell the difference in taste between this and regular sea salt.  It looks marvelous in a salt grinder ball, but other than that, it tastes like salt.  I gave it as a gift to my husband along with a couple of other varieties and a grinder and he was pleased, mostly for the visual appeal.<br />I would have given a 5 if I had been able to discern any difference in flavor with this on my food. 4
This is a good tasting K-cup from a guy who drinks coffee black and prefers a bold, full flavored taste. I would recommend. 4
I was a little skeptical about switching over to this brand but I'm happy to say, my dog loves this stuff. I don't even need to add leftover meat scraps or gravy sauce like I did to his old food. This stuff is way better than the crap they sell at those chain stores. Can't beat the price with S&S! Also love that they come in smaller resealable bags which keeps the food fresh. Better to open up a brand new bag every couple weeks than to leave a huge opened bag of kibble in the pantry for months. 5
The product is fine - we buy this dog food anyway, but we found it's cheaper for us to buy it right in our home town. 3
Delicious and easy to make. I make mine with milk and it comes out extra creamy and rich. You can pour boiling water or hot milk onto the cereal to cook it, or you can heat it in the microwave (be careful about if boiling over. I like the Maple Brown sugar just as much as the Cinnamon. 4
By now I've eaten half the bag so I know what's in here. Sure, their beef jerky is pretty tender. But for some reason they decided to throw in an insane amount of salt. I've had store-bought beef jerky and I've had quality Amazon beef jerky and this is definitely the saltiest by at least double. The first time I ate this, I could only handle 2 strips before I had to put it down again. My friend made a disgusted face and refused to have another bite. Luckily I am a salt lover so I can at least tolerate the extreme saltiness. But it's still too salty.<br /><br />Next up is the gristle. Sometimes amidst the generally tender bites there will be a mat of unchewable mass that I pretty much have to spit out or swallow whole. It happens more often than other brands and definitely more than I care for. Secondly, I don't know if it's the salt playing tricks on me, but the texture and taste is a bit worse than other brands, like they use lower quality jerky.<br /><br />Overall I believe that Wild Ride is less quality than most other brands, even when you factor in the low price. There are similarly priced brands that are of higher quality and lower sodium content. I don't know why they sell so well. Personally my next bulk order beef jerky will be with someone else. 2
With all of the choices of things to drink, this is an excellent one. It tastes great. Most of our choices are either loaded with sugar, or carbonated ... even milk is sugar-dense. This drink is good for blood pressure and cholesterol. It is an excellent thirst-quencher. So much better for the hot summer months than sugary lemonade! It does, however acidify the pH. I am supposed to be alkalizing my diet, so I can't drink a lot of this. :(<br /><br />From the time I was a small child, my mother was an advocate of apple cider vinegar and honey for health. Hippocrates would have been happy to discover Bragg Organic Apple Cider Vinegar All Natural Drink: Concord Grape Acai :))) Try it and drink to good health! 5
Note, the back of the package gives you options as to what you can add to the mix.  There is a cake-like optin, fudgy, non-oil, etc...  I used the "fudgy" recipe and it was FABULOUS!  They had a wonderful flavor.  I got them on a whim, suspecting one of my children may have a problem with gluten.  Even if he tests ok, I will buy these again, I actually prefer in some ways to the Duncan Hines brand I normally use.  My son has eaten them up!  We do not notice any aftertaste (which has been mentioned in other reviews).  Maybe they used a different recipe than fudgy?  I actually did notice the chocolate had a very rich taste, like they used a high quality coco powder. 5
I feed Hills Science diet to my pet because I love him and the vet tells me I should. But in all honesty, this product has what is quite certainly the worst snap-lock reseal that I have ever encountered. It is painfully difficult to get it to close properly; and even when it is resealed as best it can be there are still gaps on the side that allow air in to oxidize the product.<br /><br />Packaging IS important. It is no better for your pet to live on stale, oxidized food than it would be for you. Oxidized fats are also called rancid. If you imagine how healthy a rancid diet is for a human... well, you get the idea. This is about more than just inconvenience.<br /><br />I am posting this review for all the Hills Science diet products with this kind of packaging. If you have had the same experience as me with this product, please take the time to let this company know about it.<br /><br />I love my animal. I want to keep feeding him what the vet tells me is good for him. But this quite literally the worst reseal that I have ever had the misfortune to encounter.<br /><br />Theo. 1
All 5 of my cats liked both flavors preferring the Chinese chicken to the very watery pot pie. Although it does not state it is human grade, it certainly appears that it is by sight and smell. Both appeared to have a cornstarch based "gravy" with shredded or diced white chicken meat and diced carrots. I took my cats gobbling it down that it was tasty. I was surprised all of them liked both flavors as 2 of my cats are rather finicky. This cat food reminds me of a similar product Whole Foods used to carry in their brand name that I bought on a clearance sale. I alternate buying dry and canned food by Castor & Pollux's (regular and organic), Natural Balance, AvoDern, and By Nature (regular and organic). I feed them regular canned during the week and organic canned food on the weekends. The only issue I have w/ this product is the price point. The brands previously listed range from 5.5 to 6.5 oz. (By Nature-only 12 6.5 cans) and none are watery. They cost the same per can or you could view it as almost half price since the weight is almost double. Since I'm feeding 5 cats approximately 3oz. canned per day and all the dry they can eat at about $2/oz., I try to be as cost effective as possible while only purchasing those high quality products which I also consider this cat food to be. If you read up on pet food in general, you will no longer purchase poor quality food such as Friskies, Iiams, Science Diet, Fancy Feast, etc. If you go to PETCO or Care A-Lot(they carry better brands than PetSmart) and read the ingredient list you will be shocked, appalled, and enlightened. Cats do not well tolerate wheat, corn or soy and NO pet should EVER be fed animal by-products (see pet food at About.com for more information). Since Amazon currently has a [...] coupon off of [...] purchase, I will likely go ahead and purchase the crab flavor and the mixed fish case. Keep in mind you should limit the amount of tuna fed to your cat as well as to your children and any adult (see FDA website for tuna cautions and listed safe fish to eat). I hope in the future Petite Cuisine produces a more cost effective 5-6 ounce can sold in a 24 can case. 4
The quality of this cat food is excellent, with fish broth and the named fish (tuna, red snapper, sole, shrimp, or yellowfin) listed as the first (i.e., primary) ingredients.  It is 100% nutritionally complete, with no grain fillers.  When you pop the top on the single-serve can, it looks and smells like exactly what it is -- fish and shrimp.  Obviously, the fish smells like fish, but it's a natural, clean fish smell, not a nasty cat-food odor.  I swear, the steamed tuna and shrimp, with its whole shrimp, looked good enough to set out with crackers for a human appetizer!<br /><br />Although I would feed this food to my cats without hesitation, I felt I had to downgrade it one star because of the cats' opinions.  I fed this to three family cats, and being cats, each had its own opinion, but none endorsed it 100%.  One cat loved the steamed tuna and shrimp, one wouldn't go near it.  One gobbled up the yellowfin tuna, two picked at and left most of it.  My son's cat is notoriously fussy about canned food, and ate only one of these entrees with enthusiasm; my two cats are notoriously unfussy, but ate only two wholeheartedly (however, they usually prefer poultry flavors to fish).<br /><br />Petite Cuisine comes in handy single-serving cans and, as I mentioned, contains excellent ingredients with no foul odor or appearance.  If your cat generally likes fish flavors and you are looking for a high quality, healthy cat food, I would certainly recommend trying Petite Cuisine. 4
The best canned clam chowder I've found currently available.  Very light, nicely seasoned, creamy taste.  Not fishy or oniony.  Good amount of minced clams per serving.  To find better chowder, it would have to be homemade. 5
I love Vita Coco Brand coconut water! The Pom + Acai is not very good though... My favorite is the passion fruit by far but this acai + pom is just not very refreshing even when cold. It does have an exotic taste when u first try it, but by the end of the box ur left with not wanting more for a long time. There is a reason this one is the cheapest... 2
Wasn't sure I'd really care for this tea - as a k-cup option.  It's WONDERFUL! It's the perfect blend of tea and all you have to do is brew it in a minute. Add a touch of honey and sit and relax while the tea warms you up! 5
This food is very good and my dogs love it, the only concern is that it has a high level of fat (18%), part of the reason why dogs like it so much 4
This tastes like sweetened lemonade that has been heated up and heavily doused with ginger.  There is more sweetness than tartness to the lemon portion, and the ginger is very strong.  It makes your whole mouth and throat tingle.  I really was not impressed with this hot drink.  I'd much rather drink an herbal lemon tea or  ginger tea, but not this.  I couldn't even finish the cup, and no one else in the family would try it either.  The combination of its muddy tan color and its smell turned them off.  On a positive note, the powder completely and quickly dissolved in the hot water. 2
Upon hearing that I love chocolate, a friend sent this. I ate a couple of pieces and threw the rest away. It was waxy and not the least bit sweet. Choxie is creamier and more flavorful than this stuff. 2
Does it taste good? Yes. If you like the taste and texture of coconut butter, you will most certainly like this product.<br /><br />Does it spread nicely? Well, that depends on where you live and how patient you are. In cold weather this is a royal pain to use because the oil separates and hardens at temperatures below 76 F. The instructions on the label say to place the container in hot water for 5 to 10 minutes to soften the manna. Well, in my kitchen (room temperature about 70 F) it took almost a half hour for this thing to melt.<br /><br />I placed the jar inside a stainless steel saucepan filled with hot water that must have been at least 180 F. After 5 minutes the water had cooled quite a bit and yet the oil had not even started to melt. I used a blunt knife to try and break the manna into pieces. Did the same thing two more times. Finally, the fourth water change did the trick and the manna now had acquired a nice consistency, perfect for spreading, but at that point I was not a very happy camper.<br /><br />I wanted to use this as a breakfast spread and that's not going to happen, at least not during the week. I just don't have the time nor the patience. It just takes too long.<br /><br />I buy natural organic peanut butter, which also must be mixed well for the oil to combine, but I only have to do that once so I don't mind at all. With this manna it's an everyday event.<br /><br />I ordered two jars, one of them will live in my pantry until next summer, and we'll treat coconut manna as a warm weather food, I guess.<br /><br />This is a very nice tasting coconut product, which I would have rated 5 stars otherwise. Certainly worth a try, if you happen to keep your house above 75 F year round. 4
I love the flavor that this hot chocolate has.  It is very rich and smooth.  Have tried other brands but did not get the results I wanted.  I will definately be ordering from this company again. 5
Not terrible coffee, but definitely not much of the French Vanilla flavor compared to others I've tried. This coffee also seems to have a bit of a bitter aftertaste. Thought it was worth a shot on sale. 2
StumbleUpon users, be wary. I was browsing when I stumbled upon an article about miracle berries- a cool new fad that apparently causes things to taste different than they normally would. Naturally, I tried to see where I could get my hands on some.<br /><br />Once I found the mberry Miracle Fruit Tablets, I did some research. I always look at a lot of reviews and alternatives before buying anything on Amazon. The price was relatively cheap, I figured, if it worked as advertised. The aggressive claims on the product's page and the Amazon user reviews also furthered my need to investigate this mystery product, so I bought two packs- one for me and one for my friend.<br /><br />After both of us trying the Miracle Berry tablets, I'd have to say that the product is extremely overhyped, and the experience was, unfortunately, lacking.<br /><br />The way mberry talks about their tablets, you'd expect to have a Willy Wonka-esque food tasting bonanza. Sadly, this isn't the case, and though the tablets do change the flavors of many foods to a degree, it's much more subtle than you'd probably like- no Snozzberries here. I found this to be the case for me, and I was hoping maybe my taste buds were maybe just a bit more dull, but my friend reported the same experience.<br /><br />I'm giving the product 2 stars, not because I hated the product, but because I was very let down with the experience and taking that fact into consideration, I don't think it's worth the money. 2
i was recently diagnosed w/ gestational diabetes... thus began my quest for a yummy protein bar... this isn't it. i'm giving it 2 stars because my blood sugar levels were within the desired range after having it as a snack. i'm going to try the other flavors, but this one definitely is not one i'd like to have again. 2
This product would be fine, I'm sure, had it been fresh.  Mine has an old, rancid smell and flavor as if it had been stored in a hot warehouse or garage.  I'm sure it all depends on the seller. 1
I was taking Fenugreek along with Alfalfa and mothers milk tea for months to increase my supply and I the combo had. Then my baby became very gassy and making our lives miserable. I suspected everything from my food to the supplements. I tried cutting different foods then reintroducing them and no change. Finally I decidedvto read up in the supplements and found that in 20% of babies Fenugreek causes gas and/or fussiness.<br /><br />So the next day I stopped taking it. Now 1 week has passed and not only has my baby's gassiness gone away I oddly feel that I have more milk.<br /><br />I'm sure this works for some so can't say it's bad. Just be aware that this can happen. 2
Tried one and it was horrible.  My son is 11 months old and have been eating cereals for a while (mix of Earth's Best and Gerber organic).  This is the first one that he doesn't like.  When I first opened the can, it smells like green apple candy.  However, the taste does not have any apple flavor, or even "grain-flavor" like the other cereals but a little weird/chemical tasting; not exactly sure how to describe it.<br /><br />Back to Gerber & EB for my son... 1
I was a little disappointed with this soda.  True, it's all natural and only fruit juice sweetened, but it's too sweet for my taste.  I diluted it with cold water, and enjoyed it.  I don't drink fruit "drinks" that are not 100% juice, so I thought this would be good.  I prefer the fresh, clean taste of the Knudsen spritzers.<br /><br />So if you're looking for a more natural fruit soda, this might be what you're looking for.  If you want a refreshing juice with some fizz, try the Knudsen spritzers. 4
I remember trying one as a child.. SPICY! I spat it out instantly because the ginger flavor is so overwhelmingly strong. People seem to love it though, but it doesn't suit my palate. 3
I feel good about giving these to my dog because of the organics bit. I have one of those dogs who will eat almost anything.  She sits pretty for these, then takes them.  She doesn't devour them immediately or swallow whole like she does a lot of other snacks I give her.  She drops, sniffs and then carries it off to eat slowly under the bed.  That's probably not a bad thing.  It also may have something to do with the shape.  They are rectangular, about 1"x 2" and about 1/8 of an inch thick.  They are scored so you can break them into squares. They are very dry, crunchy treats.  I believe that is the reason she drops them and picks them up is because of the flat wide/long shape; she has to get them situated in her mouth.  She is an 8-year-old, 21 lbs mutt...looks like a miniature Chow Chow or a really large Pom...meaning she has a normal snout, not like a pug or peke. Anyway, these are slightly too large for her mouth, so if your dog is smaller, they may not work so well. 5
We have been transitioning our 4 cats over from the crap Purina makes to Wellness, and for most of the flavors, they love it. They like it much better than Friskies. Yesterday was the first time we tried the Salmon and Trout flavor, and absolutely none of them would touch it. They left it in their dishes all day and went hungry.<br /><br />I'll still give it 3 stars, because overall Wellness is better than anything else out there. Just be sure to test out the different flavors on your cats before committing to any bulk orders. 3
My family loves oatmeal so much we eat it for snacks.  This is our favorite flavor so it doesn't last long around here.  It's simple to fix in the microwave and it's delicious!  We usually have two packets for breakfast and one when we eat it for a snack. 4
This was absolutely horrible. It had no peanut butter flavor at all, I could only taste chocolate, and that wasn't even very good. The worst part was the texture. It was very grainy with no real crunch. Just not pleasant, at all. 1
These individually packed milk is great for on-the-road.  Does not need to be stored in the frig.  This item came in 6 packs of 3.  Then shipped in its original box and then another Amazon box over it.  The content was securely packed and I was not worried that the milk got 'dirty' during shipping.  The price is the same as in local grocery store but shipping to the house saved me from dragging them from the store while my toddler is jumping up and down the store aisle. The only reason that I did not give it 5 stars is because of the expiration date.  It is Mar 2012 which is not too far away.  I just bought one from Target(because I forgot to bring one and my toddler was restless) and it has an expiration date of Sept 2012.  Overall, I would still recommend to buy from Amazon. 4
have not tried the tea yet, i purchased it after reviewing an article by Dr Oz that that suggest using this mixed with another tea to boost ones metabolism 3
I used to buy this sugar for years. I do not eat much sugar, but still. This sugar is called turbinado sugar, but is misleading. I picked this brand just because it says real turbinado sugar, and other brands (in the local food store) that their sugar is brown because it is colored with caramel or something.<br /><br />HOW did i find out? I needed just a sweet water few days ago. I put this Sugar in The Raw in the glass. The water became brown and on the bottom of the glass i got just PURE WHITE SUGAR CRYSTALS!!!!! What a shame on the producer! U can try to put this sugar in your mouth and after few seconds you will spit out pure white crystals as well.<br /><br />I'm just wondering if the consumers can hold the company liable for such a practice. 1
Used these food writers this weekend to write Happy Birthday on a piece of fondant on a cake - there was hardly any ink!  I had to go over it and over it again.  Wish I hadn't spent $17 on these. 1
I thought these were really dry.  I definitely need a cup of coffee to wash them down.  I guess they are ok to throw in a bag to take with you in place of an energy bar or something.  I doubt I will buy again though. 3
I picked this up at the store after reading mixed reviews online. I am on a diet that is low calorie, sugars, and carbs; I've been missing a lot of foods as per usual so I was hoping that this would mix it up. Well it did.<br /><br />When you pick it up you can see that it is runny, which is a con in my book, but the flavors are pretty spot on. I added some extra seasoning like cayenne, paprika, and a pinch of salt. Possibly cooking it down would make it a bit thicker.<br /><br />If you're expecting some awesome hearty bbq sauce, this isn't it, but its a good substitute. I will definitely be finishing the bottle and would buy again.  (The 4/5 is for runny factor) 4
I do not consider Gingerbread, Spicy Eggnog, Caramel Apple Cider, Spiced Apple Cider summer items.... You cleaned off your self at my expense!  VERY DISAPPOINTED! 1
I have a 4 year old male cat who has chronic urinary tract infections.  I feed him this dry food in combination with wet food (with water added to it) and Uri Ease.  The combination seems to keeps his UTI's under control.  If I switch to another type of dry food, his UTI gets worse.  The other cats seem to enjoy this food as well.  It's expensive but it seems to be the best solution for me. 5
These are not only black sesame seeds.<br />Some other kinds of seeds (fennel?) are also in here.  This is a supreme disappointment, as when I purchase "black sesame seeds," I expect black sesame seeds.<br />These don't even smell like black sesame seeds.<br /><br />The kind from JFC is much better. 1
I bought this based on the reviews and the fact that I like The Ginger People chewy ginger. I bough 25 bags of this ginger and it's not spicy at all :(  It's a bit sugary with a hint of ginger.  Waste of money for me. Perhaps I got a bad batch... 2
Make your own jerky and save money.  This product has MSG in it.  It's bad for you and unhealthy.  Just look on youtube how to make it yourself.  You don't need preservatives in your homemade jerky if you eat it within the week. 1
I am a fan of Kashi products,but not of this cereal. It has almost no taste, and soon after pouring on milk you get a soggy bowl of yuck. I will never buy this kind again.There ain't no sunshine in this cereal...actually its gonna see alot of dark days ahead in my cupboard.Pass on it. 2
For 68oz totally, you can get same kind of olive oil(different brand) for $16 in Sam's. 2
I have tried Whole Foods 365 mayo and this Spectrum canola mayo.  Both taste like tangy, skunky Miracle Whip.  If you hate Miracle Whip, then you should NOT buy this mayo.  The only positive about this mayonnaise is that it does not have genetically modified soy oil or corn oil. 1
I usually drink Twinnings or Bigelow English Breakfast tea in bags, but I'm trying to switch to loose teas and this was my first attempt at English Breakfast.  The dry tea smells like English Breakfast to me, but once it is brewed it smells and tastes totally different, and I don't like the taste at all.  I followed the directions and I have tried different brewing times (2-5min), adding different amounts of milk and/or sugar.  Other people might like it, but be aware that it may not taste anything like what you expect. 1
I had bought Tortuga cakes in the past. I first had it on Air Jamaica and ever since then I've been hooked, they're always so moist and delicious. This is my first time buying from Amazon and I was a little disappointed because it was a little on the dry side. Maybe I just received a bad batch, or Tortuga changed and skimped on there rum.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CJSW5S">Tortuga Caribbean Rum Cake, Pineapple, 33-Ounce Box</a> 3
I love coffee, and have a terrible addiction to Starbucks! So, when I was in the coffee aisle looking for a nice flavor to try I saw the Starbucks Caramel Natural Fusions. I was so excited to set up my coffee maker so that all I had to do was hit the switch in the morning! There is nothing I love more than the smell of fresh coffee when a new package is opened but when I opened up this coffee I almost gagged. The smell was overwhelming, sort of like burnt dirt. It was extremely dark in color too, almost like soil. I still have yet to hit the brew button on the coffee maker tomorrow morn, but I figure I would give it a fair shot. After reading some of the reviews here tonight, I am already expecting to be tossing it down the drain. 1
OK this poor guy begged my daughter to make him my pecan pie and well she is a microwave girl! So for christmass what better way to a man than his stomach.  he now has pies he can pack in his lunch box.  They are sssooooo good. 5
I buy this French Roast as an alternative to Eight O'Clocks Italian Roast.  This has more 'bite' or astringency to it.  The Italian is smooth and almost chocolate in flavor.  I think they complement each other really well.  When I get a little bored with the smoothness of Italian Roast this is the best! 4
My vet suggested we put our yellow lab on an all venison diet.<br />I tried this brand and it seemed to work and her skin issues went away.<br /><br />I ordered another bag of the same product and noticed the texture of the kibble was different but didnt think much of it since the packaging was identical.<br /><br />My groomer noticed that my dog is loosing her hair and asked if we changed her food.<br /><br />I think the first bag was working but something must be different with this second bag.<br /><br />I'm going back to using the venison formula from our local dog food store. $20 more per bag but she wasn't loosing her hair.<br /><br />wish I could get a refund but the bag is half gone and wouldn't know how to return dog food. 1
I got a 6 month cheesecake order as a gift, and the first cheeesecake arrived packed in dry ice.  It was frozen and tasted great after a night in the fridge.<br /><br />The second cheesecake arrived spoiled.  They did not ensure rapid delivery of the cake and the dry ice melted while the cake was in transit.  When I called the company and asked for a replacement, they said that would be impossible, and that I would have to pick another product.  I asked to speak to a manager and the manager acted like it was my fault that the cake spoiled in transit, and said I was lucky that they were willing to give me anything.<br /><br />I've ordered other month clubs from other companies in the past, and never once had an item spoil prior to delivery.  And on the very rare occasion a product arrived damaged, other companies were very willing to make it up to me.  Amazing clubs made it very clear they had no interest in customer satisfaction. 1
This hot chocolate is pretty blah. Not very chocolatey and certainly not very strong. It's not the fault of the Keurig -- the Cafe Escapes Dark Chocolate is way better. 2
I love raspberry and chocolate.  I could live on Sees Raspberry chocolate truffles.  But this coffee, ugh.  Brewing it smells pretty nice, a bit fruity, not much chocolate.  In the mug- awful chemical processed cleaner/air freshener flavor (not that I am in the habit of eating those) but hot it just tastes artificial. It does have some sweet taste to it, but even adding milk and sugar do not make it drinkable.<br /><br />If I let it sit around (and really, I bought the Keurig so I could have coffee NOW when I wanted it, not in 10 minutes) and it cools, it becomes passable.  But only barely.  The chemical flavor dissipates and it is drinkable, but only because after spending that much on coffee, I feel obligated to.<br /><br />Spare yourself the torture, skip this coffee, unless you like the taste of lysol, then it might be for you! 2
Delicious, pretty good stuff. Its sweet and not like chewing on leather like some products I've tried. Deffinately worth the money and for people who dont like crazy hot jerky but still like a little bite, this is for you 5
Try this you might like it. I did and I am quite addicted, it is too easy to prepare, it tastes great and it absorbs the flavors you cook it with. The price is really good and well worth the purchase. If you like this type of Couscous like I do, then give this one a try.It can be eaten hot, room temp or in a cold salad with a variety of greens and other flavors, it takes on the other flavors very well when mixed. I cooked the Couscous with a broth and oilive oil for added flavor and it rocked my taste buds big time. I will be back for more. 5
This is very powdery milk.  When I pour it out of the bag it flies everywhere.  This makes it messy to use. 4
We love Hazelnut coffee, but this just didn't have enough coffee flavor in it for me. Kind of on the weak side in my opinion. I'll keep looking. 3
Definitely not extra bold...medium roast at best.  Not particularly memorable...doesn't have a good coffee aroma...but it's pretty decent tasting.  At this point I'm not sure if I would reorder. 4
I've heard that some grade B Maple syrups are too strong.  Maybe so, but this stuff is excellent.  This is the second quart we've received, and the flavour is perfect.  A bit stronger than grade A, but sweet, and very pleasant to my taste.<br /><br />PERSONAL TASTE NOTE: I also like my honey straight from the hive, and unfiltered honey is sometimes a bit stronger, as well, as it has bits of pollen and comb mixed in.  That being said, I have friends who are more finicky and they like this batch of syrup, as well. 5
I am always on the  lookout for good old fashioned candy. Funny I do not even have a sweet tooth. However I really appreciate a quality candy. I picked up one these purely for the fantastic packing they come in. After just one taste it was obvious that the company has put love and care into producing these candies.  If you are looking for unique smooth and delicious old fashion candy look no further. Highly recommended. 5
I make my own baby food but when we travel I give my daughter plum organics and happy baby food. She likes them a lot so i wanted to try something with meat. This product has good reviews so I ordered it thinking you can't go wrong with sweet potatoes and chicken. But i was wrong it taste bad.My daughter won't eat it even when she is starving. She actually didn't want to eat anything for few hours after she tried it first time. I even spiced it up a little bit hoping that she likes it but nope:(I don't blame her.I don't like it either.<br /><br />Update: Few months later I reintroduced my daughter this product and she seems to like it now. She ate it well for week when we were traveling. I ordered another one for our upcoming trip. 2
Frankly, I was expecting this to be a nuttier version of Honey Nut Cheerios as the product looks pretty much the same only this one appears to be covered in nuts.  Not the case!  I couldn't taste anything remotely nutty in this cereal, just honey and sugar.  The taste reminded me of that kid's cereal, Honeycomb, really both in taste and texture.  I was hoping for a cereal with more 'adult' flavors, or at least something nuttier, and this cereal didn't deliver that for me.  For anyone who likes a super-sweet breakfast cereal this would be good for you; if you are looking for something nutty and not too sweet, I would keep looking. 3
The cookie part is ok, but the filling is not good at all. It is dry and splinters apart when bitten into. The taste is barely noticeable and then all of a sudden there is an odd chemical frosting taste. *sigh* I will continue searching for a gluten free cookie, but have resigned myself to the fact that I will have to cook most everything from scratch from now on. On the bright side, it will certainly make me plan ahead better and a more inventive cook. 2
My daughter was put on the orange goodstart at birth.  But after going through several long nights, and her screaming bloody murder before she'd potty (she went two days without going potty), her doctor switched over to this formula.  She never spit up and she burped much easier on this. She started pooping 2-3 times a day. Although it was still hard balls, she didn't scream and it didn't smell as bad. Her dr. said she's still constipated and that is why her poop is so hard. So they have switched her yet again to the natural cultures in the green can. She's only been on it for 24 hours and has already started showing gas signs and has been spitting up all evening. Not sure if she just needs time to adjust or what. I know with the blue soy she seemed to have been doing much much better.<br />Only thing I dont like about the soy formula is the greasy residue it leaves in the bottles. You have to let them soak in hot water in order to clean them properly. 3
I bought this once and it really helped me and got my energy up. So I bought it again and I just got sick of it. As for energy it does it's job but when it comes to taste, I can't say it's the best. 3
i am very particular about dark roast.<br />This brew stands top shelf with tullys french roast and starbucks pike roast<br />good good good 5
English toffee should be firm and chewy but it doesn't stay that way and, with age it begins to soften. I don't know how old this toffee was, but it was way past it's "sell by" date-no "sell by" was printed on the container. Quite a disappointment.<br />Les Jones 1
I have tried several types of gf bread mixes with no problems.  For some reason, I can't get this one to set properly.  Every one of the three attempts I had resulted in bread that was wet in the middle.  I followed the ingredients and used my tried and true bread maker.  Each time, the bread was not done inside.  I would not recommend. 2
There's no denying that coffee singles are convenient for people who don't drink coffee every day or don't want to deal with the hassle of cleaning out the coffee maker (like myself).  However, the coffee from these singles is rather bland, with not much taste and no body.  Personally, I'm not convinced that theses singles are that much better than instant coffee.  Use them for the caffeine, not the taste. 2
I don't use sugar in my coffee or tea and this product has sugar in it. It is way too sugary for me but otherwise had a pleasant coffee taste, not bitter and very smooth to drink. This is an espresso based product so it will be high in caffeine.<br /><br />If you are not used to strong coffee flavors then this might overpower you but if you are used to espresso or very strong coffees, then you might like the flavor of this coffee drink. It is rich tasting but not overpowering. But if you are like me and do not like sugar, then you will be disappointed with the sweetness of this coffee drink.<br />If you use sugar in your coffee and also like strong coffee flavors then you might like this product. I think though that it would have been really good without the sugar. 3
I found the taste way too sweet for me. I tried it with less water, more water, added creamer, still could not shake the taste. Very disappointing. Only used it at the office anyway so I am sticking with Swiss Miss packages for my hot chocolate fix. 2
I got one of these for XMAS...and to be honest it does work well and does extend the life of your fresh herbs while providing an attractive container.<br /><br />The main problem is the container is difficult to open. It does get easier over time but whoever designed this thing should not have made it so hard from the get go.<br /><br />The thing is its very easy to open when there is nothing inside it as you can you use as much force as needed open it (you don't need to open the bottom....just squeeze the sides and pull the plastic cover up and out FIRMLY). Don't worry...you won't break it. It is pretty sturdy plastic.<br /><br />The real issue is when it is filled or has water in it...its difficult to use that much force and popping it open without spilling.<br /><br />I've just resorted to emptying the water reservoir through its fill port....then popping it.<br /><br />PREPARA...please read these reviews and improve on the next design!!! 3
Kraft jet-marshmallows contain port gelatin (it is mentioned on their website under questions). The marshmallow kraft creme contains no gelatin. 1
Ah granola, I am slowly beginning to develop a love-hate relationship with it.  Love because it is very versatile and tasty.  Hate because many times granola is promoted as a healthy food and I have discovered (many times) it is not.  Therefore, I find myself on a pilgrimage to find the best tasting and most healthy granola out there.<br /><br />This brings us to Nature's Path Love Crunch Granola.  This product is a certified organic food with no trans fat and whole grains.  Unfortunately the serving size betrays the calorie count.  So while this product is made with healthy ingredients, the serving size betrays the portions.  Which I find odd because this granola has chocolate and freeze dried raspberries in it.  I have to tell you, I had to dig, no exaggeration for chocolate, excuse me Italian chocolate and raspberries.  Again if there aren't chunks of chocolate (or even raspberries) how is this so high in calories?<br /><br />As for the taste, I must confess that it is pleasant.  Nevertheless, it isn't anything to become too excited over.  I have tasted granola that is half the price that has tasted better.  I have only eaten the granola by itself, I am sure in yogurt, over a salad or ice cream and as a cereal it might elevate the taste.  I will eat this granola, but it will not be something I would attain again.  Under the assumption a person is searching for organic and/or vegetarian granola, you might have found your match.  I for one find organic products, in many cases, as a marketing ploy.  As for finding a great tasting and healthy granola, it still hasn't happened. 3
I find it disturbing that this comes up in the GLUTEN FREE SELECTIONS!!!  THIS IS NOT GLUTEN FREE, OR EVEN WHEAT FREE!! 1
This cappuccino is very good and tastes almost as good as Starbucks Latte Primo, T-Discs for Tassimo Coffeemakers, 8 Count Packages (Pack of 2). The cream foams up well in the Tassimo machine. The only difference in taste between this Cappuccino drink and the Starbucks Latte Primo is that the coffee flavor is slightly stronger in the Starbucks product. Also, with the Cappuccino you brew the coffee first and then use the milk disc. With the Starbucks Latte Primo you brew the milk first then the coffee.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a bargain buy. As long as you are not looking for a slightly stronger coffee flavor, I'd suggest purchasing this instead of the Starbucks brand as both products use expresso coffee and milk discs. 4
I liked this beverage.  I followed the instructions and didn't shake it.  It is tough to review a product like this since it depends on how you like your coffee.  If you only drink coffee black than this will be too sweet, if you only drink those Starbucks Frappacinno drinks in the little bottle (I do like those!) than this may be too strong.  I like my coffee (hot or cold) with a little milk and a little sugar...this drink was pretty good for me.  It was a little stronger flavor than what I typically drink but quite good.  Not too many calories, not too many crazy chemistry project ingredients, nice flavor...I was happy with my experience.  I am cheap though so I will probably stick with brewing coffee at home and drinking that! 4
When I got these nuts I expected what the description said,sea salt and a 'hint' of pepper.Instead I got a salty,hot assault on my taste buds.There is no taste of cashew left.All you get is an overpowering hot,peppery mess.I would never buy these and do not recommend that you buy them either,unless all you want is heat.Then I recommend you stick your tongue in your car's cigarette lighter.The resulting taste is about the same. 1
I Enjoy it very much while my future wife thinks it is "so-so". She felt it had a slight biter taste, I on the Other hand Thought it Tasted very Good.<br />I do Not think there is a bitter taste.<br />& Yes I will be buying this again. 4
for those of us who have bad reactions to this crap they put in our food, SHAME SHAME ON YOU LIPTON 1
Now let me start off by first saying that I use the product for my hair to lock and moisture and the same applies for my skin.<br />It's a great product and the amount that I recieved for what i paid was great. I will purchase again in the future once i run out. 4
I love this coffee.  I have used Folgers Coffee for many years but this one "Black Silk" is the best yet. 5
First off, the original delivery date was about a month and a half after purchase date. So you can imagine my surprise just a week later when these arrived!<br /><br />The taste seems a little different then before, but I havn't had these in almost a decade so the memory isn't 100% clear. These taste just great and I am pleased.<br />Slightly melted upon opening, but due to very limited chocolate and the hard shell nothing messy in the bag and just a few had clumped together.<br />Overall this is a great product and i will be ordering the bigger bag soon 4
I can't wait to finish the bottle of this so I can rid my pantry of it. Of the 4 flavors I've tried - coconut, mango, caramel and hazelnut this one tasted the worst. Coconut is probably the best, in terms of delivering a good flavor with minimal after taste. I have been using this in tea primarily. 2
I tried three of Taco Bell's sauces (creamy jalepeno, chipotle, spicy ranchero) and have reviewed them all on Amazon. This was my least favorite.  The flavor is very strong and overwhelmed food items like traditional beef tacos and fish tacos for me.  However, if you are a true lover of "chipotle flavor" you may have a different opinion.  I could taste the vinegar used in this sauce which is a flavor I do not enjoy which is why I do not like jarred salsas either.<br /><br />I did some further experimenting and baked some cheese enchiladas.  After they came out of the oven I drizzled some sauce over the final product and enjoyed the flavor combination.  I also think it would be good in a cheese ball as the smokiness and bold flavors would add a spark to the traditional cheese ball. 3
In 2010 when I bought my Keurig K-cups were about $.42 each. Now they are $.60 each! My Keurig has been just taking up counter space now. And K-cups are too much plastic and foil waste for the land-fill. I want to like this product but it just doesn't make any sense. And the coffee is bitter. 1
Once the dogs figured out the "trick" to this one, they were able to get the cups out in no time to get to the treats. This would be a great tool though for using at feeding time if you have a dog that you need to slow down.  It is easily washable.  The cups will break if chewed on, but they're not intended to be chew toys. 4
I don't really have much experience with dried morels.  I can only say that I was delivered exactly what I expected. 5
the cappuccino is very good, but because there are only 8 cups in each box, it's very expensive... and i still have to add sugar.  i'm much happier with the Iced Cappuccino which i make 'hot' instead of cold.. has just the right amount of sweetener, just perfect. unfortunately, it is apparently not available in the wintertime. darn. 4
I didn't like this tyvita as well as the seseme one.  It isn't as flavorful and cracks into pieces too easily. 3
In general, I have not had good experiences with energy drinks.  Although I like the lift they give on a long day at work, they usually taste so awful I just avoid them.  The only exception was with Monster Java which had various iced coffee flavors and tasted good and gave a good jolt.  Unfortunately, Monster Java is not as common but I keep hoping maybe I'll find an energy drink that won't taste like carbonated cough syrup.<br /><br />No Fear is the latest candidate and it actually wasn't totally disgusting.  At first it actually was pretty good as it had a bit of a sour taste and not the sickly sweet flavor common in such fare.  But about a third of the way through, I started picking up a rather unpleasant aftertaste.  Not as bad as some, mind you ... but enough to make you think twice about a repeat performance.  As far as the kick it gives, it is not as strong as some I have had but not as weak as others.  Basically about average and there was no major crash at the end.  Of course, such evaluations tend to vary with personal body chemistry.<br /><br />Overall, while No Fear is certainly not horrible and is actually drinkable, it was not enough to stop me from looking for something better. 3
****<br /><br />This tea is good---it is a meld of green and white teas: White tea, Japanese green tea, Chinese green tea, Assam green tea, Darjeeling green tea, and organic green tea from Sri Lanka. It has a mild and interesting taste, and doesn't appear to be as strong in its [...] effects as some other green or white teas.<br /><br />I went to Stash's website to find out more about Fusion Green and White and it says that white tea is a very rare and healthful tea, even more so than green tea, containing powerful antioxidants; it is thought that white tea may have the strongest anti-carcinogenic effects of all teas. White tea is not oxidized, but withered and dried by steaming. It is not clear exactly how much white tea is present in this tea compared to all of the greens---I'm thinking there might be far more green than white. Still, it is a fine tea nonetheless.<br /><br />For a basic green tea, with some extra-healthful white tea added, it is a not-overly-exciting but certainly tasty tea. I would especially recommend it for people new to tea drinking who want to branch out from orange pekoe to something different, and are looking for a gentle introduction to the wide world of teas.<br /><br />**** 4
Maybe my dog is just spoiled but he doesn't seem to care less about this dog food. I figured the Bison in it was a good idea but he doesn't really seem to notice. 3
I have been impressed with this dog food, that I started using when I saw it at a local feed store.  It was cheaper than the other foods with similar premium ingredients, so that was a plus.  My senior dog's coat had gone from black to a brownish color on Avoderm, indicating that something was off.  Since I've been feeding Premium Edge, her coat has gone back to a very shiny black.  I have to conclude that this food has had something to do with that.  I checked it out on a dog food review site, and they give it 4 stars, which is pretty good, on their 6-star system.  (Their 6-star foods are very expensive and I can't afford them.  I also don't think my house pets need them) Their major qualm was that there was no statement about whether the fish in the food contained ethoxyquin, which is apparently a bad thing.  I wrote the company and received a response saying their food was ethoxyquin-free, even though there was no statement to that effect on the sack.  Good enough for me.  Too bad Amazon appears not to plan to carry this brand any longer. 4
UPDATE: After receiving order . . .<br /><br />My first review was a shimmering adoration of Argo tea, and this tea in particular. Now that my order has arrived and I'm drinking a cup, I have to ask: what happened? I used to be addicted to this stuff when I lived in Chicago and could go into an Argo store and buy it off the shelf. I remember it . . . differently.<br /><br />So--either I have changed, which is possible, or the other reviewer is right. (And my apologies for assuming he or she was misjudging.) There is something off about this tea, and I don't know what. But it does taste artificial and out of balance. Maybe it needs Chicago Municipal water to make the right chemical combination essential for the flavor I miss. But wow; what a disappointment. Proves the adage, "you can never go back." 2
When I opened the pouch, I sniffed the contents and found the aroma to be intensely complex and inviting! I tried a little pinch of it raw -- and it excited my taste buds -- very enjoyable. I even think that the contents would be spectacular if sprinked over vanilla or dulce de leche ice cream -- this Gold Kili Ginger and Lemon Beverage Mix is VERY gingery and sweet --- and with a nice lemon tang.<br /><br />So I dumped the remaining contents of the pouch into a cup and added hot water -- It steamed up very nicely, mixed VERY well and the first few sips were intense, delicious, just great. But THEN this mixture started burning my throat so intensely that I had to cut it with Soy Milk to turn off the overpowering heat -- turning the remainder of the contents into a refreshing, sweet, but mild experience.<br /><br />Now some people might LIKE all that extra heat-- I couldn't handle it. For those who like the Ginger/Lemon experience but are not fans of spicy hot-ness, then perhaps divvying up the contents of one pouch into TWO cups of tea would be a better way to enjoy this intense experience. 4
As in, I think I need to double the amount of coffee I use per cup, then the next cup is pretty darn good.<br /><br />I like a coffee that has a bold but not burnt flavor.  Well, the first cup of Marley coffee did not have any burnt flavor to it.  This is a great one for someone who has a lifetime of drinking tea and wants to try coffee.  But for a lifelong coffee drinker, it lacks the kind of body you can stand a spoon up in, the flavor that leaves you knowing you've just drank parts cleaner, and caffeine that has your molars humming.  But this cup lacks presence and is just a bit too subtle for me<br /><br />The next cup was far better, with some character to it, but a little bit burnt.  Not bad, not exceptional, but would make for a good, routine morning coffee.<br /><br />I'll keep experimenting with my remaining stock of Marley.<br /><br />E.M. Van Court 3
We bought this toy for our two granddogs as a Christmas present.<br />The larger, a boxer/pit bull mix was clever enough to grab onto the<br />yellow cups & just lift & easily found the treats. However, the<br />beagle was unable to grab onto the cups thus making him work harder<br />for the treats. Its quite entertaining to watch him go crazy trying<br />to figure it out. It keeps him occupied for about ten minutes. 4
I used to love these when they were still available in the U.S.  I ordered them from this seller and they tasted like axle grease.  I'm not even kidding.  I was skeptical from the moment I opened the package considering they had used musty old newspaper for padding.  They refused to refund my money on the grounds that they hadn't heard complaints from any other customers, which seems like a blatant lie considering there are other reviews on here complaining about the exact same thing.  Order only if you like playing Russian roulette with candy from a dishonest seller. 1
These were some of the worst bags of candy that I have ever purchased.  Over half of each package (pack of 4) the candy bars were melted and disformed in addition to them having the "OLD" chocolote white fuzzy look and funny smell.  Got them to give to my grandkids and had to throw over half of them away.  Pretty bad when kids refuse to eat candy.  This will be the last time I order candy from Amazon.  If I want candy for the kids, I will have to go to the stores and get it fresh. 1
I would have thought my 2 year Corgi would have liked this, but he reluctantly ate only one bowl and then stopped eating it altogether. I left it out for him 24 hours before I decided not to let him starve, so I went back to his old food. I don't know why he doesn't like it. The food itself is kind of funny looking: the meat particles look like exploded, freeze dried chunks. Artificial looking. There are regular, round, colored morsels representing the vegetable part of the mix. I can't really comment on the rest of it. Never seen him reject a dog food before. 2
First off, I love Phillippine brand dried Mangoes. Too bad these were Royal Phillippine dried mangoes. NOT THE SAME THING. The picture for this product is what I wanted to order. I received something different. The Royal dried mangoes i received were very similar but not as good and more importantly not what I ordered. After trying a few I noticed that they weren't as good so I checked me orders to make sure I purchased what I thought I purchased. The picture was what I ordered but under description they say "Royal Brand Naturally Delicious Dried Mangoes from the Philipines are without a doubt the best tasting..." So the picture they advertise is for Phillippine dried mangoes but under product description its a different brand called Royal. Mangoes are still good but not what I ordered. Disappointed with seller eauction for not clearly advertising product. 3
This is the perfect size for a snack bag for school.  Minus one star because the glue for the straws also glues the wrapper to all of the boxes.  That's annoying. 4
We have trouble finding this product on the shelves of grocery stores.  What an amazing find!  Our favorite pork rub, in an amount that will last many times, not just one.Thank you Paul Prudhomme 5
This product works very well. It taste great. Its a nice touch to the end of a day. PLEASE USE AS DIRECTED! PLEASE!!!!! 5
A nutritionist recommended these to sweeten my coffee etc. as there are no negative after effects unlike artificial sweeteners.  Stevia is made from herb in South America. Japanese tea drinkers have been using stevia for years with no ill effects she said.  It's quite a bit sweeter than sugar, so you need less of it as a replacement.<br /><br />I like this brand and put two packets in my iced coffee every morning with almond milk and 1 T cocoa--it tastes like a coffee milk shake for only about 70 calories as the Stevia is calorie-free! The stevia makes it taste like an iced dessert drink and is a great, refreshing treat for the day.<br /><br />This multi-pack offer for this price is about 30% lower than what I can get NuStevia for locally. 5
I bought these for my grandson who is 7 months old. He loves them and they are just the right size for a snack between feedings. His mom likes the convenience and ease in taking them along. I like ordering these and having them shipped directly to their house. It makes me feel like I have sent them a little present that is practical and appreciated. 5
It's a shame the entire U. S. food industry can't really come up with a few good and healthy breakfast cereal.  I guess this is a reflection why we love sugar and fat (irresistible taste when appearing in the forms of cheese and cream).<br /><br />Anyway this Kashi GOLEAN is one of a few (less than 3 I guess) that is<br /><br />(1) Low in calories<br />(2) High in protein and fiber<br /><br />It tastes pretty good.  The only problem is it is low in calcium.  Note that other flavors of GOLEAN such as Crunch are not as good.  They have far more calories.<br /><br />So this is a good choice.<br /><br />The other problem is that it has become quite expensive.  It started as a 14 oz box.  Then 13 oz.  Less than 6 months ago, Amazon sold it (the 6 pack) at $17, and you could subscribe to save.<br /><br />Then subscription was not allowed.  And price increased to $18, and now more than (more than) $19.<br /><br />ALDI has a generic brand of this.  It is also quite expensive (just a few dimes cheaper).  I have found it not to taste as good as Kashi. 3
I used to think these were basically "potato crack" but they have changed the way they process them with my last batch.  They seemed flat and overcooked.  Hopefully, things will get back to normal with the next order. 3
Priced in the range of a CASE, this is a single box.  If you buy this you are paying three times the full price for a box.  You are getting ripped off if you buy this!!!! 1
This is a wonderful product, we all love these at work, which is why I bought the 2 lb bag. But somewhere along the way it got overheated and all melted together in a big ball. Ruined the chocolate and ended up throwing it away. I guess don't order in the summer or come up with another shipping solution. 2
Are your cats getting sick? Mine were vomiting and I finally traced it back to the salmon cat food.  But it's not the salmon, it's the dye they put in the salmon. Some cats simply can't tolerate it.  Three of my seven were that way.  If you see this happening, there's a pretty good chance that your cat has an intolerance to the dye as well. 1
We got our Canned Beef from Amazon around last summer but opened it just now.  It smells vile.  No way we are giving it our dogs.  Not sure if this a variation or do they always smell that bad.  Definitely deleting it from the Subscribe and Save list. 1
I was introduced to this brand in Aruba. This coffee is sold in Aruba's supermarkets and jar label is in spanish.<br />When I found it at Amazon I was very excited. I was immediately disappointed after first cup.<br />Coffee in Aruba is rich, tasty and very smooth. My wife and I had been enjoying this brand for more than 10 years.<br />The coffee sold in US is complete opposite to same brand sold in Aruba. I don't know why the same brand would be so<br />different unless it is a grey market product with a look alike label.<br />. 1
This is a great latte. The caramel aroma for me is enough but for those who might like a very strong one should perhaps add more but for me personally I enjoy this and add a little sugar as I do for any coffee of mine. 4
I just tried these recently and I can't get enough of them now.  They don't have the texture of buffalo chicken wings, it's more like the stuff you get when you order a buffalo chicken pizza...just chunks of plain old chicken smothered in hot sauce.  Haven't tried it yet, but they seem like they'd be REALLY good warmed up or tossed on a pizza before it goes into the oven.<br /><br />They seem to be a bit more expensive than other Jack Link stuff, but so worth it.  Om nom nom nom nom 5
Ouch, this stuff is sweet, as in REALLY sweet...  This is really harsh tasting and we were disappointed.  Most soda doesn't have this much sugar, the 8.3 oz can has 29 grams of sugar, yikes!  For a 12 oz can of soda, that would be like having 45 grams of sugar, who would drink that?<br /><br />They need to water this WAY down, we're going to end up giving the rest of this away, we can't drink it. 1
Smooth with no sacrifice in taste and does taste as good as regular coffee.  I usually don't have any coffee after dinner and never really cared for decaf but I now have an after dinner alternative and no sacrifice in flavor. 5
Organic compounds contain carbon. Salt- sodium chloride, NaCl- is inorganic.<br /><br />Even using the silly redefinition of "organic" which took over six years ago, it makes no sense to ask whether salt was "organically grown" -- it's a mineral, for pete's sake! Of course it's not genetically engineered etc. The USDA grudgingly started dealing with "organic" certifications for plants and livestock, but they won't touch claims of "organic salt." Only three organizations (one in France, one in NZ, and one in Wales) with dubious credentials have tried to buy into the "organic" craze by certifying "organic" salt.<br /><br />Nothing against this salt- I'm sure it's fine. But any other natural sea salt will be just as good. Don't pay extra for a meaningless label. 3
First off, the initial arrival:  It came in a bigger box (since other things were ordered as well) when I opened it the 2 yellow bags set neatly and ready for me to eat!  Packaging, no other boxes or bags were used or necessary.  Review of the value: this is going to put it in perspective;<br />1) The average size bags are about 1.69 ounces<br />2) The larger size bags range from 9-11 ounces depending on which one as they make several.<br />3) This bag was just over 42 ounces and they go up to 60 ounces in certain packaging.<br />In theory you could go out and buy a bunch of the 1.69 ounce packages and to equal the total of about 84 ounces and at about $1 a bag you'd only buy about 48 bags at $.99 a bag it would be cheaper to go with these bags - however, the cost of this item was a little disappointing because I expected a little more in the bags.  Aside from a portion (probably 25% of the height) of the bag being air, I was just hoping for more M&M's.  Overall I give this purchase a C+ value as it was cheaper to buy this way.  But, as always beware of pricing for example another seller on Amazon charges $9.19 for the same bag (but you have to pay for shipping).  If you wanted to buy using Amazon Prime, like myself then you could get regular M&M's (no peanuts) for only $15.63 - about $10 less so that may be worth the savings.  An okay value - but at the end of the day it was cheaper than buying them individually. 73beats 2
I ordered this lavender to use in ice cream. Because of all the stems, leaves and husks I had to strain the ice cream after extracting the lavender flavor during the cooking. After spreading out two tablespoons and trying to just pick out the dried flowers, I gave up after realizing that the non-flower debris was about 1/3 of total. 1
This vegetable bouillon is NOT vegan.<br /><br />It contains WHEY and LACTIC acid. 1
I cannot review how well this shampoo works on the hair as it arrived in the mail with all of the shampoo leaked into the mailing envelope. I will say that if you are sensitive to products with strong fragrances like I am, this is not a good choice. It is heavily scented. I also don't recommend ordering this product through the mail as the pop top popped open and there was not packaging or shrink wrap to secure it shut. 2
When I ordered from Amazon- I thought I was getting the container pictured... but I got a short, squat version, which was okay... then I tried to use the oil as a "lotion" for my hyper (skin) sensitive newborn daughter- maybe I don't know how coconut oil is? If it's ALWAYS "frozen" and you have to warm it to apply... nonetheless, when I tried to use the spout with the container it came in, it was a MESS. It got ALL over the container, and all over my hands. Complete mess! I was very upset with the construction of the bottle- it simple doesn't work. I have to open the lid and just pour it without the "easy pour" lid. All in all, I do like the oil inside the container! 3
"illy issimo Coffee Drink, Caff&egrave;" packs a potent coffee hit in a small package with only 50 calories. Of course, because the coffee flavor was so rich, after a few sips I took the opportunity to make a fabulous dessert drink. I poured the "illy issimo" coffe drink into a large, tall glass, and added a big spoonful of sugar and some whole milk (cream would be even better). I stirred it well and added some ice, and the rest is history. Yum, yum, yum! How convenient to have such coffee richness in a small, portable package. Perfect on its own, but full of possibilities! 4
Some of the cans were spoiled. Rancid, and smelled like bleach. I threw the rest out in the garbage. Never again. 2
My Mom has a hard time always getting this dark roast and its great that I can ship it to her through Amazon and it's there in days for her to use.  I have no idea how much she has been paying but it great just to surprise with several jars of the Black Silk when she can't find it when she's grocery shopping. 5
Pops big, tastes great, but the hulls are huge! (Expensive)  I Feel like a dog with peanut butter on my tongue trying to get rid of the hulls that suction cupped to the back of my tongue.  Wanted to try mushroom popcorn, because it looks so tasty, but will stick with standard popcorn from now on. 3
I have used these little treats for our 2 dogs for a while and never had a problem.  This time the container arrived a little dented and when I opened it, discovered that the inside pouch had been damaged and the greenies are stuck together.  Disappointing. 3
Haribo's gummi strawberries are some of the tastiest candy available. I may be biased because I've loved gummi candies (ESPECIALLY those from Haribo) for pretty much my entire life. There's just something about the perfect combination of texture and bite that make chowing down on chewy fruit-flavored candy a happy activity.<br /><br />Strawberries are one of my favorite fruits so naturally I was overjoyed when I found out many years ago that Haribo made a gummi strawberry candy that, as a bonus, even looked like the fruit it was trying to imitate! They obviously don't taste like actual strawberries which have a sort of tartiness to them, but they do taste as good as if not better than any other imitation strawberry flavor out there.<br /><br />These candies are so good I can just munch on them - two or three at a time - for hours (which I guiltily admit I have done in the past at work). The price can't be beaten, either - believe me, I've looked high and low for a candy specialist that can sell this much sweet goodness at this low a price!<br /><br />And my family loves them as well. My two young boys can't get enough of them, and even my wife who doesn't really like gummi candy all that much can put down a dozen or so pieces.<br /><br />If you like strawberry flavored candy and love gummis, I highly recommend you try this (or even a smaller package if 5 lbs. scares you) - you won't be disappointed! 5
This plant was not healthy when i received it.  I didnt even gibe it as a gift, as i intended, that how bad it looked. 1
GREAT CANDY AS ALWAYS FROM WERTHER'S ORIGINAL CANDY, HARD OR CHEWY CARAMELS ARE BUT TWO OF THE CANDY THEY MAKE THAT IS OUTSTANDING. IT SEEMS THAT YOU CAN NOT KEEP IT IN STOCK AND ARE ALWAYS OUT OR JUST HAVE A BAG OR TWO LEFT TO SALE. 5
This product does not work... I have bought 5 of each... I ate one packet because I wanted to get a little bit of energy, because I was staying up late, but I ended up sleeping 20 minutes later... Now, I cant sleep without it!!!<br /><br />As for the taste, all in all, they all taste ok. I recommend the orange flavour... and I really dislike the fruit punch... 2
I have a German Breed, G.Sheph. & he is VERY, VERY, PICKY! He loved them. He is such a happy camper. He wakes up in the morning & ready to go for his walks & comes home straight to his treat cabinet, he wants his chicken stix....thank you, finally something that my boy loves.... 5
My daughter and I were looking for some real licorice and after reading several reviews about different brands of licorice we ordered the Panda licorice. We are very happy with Panda and will order again soon. 5
Love Jelly Belly.<br /><br />However my bag came with a nice hair in it.  When I called the company to complain they told me they weren't in charge of packaging and gave me a long distance number for another country to deal with.<br /><br />Not impressed by item. 2
I've been gluten-free for 4 months and was dying for some cheese and crackers.  These are amazing!!! I had them on vacation with some friends who aren't eating gluten-free and they still loved these crackers.  I'm going to order a few cases of these and stock up! 5
In light of the glowing reviews and excellent dollar-per-ounce price ratio, I bought these. It shipped quickly enough, arrived in two days, and was very well packaged. (Bravo for that)<br /><br />But the impressing stops here. If you are thinking these are $24 dollars for 5 lbs kind of quality, you would be mistaken. These are really $12 for 5 lbs. quality. The taste is bland and unflavorful. I should have listened to the other reviewer, who said he loves the Hapi brand but didn't like these. I, too, loves the Hapi brand, and most other Japanese brands. These, however, just tastes like there is something missing in the flavor!<br /><br />To be fair, this is exactly what it is called: peas flavored in wasabi. There is nothing wrong with the taste, but somehow, the Hapi brand just tastes so much better and more addictive. I can eat a whole small can of the Hapi ones in one sitting, once you pop one in your mouth you can't stop. But these ones are BLEGH. I don't know how I am ever going to finish that 5 lbs. bag. I had no idea how large a bag 5 lbs of peas would be, but it turns out it's about 3 macbook pros stacked on top of each other. That bag is HUGE!<br /><br />Anyway, this..mundane tasting wasabi pea may be healthier and more organic, I don't know. But it most certainly won't turn any nonbeliever into fans. (And may very well turn wasabi pea addicts, e.g. me, into a nonbeliever!) 3
I've never liked the flavor of wheat pasta...interestingly I used to like some wheat breads. I've opted for rice products incase of gluten sensitivity. This pasta will fall apart easily if you overcook it. So it's important to go by the directions. I prefer fewer ingredients, as this one has. I prefer the flavor of rice in pasta because they don't overpower the other flavors you may like to add from spices or tomato sauce for example, like wheat does in my opinion. One other thing is that the individual box itself doesn't state it's USDA certified? Not sure why the online ad states it is and not the box. Unless it's just mine that are like this. Sorry but for me there will be no more subscribe and save orders, the price has gone up by five (+ cents) dollars. For a family of seven and one adult working it's not as easy. If the price ever goes back down then I would reconsider it, unless I find another one to replace it. 3
I contacted Amazon to let them know that my previous order of this product just didn't look right to me and two of my dogs were throwing up and had to go to the vet's.  They were fine until they ate this product.  It was very dark and dry and seemed old or just plain bad.  I threw them away.  Amazon replaced the order but unfortunately, it looked the same so it was wasted money for me.  I am really concerned about the safety of these dog treats that are made in China.  Buyer beware. 3
The bottles leaked.<br /><br />10/10/2011  9:10 A.M. Damage reported. / Damage claim under investigation.<br />10/10/2011  9:03 A.M. Transportation accident occurred. / All merchandise discarded. UPS will notify the sender with details of the damage. 1
Normally I would not purchase coffee online as I have several coffee shops within a reasonable distance.  I saw this and figured "why not?"<br /><br />This coffee was vacuumed sealed and was tight enough to where I had to use scissors to open it.  One thing I tend to avoid is pre-ground coffee.  I usually like to grind my own beans as I find the taste is better.<br /><br />The smell from the bag was for a lack of better words pretty basic.  Usually, there is a distinct smell depending on the bean and there can be faint traces of something.  There wasn't anything distinct about this coffee.<br /><br />I used a standard drip maker which in itself was probably not the best choice but I suspect it would not matter as I was surprised that there really isn't a strong smell coming from the cup of coffee which I drank black.<br /><br />The taste was kind of bland.  I did try a little piece of chocolate and it did seem to help.<br /><br />Overall it's an ok coffee if you are not an aficionado.  However, it's not something I would add to my list of brands I purchase. 3
A very good bargain, this tea has a slightly different taste if you are used to regular sencha green tea, but it is worth the adjustment for the price savings! 4
I have two cats that are very picky eaters, sometime ago I found out about weruvia and they seemed to really enjoy it. So, in order to keep my furry friends happy and save some money I purchased weruvia online, and to my my surprise one of them would not eat it at all. I discovered that the food I purchased online unlike the one I was buying at the pet store was made in Thailand. I found a can from a previous purchase which had been made in the USA and the cat ate it without a problem. So, I wondering if anyone has had the same problems??? 1
The Art of Appreciation Grand Edition was a FLOP!  I sent it to my brother for Christmas.  He told me it looked wonderful but there was VERY little there to eat! His wife ate the ONE cookie, they each got ONE truffle.  It was all pretty package and no goodies.  I feel so badly I am going to send them a restraurant gift card! 1
For the price, this is good wild rice.  I think you could get a better grade for a lot more money, but for everyday use, this is wonderful. 4
The taste is pretty good, not great.  They do fill me up when I am hungry and on the go and do not want to eat bad fast food. 4
The best word I an find to describe them is 'bland'.  Very little sweetness, very little pera taste. 1
I have tried several types of hot chocolate since purchasing my Keurig and this is by far the one I enjoy the most.  I have it shipped every month so that I don't worry about running out!!! 5
This jam highlights the whole huckleberries, and is not too sweet. It is a real treat for those of us who have lost local huckleberry bushes to development or who no longer have the time to collect them.  The jam  brings back flavors that we thought were long gone.  A lovely bit of nostalfia for Christmas! 4
I like Columbian coffee and this is above average with a good dark color with a nice smell.  The taste is bolder than average but not unpleasant or bitter.  This is my "strong" Columbian coffee combining all the good things of the type with a bolder taste. 4
This packaged dish is okay. Can be spiced up with some butter or plain yogurt. There's nothing like a great fresh Indian restaurant and food. 3
Good subtle flavored coffee for the mid-afternoon pick me up. A bit of sweetness without being overdone. Wish it was available in whole bean as I like it stronger then the Keurig cup can make it. 4
I've always liked hot stuff, but lately I've found I need more and more to get the same kick.  I guess I've developed a tolerance? I'm not a fan of ground habanero, because it changes the flavor of the food too much, so my go-to spice has always been cayenne.  But in order to get the heat level I want, I use so much that it  flavors the food as well. I finally got around to ordering this, and I'm very pleased.  I get just the right amount of heat without the flavor overpowering the food. It's no where near as hot as I was expecting, though.  I've seen it on several TV shows where the chefs make a big deal about it with gas masks and gloves like it's DEFCON 1. I don't know if this has the heat that a ghost pepper SHOULD have, as I have never tried it before, but I would hazard a guess that this has about triple of what your average grocery store cayenne powder has.<br /><br />P.S I give the seller 5 stars - Ordered late Saturday and received on a Wednesday! 4
These had heat and had good enough coating of the seasoning. The first 2 cases were amazing best i had ever. Then they restocked and tried 4-5 cases and they taste either like plain chips or slight hint of seasoning on them. What a shame they seemed to cut back on quality to save money. Bad Uncle Ray! 1
Been gluten free for 7 years now. Thought we were done with mixes that tasted awful.  We threw it away because we did not like it. For my money, you can't beat Pamela's baking mix. But, the Betty Crocker chocolate chips are the BEST! So, don't give up Betty Crocker, just work on this one! 1
The Company didn't really mean to send me the bad taste sauce for sure i guess, and the person who ship these to me didn't mean to send me the gone bad sause to me either i am sure, I want to ask the company to check the product more often so customers who expected fresh sauce will not going to get gone bad sause. It was my first experiance ever in my life to receive sause in this terrible condition. Sause has a sour smell and I had to trash all the meat i marinated with this sauce. I was really mad.<br />I hope this dose not happen anyone else again who purchased this sause.<br />*** GOOD NEWS ***<br />is that Amazon Credited the full amount for it and Customer service was really nice and supportive. I thank Amazon Customer Service Care team and want to give them 5 stars. 1
This coffee always tastes good (not bitter) and for a decent price I feel this is the best value coffee available. 3
These chocolates are made in small batches in Kohler Wisconsin. We use to drive to Kohler to buy them. It's good to know that you can order them on Amazon. Each piece has an amazing combination of flavors and textures. I particularly enjoy the ones with molasses, they are called Blackstrap terrapins. Let me know if you like them. 5
That's what I would've called it.<br /><br />Anyways, there's not much to describe as it tastes exactly like you are probably imagining.  Cherry flavored juice with added carbonation.  I admit I was curious to see what 100% carbonated juice would taste like as opposed to something like a lemon-lime soda that contains almost all water and almost no juice.  My first impression is that they made a good decision in keeping the carbonation lighter than the average soda (still enough for a belch or two).  My second impression is 100% juice just doesn't taste good carbonated.  I think I would have preferred the juice just by itself.  Finally, at approximately one dollar per can I would most likely skip this for a sixteen ounce bottle of juice at roughly the same price if I were in the grocery aisle. 2
In my first shipment, two of three bags were completely broken and therefore the salt was rattling around in the box.  This left me with one bag.  When I contacted customer service they sent me another three.  This time all three had dime size holes in the top of them.  Some was still in the bag, but would you want to eat something that did not come sealed?  Customer service was great again, refunding my money so I can buy another brand of salt.  Packaging needs to be reassessed if they are going to continue to ship this item. 2
These are some of my favorite chips on the planet! They are light, crisp, & not too greasy. The flavor is very Dilly. Love that! Great chips. Just hard to find. 5
looking for bits as real blueberries seem to have no flavor these days.. these were very good,  Would def buy again 4
Read the fine print.  Looks like its coming from your local farm, "cage free" organic, but the back states in very fine print - "Made in China".  What's wrong with that you might ask? Well you read the reports about chicken jerk breast and dogs dropping dead from it, specifically from treats made in china.  Never again. 1
Take a normal sized waffle, soak it in honey, smush it till it's 1/8th its original size and you wind up with this.  Honey tastes good which explains all the rave reviews.  Sure it gives an energy boost, so does raw sugar, no surprise there.  As others have said, it's a bit crumbly and falls apart easily.  All in all, organic carbs are still just carbs and this didn't live up to the hype. 3
I thought that considering these are called "Sensible Portions" that they would be come as 5 single servings per box, but that's not the case.  The product is good, but a big open box just makes me want to overeat. 4
I like low acid coffees for the reduced bitterness, as I dont general have acid-induced stomach problems. This coffee was very smooth and had little to no bitter taste - great features of a dark roast.  However, the flavor was not as deep or rich as I would expect from a gourmet French roast. It was pleasant, but I prefer a slightly more robust, complex flavor in a dark roast. 3
After living in New Mexico for 4 years, the green chili withdrawal was BRUTAL! The canned version of anything is never as good as getting it fresh, but this brand is far superior to anything available locally where we're living now and the small can is perfect for a 2-person household. 5
I figured there must be bacon out there like bacon used to be - this is it.  If you are of a 'certain age' (over 40 or 50?) you remember the deep smoky flavor of a good bacon; this cannot be found in "store bacon" anymore.  Modern bacon is thin, lightly/poorly smoked - even the so-called 'gourmet' bacon.  This is the old fashioned flavor and thickness of bacon the way it was in the "good old days."  Arrives nice and cool in an ice pack - cheaper if you buy the 12-pack. 5
The DisposaKups work as advertised.  They are easy to use, just put your favorite coffee in the cup, pop the cap on and brew.  This allows me to save quite a bit of money while using my favorite coffee.  I filled about 25 of them at one time so there is always one standing by when I am desperate for a cup.  There is no need to wash out a filter, just toss it in the trash like the store bought K-cups.  They also make a good backup system if you run out of the store bought k-kups.<br />I would be interested to know if the company uses, or plans to use, recycled plastic or plastic alternatives in the manufacturing of these. 5
love this Rodeo Drive it has a very drinkable taste is also good and it is smooth! I recomend that you try this one. 4
The ingredients say Green Tea Matcha powder.  There is no mention of sugar in the contents.  This is a product that contains sugar.  NOT GOOD FOR DIABETICS or people who can not have sugar.  Also the color is not bright green but more of an olive/tan color.  This product description is very misleading.  I will return to the 100% organic Green Tea Matcha powder from Eden Foods which I have purchased in the past and was extremely happy. BUYERS BEWARE! 1
So versatile! White pearl can be used to decorate almost anything! Dust or paint it onto chocolate decorations (see Whimsical Bakehouse book), directly onto icing and cookies!<br /><br />Highly recommend you check your local Michaels or Joann's. Amazon usually has competitive prices but these are $3-4 at your local craft store - $8 is WAYY overprice on amazon.com. 4
I love fig newtons and when offered to review this product, I was hoping it would WOW me with the taste.  Not so much.  The cookies are large and nicely shaped, good to have out on a platter at a party.  The taste is....healthy, which that in itself is fine, if the cookie was healthy.  At 140 calories for 3 with 21 carbs and 7 grams of sugar, it really isn't all that healthy. I am currently counting calories in an effort to lose weight and giving up 140 calories for 3 cookies that don't taste sinfully delish just doesn't work for me.  If I am going to cheat with a snack, I could have 3 Oreo's for 160 calories, no comparison there.  They are crisp and tasty with a graham cracker texture, I just wish they were lower in calories and then they would really be a winner! 3
Great tasting, small in size like a "Smarties" candy. Made with Xylitol. But there's the fine powder from pulverized candy moving in the tin. 3
I bought a two pack at the Friday sale for $20.  Reasonable, but not an amazing deal.  I've been pleasantly surprised by the taste.  I do like the Van whatever flavor French Vanilla K-cups, and this contains significantly milder flavoring of a good tasting coffee.<br />I would and have served it to company and highly recommend serving with milk or cream.<br /><br />If you like flavored coffees, you'll most likely enjoy this one.  If you like it plain and black, you'll probably hate this. 4
This conditioner just conditions okay. I expected to be able to run my comb through my hair easily with this product but I could not. To me it did not feel very moisturizing.  One positive is that it does smell very nice but has a subtler scent than the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR8UM">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce</a> I use.<br /><br />This is not a conditioner I will be purchasing in the future. The only positive is that I liked it better than the complementary <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR8A2">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Moisturizing Dry Scalp Nourishing Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce</a>. 2
My dog likes to chew it but it's "heavy weight" even for this petite size. It's almost like 1/2 of her lunch. But it's very safe to use--my dog got choked often when she was chewing the rawhides or pig ears but never had problem with this one. Howwever, it's quite thick and dense. Wish they could make the shape flat and thin, that way, it will provide longer chewing and more fun. My 50lb dog consumes it in less than 20 seconds. She got a pack of Trixie Dentafun Kauchips 100g made in Germany from my best friend. The Trixie Chews are superior than ANY existing dog dental chews in the US market. But unfortunately, we don't have it here. 4
These pork skins have a great taste. Very fresh "homemade" taste. The cooking procedure can be a bit tricky though. I have a 1000w microwave with a turn table and did not get the same results with each bag. The first bag I tried with 1 minute, and additional 15 second intervls, stopping at 1min, 15 seconds. Several skins had not yet cooked. So I rolled the end of the bag back up and gave it 15 more seconds. Still some did not fully "explode" or "bloom".  The second bag I started with 1 minute, 30 seconds. Slightly better results, but again I needed to re-roll the end of the bag and give it another 15-30 seconds, still using the 15 second intervals for best results.  The third bag I started with 2 minutes (which is also the amount of time that is used on my popcorn setting) and the results were not as good. Too many had over-cooked and were too hard to eat.<br />My suggestion would be to stick with the 1 minute with 15 second intervals, listening closely to the sound. (They emit a slight hissing sound when they expand).  As soon as the bag has fully opened and the hissing sound subsides, it's a good sign you have reached the optimal result.  This item is a little more work than just picking up a bag of ready to eat at the store, but the improved flavor is worth it. To me anyway.  The jury is still out on whether the "healthy" claim can hold water.  I will continue to use restraint and only endulge with this treat on occassion.  Good Eats! 4
The tea is Ok but if you like your tea strong or with a dash of milk, this is not the best! 3
The picture was a bit misleading. I thought it was a trap where flies entered inside and were trapped, like a roach motel. When I received it, the design looked different, and it was obvious that it was a a square "tube" coated with very sticky adhesive, where the flies land and stick. As such, it works but not exactly what I expected. I would have designed it differently, though and put the adhesive on the inside and entrance holes on the outside so it doesn't look so ugly when the flies are caught. 3
One of the more enjoyable (and important) aspects of the single malt experience is the nose. Whereas with wine, the nose can be complimentary or conflicting to its taste, scotch whisky tends to be mainly complimentary. Further, as a distilled spirit often of considerable ABV, the myriad components making up a fine whisky's nose can be identified and analyzed with great depth and accuracy provided it is presented in a suitable glass.<br /><br />In my opinion, sloping sides to concentrate aromas from the whisky is essential and for some reason, Riedel saw fit to omit this critical feature from this glass. From the looks of it, it hasn't gone unnoticed and they've received quite a bit of flak over it. Even they admitted that they had made a mistake. One feature that is not a mistake, however, is the curved rim. This serves to deliver the spirit to the middle of the tongue rather than the tip and will let you appreciate a wider array of flavors from your whisky but the taste is only half of the story.<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of the traditional Glencairn glass and taste my whisky (and many other spirits) from it. They have the sloping sides but no curved rim, which isn't a deal-breaker since you can just pour the whisky deeper into your mouth. Some stemmed copitas have it but they're also much more delicate. One glass that has a lot going for it is the Ravenscroft single malt tumbler. It has a Glencairn-type shape AND the curved rim and features no stem of any kind. Perhaps the only thing that could be perceived as a downside is its 12 oz. capacity to the Glencairn's 6 oz. I find the Glencairn to be the perfect size for a dram.<br /><br />If you have the extra clams, you could certainly add these to your glassware collection as an experiment but if you're looking to have the best and most durable, spend your hard-earned quid on some Glencairns. 3
After following package directions, I found that this product was very starchy and tasted like the whole wheat pasta that first appeared on the market years ago, which was not very good. There was also another pasta shape in the same package. I was sorry I wasted my homemade sauce on this product. 1
I drink a lot of Earl Grey tea and have tried four or five brands over the years, Bigelow being my favorite.  I've been trying this organic Rishi tea for two weeks now and have experimented with different amounts of tea to get the flavor right and have not been able to. It is just okay for me. This tea is advertised as a bold tea and I see that many reviewers agree but I do not.  If I add too much tea to try to make it stronger it adversely affects the taste unlike other loose teas I use.  Also, this tea requires 1 TBL of dry tea per 8oz of water; I need to use twice that amount for it not to be weak, whereas other loose teas I use only require 1 1/2 tsp. for the same strength, so this Rishi tea would be much more expensive to use regularly.  I may prepare it occasionally just to have a change once in awhile.<br /><br />The packaging is beautiful.  It is packed in a very nice earthy looking tin and is slender and tall so fits in the cabinet nicely.  The big plus with this tea is that it's organic. 3
I love this product, but BEWARE, Amazon has covered an expired expiration date with a sticker! Shame on you Amazon! 1
So, I purchased some of this type ice cream from my local store and decided to buy online. Unfortunately, this is NOT the same. It is very icey/crystally. I doubt it is even the same mixture as the store bought hand scooped ice cream. I do NOT recommend purchasing this item. It tasted BAD and has the texture of chipped ice. 1
While my dogs do like the chews the picture is misleading. The actual package is small and so are the chews ( even the large size)<br />My dogs' breath is a bit better but I'm not sure they are worth the price.<br />I'll be trying other brands. 3
Before I discover this mix on Amazon I always bought it in Whole Food Store.<br />I like this mix and when I am doing the pancakes they came very delicious and fluffy.<br />Just one small secret: Try to add the Seltzer water instead of regular one. 5
The quality of this product is great, but after about 3 of each flavor the novelty is gone and you're out of friends to torture with this mix. Choose another one of their really good mixes, this is one to skip. 2
I've been drinking these little 5-hour energy drinks for a while now and I have to say that it's a great way to get a boost to your day. I was having a hard time waking up in the afternoons (you know, after lunch, the work day just drags sometimes and puts you to sleep) but taking one of these gave me the energy I needed to get through the days. I buy them bulk like this from Amazon because they're cheaper than buying them anywhere else. Although, I have been wondering lately what the long term disadvantages are to taking these on a regular basis.<br /><br />Either way, good product and some great tastes if you're not a fan of coffee. 4
Since I don't spend much time in New York City I've obviously missed the Mallomars excitement which is supposed to grip the area each fall.  I had no idea I was requesting a legend when I clicked on that little box to chose these cookies.<br /><br />So-o-o, don't get me wrong here, I didn't like them a whole lot, but I also didn't hate them.  More or less a simple shrug of the shoulders.  Definitely not something I will be looking for in the grocery store.  A small graham cracker type cookie with a dollop of marshmallow on top then encased top to bottom with a dark chocolate. For me a three-bite treat, for my husband, two bites.  There was a *snap* when I bit into the treat, but that poor cookie was terribly dry and crumbly.  It's the chocolate coating which gives it that snap sound.  Three of the eighteen cookies in the package had come unstuck from their marshmallow so they weren't beautiful, but they certainly did taste the same as the others.  No cookies were broken otherwise or crushed.  The packaging seems to have held up very well since these traveled by SmartPost.  When enjoyed with a cup of hot tea this 60 calorie cookie was pleasant enough, but was not special for me.  Down here in the South we have a concoction known as a Moon Pie.  It has all the same elements, but in a larger size.  Even though I haven't had a Moon Pie in several years I can safely say these Mallomars have not tempted me away from my Southern roots. 3
I bought these for my son to take to work for lunch. Apparently his co-workers found the smell so offensive they asked him not to eat it at work again. Maybe it was a bad batch... 1
This review is for Newman's Own Organics Lamb and Barley New Zealand Ranch Style Dog Treats. There is really not much to say here. The dogs loved the treats, and they didn't last long at all. My only complaint is that I don't thing the name of the product is long enough :) 5
I used to think these were basically "potato crack" but they have changed the way they process them with my last batch.  They seemed flat and overcooked.  Hopefully, things will get back to normal with the next order. 3
I have to get this for my son because it's the only one he likes.  I tried to get him the "Bare Fruit" chips which are in my opinion tastier and also made in the USA but they are definitely hard to eat for a 2 year old (plus the bag doesn't have a Mickey Mouse on it...sigh).  So, these are good and easy to eat and all is great if the severely faulty Chinese quality controls don't fail yet again.  It worries me that these come  from a country that has sent us deadly toys, deadly toothpaste, deadly baby formula, deadly dog food and treats, amongst many others, but hopefully he'll outgrow these ones quickly. 4
I made one for my daughter's birthday party and everyone but her died of uranium poisoning. Still tasted pretty good, though. 2
I bought this coffee thinking it might replace my Trader Joes breakfast blend. But other than the pice, there's no comparison. TJ's House Blend is rich, earthy, smooth, with many good overtones. This coffee - the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002GWFAEG">Coffee Bean Direct Medium House Blend, Whole Bean Coffee, 5-Pound Bag</a> - is bright and bitter, slightly harsh and nondescript in flavor.<br /><br />It serves me right for trying to save a few pennies on the TJ House Blend, but never again.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002GWFAEG">Coffee Bean Direct Medium House Blend, Whole Bean Coffee, 5-Pound Bag</a> may appeal to a few people trying to step up from "Mawell House", but a rich, elegant, complex morning coffee it isn't. What it is, is another nondescript entry into the many "E&E" (Elite and Economical) coffees that are fast flooding the coffee aisles. 2
This product does not taste to green tea at all, this is no surprising if you look at the ingredients: it has green tea, lemongrass, apple pomace, blackberry leaves, malic acid, lemon peel, natural lemon flavor wonf, citric acid, roasted chicory root, rosehip and lemon juice.<br /><br />The taste is not bad, but is not tea and it should not be sold as tea in my opinion. I will not buy it again. 1
nickels covered in old, mashed up tomatoes, then these chef boyardee meals are certainly for you. 3
I ordered this candy from this company twice.  The first time, the six boxes arrived crammed together so tightly that the product was spilling out of the boxes and the boxes were damaged.  They were meant to be gifts for Christmas, but were hardly in gift condition.  The second time I ordered them, I got a reply back saying that they were sold out and a refund would be issued. Both they and Amazon later insisted the refund was issued, but I ended up letting my bank go after it.  Not a good experience and I won't order from this distributor again. 1
I tried these bars and they were very good, although I do like the Peanut butter chocolate chip bars better. The bars are a quick and easy to carry snack when you are on the go! 4
Well my dog seems to like these very much.  Let's see if someone can offer free shipping on these. 5
i order this pickle gum as a gag gift ,  came in a big box but a very small package  it was cute  was fun when someone opened it, but then u do try it an theres not much of a pickle taste  an what little taste there is  goes fast 2
I found it so hard to believe anyone could give this mix 1 star, I had to read those reviews. Two of them seem like ads for Robs Red Mill, and the other one didn't make any sense. You must be looking for pancakes or waffles, so do yourself a favor and give these a go. They are delicious 5
These bars taste fine but there is a problem with the condition of the product sent. The back of the bars are stuck (perhaps melted?) to the plastic wrapper and can only be removed by scraping off small, individual pieces. I ordered these Cranberry Almond bars along with the Kind Apricot Almond and Mango Macadamia Nut bars.  The other flavors came from a different seller and arrived in great condition, even though they were sent in the same shipment as the defective box.  I won't bother with the hassle of attempting to return them, especially since I ate one of the bars before I realized there was a problem with the entire box.  A real waste of money. 2
I love full-bodied, dark-roast coffee, but many of the typical low-acid and decaf coffees have a bland, chemical taste to them.  Not the Puroast.  While it doesn't have all the complexities of my favorite beans, it has a full taste with a bit of the tartness I associate with dark roast and none of the chemical taste of other low-acid coffees. If you enjoy coffee but have difficulty with the acid, then you may enjoy the Puroast. 4
$136 for 12 boxes?<br /><br />Is this a rare item?<br /><br />That's $11.33 a box.<br /><br />I think the item might be a bit overpriced. 1
This product is great it really works. I have lost a total of 15 pounds in two months wihout exercising. I reconmend this product to everyone. 5
Great to make popcorn with! I even put some on a sweet potato, I cannot get raw butter, so I use this as a substitute. 5
My 8 month old yellow lab destroyed the rope almost immediately.  She also watched me fill it with toys and chewed on the screw off part until she broke the cover.  Then she chewed up the bottle.  Not for the heavy chewers like Labs. 1
This coffee tastes like chocolate that's gone bad.  It's overpriced and just not very good.  Starbucks has always over-roasted their beans.  I guess if you like that then you might like this coffee.  To my tastebuds however, it was just bitter and gross with a weird off-taste that left me making faces long after the cup was gone.<br /><br />Also, to all the reviewers who are saying that this was finally a strong k-cup, I say bah.  There are many other brands that make a cup just as strong but much better tasting.  This was just swill.  Bitter gross swill.<br /><br />If Coffee People still made their french roast I wouldn't have even bothered putting this in the brewer.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006IOKA70">San Francisco Bay Coffee One Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, French Roast, 36-Count</a> is my current favorite for my Keurig.  It's so much cheaper than a Starbucks k-cup.  But even if it weren't, it's still a better cup of coffee.<br /><br />Don't waste your money.  Overpriced and over-roasted equals bad coffee. 1
I'm a vegetarian and had been supplementing my protein intake with whey protein for a long time. It really frustrated me that there wasn't a good, competitively priced organic protein mix available. I was skeptical about using hemp protein because I had never tried it before. I was extremely surprised when I bought this chocolate hemp-protein mix and found that not only did it taste great, it also has exponentially more fiber than whey protein. While the taste of this protein isn't necessarily what I would call "chocolate", it definitely is chocolate-like. If I had to give a comparison, I would say maybe hot cocoa? While hot cocoa does taste similar to chocolate, it is nothing like biting into a chocolate bar. Overall, I would highly recommend this product! 5
As others have said, these are a little dry, but they have a very nice flavour, and they are very healthy. Other brands of oatcakes can contain sugar and more fat, these contain no added sugar. The organic oatcakes can be eaten on their own, but they are excellent with a thin slice of cheese, or spread with a little hummus. I prefer Nairns Cheese Oatcakes for eating on their own, but because they contain cheese they do have more fat and less fiber than the organic variety. 5
This comes in a case of 24 so I bought one can locally before ordering the large amount.  Good move!  I have 3 cats and none of them would eat it. This review is for the mature gourmet beef entree. Haven't tried the other favors yet. 1
Both dogs love the nutritious treats. The chicken breasts are used sparingly.  Good inducments for getting the pups into the bathtub or out of the house. 5
German Haribos don't contain artificial flavors and no artificial colors. German Haribos are all natural.<br />The Turkish ones however taste too sweet and less fruity, and look much more colorful because of artificial colors (FD & C yellow no. 5, red no. 40,blue no.1) and unnatural flavors.<br /><br />When you send a mail to Haribo, they reply that the Turkish Haribos, sold in the US, contain that artificial stuff, so that the Gummy Bear flavor survives the long shipping by ship. Looking at long shelf life duration of even the German Haribos that seems like a lie to me. Cost cutting and less restrictive US-Food regulation seem to be the real reasons ...<br /><br />Hungarian made Haribos (seen in India) aren't any better btw. 1
As a French Roast fan, I bought this brand of K-cup with high expectations, considering the name attached to it. I was disappointed. It has a hearty aroma and full-bodied flavor but leaves a bitter aftertaste.<br /><br />If you're a lover of the more robust roasts, I would recommend trying the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002L41Y8A">Coffee People Kona Blend Island Style, Extra Bold K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a> instead. It is a smooth blend with none of the bitterness that delivers that kick you're likely looking for. 3
K-Cups I recently purchased this new brand, and the quality of the K-Cups is definitively a problem. The seals on several of the K-Cups have broken and caused quite a mess. The coffee flavor s good when I am able to get a "good" cup. When you compare them side by side with other K-Cups you can see a difference in the packaging.<br /><br />I would not recommend this brand unless they make significant changes to their manufacturing and quality control processes. 2
These are the answer to anyone who wants to avoid carbs but like to dip or enjoy cheeses on a cracker.  The carb level is less than 1grm for you somersizers that means you aren't combining your proteins and bad carbs.  Hard to find and a little pricey to ship, but worth it. 4
we used to get this from our local grocery store for our 10month baby girl but it was $2 more a can and with prime there is no shipping charges as well as no taxes YAY!our baby loves this and it really has cut down on her spitting up. 5
I'm normally a fan of jack links but this really disappointed me. Ordered 4 bags and had two of them. I spent more time picking through the meat taking out the nasty gizard and fat chunks all throughout the bag. Also the meat quality was terrible and quality control isn't. Good for this flavor. One piece would be moist and flavorful and the next would bard as a rock and uncomfortable to chew. Overall this was a terrible product. Jack links shouldn't put 10 different cuts of meat in the same bag. If you like quality controlled products this isn't for you. 2
These k-cups are just what my son wanted!  The price was excellent and the flavor is rich.  I would recommend these to anyone wanting a good cup of instant hot cocoa. 5
I got this product hoping that my dog will have something good to chew every day. But 15 min (if not less) after eating the chew, my dog had a diarrhea. Amazing! Never seen anything work so fast in that direction. So I had to take him out for a walk every 30 min that night. It was that bad! I thought I will send the product back, but started to read reviews. Found one saying that you should give this chew after the meal. Next time I gave my dog Kong stuffed with his regular food, and then half of the chew, and then more food in Kong. 15 min went ok, and he did not have to run outside. Later same day I did it again - food-chew-food, and he was fine. And I have to mention that he is a big boy and never had problems with his stomach before. And he eats different things.<br />Two things I can summarize - watch your dog during and after you give the chew, and give some food either before or right after the chew is gone. 3
This is a very pleasant green tea. The cinnamon is fairly dominant but counterbalanced quite well by the green tea flavor, even though Stash did use cinnamon oil.<br /><br />I was a little scared about the cinnamon after my unpleasant experience with Stash's Organic Chai Black & Green Tea, which was ruined by too much cinnamon oil.<br /><br />After I use up these six boxes I do not know if I will purchase anymore Stash tea.<br /><br />Stash needs to hold off on using the spice oils (especially the cinnamon), even though it isn't so offensive in this particular tea, they could still tone it down a bit more. 3
OK - the nut butter itself is awesome. No sugar, just nuts and some palm kernel oil. I travel a lot and have specific dietary needs so I was super excited about these. It's the only way I've been able to get nut butter past airport security - usually they confiscate if I take in a tupperware.<br />The con about this product is that a bunch of the nut butter never gets squeezed out so I have to slice them open and scrape out the good stuff. Love the brand but will probably stick to the jars in the future. 3
...but the cans were smaller than I expected for the price I paid.  I dunno, I just expected to be saving a lot more than that when buying in bulk.  It's the same price (about $3 a can) at the local Target.  Plus, and this is a personal problem, I had a hard time being conservative with em.  They are delicious (not as good as the smoked ones though which Amazon doesn't sell for some reason) and I couldn't stop eating them!  I went through two cans in the first night!  I love to snack, but almonds aren't the best for snacking in large quantities, and I won't explain exactly why but it messes with your digestive system.  Anyways, the nuts are perfectly fine and it's a decent price (considering you're not paying sales tax outside of NY and that there's free shipping if you're patient) so I can't not recommend them, although I will never buy em again in this quantity. 3
I've been ordering the Kicking Horse decaf, along with the Three Sisters regular blend, for over a year now - it's great coffee, and arrives fresh and fast.  Much better deal than buying the little 12 oz bags in coffee shops! 5
I wanted this item to be amazing. I was also thinking it was going to be crunchy but its kind of chewy like what I would imagine cardboard would feel like to chew 2
This is available at nearly every gas station gift store throughout Georgia for $3.99.  I buy it at Plantation House gas station.  Plenty of others sell it too. 4
I ordered this wanting to try a hot chocolate on my Keurig, and I am very happy with this product. I will definitely be ordering it again. That being said, I dislike hot chocolate made completely of water, so I do add a splash of Half and Half to my cup when I make this. Thus, I didn't want to give it a 5 star rating since I do doctor my cup up a bit at home (otherwise I would have). However, I won't even venture to make a cup of hot chocolate in a packet from the grocery store with water, I use 100% milk usually for those and they still don't measure up to this product from Grove Square. So, the fact that this tastes so good made with water and a bit of creamer to me speaks volumes. I do have to say that this is by far the best cup of instant cocoa that I have ever tried at home. Compared to the Swiss Miss in the cupboard this had a distinctly grown up taste to it. I'm a big fan! 4
As others have reported. Mine arrived badly chipped. Was going to use them for a High School graduation but due to condition gave them away to a local shelter. 2
No seriously, she is.  My dog's "grandfather" (my Dad) sent this as a first birthday gift. I videotaped it - 1st time, 23 seconds, including eating 4 treats.  She moved 1 piece with  her nose, ate treat, one with right paw, ate treat, one with left paw (she's ambidextrous), ate treat, and moved last piece with her nose, ate treat, ta dah!!  It was pretty entertaining. It won't slow down treat eating for her, but I can show her off. And it is very durable. I will try some of Kyjen's harder puzzles! 3
I just want to preface this review by noting that I do stop into Starbucks and get flavored coffees (current favorite, Peppermint Mocha, whipped cream on top). So I had positive expectations of a vanilla flavored coffee. Unfortunately, this was among the worst Starbucks blends I've ever tasted. Just to give it a fair shot, I tried brewing and drinking it four different ways:<br /><br />1.Mild with no sugar or cream<br />2. Strong with no sugar or cream<br />3. Mild with sugar and cream<br />4. Strong with sugar and cream<br /><br />I also had friends taste test this. We all hated it. We couldn't choke it down as it was truly bitter and unpleasant. Maybe we got a bad batch or bag. At this point, we have nearly a whole bag left and I'm feeling guilty about wasting it. But there is no way I'm going to brew another pot of coffee and try to create a tasty brew. I tend to like my coffee extremely strong but even making it overly strong did not make it better. Yes, the vanilla flavor came through but it wasn't a good addition to a possibly decent coffee (without the vanilla). 2
The pistachios are large, fresh, and delicious!  This cute bag makes a perfect hostess gift, and a nice holiday gift for casual friends. 5
This is the best Jasmine Green Tea so far. I have tried a couple other brands but Stash comes out as the best. 4
I ordered this brand when I couldn't find my usual brand. This is quite good, and has a smooth, cozy vanilla taste. Not real spicey, not too sweet...very good. 4
A neighbor introduced me to this black coffee and the herb within, and I will be forever thankful to her. After reading these reviews, I was hesitant to even try it for a week because of the very few negative reactions noted here. When I finally dove in and made my first cup of "ganoderma coffee", my first impression was that it was the blandest coffee that I had ever tasted. Then the initial jolt kicked in as if I had downed a few shots of espresso. That wore off after an hour and then the ganoderma kicked in about two hours later. (Your system may not react the same!). The ganoderma kept me going all day and completely obliterated my appetite for food and even alcohol, which is a very good thing for me.<br /><br />Then I started wondering about the content of this product and started doing research. My initial guess was that this was mostly cheap robusta coffee with a high caffeine content and very little of the ganoderma. (It turns out that this assumption was wrong and there was very little coffee in this). One reason for the loss of one star in my rating is that the company does not post percentages of each ingredient. However, they seem to be the only one of the products that I tried that states that it is a product of Malaysia. It is well known that growing this mushroom in the tropics of southeast Asia produces the highest content of the active ingredient, which is an enzyme that breaks down dead wood (and junk in your arteries and veins).<br /><br />My neighbor also told me that hot water was needed to activate the ingredient, hence the coffee. Undaunted, I still went on a search to find capsules that were affordable and rated well. I visited two local health food stores and bought two different brands of 100-capsule bottles at a substantial savings below the suggested retail price of Organo Gold's capsules. One bottle scored an absolute zero, while the other bottle scored a bulls eye. I won't tell you the brands, because I spent a lot of time and some money to find this out myself. With the brand that scored the goose egg, I also dissolved the capsules into 8 ounces of hot water and still got no effect. As for the good brand, dissolving them in hot water only made them get to work faster. However, this good brand did not make me quite as hyper as this Organo Gold Black Coffee, so I still tend to believe that the Malysian grown reishi mushroom produces the highest concentration of the active ingredient. Other companies have figured out a way to grow them in laboratories, with mixed results. There are too many claims from each company claiming that their product is best, so the only way to find out is try with their cheapest version first and find out for yourself. A high cost does NOT mean that it is the best!<br /><br />So, if you hate the taste of coffee and like the jolt without the bad side effects of caffeine, then this product is for you. However, the taste of good ganoderma would actually be well suited to green tea, which this company also sells. As for me, I love the taste of good coffee made from fresh ground dark roast Central American Arabica beans, and I actually hate the jolt from cheaper robusta coffees. Since I also found cheaper ganoderma capsules, I have absolutely no use for this product. Since I am not 100% sold on this product, I certainly don't wish to spend all of my free time marketing this product. Those that wish to give it a shot, I wish you the best of luck. 3
This food does provide a reduced protein diet important to dogs that are show kidney values out of range. My dog ate it and liked it, though he would eat anything. Two concerns:<br />1) The amount of food prescribed is way out of line with the amount of food the dog should take in. Says for 50 lbs should be 4.5 cups, and for my 70 lb dog we fed 3 cups per the doctor, supplemented with raw veggies. The dog did not gain or lose any weight on this amount<br />2) We combined the Urinary SO 50/50 with the Renal mix - not sure why they have two. The vet cautioned about how this food will act as a diuretic, that the dog would be very thirsty and recommended we give him distilled water to drink to reduce load on the kidneys.<br /><br />What happened was instantly his poop became hard and smaller than normal. Brought it up to the vet who said this is normal. Dog drank water all the time, and did not exhibit signs of dehydration. What got dehydrated was his poop. He died of peritonitis brought on by a completely full colon because he could not get the very dry stool out of him properly. Very hard to see warning signs - he pooped twice a day, seemed a little distracted, but we had no idea his lower bowel had severly reduced movement. When he threw up undigested food four times in a row (12 hours after eating) the vet said to take him off Meloxicam for a week. Meloxicam is an NSAID arthritis drug known to cause kidney failure and ulcurs, and GI problems (bloody vomit or stools which Mikey did not have as we were watching closely for that). He stopped throwing up but I think it was coincidental timing. All these factors contributed to his death.<br /><br />Long story to say you must measure the water intake while on this food - more than keeping the bowl full. This food is VERY dehydrating. And be mindful of the output of the dog and weeks of very dehydrated poop is something that you should pay close attention to. 2
Decent price...arrived on time.  No complaints here.  We will continue to purchase this item.<br />My daughter loves her "goat milk".  :) 5
So Im a pop-tart lover, and the limited "seasonal" editions, are my favorite flavors. So ofcourse I love these Pumkin Pie flavored pop-tarts, but they do NOT taste like Pumkin Pie. One review said its like eating pumpkin pie, to me thats an over statement. They are yummy(delicious seriously),& yes pumpkin is actually listed in the ingredients, but these taste exactly like what they are Pumpkin flavored pop-tarts.<br /><br />However these are far to expensive online, Ive recently bought a 12 pck, which is only 6 servings (2 pastries to a wrapper)for 2.69$ i'd suggest buying from the grocery store, inless buying online is your last option :) 3
This is a simple product and it is simply good.  There are no extra ingredients that are hard to pronounce and have you scouring the internet finding out what they are.  It is a bit thinner consistency than the usual syrup, so use caution the first time you go to squeeze some out.  This will be great for people who like mint, it has a much stronger mint flavor than chocolate.  I use it in my coffee with a bit of half and half, tastes great.  Sometimes simple is better. 5
I ordered Twinings Green Gunpowder With Mint. Without notice I recieved regular not with Mint which is nothing like I ordered. 2
Have generally enjoyed this product over a few years-but found that one container (of 6-1 lb. size that I was shipped) so far had quite inferior ghee-with the milk fat still present-made me a bit sick-and threw away rest of container. 3
As an Oregonian, I make a point of sharing these Oregon-made snacks with friends who visit the state. I tell them the Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrew does for beer.<br /><br />Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.<br /><br />Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with Spicy Thai chips. Solomon wrote, "...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly."<br /><br />I also recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBV4">Kettle Chips Honey Dijon</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBUA">Kettle Chips Sea Salt & Vinegar</a>.<br /><br />The Honey Dijon chips bring a terrific balance of salty, tangy, sweet and crunchy. Other brands I've tried use too much mustard flavor, which overpowers the Honey Dijon pairing. The Honey Dijon chips make a great side dish on a BBQ plate with baked beans, coleslaw or potato salad and grilled meat. Naturally, they also go down great with beer.<br /><br />The Sea Salt & Vinegar chips are a perfect complement to vegetable trays of cucumber, carrot, celery and cherry tomatoes. Skip the dip; balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable.<br /><br />In summary, I highly recommend Kettle Brand chips, a great buy on Amazon.com. 5
This turned out fantastic, a little sweeter than I expecting but still great. May even consider this a dessert wine. Its nice using Cornucopia kits as they come complete with all the supplies you need, corks,labels,toppers,etc. I only use distilled water in the making of the wine, dont want to chance it with anything else. They have always turned out great. Give it a try.....The Farmwiner 5
They did a very good job with shipping the order quickly....Nothing like Ace Hardware who took a week to ship 5
Hope you have sharp teeth cause this jerky is tougher than your grandpas leather shoes. I broke a darn tooth eating this gator hide like jerky.<br />You get what you pay for with this product. I bought this jerky to save a couple bucks now I have to spend $1300 to get my darn tooth fix. 1
This Hot chocolate tasted very good!  The whole family liked it!!!  It is a nice change to make Hot Chocolate instead of coffee inthe Keurig coffee maker.  We wold purchase this again. 4
These are very good. They are very close to home made, but when I'm in a hurry, I really appreciate having them at hand. 5
Ramen cups (or bowls, in this case) are a guilty pleasure. I enjoy a Nissin or a Maruchan from time to time, but I know before adding the water that I'm not going to get a healthful snack. For that reason, I don't assess any star penalty for the nutritional transgressions that will be committed when one of these is consumed. They are what they are. You want healthy, eat a salad.<br /><br />Speaking of healthy, the Nongshim bowl proudly proclaims that it has 30% less sodium than their regular product and no MSG. But if you eat the whole thing you'll still be getting about 3/4 of your daily allotment of sodium (assuming a 2000 calorie diet) as well as artificial flavor and the usual cast of chemical names. As I mentioned, you would assume this much unless you just fell off a potato truck.<br /><br />All that said, I just didn't care for the Nongshim very much. I like spicy but I didn't find it all that flavorful beyond the spice heat. My 3-star rating is based solely on that. If sodium and healthy eating are concerns, you can work your way down the star scale from there. 3
Using 8 oz water as the directions state made the cocoa much too weak. It was like hot water with a few drops of chocolate syrup. Using 6 oz made the cocoa much too sweet, and still too weak in the chocolate department. It uses sucralose as a sweetener, which gives it a very intensely sweet flavor. This may not be a problem for those who like very sweet things or don't mind the taste of sucralose. Unfortunately, I'm not one of those people. 2
Although everything in basket was really tasty all products were very small in portion and very expensive.  Would not recommend. 3
....we found this popcorn to be too salty....so now I snip a tiny corner of the package before putting the popcorn into the popper and let most of the fine salt drain out.  That works just fine...and the popcorn tastes pretty darn good.... 3
My dog loves these treats and with her sensitive stomach, there are no problems plus they keep her teeth in great condition. 5
Nothing spectacular.  It wasn't as sweet as I'd expected nor as flavorful.  It seems like I would need to use two just to get one glassful.  I probably wouldn't order them again. 3
They taste great and are healthy. We keep our home stocked with Nana's Cookie Bars. 5
The item was nothing like what was shown in the picture. Also from my experience living in Japan, I am sure it cost them no more than 10 dollars for the whole package as opposed to the 40 they charge. 1
This is a nice smooth coffee, a part of the Keurig K-cup portfolio. This is labelled "extra bold." Not sure that that is the case. This has a nice smooth, albeit rather mild (and even bland) flavor.<br /><br />However, some K-cups have a harsh, almost acidic, quality to them and are not particularly pleasant. This produces a nice cup of coffee. 3
This peanut butter contains sugar - cane sugar, but sugar nonetheless. So please be advised, especially if you are a diabetic. 3
There is something very odd with the sweetener in this drink, I think. It tastes at first like strong black coffee, almost burnt, with some sugar and no cream added to it. Quickly, however, a really strange acidity overwhelms the rest of the taste. It's a little like that cheap liquid "diet" sweetener from the 1970s, which tasted like chemicals if you had it by itself.  It would probably be okay in this coffee if the coffee itself didn't taste burned, or if it balanced with more cream-type taste.  In fact, I finished the rest of the can I had by mixing it in with about 2 ounces of pre-made iced coffee in a carton, and that made a huge difference.<br /><br />I drink coffee daily and really enjoy other illy issimo products. This one just is not that good. 2
The first bag was great. The second bag was more prune paste than prunes. could not discern where the prumes began and ended in the mush. Too bad. I give the first bag a 5, and the second bag a 1. 3
I have been looking for a cracker that kind of passes off as a saltine cracker. My Mom's recipes require saltine crackers and so having celiac disease I have gone without! Now I can enjoy some of the recipes that I have grown up with. They also are good for snacking crackers. I thought they tasted like a cross between saltines and ritz. My husband went with a kinda grahm crackery taste. They are the first gluten free cracker I have found that are not so crispy they crack in pieces!! 5
I can't believe anyone is buying this stuff at Amazon!!!  Go to Keurig.com and pay half of this price.  Spread the word because this is rediculous! 1
Received the package in 2 days which was good; gladly opened one pack and very disappointedly found out it both smelled and tasted like outdated.  I also realized the item is not returnable which is double the disappointment..  this was the last time buying the product. 1
This product -eg the 35 lb bag- just DOUBLED in price, from 35 to 63$ for a 35lbs bag. Strangely the price for the 17 lb bag has remained unchanged..<br /><br />Delivery was prompt (prime), but on opening the bag the rancid smell was overwhelming. Granted it is still summer, but this bag must have been in a warehouse storage for some time.<br /><br />Aside from the rancid smell, it looked as advertised, small kibble without coloring, ingredients said to be all from the US.<br /><br />However, there is no justification to grossly overcharge for it.<br /><br />I will not reorder for that reason. And because the heavy rancidity of this product.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Hi-Tek-Naturals-Chicken-Formula-35-Pound/dp/B004TMGRLG/ref=sr_1_2?s=pet-<br />supplies&ie=UTF8&qid=1348333106&sr=1-2&keywords=hi+tek+dog+food 2
I'm drinking oolong tea because Dr Oz said it would raise metabolism, the jury is still out.......really how would you know? I have lost weight but that's because I quit drinking coffee which I added too much cream to and started working out a lot more. It does not taste the all that great so I add 3 equals and drink it after it cools. 3
No, these aren't as good as "real" fresh mashed potatoes, but they are about as quick and easy to make as it gets and they do taste pretty good for instant.  I'm no fan of instant mashed potatoes, but these are good enough to do in a pinch.  When I'm making a quick solitary meal, these will be a welcome addition from time to time. 4
Ingredients: Gluten-Free Oats, Og. Agave, Rice Blend (Brown Rice Flour, white rice flour, sweet rice four, tapioca starch, xanthan gum), organic chocolate chunks (og. sugar, organic cocoa paste, organic cocoa butter, non-GMO soy lecithin/emulsifier, gluten-free organic vanilla--Chunks may contain traces of milk protein due to manufacturing equipment); coconut sugar, monounsaturated safflower oil, organic eggs, almonds, coconut, chia seeds, natrual flavors, seas salt, baking soda, xanthan gum.<br /><br />Nutrition facts: per 40 g bar:  180 cal, 80 cal from fat, 9g total fat (13%), Sat fat 2g (10%), trans fat 0g, Cholesterol 15 mg (5%) sodium 130 mg 5%, Total carbohydrate 23 g 8% (fiber 2 g 10%, sugars 8g), Protein 2g.  Calcium 2%, Iron 4%, Anything else 0%.<br /><br />My family and I taste tested these, and mostly the reaction was lukewarm.  I love coconut and chocolate, so to me, they tasted like Girl Scout Samoa cookies, sort of, and I liked them and would buy them to eat if I were just judging on taste.  Opinion was split among the rest of my family, with mostly the toddler and 5 year old thinking they were great, but the three older children and my husband all agreeing that they prefer other flavors of bars.  The basic sentiment was that they are not good enough to count as a candy bar, and not healthy enough to count as a health bar. 4
The drink is 100% juice concentrate reconstituted with carbonated water.  It tastes like a cross between <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GN4OHK">Orangina Sparkling Citrus Beverage with Natural Pulp - 24 Cans</a> and the orange drink from McDonalds.<br /><br />It was refreshing at first, but the aftertaste is abrupt and almost chemically.  It's odd, because the drink doesn't have any unnatural flavors, according to the ingredients list.  If the end flavor was more natural, I would definitely buy it again. 3
I use hot chocolate packets to stir into my coffee.  I normally use Land O'Lakes hot chocolate, but I've had trouble getting some of my favorite flavors, so I wanted to try something new.  I ordered the Bellagio Chocolate Truffle flavor, and I suppose that it gets the job done.  But to make my coffee taste chocolatey enough, I've been having to mix in the Bellagio cocoa with a K-cup hot chocolate.  The flavor's a little flat, and the texture is pretty watery when compared to Land O'Lakes or even regular Swiss Miss.  I don't hate it, but there are better options out there, so I won't be ordering it again. 3
This stuff is just awful. Doesn't taste like chocolate in the slightest. I've had very good Mexican spiced chocolate that actually tasted like chocolate. This stuff is just a mix of cinnamon and a bunch of other overpowering spices that are not pleasant. I can't believe this stuff has such good reviews. It's iky 1
I love Sumatra coffee and was excited to receive these K-Cups however was disappointed when I opened my Amazon box and found that the plastic wrap holding the two boxes of K-Cups was full of grinds meaning that there was a possible blowout of a cup... after carefully unwrapping the boxes and attempting to get as little coffee grinds everywhere as possible I opened the first box and all cups were fine, however the second box every kcup was covered in fine grinds and I had to clean each one and found that 3 of the cups were defective due to the top being stamped on at an angle and the grinds had spilled everywhere. I now see other reviews stating they had defective cups as well. However the taste of the coffee is good. 4
The pecans are good, not great.  I've had others that were like eating candy.  Although, they do offer bigger cans. 3
These tomatoes taste like home canned. When summer is over and heirloom tomatoes no longer are available at the farmers market, these serve as an excellent reminder of the past season and a promise of the next. I originally bought these organic tomatoes for my stepfather, whose heart disease dictated a low sodium diet. And they are incredibly low in sodium. But I soon bought them for myself after I tried them just once. When the local organic grocery store and then Sprouts stopped carrying them, I turned to Amazon for a case. They are as much a staple in my pantry as olive oil. 5
This hot chocolate is delicious with some tweaking. I originally bought it because I cannot find hot chocolate in the store that does not contain any hydrogenated oils or a ton of sugar. Nestle is the only one who doesn't in their fat-free mix, but then you have the nasty artificial sweetners to deal with. I was ecstatic when I came across this (hopefully a dream come true) on Amazon and ordered it.<br /><br />I have to admit, my first batch wasn't very good. I followed the directions, and found the hot chocolate to be very strong. I like more of a milky chocolatey taste as opposed to a dark chocolatey taste in my hot chocolate.<br /><br />I consume sugar very sparingly, so I used both liquid and powdered Stevia with this chocolate. It produced okay results, but nothing really spectacular. I love Dagoba chocolate bars, so was expecting to be "wowed" by the hot chocolate, too. I was a little disappointed when I wasn't.<br /><br />I was camping on my third try making this chocolate, and gave up on the Stevia. I made the batch with half of the chocolate called for, and the only other item I had on hand that was sweet (I don't carry sugar)  was a bottle of organic pure maple syrup. I added a teaspon ot two of this to my cup, and voila! It was a totally different experience.<br /><br />After only adding half of the chocolate called for, and using both Stevia and a little bit of pure maple syrup, was this chocolate exceptional.<br /><br />I was finally able to taste the true colors and depth of this delicious chocolate. It kind of reminded me a little bit of Mexican hot chocolate because it has so much going on with it as far as the colors and depth go. Mexican chocolate is very flavorful, and this chocolate is too, with tweaking.<br /><br />Also, be sure to whisk the chocolate *very* well when heating up the milk (or other milk-type beverage) or you will end up with big clumps of unsweetened, unmelted chocolate in your cup. As it stands, when I whisk and whisk and whisk, I still get small clumps of chocolate in my cup.<br /><br />I rated this 4 stars because after tweaking, the choclate was delicious. If I hadn't had to tweak it, it would definitely get 5 stars. I would imagine if you just used sugar, you might not have the problems I had in the beginning. 4
This is instant coffee.  It tastes terrible.  If you don't use it shortly after you get it, the cups get hard and stuck together and doesn't work properly.  I won't buy again! 1
I ordered the 10 oz crab cakes.  Usually you expect a shell or so, but not in EVERY bite.  The 'lump' was not all lump meat either.  These were a great disappointment. The flavor is fine, but I would never order these again.  I have found G&M crab cakes to be true lump and much better than these. 1
This arrived at least a week late with no refrigeration. Upon opening the package, I found it was warm and smelled a bit strange. I would have sent it back, but it was stinking up my home and had to be disposed of. As for a refund, I'm still wondering if I want to banter with the monkeys who sent it. It took them long enough. 1
I read a previous review about the oat bran smelling rancid and clicked "buy", hoping it was just a bad batch that she received and that mine would be fine.  But unfortunately, that was not the case.  I wish I had saved the packaging so I could attempt to ship it back, but I was so excited to have GF oat bran that I poured it all into once big tupperware container.<br /><br />Not only does it smell rancid, it tastes bitter and awful. I tried soaking it in water overnight before cooking it to remove some of the bitterness, but it still tasted "off".  I have eaten a lot of oat bran, both GF and regular, and never has oat bran tasted like this.<br /><br />I don't like to leave bad reviews, but I really hope no one else makes the same mistake I did.<br /><br />Legacy Valley, I hope you just ran a couple bad batches.  If that is the case, do yourself a favor and THROW AWAY the remainder of those batches. 1
I opened a bag of this treat a week ago. It was a part of the Christmas present I gave to my 5-month old miniature schnauzer. My pet is crazy over this treat! I would have given this product five stars because my puppy loves it and it's highly nutritious (as claimed by the manufacturer). But I reduced my scoring to two-stars because it makes my puppy pass obnoxious-smelling gas. It doesn't bother him but it does me! When I reviewed the list of ingredients, I found a possible culprit: sweet potato. This is a root crop known to cause flatulence. 2
I decided to try this, and bought a bottle since I was up from 8:30am on a Sunday, and had to work a double (4am -Midnight and Midnight - 8am), and wouldn't be home till around 9am.<br /><br />It has a horrible taste.  I gagged and chugged down some water hoping to get rid of the taste.<br /><br />I chugged it around 5am, hoping the "5 hour" energy drink would last till I get home.<br /><br />Felt absolutely zero pick up, zero energy.  Didn't work for me. 1
Expected good, full flavor from this tea, recently having finished 2 packets of Japanese Gyokuro. It is bland, and the color of the steeped tea, an unattractive dark brown - with no hint of green. 2
This mix has a very good taste and zero nutritional value.  You might as well be drinking a soda.  So, if you want a smoothie with some nutrition, you're going to have to add your own stuff. 3
I have always been a fan of Kettle chips.  When you open a bag of Kettle chips you know you are going to get quality.  These chips are no exception and live up to the name printed on the package.<br /><br />The New York Cheddar chips  have a very subtle flavor to them.  You can taste the cheddar in them; but it doesn't smack you in the face like supermarket brand chips might.  The taste lingers as well which is a definite plus!<br /><br />Another aspect about these Kettle chips is the fact every chip is nice and crisp, that crunch in your mouth.  On top of that there are no burnt chips in any of the bags I have had since the purchase.  The only negative I might have is that the flavoring of the chips is uneven.  Some chips might pack a nice cheddar punch while another might taste rather plain.  This isn't a big flaw as it happens when getting seasoned and doesn't ruin the bag at all.<br /><br />Overall the quality of the chips is fantastic.  The flavor is great and you wont' be disappointed , especially if you are a cheddar lover! 4
This isn't horrible.  I still drink it, but I am never going to buy it again.  For starters, its WAY bitter.  I normally like dark black/bold coffe, but this has a bitter finish that is not very appealing.<br /><br />I've tried most of the k-cup coffee, and I think Caribou's Blend coffee is probably my favorite.  On the lighter end of the scale, the Coffee People's Donut Shop coffee is also pretty good. 2
I tasted a few of these and they are pretty good.  I was expecting something a bit flavorless and I can imagine happily snacking on these for a multi-day packing hike.  I will write more after I have taken them on the trail. 5
It was great to find that Amazon still made these great chocolatey wafers available.  It is almost impossible to find at the local stores.  It seems that Nabisco is doing away with many of our old favorites like these great chocolate wafers and crackermeal.  The only wish I would have is if we could buy in smaller quantities at a time.  There were a few boxes that were cracked into pieces rather than whole,however not affecting the great taste in any way. 4
Just as I remember from my childhood, though about a quarter of the box was broken. 4
I pay $2.50 a can for this at the gas station, this doesn't make sense. 1
I read lots of reviews on the internet on dry dog food, this one was highly rated for grain free.  it may be expensive but well worth the price. My standard poodle is very picky about his food, not a food hound in the least, he liked it immediately. 4
The product description reads:<br /><br />...We then package them in our authentic Maxwell House glass jars to seal in that rich flavor and aroma...<br /><br />I ordered these because the description notes that they are packaged in GLASS jars which is my preference for ensuring the freshest coffee taste.<br /><br />These are NOT GLASS jars. They are plastic. I can get plastic at the local Mart.<br /><br />Very disappointing. 1
My grandson and husband love to bond drinking this hot chocolate together. I get it every other month.  I can't ever be without it. 5
I have an immense love for pancakes.  I have been on a search for the best pancake mix for about a year. I did not write this review prematurely as I wanted to give the product a fair chance.  I tried it with whole milk.  I tried it with buttermilk. I tried it with blueberries. I tried it without blueberries.  It is by far the WORST mix I have tried thus far.  The flavor is not good, seems like it needs more sugar.  With blueberries, it is very hard to get the pancakes to cook all the way through without overcooking them.  I really am telling you all the hype on this product has got to be from people that either work for the company lol or have never tried another high quality mix.  I honestly would rather eat pancakes from McDonalds.  Don't waste your money!  (Robbys mix is also wayyyyyyyyyy better and I believe it was cheaper). (may be better for waffles...since I'm stuck with two cans I may try that...ugh!) 1
Arrived super fast.  Works exactly as advertised. I would highly recommend this product. I think they do help me keep my electrolytes in balance when I'm outside working hard all day. I think they are yummy! 4
I always pick medium coffees because I can't take anything stronger, but this bean is way too weak for me. I use a french press to make my coffee, and take it with a little sugar and half & half. The coffee didn't taste bad, it just didn't have much flavor. My husband and I managed to finish the entire 5-lb bag, but now I'm glad it's over so that I can look for a better bean. 3
I have ordered coffee beans through Amazon numerous times.  I've also ordered from the particular roasting company on more than one occasion.  I must admit that I have been disappointed with the freshness of these beans which is the likely cause of the lack of flavor.  I won't order these again even if they are less expensive than others.  What you pay for, you get. 2
Coffee is very weak,I have to use 3 packs to make 4 cups of coffee. 1
This was supposed to contain 50 Tully's Breakfast Blend K-Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers.  Instead there were only 38 K-Cups, 4 of which were Green Mountain Half-Caff and one of the Tully's K-Cups was busted open.  I've ordered K-Cups through Amazon many times in the past with no issue.  This is by far the absolute worst experience I've ever had with them and makes me question whether or not I'll purchase any more from them. 1
Product did nothing to stop squirrels from attacking my tomatos. I appled per directions to create a barrier.. the squirrels just played in the barrier area or stopped in it to eat the tomatos after stealing them from the vines. Product just does not work..period. Save your money and just buy your produce with it or buy new plants. 1
I purchased a case of these tomatoes a couple of months ago, and the cans were so badly bent and warped my can opener won't open them.  I complained to Amazon and they shipped another case out right away - but those cans are worse than the first case!  I won't order again. 2
I purchased Dentastix about a month ago.  My dog loves them, however, whether they really help to prevent tartar, is too erly to tell.  My dog devours them a little yoo fast, which makes it doutful that the sticks serve their purpose. By all means, it won't hurt to use them.\<br />Ursula Behrens 4
They sent me the French Roast which is not a favorite of mine at all. The coffee advertises as low acid, but after two cups, I was feeling the acid. I'm sure it is most likely because of the dark roast rather than any extra acid in the coffee. The flavor is good when fresh brewed, but it doesn't sit in the pot well. It would be best for company when the whole pot will be served rather than as a daily pot for one person. It is very strong, and reminds me of New Orleans coffee without chicory. 2
On a taste standpoint, it's barely mediocre--bland, with an odd aftertaste, and made with inferior ingredients. Although the foil wrapping is attractive, it easily separates, leaving a mess and exposing the chocolate. Considering the hefty shipping cost, I would not order this product again. 2
This was a nice cookie. The cookies are individually packaged so that you can easily tuck them into a lunchbag or a purse, and the packaging really does hold up well. The cookie itself is slightly on the dry side, but good. For someone looking for a sneaky way to get some extra fiber into my diet and my husband's, this worked really well! 4
My dog can't seem to figure this one out.  No matter how much he tugs on it, the food doesn't come out.  We prefer the Kong Wobbler.  This was a waste of our money. 1
When I need to cook some onions and peppers without having to saut&eacute; them first, this is perfect. They taste great and add so much delicious flavour to food. 5
I normally don't give my dog rawhide, because they usually make him throw up.  However, based on the reviews here, I decided to try these since he is getting older now (9 years old) and does need some help keeping his teeth clean.  Here is my pro/con list:<br /><br />Pro:<br />- Amazon ships these to you fast<br />- dog loved these at first lick<br />- I ordered large size (my dog is ~80lbs) and it kept him busy for about 20-30mins.  A normal bone (busy bone, dentabone, etc) would normally only last 5mins<br />- Seems to make his breath smell better too<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Price, but for what you get, this might not really be a con<br />- I think it gives my dog gas<br /><br />I recommend trying this product, especially if you have tried normal rawhides with no success. 4
Let me start by saying that the seller did an excellent job of packaging the case with not one dented can and it arrived quickly. My cat refused to eat the Purina NF and Hills K/D sold at my vet's office and was willing to starve himself if that was all he was offered. I read many reviews on other sites prior to purchasing and located a site where you can order individual cans. Great as a trial in case my cat refused to eat it. However, that site sent me 6 cans of the old formula and 6 cans of the new formula.  Being new to this brand, I turned to the internet to figure out what had changed. Apparently, the ingredient listings have not been updated for the new formula, even on the manufacter's site.  The new formula lists beef as the primary meat ingredient.<br /><br />My two cats including one that does not have kidney problems were initially enjoying the food, licking their plates clean with a distinct preference towards what turned out to be the old formula. I thought finally I had found a kidney diet that wouldn't end up in the trash. By the time I received the shipment, the attraction had worn off. One of my cats vigorously claws at the floor in an attempt to cover the food dish and the other (diagnosed with kidney disease) runs from the bowl after a few bites. They have gone back to eating regular food for now.  However, I am going to try and mix the more enticing food into the Hi-Tor before I completely give up on it and request a refund, and continue my search.  My local humane society does not retain "special needs" cats or dogs so donating it is out.  On the bright side, this seller has a 30 day return policy. 3
The price of this product was outlandish. One half of the cans arrived with major dents, even though the package appeared to be in perfect condition. However the shipment arrived quickly. The contents of the one can we have used (the one most seriously dented) were fine. 1
I have at least 4 dozen different k-cups at my house right now because we love to experiment with different flavors.  My favorite is Timothy's Rainforest Espresso because I like a bold coffee.  But others that prefer something milder say that Breakfast in Bed is their favorite.  I like it to but only when made as a stronger brew.  I have purchased maybe 15 boxes of this since it came out. 5
smokehouse almonds are great but i just can't take all of the salt so i rub some of the salt off of them and then i go to town, if they sold lightly salted ones i would probably not only be addicted but broke as well from eating them so much love love love this product and will buy again. 4
I like the high protein/fiber and low calories. But this was way too sweet. I had to double the amount of recommended water to be able to drink this. I have also tried the iced tea and pink lemonade. I like the pink lemonade best and this one the least. Overall, the product is not bad. It dissolves completely and does not have aftertaste. Give it a try. But before buying a bunch of one single flavor, try them all first. 4
These are crazy addictive little buggers. The menthol flavor doesn't appeal to many folks: I've tried to give some away with few takers. These do not give you the horrendous gas that the alcohol sugar treat give you but they do give you some. I probably won't buy these again. 3
Getting really good cocoa out of a K-cup is not easy but this is much better than the others I have tried. Still a little wattery, but at 60 calories it is a nice treat.  very rich flavor - not as good as the real thing, bit I am not drinking it in a Berlin Chocolate shop either.  Put your slippers on, sit in front of the fireplace with your sweetie, and enjoy!<br /><br />60 cal (20 fat)  --  2g fat sat  --  11 carb  --  6g sugar  --  &lt;1g fiber 4
I ordered these without having purchased them previously, so wasn't entirely sure whether I would like them. What I really wanted are Pretzel Rods without salt on the outside. That is, "Baldies" but in rod shape instead of twists. I have previously had sesame pretzels, and liked them, so thought this might be an acceptable substitute.<br /><br />However, these are much smaller/thinner than pretzel rods and are much saltier than needed given the sesame seeds. We'll use these, but I'll keep looking for a lower-salt pretzel rod. 3
I don't care for Bigelow's version of their Spiced Chai. They don't list their ingredients on the box - but this definitely has something strange in it. I bought it because I couldn't find my regular brand - but I'll be giving these away. :( 2
Hint, pour on a bit of seafood sauce with horseradish in it and microwave a few seconds to warm up.<br /><br />I just tried a can of these for breakfast this morning.  There were about 9.5 ounces of actual sardine in there and the rest was sauce.  Still not bad considering that's the equivalent of just over two cans of sardines for somewhere under three dollars if you buy them 24 at a time.<br /><br />The fish weren't the freshest tasting I've had, but they weren't that bad either.  At least they're the medium size sardine fish and not the herring you find in the really cheap sardine cans.<br /><br />Here's way to beat the recession and get your protein and calcium. 3
This isn't bad but it isn't anything spectacular. I've tried this and Taste Nirvana's brand and honestly I prefer Taste Nirvana because it tastes more natural. 3
These cookies are delicious and great for a sweet treat if you are on Weight Watchers! However, they are expensive so I was thrilled to find them at a much more reasonable price! 5
Maybe, I got a bad one.  It's very plain, nothing special in flavor.  I felt like I wasted my time and money. I will not buy this flavor again. 1
I bought this coffee for my Keurig coffee maker and I really like it. Smooth  and the best thing it is an organic. Wolfgang uses the the best beans for his coffee's. Buy you will be pleasantly surprised. 5
Two of the six packages had lost their vacuum seal so were completely tasteless.  The still-sealed ones were not nearly as tasty as Yuban.  I would NOT buy this product again. 1
As other reviewers have noted, this is a round O's-type cereal. I like the fact that it isn't excessively sweet. I avoid most "kid's cereals" these days because of the excessive sweetness, but this cereal is OK from a "grownup taste" point of view (for lack of a better term). The peanut flavor is fairly strong, which is absolutely fine with me. Perhaps a little too carbohydrate-laden to be a main breakfast course for me, but it does make a tasty snack. 4
I've had these a number of times and my most recent attempt was an utter and complete failure. The amount of water recommended wasn't enough to hold my falafel balls together and they came out dry. I suspect this is why they fell apart in the oil. Also half an inch of oil in the pan is really insufficient if you want to make normal sized falafel balls. Even at one inch in diameter you would have to flip them over to cook both sides of the ball. This also results in a partially cooked interior.<br /><br />Taste wise these are rather unspectacular. Any half decent restaurant falafel will be better than these. But then again what do you expect for something that comes in a powder form.<br /><br />I say try making your own from scratch. It's not easy to find a perfect mixture that won't disintegrate, but when they are good they are divine.<br /><br />In the meantime I'll continue looking for another prepackaged falafel option. 2
On an English muffin, the day starts off best with the mild taste of ginger! 5
Bought a pack of a 100 of these and each cup it takes so long to process the coffee.. Each cup I get coffee grounds in and not a whole cup of coffee.. Great concept, I believe the paper filter is to fine which holds back the coffee and pressure which results in bleeding of coffee grounds out of the 2 other holes.. Regular K Cups work work much better.. Again great idea, just not so great of a product.. 2
Despite reading the reviews of others on how hard this was to open, I was confident I knew the secret so would be fine. Not so. No matter what I did, couldn't pop off the clear plastic lid. Instructions showed the bottom part screwing off, didn't. Husband couldn't even do it and he opens everything for me. He finally got it open, only held about half of the aspargus which is what I wanted it for so tossed it in the garbage and then bought one from Progresso that we both can open. Note to self, pay MORE attention to what people are saying. 1
What could be better than a soft Chips Ahoy cookie with a fudge center?  Apparently quite a few things, as this tempting snack did not live up to expectations.  To start with, the image of the cookie on the package looked nothing like the contents within.  Perhaps it was because the cookies arrived on my doorstep in the heat of summertime, I don't know, but what I found were trays of unappealing, blackened-looking (because of the fudge interior) chocolate chip cookies.  Oddly, it looked as if these snacks got into a fight and emerged all black and bruised.<br /><br />Still, a cookie might look ugly and still offer up a great taste.  Well, not so much.  Yes, there was a definite overload of chocolate, to be sure, but it had a sandy, gritty taste.  I stopped my snacking after a single cookie, even though the serving size is two for 3.5 grams of saturated fat (thankfully, no trans fat).  Again, I am willing to accept that I maybe got a bad package or one effected by the heat, though I rescued it from my porch less than ten minutes after it was dropped off by UPS.  I can't recommend this, unfortunately.  I would instead go with a Keebler Soft Batch cookie any day. 2
Popchips are ok.  However, these snacks are made from potato flakes, similar to "Pringles".  If you have ever eaten "Funyuns" the onion flavored rings made by Frito Lay you have already tasted pretty much what Popchips taste like, just without the onion flavoring.  If your not concerned with calories, but simply want the best potato chip you can buy, try "Grandma Utz" potato chips, a true potato chip. 2
I would prefer heavier syrup but they are as advertised and quite good.  I really wanted to get the all-grapefruit but found that they weren't always available. 4
To quote another reviewer, I can't understand the high praises these chips have been receiving.<br /><br />Based on their popularity and high review score I ordered the 6-flavor variety pack off of Amazon. With some excitement I tore open the packaging and tried the various flavors. I was met with disappointment. Texture-wise, these chips are not crunchy at all and are unsatisfying. The flavors vary from terrible to passable. I couldn't finish the pack of what they call "salt and vinegar" chips.<br /><br />I suppose these chips might be popular with people who are trying to watch their weight.<br /><br />An anecdote: the day after I received these I gave the rest away to the other people in my dorm (who proceeded to affirm my suspicions that these chips were subpar). I then went to the corner shop across the street and bought some salt & vinegar Kettle chips. 2
I have a Golden Retreiver, and 2 labs.  All big dogs.  They love the chews BUT I caution you to PLEASE keep an eye on your dogs while they are chewing them.  The chews tend to soften as the dogs chew and chews often stick in the back of the dogs throat and I have to stick my fingers down to remove the last piece of chew.  I would never leave my dogs alone while eating any type of rawhide chew. 4
I've bought this product many times and this time (11/10) they are old or defective.  The bags don't puff up and rinds are flat, stale & burn when cooked.  I've tried different time settings and in different microwaves.<br /><br />I'm very dissapointed as this is a product I've been ordering for years.  Guess I'll have to call them and complain. 1
I opened a bag of these chips. I thought I detected a strange odor but put one into my mouth anyway.<br /><br />The chips were definitely rancid. I tried several other bags and discovered the same rancid taste.<br /><br />I threw them all away. Caveat emptor. 1
The is a very basic tea chest.  The Bigelow website offers many more and the quality is much better for similiar prices.  This particular tea chest can also be found at BJ's Wholesale Club for $19.99. 2
I am a chocolate fanatic and pairing chocolate with tea only seems natural to me.  I've sampled several chocolate flavors and this Stash tea, when compared to the others, is nothing spectacular.  When unbrewed, the Stash tea bag smells like chocolate but that scent does not translate to much of a chocolate flavor once the tea is brewed.  I could taste quite a bit of vanilla and some nut but the chocolate was just negligible. Additionally, there was a strange aftertaste with this tea.  It just wasn't pleasant.<br /><br />If you are committed to a chocolate decaffeinated beverage, your choices will be limited. I have sampled quite a few chocolate teas and many use a black tea base.  However, if interested in a caffeine free tee that has a good body, I would recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030LXA0I">Chocolate Chai Tea by Zhena's Gypsy Tea</a>, which is a naturally caffeine free tea.  Zhena's chocolate chai is supposed to taste like chocolate, but it has a lot of spices.  Still, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030LXA0I">Chocolate Chai Tea by Zhena's Gypsy Tea</a> has a much richer overall flavor than the Stash Premium Chocolate Hazelnut tea.<br /><br />If you don't care about caffeine and are just looking for a chocolate tea, there are several others that I would recommend before this one.  They include: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0031TJ0X0">Tisano Organic Chocolate Tea</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO64F6">SerendipiTea ChocolaTea, Chocolate, Vanilla, Rooibos & Black Tea, 4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 2)</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QY03TC">Bigelow White Chocolate ObsessionTea, 1.6-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.  The first two are loose teas and the last is a bagged tea.<br /><br />At the end of the day, I don't think I would recommend this Stash tea to any chocolate lover.  It doesn't taste like chocolate and the overall flavor is poor. 2
Satisfying.<br /><br />I love that this chocolate is organic. From the first to last ingredient.<br /><br />I love that the first ingredient is dark chocolate.<br /><br />I love the taste. Intense, rich with a hint of sweet.<br /><br />The one thing I didn't love was the meltability on the tongue factor. I don't know if the bar is so thick that this slows the process. I broke it into a smaller chunk and it sat on my tongue awhile. Not that that's awful..it's chocolate for goodness sake... I guess I could say it's slow to melt. Chewing didn't hurry the process.<br /><br />Allergies or Vegan? The standard disclaimer appears. "This product manufactured on equipment that may process products containing peanuts, other nuts, milk powder, wheat, soy and egg." However the only listed ingredient on that list is the organic soy lecithin.<br /><br />Overall tasty. And pretty much what it promises. 4
This is a good quality product, which definitely helps tame my tummy.  I have it each evening and it makes a huge difference in how I feel.  Definitely recommended, along with Heather's Acacia Fiber, which is life-changing. 5
I put my cat on Evo for 2 years, she got a urinary tract infection.I had to change her food. Right after I changed her food. I found out Evo is terrible for animals, the food is causing alot of health problems.I got a letter in the mail stating there is a lawsuit against Innova Evo plus all Natura products.I'm currently in the lawsuit myself.. Evo lied about the ingredients in all their products...DO NOT BUY EVO AND NATURA PRODUCTS!!! (such as Innova Evo, California Natural, Healthwise, Mother Nature, and Karma Dog)Google it, it's called PetproductsSettlement.com.. It's for a $2,150,000 settlement. 1
BEWARE!! As usual everything about the deal went great because of Amazon; prompt delivery, etc., etc. However, this coffee will expire in less then 3 months. So, clearly, this has been sitting around somewhere. I buy other Kirkland coffee's at my local Costco and they usually don't expire for 12 to 18 months. Unfortunately, the Kirkland Espresso hasn't made it to the East Coast (last year or so far this year), at least not at the Costco's around me, and I wanted to try it, since, even at this inflated price it's priced about the same as 2 pounds of Lavazza, etc.<br /><br />So, hopefully it will be fine when I open it, but don't buy this expecting to use it this winter! 3
The noodles smell really bad before you rinse them.  They have a weird texture and you definitely have to add something to them.  They are a strange white color.  Very odd experience. 2
Product had 4 months to go on date when I received it.  Tasted stale.  You cannot return this item, so your stuck with 10 boxes of them.  $30 down the drain.  2nd food item I've received from Amazon in the last few months that was stale tasting.  I think your local grocer is a safer bet for this type food item.  That is, if you can find it locally.  At least you can try a smaller quantity and return it if neccessary. 2
Okay, the bottom line for this food is that my cat, Buster, wouldn't eat it.  He LOVES canned cat food usually, but is 13 1/2 years old and rather finicky now.  He likes just about any kind of Fancy Feast, though once in a while, being a cat, he will turn up his nose even at that.<br />But I couldn't get him to do more than lick some of the gravy off the first serving I gave him of these chicken-flavored items. Subsequent offerings were met with the floor-scratching response (cat owners usually know this, but the cat is using the same gesture he uses in the litter box, effectively saying "This stuff is c***!").<br />My friends who have cats don't give them canned food - so I have most of this stuff left in my basement awaiting a hungry, interested feline consumer.<br />The product is made in Thailand, which is too close to China for my comfort, anyway.  We all know about recent deaths and problems with Chinese-made pet food (and baby formula!) ingredients.  I considered not using this product at ALL once I noticed it was from Thailand.<br />But Buster made the call, so I didn't have to. 2
I recieved a Keurig K-Cup Brewer for Christmas with sample cups of coffee and tea but no cocoa so I tried this brand and I like them but I haven't tried other brands yet to compare with. I would buy these again until I find one I like better. 4
I had been expecting White Chocolate Flamingo Droppings, the kind favored by *les nobles qui sait* in Nice and Monaco. I have used those for years as both an alleviate and an ironic potpourri for would-be long-term guests, and I have never been disappointed. Imagine my dismay, then, when I received (by breathless messenger) this item, clearly intended to be *eaten*.  Shudder. 2
I love this gum.  It is very dishearting that it is so difficult to find.  I was hooked on the Cinnamon Extra until that went away.  Now this item is not available.  This world needs more Cinnamon lovers. 5
I did not care for this product at all, I thought it was the same tea my sisters and I use to drink when we were in elementary school. I found out the tea we use to drink actually came from the root of a particular type of tree. 2
This soup is easy to make, ready in a minute, and reasonably tasty if you take it for what it is. Don't expect a gourmet experience, however. 3
First of all, I am aware that this is made for the gun, however after reading the reviews I purchased it and let me say I have never been more dissapointed. In the picture the gold is brilliant, bold, and intense. When I got this product it was oily in appearance and looked like vinegar in color. I used a paintbrush as I read in a previous review. The color is a yellow, maybe a copper tone---nothing like gold. I used part of this for an anniversary cake--I had to drive to the arts and crafts store to purchase Wiltons Gold shimmer to attempt to cover this disaster. I thought $15 was pretty expensive in the first place, but after using the product I am sure it is not worth a single cent. I cannot believe how grotesque this color is. If I wanted a copper/yellow tone I would have just used edible dye---I sure would have saved the money for something else. I bake hundreds of cakes each year, and I am confident to say that this is the worst item I have ever used. Garbage. I have another bottle that should be arriving in the mail in a couple days for the silver color, I will be sending it right back and getting my money back for sure! 1
My wife is very fond of chocolate covered cherries and has tried just about every brand.  She assures me that these are the very best she's ever eaten. 5
I first found these at a local deli but they freqently were out of stock so I was thrilled to find them on Amazon. These are very satisfying and I have great fun introducing friends and co-workers to them.<br /><br />I also frequently recommend them to people with sore throats or coughs. Honey is an antibacterial agent and very soothing so these make an excellent lozenge in addition to being a wonderful candy.<br /><br />I bought a case so I can hand them out to people having a bad day. :) 5
Once again , clueless consumers that feed their cats nearly inedible corn, glutens, and by-products, none of which are good for your animals.  Last reviewer thinks they are a good cat mom -  think again.  This is one of the worst foods out there along with meow mix, science diet, friskies, most purina products.<br />Would you let your kids eat french fries and fritos for all their meals?  this is pretty much the same thing for your cats.<br />Read the labels -  main ingredients should be meat, not corn, not byproducts.  Glutens are allergens and used as filler and should be avoided.  Look around, there are affordable good foods available -  some warehouse clubs sell their brands which are very good (starts with a "C").  Check pet food ratings, dot net.<br /><br />Ignorance is no excuse for torturing your animals with terrible food 1
I bought a 24 pack of this an drank almost all of them before realizing what the flavor reminded me of. It tastes like hotdog water. 1
Silly me, I didn't read the packaging terribly closely. I was actually rather pleasantly surprised. Basically, it's carbonated fruit juice from concentrate, or as they say: "100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, tangerine, orange and acerola [cherry] juice concentrates)."<br /><br />Gone is the usual second ingredient in such beverages: "high fructose corn syrup" or the old standby "sugar"...<br /><br />Basically, it reminds me of a carbonated version of Tropicana Pure or one of the Odwalla beverages, watered down just slightly (not quite as sugary, but still pretty darned sweet).<br /><br />Overall, I rather liked it. It's a bit smaller than your typical Pepsi or Coca-cola can. But I could see it being handy for kids' lunches and such. Slightly better than typical "soda" with corn syrup. Though I'm not sure whether it would be preferable to straight up fruit juice...<br /><br />Personally, I'd rather have the fruit juice (like a Hansen's smoothie or something, granted they're a bit sugarier)... But some folks like carbonated beverages. So, why not make one out of actual fruit juices rather than all sorts of more artificial stuff?<br /><br />Rather liked the Orange Tangerine one. I'm interested now to try some of the other flavors and see if they're as good. Especially <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH40">Kiwi Berry</a>... But possibly also <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH54">Watermelon Strawberry</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH2C">Fruit Punch</a>. 5
<span class="tiny"> Length:: 1:15 Mins<br /><br /></span>These are great treats that will please the most discriminating canine palate. 5
This was delicious!  The taste is sweet, like banana bread, and the chewy, soft texture with nuts on top is good! I wouldn't buy this, though, just due to calories/sugar content. 4
This salt is so tasty!  It tastes nothing like the iodized table salt.  This has a light, mild taste that greatly enhances meats, vegetables, etc.  It's pink/peach color also looks very pretty in my clear Cole/Mason grinder.  It grinds very finely with no issue.  In fact, this salt grinds so finely that it leaves a fine coating, almost like a powder, around the inside of the clear grinder.  If you're a neat freak, this might bug you a little and you might find yourself wiping out the top of the grinder.  Great salt and the bag lasts a long time. 5
I am a Green Mountain Dark Magic fanatic, so this coffee fell a little short for me. It has good flavor, but is just not strong enough for me. 3
I've been a fan of Nong Shim spicy noodles for years, so when this instant version came along I had to try it. I love Korean style fat noodles and the fact that it's instant is a big plus. Unfortunately, it didn't taste as flavorful as their other lines and by comparison I find this version a little plain. No comments on the health factor since instant noodles by nature is junk food. But there's a time and place for them. 3
This is basically shredded white chicken in a seasoned gravy like broth. ALL 5 of my cats inhaled it and licked their bowls clean. It appears as human grade food. That said,and since it is not organic, it is more cost effective to buy a can of broth, add some seasoning and add a mashed can of chicken. I think the cost of this cat food for the convenience is not worth it-now if it were a 5-6 oz. can, then I probably would think it was a reasonable trade off. Just a note-the greatly higher amount of chicken you get in this flavor vs. the pot pie watery flavor is considerable. 3
The millet flour was rancid, I wonder how long it had been sitting on teh shelf beofre they shipped it. I would not recommend buying this product from Amazon. 1
Such a perfect companion to the Babycook! I freeze in this and once the food is frozen, I take them out and put in a labeled ziploc because the lid doesn't quite seal tight enough for my comfort but would definitely purchase again! 5
If you are tired of having peanut butter sandwiches for lunch every day, try one of these Annie Chun's Peanut Sesame Noodle Bowls.  It is delicious and better yet, vegetarian.  The noodles are pre-cooked just right, not too soft, not too hard, topped with chopped peanuts and a tangy peanut sauce, just the way I like it.  However, the dried veggie flakes are just "decorative" and I didn't see any sesame seeds.  Annie Chun surely knows how to cook.  She has got another winner. 4
I had previously ordered baby hulless from Riehl's Select but tried Whirley-Pop this time since it was less expensive. It didn't seem to be baby or even remotely close to hulless, as many hulls got stuck in my teeth (and one still stuck at the back of my throat). It was lacking in taste, too - better off buying regular grocery store popcorn for the taste (if you don't mind the hulls). Amazon was great and refunded my money, but I'm going back to Riehl's baby yellow popcorn. 1
We like the flavor of the coffee, however,water overflows with grounds unless we brew on smallest cup setting. Haven't had this issue with any of the other K cups we've bought. 2
Compared to Pacific Gold beef jerky, this beef jerky is way too salty! You have to drink a glass of water for every piece of jerky you eat.  It's also a littler drier and less tender than other beef jerky.  I would recommend trying other brands of beef jerky and staying away from this unless you want to develop early high blood pressure. 2
i used extra yeast and a little more water and it came out very light with a heard crust, which i like. i will order it again. not much of a potato taste but good bread 5
I should have looked closer at the description.  I am quite disappointed that a product that is called "Eating Right" would contain HFCS (high fructose corn syrup).  The taste isn't all that great either. 2
Pill pockets are great! My dogs love them. They are soft so perfectly hides the pill medication we give them. 5
Although expensive, my fussy eater has eaten this with significant improvement to her skin and coat!  She no longer has breakouts, hotspots, and chewing problems.<br /><br />she is much happier and healthier! 4
If you don't like ginger, you're not going to like Gold Kili's Ginger and Lemon beverage. The ginger is very strong, bites the tongue a bit, but the lemon is not as strong and while I noticed it, ginger is definitely the frontrunner here.<br /><br />Inside the packet is enough powder mix to fill my 14-ounce mug. I specifically used the larger mug because most packet drinks to me are overly sweet. I don't like a lot of sugar. Instructions are easy, simply pour the mix into your cup, add boiling water, and stir. It's that easy and the mix dissolved quickly. I saw some ginger grounds, but as I love ginger, that definitely wasn't an issue with me.<br /><br />It tastes incredible. Very strong ginger as mentioned earlier, and not a fake ginger, this seems more like dehydrated ginger ground into a course powder. The sugar level was still a little sweet for my tastes, but I think using the larger cup was definitely worthwhile in my case.<br /><br />I happen to have a cold. It's not bad, but annoying nonetheless. After finishing my cup of ginger and lemon beverage, my nose felt a little less clogged, so the ginger aroma and steam obviously helped. Next time though, and I definitely will be buying this mix, I think I'd make it and then chill it for a refreshing summer drink. 4
****Latest Update****<br /><br />We are now past the baby food stage so I may have missed this if it was formally announced, but I recently heard that they switched packaging in late 2011 to be completely BPA free.  I confirmed this with customer service.  Leaving the remaining review as it was...<br /><br />*********************<br /><br />My wife had made her own baby food for our daughter for the first eight months. Then, when our daughter was going to begin daycare, there was a certain convenience factor of being about to send in jars of baby food for her and so we bought Earth's Best. It was organic, and figured to be the closest bought brand to what she had been making herself. The variety packs are a nice, easy way to stock different kinds for our baby to enjoy... and enjoy she did for several of the flavors, though some she hated as well. All in all, we were pleased, and baby seemed pleased, though I will say, she didn't seem to like these gourmet ones any better or any worse than the less expensive <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BM6LVS">Earth's Best Organic 2nd Dinner Variety Pack, 4 Ounce Jars (Pack of 12)</a>.<br /><br />Needless to say, I was pretty surprised to read a review about BPA in the lids at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BM395E">Earth's Best Organic 2nd Fruit Variety Pack, 4-Ounce Jars (Pack of 12)</a>, (and so I posted my review there as well).  I spent some time trying to verify this myself. A lot of different blogs stated it, and while I couldn't find anything definitive, here's what bothered me: Clearly Earth's Best knows people are concerned about BPA in their lids... their own facebook site is littered with people asking this same question. The admin answers these the same way... food safety and baby health is of the highest priority, call us to discuss. That's only slightly paraphrased. Going to their website, they have zero articles on BPA and none in the FAQs section either... nothing. I'm not worried enough about the issue to stop using what we purchased, but I would have felt a whole lot better about the company and their products if they would acknowledge parents' concerns and tell parents... something. Hey, we check our food in laboratory testing regularly and the the amount of BPA found in our food is X, which is so low, there are no health concerns... just say something... anything. Do you really want the onus on the customer to contact you to keep using your product?<br /><br />As I was taking the time to review their product, I decided I would call them to give them a fair chance to explain. Something, I likely wouldn't have done if I wasn't writing a review. Their office was closed... 9AM - 7PM est. Not the most convenient times for a working parent, but I will attempt to follow up and update this accordingly.<br /><br />****UPDATED (old)****<br />Just spoke to someone from customer service.  She says that the liner that comes into contact with the food is BPA free, but that there is another section of the lid behind this liner, that does contain BPA, but that section of the lid does not come in contact with the food.  I'm sure not everyone will be okay with that answer, but I'm ok with it.  I still think it should be an answer that's readily available to consumers without calling them, but I will say there was no hold time at least. 4
The can of illy issimo Coffee Drink claims "100% natural Arabica coffee and the finest ingredients".  There are in fact only four ingredients, the first two of which are coffee and sugar. Note - no High Fructose Corn Syrup here.  The other two ingredients aren't what you'd typically put in for yourself, potassium bicarbonate and potassium citrate, often added to drinks to regulate acidity.<br /><br />The taste is pretty good for a canned product - nice strong coffee flavor, the way I like it. Perhaps a bit more sugar than I would normally use, but less than I find in most commercial drinks. There is a hint of chemical in the taste, but it isn't obnoxious. I found it quite refreshing. One can is 50 calories, about 2/3 what you'd find in the equivalent amount of soda.  Caffeine content is 155mg per can, about on par for brewed coffee and maybe twice what a typical can of an "energy drink" contains. 4
Nutricity is the very worst ever place to order.  I ordered almond butter thinking it came in a glass bottle and when I received it it was packages in plastic.  I returned them and they send me an email saying they did not receive returns.  When I tried to get in touch with them with their 800 number a recording said they only handle returns via email.  I will never ever order from them.  I highly recommend that nobody ever orders from them.  When I ordered I never read that you couldn't return an item.  And then to top it off I could not talk to anyone in their company they handle all via email.  VERY DISSAPOINTING!  DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING FROM THEM. 1
I agree with the previous reviewers - I should have listened! My Boston Terrier chewed up and ate an entire bone in less than 5 minutes. This may be a good "treat" but I would not call it a chew toy! 2
I really don't like this coffee.  It has a strange taste to it.  I'm used to adding creamer to my coffee and it just doesn't work.  Even without creamer the taste is BAD. It smells like vanilla when you brew it, but the flavor is medicinal.  I don't recommend it all. 2
Seriously, the emperor isn't wearing anything. Don't believe the hype. My diabetic friend discovered these noodles online and shared the link with me. We both ordered some. I opened a pkg and nearly gagged. Wasn`t sure if it was a bacterial issue or there was an undisclosed cod fish ingredient. Rinsed repeatedly, soaked and rinsed and finally threw out. Tried to give the remaining five packages to my friend and she graciously refused them. 1
I found these in a local market a while ago, and fell in love with them, but hadn't been able to find them anywhere in person for a while.  Saw that they were available on Amazon, and ordered a 12-pack.  What arrived is completely different from the product I bought in the store.  The ones I bought at the store were firm but chewy, even-textured, with a nice fruity flavor.  The ones that arrived are crusty on the outside, soft on the inside; the crustiness really makes it hard for me to enjoy the flavor.  I feel bad for wasting food, but I don't think I can stomach these. 2
I used to LOVE the ZICO Coconut Water.<br />I used to buy 2 boxes monthly.<br />Until they decided to change from the Tetra-Pack to the Platic Bottles.<br /><br />For some reason, ZICO thinks its a better product, unfortunatly, the plastic leaches to the Coconut Water and changes the taste. It literally taste like plastic.<br /><br />I stopped buying ZICO and went over to O.N.E., not as tasty as the Tetra-Pack ZICO, but atleast doesnt taste like plastic!!!<br /><br />KEEP AWAY FROM ZICO, until they change it back to Tetra-Pack!<br /><br />Aparently i found out after some dabling online. Its not 100% coconut water, they changed the process where they make the coconut water out of CONCENTRATE.....honestly...concentrate??? No i am pissed off..... 1
The salsa tastes good as noted in other reviews but after phrases such as "barn burner", "call 911 screaming hot" and "remember the Alamo" I expected something really really hot. Ends up I can eat it with a soup spoon. Compared to Jose Madrid crazy hot salsa this is cat nip. 2
I bought because the price is very reasonable and low calorie.  However the flavor is not my taste.  It is very creamy but doesn't taste like tuna.  I end it up gave them to my friends. 3
This orzo is absolutely delicious, with a firm bite and an astounding 9 g of fiber in every serving (and when it comes to pasta, that's what you should be looking for on the package). This is the healthiest and most delicious choice I've found in whole grain pastas, bar none. The orzo shape is great for cold salads and hot dishes alike -- I really like making a hot caprese-style pasta dish with this stuff. I don't buy anything else ... and you can't beat Amazon's price for the 4-pack, particularly if you select the automatic shipment option (I get a new pack every 3 months). 5
The label on the little bag says 1 serving is 120 calories. But one serving is 1 ounce. The little single serving sized bag is 1.5 ounces! So there are 180 calories in the bag. This is sneaky. No one is going to open their bag and measure out one ounce, then save the other half ounce...<br /><br />EDITED TO ADD:<br />I ordered these again because the price went down momentarily (is now back up) and the product is now changed. Although Amazon still had it listed at 12, 1.5 ounce bags, what I got is 12, 1.2 oz bags. So now yes, one bag is a serving but the nutrition facts do not add up to what was listed before. Now a bag has 120 calories and 15g carbs. Another sneaky move, you get less for the same price. 1
Weird black stuff inside the ravioli.<br /><br />Otherwise, really tasty. My favorite, but the black stuff freaked me out. Not sure if it was bugs or what. I started slicing the raviolis open. I found a lot of them have black stuff.<br /><br />I did an internet search to see if there was maybe an explanation. I found none. The ingredients are plain. I must have gotten contaminated cans or something.<br /><br />Unbelievable how people think that reporting bugs in the food, or some kind of decontamination, isn't helpful. Some people are really lame. Well, enjoy eating your bugs, idiots. 3
Watch out -- this comes up on Amazon when you click through to the gluten-free section, but it contains wheat. 1
The ingredients are wholesome, and are without by-products, but my four cats do not really like this catfood.  It is a shame because the price is reasonable, and I like the quality, but my cats and I don't argue over 'taste.' 3
I bought the 3# jar of this popcorn and rated it a 5.  Best popcorn I ever tasted.  But the 1# package (cellophane) was stale.  I can't help but think it is the packaging.  I would not buy the 1# size again. 2
I've only openned one can so far and I haven't actually bought a can of sardines for decades, but saw these on a deal site and had a hankerin'. I used to buy sardines in tomato sauce as a treat when I was young/kid.  Yes, strange kid.  Love sushi now too!<br /><br />Well I openned the can and was greatly surprised to what appeared to be a can of only sauce until I noticed sardine shaped bump.  I litterally had to blindly dig around in the can to find the 4-5 3"x1"x.5" sardines in the tomato sauce.  This was nothing like I remembered where the can was packed with sardines and a coating of tomato sauce.<br /><br />I'm not sure I bought this brand decades ago, the can was shaped the same, but either way, the can contained way to much sauce.  Upon fishing the sardine out, the sauce left in the can was still up 40-50% the way up the side of the can, which is rediculous.  It's not like I'm going to put this over spaghetti!<br /><br />The sardines and sauce tasted decent. 3
When I was told by my nutritionist that eating a handful of whole, natural almonds a day would help me to lose weight and get the right kind of fats and proteins implemented into my diet, I was a bit skeptical.  I was not a huge almond fan to begin with.  I don't particularly enjoy salted or roasted almonds.  Usually only the kind that come surrounded with coconut and chocolate or the kind that you get out of the nut bowl to shell around the holidays.  The Whole Natural almonds by Blue Diamond taste like they came right out of the shell and boy are they yummy.<br /><br />I like that they are a satisfying snack and I like the taste of them.  These are the ones I buy ... no added salt or anything.  Nice and fresh right out of the shell.<br /><br />5 stars. 5
As the other 1 star review said, this was received as ONLY ONE 58.8 ounce size box, despite the product features section stating specifically that the product is "Pack of two, 58.8-ounce(total of 117.6-ounce)."  However, after complaining to Amazon customer service they did refund me half the purchase price. In any case, only 1 star because it was not as advertised.<br /><br />For a better deal, I recommend Frosted Mini-Wheats Bite-Size Cereal, 18-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4).  It is a better price per ounce than this even if I had received both bags as advertised. 1
It's very easy to prepare.  Just pour the powder into a cup and add hot water.  The ginger taste is very strong and spicy.  There is minimal lemon flavor.  For my own taste, I had to add more water to dilute the brew to make it less strong. 3
I usually have only great things to say about most Nylabone chews, however, the shape/style of this one I do not like.  It also seems to splinter more quickly than the other products.  One bone will typically last my pooch 2-4 weeks, this one I had to throw out after just one week.  I will not purchase this product again. 2
I thought this was the beef jerky that I was used to getting from the gas station on my trips. However, after eating one stick(really two sticks in one).  I ended up drinking two bottles of water.<br />The Salt content!<br />you can taste the salt before the beef jerky 3
The illy issimo Coffee Drink, Caff&egrave;, 6.8-oz is a little too bitter for my taste and frankly, not what I expected of a chilled coffee. Even with 10mg of sugar in it, the bitter after taste still lingers. To taper it down, I actually added a bit more cream and sugar to it and that made it more bearable. This being a canned variety, it is obviously geared for on-the-go people and for those who just plainly love espresso. It is also on the pricey side and this is not something I would be drinking on a daily basis. 2
I use this in combination with Baby's Only formula for my daughter. Unfortunately, due to illness, my milk production took a plunge when she was 5 months old. Although, it breaks my heart that I can only nurse a little, I feel better using goat's milk (easy for baby belly's to digest). I add Baby's Only so she gets the vital nutrients she needs. If you are looking to supplement your child, consider using raw local goat's milk (if you are lucky enough to have it around). This stuff is great. 5
Love the taste of Annie's organic Mac & Cheese. Plus it's a great source of fiber and is certified organic, making it a better alternative to Kraft and conventional brands. Serve it up with some steamed broccoli or a toss salad and you've got a nutrish and delish meal in a jiffy. 4
My family drinks a lot of coffee and they also love french vanilla creamer.  We were paying about $3 a bottle, and had to buy them every couple of days.  We tried the concentrated pump and it is a lot cheaper in the end.  We buy a pack of two every couple of weeks.  I don't drink coffee, but I have actually used it in baking, and it works great. The pump does leave some in the bottom, but my son just cuts it off, and uses what's left. I only wish that they had Amaretto flavor. 4
I've been using Pill Pockets for the last year or so. My dog has never spat one back out, and I find them much easier to use than e.g., peanut butter or bread.<br />In the past, I've used the tablet size pill pockets, but decided to try the capsule version. For roughly the same price, the capsule version is far more economical. The pill pockets are huge! You can easily split them in half to make the bag last longer. I will never go back to the tablet version again. 5
This is not made from organic grains. The name is misleading, so beware. I would not have purchased it had I realized that a label like "ORGRAN" was not to imply organic grain... 2
I have now tried them all and choose vita coconut water. This stuff and all the others taste terrible ! Vita is way more expensive but so much better and well worth it! 1
Folks, move along--don't buy this from these people.  They are completely incompetent.  The links showed up rancid, so I refused the order (but they also took TWO+ WEEKS TO SHIP THIS NIGHTMARE, and made my whole experience the worst I have had w/Amazon in 8 years).<br /><br />As an example, here's how they dealt w/my order 2 weeks ago:<br /><br />1 Waited a WEEK, then called me 6 TIMES, harassing me in the middle of a work meeting.<br />2 No one should EVER ship food 2nd day on Wednesdays--most food companies realize this.  If the shipper does make a mistake, the food is sitting in a warehouse somewhere, rotting.  These people actually WAIT A WEEK AND A HALF, then ship on Wednesdays!  Then they try to blame the shippers for their own inccompetence!<br />3. The owner of this company then, after all the fiasco discussed above, send a nasty email, complaining about my rudeness (yeah, why don't we call him 6 times in a row, during some inconvenient time).  He also blamed the shipping being late on FedEx (um, if you shipped on Tuesday or Monday, this doesn't happen)<br />4. Finally, he tried to claim they had upgraded me for shipping on 2nd day air, when the shipping was FREE for orders over 80 dollats.<br /><br />All in all, this is a really bad company.  If you want headaches, then please feel free and order from these people.<br /><br />My advice?  Order from D'Artagnans--I've dealt with them many times and they are considerate, acknowledge mistakes and at least attemt to rectify mistakes, instead of denying any fault at all.<br /><br />One last thing to sum this up--I ordered A WEEK LATER from Thai Food here on Amazon.  The order showed up 5 DAYS BEFORE THIS DID.  But they're not incompetent--not if you talk to them! 1
The coffee has a great flavor for decaf. I am disapointed in my most recent shipments. One in four of the k-cups explodes in the machine when prepared. The top comes undone and grounds and hot water go every where. We brew other offer coffee in our machine without any issues. I called the company and they are aware of the complaint and have had others. I really wish this didn't happen because the coffee is so good. This is the second time purchasing this product where this happened. It is so difficult to find a really good decaf so I am really disapointed. I do have to say that Amazon's customer service in resolving this issue was excellent. They imediately got back to me, offered a refund and are looking into this issue. Hopefully this issue will be taken care of for future purchases. 3
These bars are just the right balance between the flavor of the coconut & the sweetness of the rice syrup. Unfortunately, although the expiration date is in 2013, about a third of mine went bad, or perhaps started life that way. They had a funny, metallic taste, & one even had some black substance on it, which may or may not have been mold. I'm wondering if refrigerating would have prevented this. I highly recommend these bars, but beware of the keeping quality! 3
This is a great concept, we all need more natural things in our diet. The Black Cherry flavor of this product was trying to catch up to the other juices that are in it, which basically came down to it was a bit tart, like a cherry, and not totally sweet like apple or grape juice, of which this contains more of than the cherry juice.<br /><br />It was lightly carbonated, not overly so. Hard to tell if this is by design, or being shipped through the postal service, with all the shakes, rattles and rolls that consists of.<br /><br />The small size leaves a bit to be desired, as it kinda leaves you wanting more. It has a pleasant flavor, so I would drink it again, although I actually prefer naturally carbonated water with a hint of some natural flavor, such as lemon, cherry, orange, etc. 3
THE QUICK TAKE:  Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate is a great chocolate option.  At 54% cocoa solids, it's just over the edge of dark chocolate.  So it makes a nice change for those wanting dark chocolate that isn't so dark.  And, it's sustainably and responsibly produced - making it as guilt-free as chocolate gets.  The price at Amazon varies and can be high, so you'll need to look at the current price and your other options to decide what works for you.<br /><br />TASTE AND TEXTURE:  To have a little fun, we did a taste comparison to some other chocolate we had in the house.  The Newman's Own Dark Chocolate compared well to other premium and organic chocolate we had. It's decidedly darker, less sweet and firmer than a milk chocolate, with a very nice texture both to chew and on the tongue.  And it has some really nice subtleties to the flavor.  But it's not nearly as strong as what aficionados would consider a "dark" chocolate.  So it's a good option that might just hit the (bitter)sweet spot you are looking for in chocolate.<br /><br />PRICE:  These bars are relatively expensive.  That's to be expected for a premium chocolate that's organically produced.  We're lucky enough to have a lot of options for locally for organic chocolate.  Newman's Own is an excellent product, but you will want to compare it to the other options available to you.<br /><br />PRODUCTION: There are two important aspects that make this chocolate as guilt-free as chocolate gets:<br /><br />First, organic production.  Newman's Own has one of the largest organic chocolate sourcing operations in the world, which is highly commendable.  So you and your family get great tasting chocolate without consuming other things you don't want to eat; and, you also get the knowledge that the producers are working to minimize the impact of your consumption on the places where the chocolate is grown.<br /><br />Second, responsible sourcing.  Far too few people know that most of the world's cocoa production is tainted by child labor and often forced labor - or, in plain terms, slavery.  If that's news to you, Google chocolate slavery for some eye-opening information.  Or have a look at some of the Amazon listings, such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GAN1VQ">Bitter Chocolate: The Dark Side of the World's Most Seductive Sweet</a>.<br /><br />All of that is a lot to fit into a chocolate bar - but Newman's Own has done that, and more, and offers you a lot of excellent options in chocolate.  If this one doesn't suit you, there are several more on Amazon. 4
I was in love from the moment I opened a bag and took the first whiff.  However, it did take me a while to figure out the right brewing method, because I found it was much easier to "scald."  Might be just me though.  First I boil the water, but whereas usually I just let it sit there for about a minute to cool, here I actually poured it into a pot and let it sit for about 2 or 3 minutes.  Then I grind the beans medium-coarse (it smells heavenly) and 2 tablespoons into the french press it goes.  Pour the water in, and I let it sit for a bit longer than usual, too (still hot though).  I find that it has a very nice... sort of crunchy, hard caramelized sugar finish to it, kind of tastes like the top of a cr&egrave;me brulee.  Delicious.  I drink it black. 5
$10 for a single serving is high compared to the price offered from Nutrisystem themselves. Also, despite being listed as from Nutrisystem, our package came from a separate source. 1
Shipping was horrible. They claimed they couldn't keep it cool for delivery to  NY in the summer (How come Godiva can?)<br /><br />Chocolates good, but........  (others can be better-maybe these were just handled & shipped so poorly that they were no longer good).<br /><br />Gave as gift, I think I can probably do better. 3
They taste nice, but they made my stomach hurt and gave me a bit of flatulence issues (because of the chicory root fiber). It also made me bloated. 3
Celestial Seasonings is one of my favorites, if not my favorite, brands of tea.  Fruit herbal teas are my favorite type.  I love this sampler box of herbal teas.  The five types of tea, in order of my favorite flavors, are: Country Peach Passion, Black Cherry Berry, True Blueberry, Raspberry Zinger, and Wild Berry Zinger.<br /><br />I love tea, especially when eating certain foods, but also I love it all by itself.  I love tea with most all kinds of foods, especially cornbread or country foods.  It also goes good with most all other ethnic foods.<br /><br />I usually drink my tea plain (no sugar).  Very, very seldom do I add sugar.  And when I do, it is a very small amount.  Where I grew up, sugar in tea is an option.  However, I was stationed in the Deep South, and they drink thick sugar water with a drop of tea in it.  When my daughter was in elementary school, her teacher had the audacity to bring me a glass of that thick sugar water; I gagged.  I couldn't get past the first sip.  She might have gotten her feelings hurt.  They think you are crazy if you prefer tea with no sugar.<br /><br />Highly recommended if you like fruit herbal teas. 5
I was recently given a sample of these. I was impressed with the fact that it has 5 grams of protein and 6 grams of fiber! I think 140 calories is a lot though... but overall it was good. It tastes way better warmed up. I can see myself buying more of these in the future! 4
I love this tea, it is great for people who suffer from IBS.  It helps relieve bloating and gas from foods.  Great tasting too! 5
I received this product last week and my husband and I have been slowly trying the drinks. Thus far, the horrible outweigh the okay. The Grape was okay...the Dr. Zevia was okay...and that's been about the only okay products. The Mt.Zevia was like a flat Mt. Dew, the Cola was nothing like cola, the Ginger root beer was like a carbonated chai drink. They have been such a let down. I am very bummed that this was not a good product as I grew up on diet drinks and am quite attached to them. Not these. Never again, nor would I recommend them. 1
This had a nice, tart cherry flavor, but it was too sweet for me. Otherwise, I thought this was refreshing and I liked the fizzy-ness.<br /><br />It had a slight aftertaste (metallic?) when I drank it out of the can. I thought that it tasted much better in a glass.<br /><br />It's nice to see a healthier alternative to soda, and I'll definitely try the other flavors.<br /><br />Ironically, I think this would be tasty as a mixer in an alcoholic beverage, which pretty much defeats the purpose of drinking something healthy. 3
We were told by a relative this was the best coffee they had had.We love our morning coffee and we use a Jura compressa machine to make it. We were not pleased with the taste of this coffee even compared to local store brands. Still better than instant coffee. 2
I bought the variety box of Popchips and some flavors are really great and others are not. I loved the sour cream and onion, original, and salt and vinegar. Was not a fan of the bbq (kind of bitter), salt and pepper (too peppery), and the cheddar (not a fan of cheddar flavored stuff). I would definitely buy the sour cream and onion and original flavored ones again! So crispy and crunchy and great chip-like flavor. They remind me of regular pringles but with more crunch and flavor! 4
I am surprised just how yummy these chips are and my kids ADORE them. They have no artificial anything which is important as my kids are on the Feingold diet which eliminates all artificial coloring, preservatives, and flavors. The only thing that kept me from a higher star rating is the choice of oil they used to coat the chips. I have NO PROBLEM with oil as I believe fat is GOOD for us and the great thing is they coat the chips with oil AFTER they heat them so they don't create free radicals. That said, the ingredient list says, "sunflower, safflower, and/or canola oil." Hmmmm... that's not very definitive!<br /><br />Sunflower and safflower oil are good but canola is a FRANKENFOOD that I don't want my kids to eat. Sigh... a yummy possibility spoiled by canola oil. 3
forget cheetos! these are the best ever!  same price (or less if on sale) and better for you.  I could eat a bag by myself but the kids beat me to it! 5
I have high triglycerids and have researched a lot about low-carb pastas, this one is the best in low carb content, flavor and texture. WIll keep on buying. 4
My Doberman/pointer mix has a lot of extra energy and really enjoys to chew. I purchased this product on a whim at the animal shelter that we got her from. I really had no idea how the toy was supposed to work, so she really did not use it for the first few weeks.<br /><br />Initially I put just a few Zuke's Mini Naturals treats in the container. She was able to get the treats out eventually, but lost interest quickly.  This toy is dishwasher safe! I put some peanut butter and a few broken up Milkbones in the toy to make it smell appealing and rattle when she shakes it. This made all the difference.  She now will sit calmly trying get to the peanut butter, and accidentally making the Zuke's treats fall out.<br /><br />Other reviews stated that their dog was able to break the plastic, but my dog has been playing with this for a month now, and she hasn't even been able to rip the rubber ball by the rope. As with any toy, you should try to supervise your pet. I would recommend this toy to any owner whose dog gets bored and will get destructive. 4
I don't much care for this Stash Premium Loose Green Tea.  I'm no tea expert, but I've got several problems with it.  Flavor-wise, I find this tea to be bitter with a grassy taste (that's not a good flavor, to me).  Texture-wise, the tea "leaves" range from almost half-inch long thin shards of leaves down to 1/16th of an inch sized remnants (I've uploaded a picture so you can see for yourself).  The mishmash of textures makes it difficult to portion out the leaves and results in a lot of the small stuff making its way through the infuser of my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010NR7C0">Bodum YoYo Personal Tea Set with Infuser and 12-Ounce Glass</a> (admittedly, a finer meshed infuser might not have as much of an issue here).  Also, the wide range of textures indicates (to me) that these tea leaves might not necessarily have been chosen for inclusion.  Instead, it feels like they might just have been leftovers from other processes (that's merely my non-knowledgeable feelings and not based on any hard facts).  On a positive note, I will say that the steeped beverage does have a very nice yellowish green color.  Overall, though, I have to rate this tea at a not-very-good 2 stars out of 5.  A green tea that I do like is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4H5FE">Twinings Green Gunpowder Tea, Loose Tea, 3.53-Ounce Tins (Pack of 6)</a>. 2
I LOVED this soup when I first tried it years ago. I've been looking for it recently and found it here. I bought a few cans but was very disappointed to learn they changed the recipe. The flavor is still there (well, mostly) but the wonton fillings are no longer bulbous, filled sections, they are now paper-thin fillings(no exaggeration, it's just a thin line) - the wontons aren't round any more, they're flat! The wonton filling was the best (and main) part of the soup but it's practically gone now.<br /><br />I'm hoping they go back to their old recipe and not be so stingy on the filling. The wontons aren't abundant and they're tiny, so how much could it really cost to fill them and satisfy their customers? 3
We like these Sugar Free Licorice candies. They are small and strong with good licroice flavor. Small box fits in your pocket or purse easily. 4
The colors are darker than on the picture, but it wasn't a big deal to me... They arrived in time for my event so I was happy. 5
My puppy does NOT like these! And well, mom doesn't like them either! The smell of garlic is so overpowering, I tossed them a week ago and I can still smell them! I think if your dog likes strong flavors these are for you, but they give my little guy diarrhea!! I would recommend the same brand in the Peanut Butter and Honey flavor, much gentler on tummies and my puppy can't get enough of them. 2
Effective as far as catnip goes, and I wanted organic because my cat tends to eat it and not just roll around in it.  But, I found it especially twiggy, with woody stems.  I would try a different brand next time.  I went with this one primarily because I found the tin to be attractive, but I can use a jar or something I already have next time. 3
I'm glad I only received one serving of this for review.  There is nothing about this drink that I liked.<br /><br />First, the package I received did not have any calorie information so I don't know how many calories are per drink.  The product information on Amazon currently doesn't show the calorie count either.<br /><br />Second, the directions tell you to use 250 ml of hot water to dissolve the powder which translates into a hairline more than an 8 ounce cup as around 237 ml is equivalent to one US cup.  For US buyers who are not familar with the metric system or don't have access to a conversion chart, those measurements might confuse the user.<br /><br />Third, the color and consistency of the drink is like apple cider and one sip was all I needed.  The liquid has a heavy ginger flavor that masks any lemon flavoring according to my tastebuds. I felt my throat was burning from this drink and it wasn't from the hot water but from the strong ginger ingredient.<br /><br />I threw the rest of the drink out as this is not for me. 1
My cat usually can't get enough of his daily wet food, but he won't eat this stuff.  He completely licks all the sauce off and leaves the entire bulk of the food.  Every, damn, time.  He's not picky with any other wet canned food, only this. 3
This reminded me how much I enjoy Indian pickle.  It was basically good pickle.<br />Problems:<br />* it seemed a bit stale<br />* it was fairly pricey<br />But it did remind me that I really like Indian pickle, and told me that I could get it on the internet, so I poked around a bit and found a place (ishopindia.com) in another suburb of Chicago which was closer (Skokie; I live in Oak Park) so instead of it coming from Texas, it came from Skokie (less than an hour's drive away).  That solved the staleness problem.  Their prices seemed to be about 2/3 of Amazon's prices.  I thank Amazon for reminding me that I should look. 4
The delivery of this item was timely, but the product expiration date was very near.  Treats were really hard.  Would have been nice to know when the expiration date was.  Anticipated a "softer" treat since they were "FRUIT"ables.  Aren't most fruits soft? 2
Diamond Almonds<br />Almonds are a good source of magnesium. One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not. This is called taking magnesium to bowel tolerance (just like using vitamin C to bowel tolerance.<br /><br />Almonds are a good source of Fiber.<br />One ounce contains approximately 12% of the RDA for an adult.<br />So, in summary, Almonds are a very healthy snack, so what's left to say?<br /><br />Two things:<br />1st be cautious about "bowel tolerance" or "happy bowels" if you prefer.<br />2nd Taste.  I realize that taste is a personal thing.

I actually liked the companion shampoo but didn't get the same benefit from the conditioner and would be unlikely to purchase in the future. The companion shampoo left my hair feeling light with body. The conditioner didn't. My waist length hair felt heavy, limp and difficult to style/manage after using. All in all, a bit on the heavy side. 3
When my local grocery store stopped carrying my favorite avacado oil I started a search for a new favorite. I typically use it to make homemade mayo so I prefer a mild creamy flavor. This is far from mild or creamy. It gave my mayo a pungent almost bitter taste the was more like olive oil than avocado oil. In the past, quality oils have turned my mayo slightly greeninsh, this stuff turned it an odd bright yellow which does make me doubt the quality of the product. 3
This was an excellent offer. The product is quite good. The packaging included a clear plastic bag with the individual packets all placed within a cardboard box. 4
This is the only Earth's Best food that my granddaughter refuses to eat, she loves other products.  Not sure why, it may just be the texture as it is rather thick. 1
I received these on a very hot day 97 degrees. They felt very squishy so I let them sit a day before trying.<br />Oh my goodness, they are so moist and just the right mix of coconut and chocolate, almonds. The bar is big enough to be a good small meal if you eat 6 meals a day 3 snack size and 3 small regular. They are soft and a bit chewy.<br /><br />I know I can trust Pamela's products to be gluten free and of the highest quality. I highly recommend these, they taste like a home made cookie that Grandma made. Super yummy. 5
I bought this candy bar after trying a candy bar at an old irish shop that i was told i probably couldn't get here in the states; thanks to the magic of the internet i knew i had a shot. This is not the candy we tried, but is very similar, chocolate covered chocolate nougart with pieces of biscuit inside & layered with caramel - it's delicious. If you like chocolate this would probably be a very good choice. 4
Was looking for a strong K-Cup that could hold up for the perfect Espresso and for a great cup of coffee! Now receiving on auto ship, if you're looking for a great bold K-Cup, this is it. 5
This is the first catfood I've had in a can that didn't smell strong of aromas when I opened it, and perhaps that is why the cat wouldn't eat it.  Catfood is notorious for having artificial aromas added to attract finicky cats.  This stuff is all organic and even when hungry, the cat just walked away from it.<br /><br />So the case I bought for the cat literally went to the dogs, who all gave this stuff two paws up.  The dogs saw the small cans as special treats and would woolf it down fast. 3
This brew is just Ok I will not buy again. I love the packaging, less waste and cups brew just like original keurig. The taste however was not to my liking. It was just like the organic blend with the yellow lid except with a little less bitterness and just a little less burned taste. The aroma and basic taste however were the same. I read on here in another review that they may stop making that brew so if you liked it this will be a very good alternative for you. But for me this is not pleasant. I may try another flavor because I do like the packaging. That is the reason for the three stars not the coffee.. 3
I hope this stuff is really great when added to Italian meals. I ordered two bottles because I expected the best from Emeril, live and learn. I opened one bottle and removed the seal to smell the "essence". Wow, to my surprise not only was the bottle less than half full, but the contents are powder, no body to the ingredients what so ever!! This stuff is not cheap and from now on I will buy items like this in my local stores, that way I can take it back if it is like this stuff. BAM, my butt. This will also make me very wary of any other Emeril stuff. 1
These cookies are cloyingly sweet, i had to throw out the middle as it tasted like sugar! The cookies themselves are hard without much flavor. I wouldn't buy them again. I'm wondering what to do with those that are left. 2
I was given sweetleaf choc but its a totally different taste than the usual one I buy from you and it says "sweetdrops" which I didn't ask for.  I don't care for it at all. The packaging is different too which probably means the ingredients are different.  Will not be ordering it again unless this is replaced with my usual. Sorry. 1
I got  my mother in love this tulips and when she opened the door of her patio they were dead with the heath, the company that delivered them just left them in the door in Palm Desert and the temperature was 105. 1
This tea is very good and I like the fact that it doesn't need sugar or<br />cream.  It isn't as great as some of the local restaurants' versions but<br />a good at-home solution. 4
The 1st time I ordered Hibiscus Tea it was great.  The 2nd time I have to use double the tea to get the same strength.  Where's the quality control? 1
I've had the other Annie's shells and cheddar and they're usually very good. I wanted to try whole wheat to be healthier, but it's really not worth it. It has a different texture that I didn't like. The flavor was okay but a little bland. If you want a good mac and cheese, stick with the original version from Annie's! 2
All four ounces of this tuna is stored in a single pouch. Once you open it, the entire four ounces are exposed. My two cats will only eat about one-sixth of this between them. I would rather have smaller, individually wrapped portions so I don't need to refrigerate the most of it to save it for later.<br /><br />The heavy plastic, recloseable bag is hard to open and hard to seal. I used another ziploc instead.<br /><br />I don't see the point in the product though. I'd rather buy a can of tuna for much less and feed my cats that when they need a treat while I eat the rest. I suppose I could eat the rest of these treats, but it's not that appealing.<br /><br />My cats liked it just fine though, but they like the regular tuna just as much. 2
I like their variety package, but also heard that there is BPA in the lid. I will switch to other BPA free products. 3
Just received this butter yesterday and we are already using it to make sandwiches with jelly. Tastes great without having any salt or sugar added. Highly recommend! 5
Luzianne Cajun Seasoning is a great way to spice up anything you make. It adds a nice amount of heat to your food without being over-bearing. My whole family loves it! 5
I'm so addicted to these!!! You know the movie When Harry Met Sally? When I drink one of these it just feels like that famous scene in the movie... orgasmic! 5
I heard about these through Hungry-girl.com and am so glad I tried them.  I kept hearing how I should replace pasta with spaghetti squash and found the texture and taste to be unsatisfying.  Although these need to be rinsed well and patted thoroughly dry, I think these are the closest thing to real pasta at about 10% of the calories.  I have tried the fettuccine and the macaroni, both which I like, but the angel hair shape is the best.  Works great with the Hungry-girl recipe on the back too.  YUM!  I highly recommend.  The seller also sent these to me so quickly and at no additional shipping price for my multiple orders. 5
I have a shep/akita mix, but I bought this more for my coonhound, who will eat ANYTHING.  Anything!  Especially if it's made out of food.  :)  I put the treats in the ball thing and she licked it a couple times and lost interest.  The problem with this toy is that it's hard for the dogs to get a grip on the thing.  The shape is putting them off.  She later tried to knaw on it with the side of her jaw, but got so little out of it (a taste but nothing to chew on or savor or act like a reward) that she lost interest - which is saying a lot, since again she will go to great lengths for the smallest crumb.<br /><br />Finally, I took the treats out of the ball and offered them to the dogs - instand results.  They are working away at them right now.  I think the lesson here is that this toy will only work well for dogs that enjoy chewing on hard objects that don't break into pieces easily if they do at all.  Some dogs love this!  Not mine, apparently.<br /><br />So if anyone wants to try it with their dogs, email me.  I have one, never been chewed!  Maybe your dog will like it more than mine.  Five bucks!  ;) 2
A few years ago we received a gift of salt someone brought us from Hawaii.  A beautiful salt that was a pink/beige color, a great texture and size, and lovely taste that enhanced all food.  It came in a baggie...sigh.  I've been looking to replace it ever since so I thought I'd try this salt.  My honest reaction about this salt - I don't get it.  I like the course texture of the salt.  It's a bit more chunky then we like though you do feel it when you eat.  The taste?  Here it is, I don't get it.  There is a critical mass point putting this salt on your food - and what we feel is that it's nothing or simply too much.  I know, I'm giving a lot of words here.  It's just that there are all these great reviews of how amazing it is.  The salt is kind of tasteless on the finger.  On food it seems to need a lot and then ICK!!!!  So my recommendation is a 3 because maybe we simply haven't found the exact amount to use to create the taste everyone is raving about.  I keep trying and it's either no taste at all or so over powering the food is awful.  For the price I'm tossing it in the garbage because it's too much a pain at meal time when I'm trying to figure it out.  I can't say it's awful because maybe it's us.  We are salt lovers and we buy and understand salt.  This salt?  I don't get it.  And that is actually saying something.  So I guess I'll take a stand and say - we don't like it.  I've tried it on simple and complex food and recipes.  Too risky when time is so busy these days to have to find a balance of the amount you use.  Going back to Morton's course kosher salt or our sea salt bought locally in Maine until I find that salt that matches the gift from Hawaii... 3
Nice, light cup of coffee. Definitely not a bold brew but it's smooth and gentle on the stomach.....good for those mornings when you over did it the night before. Would buy again. 4
One of Green Mountains best blends of coffee in my opinion,love it for your everyday blend, perfect stregnth, excellent blend! 5
Makes pretty good cocoa and a lot easier than on the stovetop.  Not as sweet as I would prefer and needs to be stirred to keep it in suspension.  I guess I can add marshmallows:-) 3
Is this cake mix REALLY $32.28?or $3.28?I dont think any cake mix is so great that people would want to buy it for $32 + shipping.WOW. 2
I really wasn't too sure this product would work.  It has surpassed all my expectations.  I will never buy the ready made K cups again.  This is truly a genius product! 5
The Wolfgang Puck Coffee, Chef's Reseerve Columbian Decaf is fantastic and very delicious.  I definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants a great cup of coffee. 5
Usually I buy spicy Shake N' Bake seasonings, so I was prepared to be a little disappointed when I tried my sample of the Original Pork breading. It turned out to be pretty tasty - the crispy breading added a subtle flavor to the pork and didn't overpower it. Add some rice or pasta and a side of vegetables and you've got yourself a healthy, home-cooked meal with little hassle. I'll make a note to buy more of the original flavor in the future. 4
We needed special food for our Cocker, he has kidney stones. This is a much better buy the the script food the Vet wanted him to have & it has better ingredients. 4
I learned about these from a co-worker after he made a bulk purhcase of several kinds of beef sticks a year ago.  He spread them around and so I got to sample a variety: I've ordered the Honey Stung four times since then. Two other co-workers have also ordered them on several occassions this past year and they're "believers" too.  Additionally, we've all ordered several of the Buffalo Bills brands and they're all superb!  As long as you don't eat the whole bag, I'd also call these "Atkins friendly" as well, as that is also a motivator for me ordering these so many times (other than them being just being great, well-seasoned snacks).  Buy 'em, you'll love 'em! 5
Ok,lets start of by saying that my microwave is not very good for popcorn,but in my local grocery store I can buy Market Pantry popcorn for $ 4.25 for 18 large bags and not all the pop corn kernels pop but very yummy,and I went through 2 boxes in less than a month,but then we have this one Pop Secret and my first 3 bags BURNT  and was not happy so I decided not to follow the instructions,so I decided to put microwave at 3 minutes and let it stop when it got to 20 sec's,ok so it didn't burnt it,but due to me not placing it microwave on high,it took a very long time to cook it,and so anyway's it began to pop,and so I thought great,at least no burnt popcorn,and I was so excited and HUNGRY to try it,due to the ratings on this site,I began to eat it,and my first reaction was,oh my good ness,DRY DRY ,where is the butter ?..its called butter pop corn so where is the BUTTER ? did it get all dryed up in microwave ? 2
I liked Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger & Lemon Beverage.  I didn't add anything to it, because the flavor was nice as it was, without sugar or honey.<br /><br />Be aware that this is the flavor of fresh ginger, kind of hot and spicy, and not sweet like gingerbread.  Just saying, because if you're not used to the heat, it might take some getting used to.  I drink fresh ginger tea when I have a cold or fever, and I know it has many other medicinal benefits.  There is a light taste of lemon.<br /><br />I will drink this again, and recommend it if you like fresh ginger teas. 4
I haven't tried it, nor will I.  There are so many corn and soy byproducts in the ingredients list that it's an automatic no for me.  90% of the soy and corn crops are genetically modified (RoundUp Ready--gee they come with their very own pesticide grown in!) and unless it says organic or non-GMO, it's guaranteed to be GM.  I won't eat GM products, and I don't feed them to my livestock or my pets. 1
While I never liked coffee, this was a hit with the coffee drinkers in my household.  It is well packaged and for those who want to take their cans when they travel, this packs well and maintains the freshness of the contents.  The coffee hounds laud this for its energy boosting properties.<br /><br />This brand has only 100 calories and very little fat, which is far better than you will find if you purchase gourmet coffee.  You can also buy this in a 8.45 oz can. 4
it took me a while to write my review because i had to eat the whole box of cereal.<br />it has a delicious taste, stays crunchy in milk but the only drawback is that it is a little too sweet for a cereal. it tastes more like a granola bar, a sweet granola bar. dont' get me wrong.  i would buy this again but i would mix it with some other non sweet cereal like cheerios or corn flakes.  this cereal alone is a little sweet but if that's what you like then you will LOVE this cereal.<br />it really has a delicious taste. 4
This is the first time I've ever tried kaju katri so I don't know what it's supposed to taste like, but to me it was like eating heavy, greasy air with calories. After 2 bites I dumped the rest of the box in the trash. If you've read any of my other reviews on Indian sweets and tend to have similar likes as me, skip this bland debacle of a dessert. 2
I ordered these because I was once an exchange student in Sweden and one of my favorite gummi candies over there were these sour cherries.  They were two cherries on a stem and sour!  I got there and they were tasty (and being Haribo--Swedish) but not very sour.  I sucked on the candies for awhile and once the sugary coating was off the gummy inside was more sour, but still the wrong candies.  I guess I'll have to wait until I get back to my beloved Sweden.  :-( 3
As someone who suffers from stomach problems exacerbated (if not caused) by drinking far too much coffee, I had high hopes for this product. Unfortunately, during the two days in which Puroast replaced my usual brew, I noticed no significant changes to my physical or mental states nor any respite from my ailments.<br /><br />So it strikes out as a medicine, but how is it as a beverage? The answer is, at best, nothing special.<br /><br />While billed as a "dark French roast", the fine grind of the coffee was more suggestive of espresso, and for best results one should not make espresso in a standard automatic drip coffee pot. The coffee had an acrid aroma and initial taste, which quickly gave way to an empty and hollow flavor, such as one might get when drinking the melted ice from what was once an iced coffee or making instant coffee with cold water. In fairness, my wife liked it more, but she regularly dilutes the coffee that I make... why pay for gourmet when you could just add water? 2
Even though I followed the directions to a "t", my lunch was a bit saucy and mushy because of the extra liquid.  The taste was fair.  It did the job and kept me full for 4 hours. I liked that it didn't require draining. I also like that I can reuse the container. Not a fan of the price per serving. However, in a pinch...it's worth it to have a semi-healthy lunch that I can make in my office.<br /><br />I usually don't eat much sodium and this has way more than I would normally eat. I was impressed at how many grams of protein are in this though. That is what sold it. Next time though, I'll probably opt for a little tuna fish lunch kit instead.<br /><br />I like the idea of being able to buy something semi-healthy at a 24-hour drugstore. This flavor is not for me though. 2
The taffy by itself is tasty, comes well packaged and has a very good price. I do believe that they could have been fresher, they are a bit hard on the outside, but it's a good purchase overall. 3
It took a while to get used to these chips but they are pretty good and more healthy for you. They sure were eaten all up by my family and friends. 4
the little wax bottles had melted together in a big messy blob of wax with the liquid leaking out in all directions. 1
Yea, those who claim these bars are not "real" pemmican are right. The original stuff was a mix of dried beef and rendered fat, sometimes with whatever local berries could be found. Even those who ate it regularly hated it. (Mostly voyagers and the like.)<br />Those who whine that this is not real pemmican are clueless. In 1830 or for that matter 2012, meticulously prepared meat-based pemmican still can go rancid. In fact, it WILL go rancid. It was mostly an emergency fall-back ration.<br />Better by far were the old Wilson meat bars of the early '70s. The US military still uses something similar in some of their MREs. Sadly I can find no source for the bars any more.<br />If you make and seal pemmican meticulously with a vacum pump heat sealer they MAY stay eatable for a week in hot weather. I would not count on it. It is also a very pricey item to make, even from scratch.<br />If you want a meat based product that is close to the original, buy one of hundreds of small shelf stable sausages such as salami, pepperoni, summer sausage, etc. Large groceries handle dozens of varieties. I have even seen low fat varieties such as pepperoni. There are also smaller items like Slim Jims and their fellow travelers for smaller meals or smaller appetites. I have seen them in like 3 ounce servings up to eight or so ounces. Beyond that, they get huge. They are all quite fat heavy as was the original item. 4
Poorly packed without any bubble or other cushion wrap to prevent damage.  Amazon usually does much better than this.  One of the six cans was dented so badly it was leaking, thus had to be discarded.  Similarly denting with one leaking can in last shipment of the Spam with Cheese product.  Initial shipments arrived well-packed and undamaged, but I can't afford to throw away one of every six cans.  Am cancelling subscription to this product. 2
Like the other reviewers wrote, GNATS!!!! I first noticed little clear worms in my soil, and soon I had little black flies buzzing around. I tried everything I could to get rid of them, including drenching the soil with chamomile tea (I know that moist soil helps them, but chamomile is supposed to kill the larvae), but last night I found more larvae in my pot! I sprinkled the surface with cinnamon, which I read helps, but I have little faith. One of my pots a strange green moss-like thing growing across the surface. I've since bought cheapo stuff that has no problem with bugs or moss! I didn't think I had to look up reviews for something like potting soil from a reputable company like Miracle-Gro, but obviously I was wrong. Stay away!!! 1
Been searching for years for a better sauce than Pizza Quick.  Tried many other brands and end up going back there.  Pastorelli is thick and has a nice assertive tomato flavor but the pizza is fairly bitter and astringent.  I'm going to try mixing in a little sugar and wine next time.  The search for the perfect sauce goes on... 3
Better texture and flavor than most. Machine made gnocchi will never approach handmade, sort of like boxed mashed potatoes vs homemade, but these are about as good as possible. Try boiling and then baking with gorgonzola and cream. 4
I was not impressed with the quality of these vegetables, and I won't be buying them again.  The contents did not look or taste appealing.  There were a lot of potatoes, which I did not expect to find in mixed vegetables. 2
I totally agree with all of the other 1 star reviewers here.  This used to be my favorite bar, but now it has almost no flavor and indeed does have a waxy texture. 1
I've only bought one roll of these at the store. The first taste is OK, but there is a really weird aftertaste that I can only describe as tasting "moldy"? Bought the wintergreen version as well and they definitely do NOT have the odd aftertaste. 1
This is going to fall under the category of "You get what you pay for". It's not a terrible tea, but I do find that I have to be extremely careful with water temp and steeping time or this is bitter beyond anything drinkable. A dissapointment was that instead of nice large leaves, this rather looks like chopped hay. Kind of smells like it, too. If you're looking for a really excellent green tea to enjoy, you'd probably want to skip this. If you're just looking for a cheap tea to drink daily, this may be ok. 3
This stuff worked out great for my Disco Ball Birthday Cake.  My customer loved it! Check it out [...]<br />If you are looking for a great way to add that little extra something for your treats, you found it. 5
The hot chocolate was very tasty, but pretty expensive for hot chocolate. You can buy hot chocolate K-cups in most retail stores and some grocery chains and it is the same thing for less money than advertised on here. 4
I have 3 rescue cats who love all 3 flavors of this food. Sometimes they seem to prefer one over the other but between the 3 cats and 3 flavors everything works out. I tried them on the other flavors like turkey and beef but they would usually leave it. I mix a little dry food with these flavors to stretch it out. I also keep plenty of water available because they drink a lot after eating. It must be salty and even though I rated this 4 stars (I like it), the rating is from the cats. I haven't tasted it personally. I was buying this at the grocery store, but since the price in the stores has recently gone up, I'm saving over $12.00/ month on this food using Amazon's subscription service...enough to pay for the 18lb bag of dry food which lasts 2 - 3 months.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010B3FIC">Fancy Feast Gourmet Cat Food, 3-Flavor Seafood Variety Pack, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> 4
I found the flavor to be flat, and almost tasteless. I would recommend the manufacturer add more flavor to their recipe. Crunch appeal was good 1
I am looking for a replacement for Coca Cola and I read the positive reviews here and decided to purchase at my local Whole Foods. There's a gross stevia aftertaste and it tastes nothing like commercial cola; it's not good and it's misnamed. 1
I have never found Altoids to be lacking.  Also bought the new licorice flavor.  It is really nice if you like licorice, and I do.<br /><br />Good price. 5
I bought this because I like chocolate.  But this isn't very strong and I'm afraid I would have liked it with a stronger chocolate flavor.  But as a little something in coffee it does add some taste. 3
Unlike the other reviewer, I am pleased with the texture of this product but the taste of the Original or "Natural" flavor is not pleasant. I can't quite describe the taste. It's almost a medicinal flavor. Just at the start. Once you begin chewing the taste mellows. 1
Yes, dogs love these treats but educate yourself before you buy any dog treats made in china.<br /><br />Per ABC News;<br />Just six months after issuing its latest warning about chicken jerky dog treats made in China, the Food and Drug Administration confirms it has logged more than 900 complaints from pet owners who say their dogs either were sickened or died after eating the treats.<br /><br />The number of complaints has nearly doubled since the story was first reported by ABC News in March. The FDA says its investigation is ongoing and that it continues to test samples of the popular treats, which dog owners across the country say have caused kidney failure in their pets, resulting in severe illness or death.<br /><br />[...] 1
I would hope it would go without saying, but if you don't like plain almonds, you probably won't like them sprinkled with cocoa powder. I like almonds, particularly for their health benefits that are fairly well known. I usually avoid them covered in salt and flavoring powder, but I'm glad I gave these a try.<br /><br /> The packaging suggests Dark Chocolate, and it would be easy to get the wrong idea that these will taste chocolate in the sense of Milk Chocolate perhaps. I just expected them to taste like almonds and cocoa, which they do, so they are semi sweet and like other reviewers have noted, they will appeal most to dark chocolate fans. 4
popcorn is very good.  cant believe the difference between this popcorn and the regular stuff at the story. a very good purchase. 5
There really needs to be information on these sorts of products on the amount contained in the jar. Many people like to know how much per ounce they are buying. 2
This flatbread is just delicious. I love all the various seeds, very crunchy. There is a hint of sweet but in a delicious way. 5
To purchase these, you must buy 6 tubes and pay expensive shipping costs.  I was excited and willing because I love this flavor, but over time, I realized the unopened tubes were leaking on the box and the boxes were sticking to my pantry shelf.  I threw them all away which made it a complete waste.  I would have tried to rescue the paste earlier by putting it in plastic tubs and freezing or SOMETHING.  BTW, the expiration date on the unopened tubes was 16/11/2012. (European labeling)  The tubes appear to be about to explode which leads me to believe there could be possibly be bacterial contaminants?  I don't know, but something made these packages leak on the crimped edges. Obviously, I would not recommend OR buy them again. 1
Great stuff and soooooo good! I purchased this for my wifes new diet but I am drinking it more than she is! It is delicious and smells great! A must buy folks. 4
I bought this online because it was much cheaper than in my local health-food store.  Then I got slapped with a $7 shipping charge!  For a teeny envelope of product!  I'll buy from the store, thanks. 2
I got this for my mom and she loved it. She just got a tea maker and with this 3 pack of 8 discs each, she is going to have a lot of tea. I shouldn't have gotton the awake tea for her because it was only 1 package with 7 discs because it is more expensive. Oh well, the thought that counts! Btw if you read this, please check out my seller profile and items i sell. I will star to sell stuff soon and once i talk with amazon i will let everyone choose super saver shipping. I am a true seller and give the customers what they wan't in perfect condition. Anyways, this tea is great and i reccomend this to everyone who loves tea. 5
All the times I have had Tung Ting tea, from many different sources, the leaves have been a lovely green, yielding an infusion from pale yellow to gold with a deeply floral character, much more complex and mysterious than jasmine tea, although with tung ting it is the smell of the leaves themselves, no flowers. In fact this is the general characteristic of Formosan teas.<br /><br />Typically, the first infusion can be very sweet with the pronounced floral qualities presenting themselves more with each subsequent infusion.<br /><br />Well, sometimes you get what you pay for. This stuff appears to be quite old and of poor quality to start with. The leaves are dry and brown, not fresh looking and greenish. There was not expiration date and the box is not air tight, the bag inside is not sealed.<br /><br />The leaves have no fragrance at all, and the tea was brown with about 2% of the normal floral character or sweetness. Actually it tasted more like the very cheap oolong tea at the tiny tea houses in the outer Sunset district, S.F. where the tea is free with the $1 fried bread.<br /><br />I would spend just a little more from one of the reputable companies on Amazon like Tao of Tea, and get what you pay for. Thank you. 1
I drank this beverage during that part of the afternoon when my energy level desperately needs a boost. Only after consuming a third of this 16 oz. drink I felt more alert, energetic and a tad jittery. The drink is lightly carbonated, and fruity with a raspberry-like aftertaste. It's similar to Red Bull but the flavor is not as sharp and heavy, which kinda belies the intimidating skull, wings and dark d&eacute;cor of the can. `No Fear' contains 130 calories and if you're calorie conscious you don't need to drink the entire can for its effects to be felt.<br /><br />Like most energy drinks, this ought to be consumed if you're looking for a jolt of energy, not necessarily for the flavor. But it's tasty and it certainly wakes you up! 3
Bought this because it's advertized as good as a coffee creamer too.  I found the taste pretty bad for use in coffee.  Avoid! Get the stuff that actually says coffee creamer on the box itself. I'm giving one star because of poor advertising. Maybe this works okay as a substitute for other cream uses. Not sure yet. 1
Good flavor.  Coconut flavor is subtle and not overpowering.  In comparison, there is another coconut coffee by Green Mountain in which the coconut flavor is overdone in my opinion. 5
When it has came down Starbuck Via Ready Brew, I honestly found it to be one of the worst tasting instant coffee brands that are definitely out there. I tried it out in a taste test just recently, and I was definitely appauled. But with Taster's Choice instant, I definitely knew it was one of the best. But when I found out they had on-the-go packs, I was even more impressed. Taster's Choice on-the-go packs are easy to drink, and taste just like you're tasting a freshly made cup of coffee each and every time. I loved the taste, because it was delightful, and carries more at a very inexpensive price. Overall, I really suggest you buy Taster's Choice on-the-go packs. They not only are worth the money, but the taste is definitely the strongest with each and every cup. Bottoms' Up!<br /><br />Price: B+<br /><br />Convience: B+<br /><br />Taste: A-<br /><br />Overall: B+ 4
THESE ARE VERY TASTY FOR A QUICK SNACK, BUT THEY ARE A LITTLE TRICKY TO MICROWAVE. EACH MICROWAVE OVEN COOKS DIFFERENTLY (SIZE AND POWER WATTAGE) IT TAKES A FEW PACKS TO COOK JUST RIGHT. VERY EASY TO OVERCOOK OR UNDER COOK AND THIS EFFECTS THE TASTE GREATLY. AFTER YOU LEARN THE EXACT SECONDS FOR YOUR MICROWAVE THE BETTER THE TASTE. IF YOU OVERCOOK THEM THEY HAVE A CHEMICAL LIKE TASTE...YOU MIGHT AS WELL THROW THEM AWAY! (IF NOT COOKED JUST RIGHT)... I LIKE TO WATCH THE BAG COOK FOR BETTER RESULTS. I TAKE THE BAG OUT AT THE POINT OF INFLATION, NO LATER OR THEY WILL BE OVER COOKED. AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE LIKE NUKING POPCORN, BUT IT IS MORE DIFFICULT.<br /><br />+++UPDATE 1-04-10....WE GO THROUGH ABOUT 2-3 BOXES PER MONTH BECAUSE WE ARE ON A LOW CARB DIET. 4
Why is this $[...] when the same product is available for $[...] here?<br />http://www.amazon.com/VICTOR-FLY-MAGNET-BAIT-REFILL/dp/B00004RBDY<br /><br />The Victor M380 and M502 traps are unreal, of course -- total fly genocide. Pretty stinky, but only right nearby. 4
Before you try the Newtons Fruit Thins, please don't think "cookie" in the traditional way.  At first, I was expecting more of a 100 calorie version of a Fig Newton and I was wrong. This is more of a biscuit wafer (crunchy) with pieces of dried fig in it.  My first bite, I bit into a hard piece of fruit and OUCH. I was not expecting that.  However, the entire package was enjoyed my myself with tea.  The good news? The kids wouldn't go near them!  Ha! Gotta love that!  I am giving the Newton Fruit Thins a 3 due to the hard pieces of fig here and there. I would think that might be an issue for people with dental issues.  As for taste, I would have given them a 5 because I don't like traditional sweet cookies. 3
I love fresh bread and Hodgson brand is awesome. i usually just use the dough cycle on my bread machine and then form the dough in buns and stickss so i can easily take them on to go. even if the brand is not organic all the ingredients are natural and processed without chemicals. but most of all they taste great. all it requires is some water and shortening(butter, or oil). i have even been able to use applesauce instead of oil but it didnt get as rich taste. I have ordered all varieties they had on amazon, whole wheat honey is specially tasty. no more supermarket bread! 5
What can a person say about a dog treat?  My yellow lab loves these treats, and I like that they are an organic product.  I also like that Newmans Own donates to charity.  If these are important to you, I recommend the treats. 5
It came on time and was in good shape and no slat was linking out of the box so I would buy more soon. 3
Definitely would reorder these again.  I think it would be better if they were offered in a bigger pack.  My kids love these.  Great little Valentine's Day gifts.  Great stocking stuffers. 5
Has soy grits and flax in it, not what you expect in chips, and not adequately labeled as such when purchasing. Not the usual corn taste, although it has some health benefits. It's just not what I expected/wanted, and won't buy again. 1
My dogs liked the treats and they are very hard to please. I love the fact that there are now several online dog treat companies. I have purchased organic dog treats from several sites and the top two are with Amazon! My other favorite company is doggiemunchies.com and they cost less, however I still get some treats from these guys because they offer different flavors. 3
This food contains all of the good stuff and none of the fillers.  Because of the limited ingredients it is one of the few foods I can feed my dog, who is allergic to many common dog food ingredients.  Unfortunately due to the cost, I only use this food on a supplemental basis.  This bag would last for about 2 days for a dog weighing 20-25 pounds.  For that reason, I only feed this food a couple of times a week on a supplemental basis.  Even the larger packages are cost prohibitive.  On a side note, I've found the frozen raw diets are generally cheaper than freeze dried, so I'm hoping to source the frozen varieties locally. 4
The flavor of this coffee is okay, but I felt it shouldn't be labeled as French Roast as it just doesn't have that deep roasted flavor that I love so much in a French Roast.  It's a much more mild, bland roast. 3
After buying my Keurig, I've done a bit of experimenting with different varieties of coffees available.  I've enjoyed other Newman's Own products, so this one caught my eye.  I was disappointed.  I'm not sure how they came up with "Extra Bold" in the name, but I found it relatively weak.  I ended up drinking a couple, saving one or two for potential guests that might like weaker, smoother blends and gave the rest away. 2
Boil some water and throw the contents of the packet in. About 7 minutes later you have a tasty side dish.<br /><br />Preparation could not be easier and the results are not bad - no off tastes and while not gourmet, nevertheless, this is a quality side dish<br /><br />I've tried most (if not all) of the Lipton side dishes. This is one of my favorites. None of the Lipton side dishes are bad but they are often bland. This one stands out along with their Alfredo and Stroganoff.<br /><br />Well worth a try. 3
At first taste, eaten dry without any milk, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004CYLW7A">Crunchy Nut Roasted Nut and Honey, 10.8-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> reminded me of honey roasted peanuts. With milk, it has a slightly different taste to it, but is still very good and reminded me of a variety of products: mainly Cracker Jacks, although not as sweet, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002LVACUE">Post Waffle Crisp Cereal, 11.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a> minus the maple taste, and to a lesser extent Fiddle Faddle and Crunch 'n Munch. This cereal has been compared to Honey Nut Cheerios (HNC) but other than the honey and they're both circular in shape, I don't see the comparison. I'm not a big fan of HNC because I find it to be too sweet, and while CN (Crunchy Nut) is a tad sweeter than I'd like, it's still not as sweet as HNC and I much prefer it to that cereal. Plus, I get a bit of the peanutty taste. If I'm going for Cheerios, I go for the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002AQP4QM">Cheerios MultiGrain Cereal, 16.2-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 3)</a>.<br /><br />As far as being a healthy breakfast, you could do far worse. Nowhere does this claim to be a nutritious cereal, though it does use the colors typically associated with healthier options, or those food companies want us to think of as healthy anyway. For a pre-sweetened cereal, the calories and sugar aren't too bad, 100 cals. per 3/4 cup w/o milk and 10 grams of sugar. It also has 2 grams of fiber and 2 grams of protein. There are more vitamins and minerals than I thought there would be in this cereal and no corn syrup or high fructose corn syrup is used, instead they sweeten with sugar, honey and molasses. The only thing I wish the cereal had used would be whole grains instead of yellow corn meal, otherwise it's a more than decent option for breakfast. For me, cereal is a go-to meal or snack any time of day, and this is a nummy option that I will definitely get again in the future<br /><br />Note: I do have a sweet tooth, but generally speaking, I don't like my foods as sweet as the average person and don't eat much of it in a day. 4
I picked up a can of these after the glowing reviews I read for it. To keep it short, it has a very authentic wasabi taste. It literally tastes like an almond dipped in wasabi sauce. And that, to me, doesn't make the most appealing snack. I find the wasabi flavor overwhelming, and none of the soy flavor coming through. I thought it'd come through as a more balanced flavor, but that's not the case. I won't be eating anymore, personally. I gave it two stars since it is wasabi flavor, and it certainly tastes like that. 2
My two cats loved these Petite Cuisine chicken flavors, and that's where the rubber meets the road in cat food. Happily, the food itself is very healthy and does not contain garbage byproducts. It's not human food but it's darn close. My cats preferred the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BDDTB2">Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp)</a> which I also received, but they certainly didn't turn up their noses at the chicken flavor!<br /><br />My sole complaint is that the chicken-pot-pie variety is very watery. My cats did not seem to mind though.<br /><br />If you want a premium, healthy cat food that is full of the good stuff, this is a great option. 4
Just because you see 96 treats on the box your crazy if you think that's how many your buying everyone knows 96 really means 45 1
Sorry, but Pure Naturals Chocolate Almond Bar did NOT answer my chocolate prayers. It was like eating 190 calories of cocoa, period. Thankfully, I had some leftover coffee in my mug to wash it down. 1
I rarely type reviews but simply have to after trying this product. I picked it up at Whole Foods and yes, the color is kinda strange, but I can get past that. And I realized it wouldn't taste truly like ice cream. But it has such a sickeningly sweet flavor that is nothing like cookies and cream. It reminded me of cheap ice milk with a bunch of Equal packets mixed in. And I did assume there would be 'cookies'. I know that there are whey crisps out on the market and assumed that something similar would be used.<br /><br />Overall, I really hated this product and after trying to doctor it up, I just threw it away. It's not a remotely good ice cream substitute. If you're looking for a natural, low sugar option, try So Delicious No-Sugar Added Coconut Milk Ice Cream. I've tried the Mint Chip and Chocolate and both are pretty delicious. 1
I purchased this item for my son for Christmas since we are unable to purchase the Nacho flavor Slim Jims in our area.  After Christmas he brought it back to me because the expiration date was over 2 years ago!  Amazon was great about the credit, and we ordered it on E-bay with no problems.  I don't know if this was an isolated box or if they have several like this.  Someone should have caught it before it went out as it was clearly marked on the box. 1
My wife can no longer eat products containing wheat, so she had to give up sandwiches, her morning toast and other bread-based products.  This excellent mix solved the problem and returned all of those treats to her menu.  The mix worked perfectly in our bread machine.  Just follow the simple instructions.  We use extra large eggs in our home, so I adjusted the recipe to use a bit less water to compensate.  Worked just fine.  We will try more of this company's products in the future. 4
These rice crackers are truly delicious w/cheese or Peanut butter.  Also I can eat crackers w/o Gluten. As I am allergic to wheat, eggs, Gluten, and Bannas.<br />This is my favorite snack on Sunday nights. They come promptly and save me money. Thank you. J. Wolf 5
Ok, so I may not know how exactly my dogs feel about the taste of these treats.  I do know that my dogs snapped these up and went to their perspective corners to enjoy these treats.  Going to your special place to enjoy a treat at my house only happens when the treats are tasty.  So I believe these passed that test.  I liked that these treats were are organic and not made with a lot of fillers, but rather quality grains and lamb.  I will definitely be reaching for these treats again. 5
The salmon is pretty tasty.  A little on the salty side, but still good.  Not tough to chew too.  The only grip I have is the price.  17 bucks for 5 ounces.  I'd give it more stars if there were more in there, or the price was lower. 3
My husband and I love this french vanilla decaf tea--but our local grocery stores now only carry the caffeine French Vanilla Tea. Luckily, I found it for sale on Amazon--even cheaper! 5
The plant looked great the day it arrived. With that said, the arrival took an extra week to get here. After the first day one of the heads turned blacked and i had to remove it. I give it 4 hours of direct sunlight a day and always keep the media wet. I never use tap water. Only rain and purifies water. I still have yet to see any of the heads open. I'm very nervous that they will not ever open. Maybe they will send me another one :/ 3
This cat food is adequate and nothing more. It will feed your cat. My cat does not like it and I am stuck with a big bag. This is a bargain brand, and gets the job done. 3
I've had good experience with pod teas in the past, so I was hoping that now that I have a Keurig brewer I'd be able to find some good tea blends.  This Madarin Orange Spice Herbal Tea is really good.  It has a pleasant orange spice flavor that is strong enough when brewed at the maximum 12 oz setting of my Cuisinart Keuring brewer.  Add a little sweetener of your choosing and it makes a refreshing beverage hot or over ice.  I will definitely buy again when I use up these portions. 4
I try to follow a somewhat low carb diet and find that these pretzels fit the bill as far as satisfying my need for a carby crunch.  I really enjoy all of Kay's chips and pretzels but keep in mind that, of course, there will be textural and taste differences from the "real" thing. 5
All and all it is my fault because I did not pay attention to what I ordered. When I went to the Jack's Links website it advertised white meat 95 to 97 percent fat free. At the time they did not have this product for purchase. So when I received an email saying it was now available I hurried and ordered it. It is not until I received the order did I realize I had ordered dark meat. I did not even know that dark meat was available; therefore, I was shocked and felt deceived. Yet, I had tasted the chicken nuggetts before reading the content and was wondering why was it so salty. I did get a formal apology in writing from jack's links but again it is still my fault for not paying attention. Now I am stuck with many packets of dark meat chicken nuggets. In conclusion, I guess it is still a little bit healthier than the beef. (maybe) 2
I enjoy the Newman's Own Pretzels on a regular basis and decided to start buying them by the case as my local grocery store stopped carrying them.  The first two cases I bought from a different distributor were fine, however in the last case I purchased from Amazon, all the pretzels tasted stale, although the bags weren't out of expiration and didn't appear to be opened.  I was very disappointed with this batch. 2
If you feel compelled to buy this, get it from Whole Foods so you don't waste money buying the 6 pack. Buyer beware that you cannot return many food items. The texture of this after rehydration was like a cellulose sponge.If you must have dehydrated tofu for hiking or camping trips, make your own or buy the tofu in the sealed boxes.  On the flip side, I love many of Eden products but this was a waste of my money. 1
I took one and said good Russet potato chip but I found that the flavoring was subtle for my taste, a bit oily and overcooked. It may be because I am use to eating their great tasting <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai, 2-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24)</a>. Or perhaps because all the chips in the bags I received were overcooked and that overpowered the seasoning. It is obvious the chips are flavored, but if I did not read the bag I would never have thought it had Cheddar flavor. And I love New York Cheddar. The flavoring included Parmesan, Cheddar, Blue Cheese, garlic and other spices. A good chip even when overcooked, but I do not plan to buy them again. 3
This is a spread that is lobster, trout and cream cheese.  It's not bad but it is really salty.  It has the look and consistency of cat food.  I had spread it on crackers but the saltiness, next time I think I'll spread it on bread. 3
Just had this to make a PB&J and I was really just eating a jelly sandwich. I guess it would be ok to mix into a smoothie (maybe), but I didn't think it had any flavor at all. 1
The Let's Do Organic Shredded Coconut is soft and finely shredded. This stuff is not as finely shredded and much drier. I prefer the Let's Do Organic Shredded Coconut. 3
having salt in separate area is a pain it makes it hard to regulate the salt that you are putting in so if you like salt go ahead get this product. 3
Do not bother. They are only good for 4 months. I bought these 6-2 oz cans in August, and they expire in December. So I would have to use in 4 months. Rip off. 1
If some other yahoo deems it ok to give give a suck review to this stuff because he doesn't like the taste, I feel I must assert that in this -as in all matters of taste- "De Gustibus Non Disputandem Est".<br /><br />I really love this gum. OK it doesn't really taste like strawberry, but it's still delicious. It has a wonderfully smooth consistency about halfway through, but then it gets tired, stuff, and squeaky.<br /><br />You'll forgive the squeaks perhaps when you find, as I did, that this stuff is a wonderful dietetic aid. By obsessively chewing this product I filled my gut with odorless room air and so helped me lose 25# in 3 months.<br /><br />Also, it doesn't lose its flavor on the bedpost overnight. 5
This is great hot sauce, but this is false advertising. Only one bottle will be sent, and they'll charge  $10 for shipping it--$20 per 5 oz of hot sauce. Totally absurd. Notice that they still haven't changed the description! 1
When I ordered this product, it said it was real cinnamon (i.e."canela") and "product of Sri Lanka". I ordered based on that, but they sent me Indonesian "cinnamon" (not Canela). Not at all what I wanted, and this item has been deemed "not eligible for return", and the website has been revised to match what they sent me.<br /><br />I don't think they did it to be evil, but they should have admitted they no longer stock what I ordered instead of taking my money for something I did not want. This product is WAY too expensive for common non-canela "cinnamon", so I feel a bit ripped-off.  And now I still have to find some real canela. Two stars, because it's probably an overpriced yet adequate product if you weren't bait-and-switched from something else. For me, it was just a total waste of time and money. :( 2
This product was fine for the price, but the quality wasn't very high. Too sweet, and variable consistency from piece to piece - some too tough, others soft and mealy.  I don't think I'll purchase again. 3
I love refried beans. I've been eating and enjoying them for almost four decades. However ... these aren't them! It would be much closer to what is in the can to call them bean paste -pale and flavorless, at that. I've eaten probably 20 different brands of refried beans over the years. Though some are better than others, they all share something this product doesn't have: whole or parts of pinto beans. Plus a certain darkness of color suggests that they are indeed pinto beans and are refried. This product is a very pale paste.<br />Refried Pinto Beans ... Not 1
Items in this Gift Basket was delivered to people who called me to say "could not eat any of it, because everything was old and stale."  I was sad and disappointed. Time and effort, as well as money to get this, only to find out - terrible. 1
Like every other Tazo iced tea lover, I was heartbroken when I read they changed the blend of their iced black tea. I had 6 of the old bags left and rationed them as long as I could. I broke down and bought a 3-pack of the new blend. The first batch was disappointing--it was a weak pitcher of iced tea that lacked color and taste. I didn't think I'd be able to drink another pitcher, let alone 3 full boxes of tea. But then I started adding 3 Irish Breakfast tea bags to the water, and I let the pitcher sit in the fridge overnight before drinking. Finally I've made a decent pitcher of tea with this new blend. It's dark and full-bodied and not half bad. I've got one bag of their old blend left and am going to try to concoct my own blend to match.<br /><br />If you like sweet tea, try taking 1/4 C brown sugar, 1/4 white sugar, mix with enough water to cover the sugar, then microwave for a minute to dissolve the sugar. Pour into the pitcher and stir, then let sit overnight. It's a delicious guilty pleasure. 3
Canned mushrooms produced in the USA are hard to find these days (many are products of China).  Organic canned mushrooms can also be quite hard to find.  In this product you have all that, and they are very good to boot! 5
These nuts taste alright. My main problem with it is that label makes no mention that is uses sucralose (aka Splenda) and modified food starch (aka MSG). These junk ingredients do not make the nuts taste awesome, so it's not worth it putting this garbage into your body. I guess Emerald doesn't realize that the whole point of buying nuts instead of junk food is so that people have a healthier diet.<br /><br />This is the only brand of nuts that has this garbage, all the other brands I've seen have more natural ingredients. Stay away from Emerald brand. 2
Delicious and aromatic. 4/5 stars because of Illi's superiority. It is however like 3 times cheaper.<br />If you are not ready to pay a fortune for Illi's coffee, this one is #2 but at significantly cheaper price. 4
I bought this product because it looked good not knowing if it would taste as good as it looked. Well it finally showed up by USPS well packaged. It's soft smells great and tastes even better. You won't be disappointed. I've already eaten five strips. 5
I've worked as a barista at an EXCELLENT coffee shop that trained us really well about beans (origins, qualities, roasting, etc.). This Tarrazu was a disappointment, even for a mass distributor. These beans have been over-roasted to the point that there is almost no flavor and the grounds are chalky (no oils left = no flavor at all). Tarrazu is usually medium-bodied with bright citrusy notes. Even after preparing it with 2 heaping TBS beans per cup of water, the brew still came out weak, bland and just gross. The seller won't accept returns, so these are going in my compost bin. 1
This is a very unique product. The taste is different, but very good. I'm addicted to them. My mother had these when I was a kid, so they are not only an excellent, unique hard candy, but they are also a childhood memory for me. 4
I saw this Chai Tea when I was shopping here for the Tazo Chai Tea.  I read the 3 reviews which all gave 5 stars so decided to give it a try.  I have to say I am totally disappointed.<br /><br />No real flavor what so ever.  I was expecting a Chai Tea with a little bit of bite and I got quite a bit of nothing.  The description written up by the manufacture made the tea sound wonderful.  Again the 5 stars by the reviews sold me, the taste did not.<br /><br />I would never recommend this tea to anyone, and as for me I'm sticking with Tazo. 1
Greek yogurt is an acquired tasted. It is very thick and tart tasting. While it tastes good with toppings like strawberry or honey, the taste is not something that I would choose without any additional flavor. 3
I love this stuff!  It tastes amazing and I bet it would taste even better warmed up!  It's not super filling, but it's perfect for a mid morning snack something to hold you over until dinner time. :) 4
No lemon flavor at all, no taste at all just cardboard texture. I do not recommend this product. I will not ever buy again. 1
I received these in the mail and immediately opened them.  I am a big fan of Fig Newtons (fruit and cake) and I wanted to try these immediately.<br /><br />I was less than enthused.  The cookie had a good taste and crunchy at first, but seemed to have a bitter aftertaste and seemed "waxy".  The aftertaste seemed to be primarily associated with the glazing of the cookie.  Not sure if this was part of the effect of the honey or not.  Anyway, I found it difficult to finish the box and would not buy these from the store.  I tried them a few more times,just to see if anything had changed, but the bad aftertaste was still present.<br /><br />I did not try any of the other flavors and I'm not sure if this one is still offered or not. 3
A pleasing coffee drink that doesn't taste canned, but it's not a substitute for real espresso.  If you like iced coffee, you'll enjoy the similar flavor (I had it fridge-cold).<br /><br />If you're used to super-sweet American bottled/canned coffee drinks (like starbucks "mocha" bottled drinks), you're in for a pleasant surprise: a distinct coffee flavor and modest sweetness that comes from a mere 50 calories of real sugar.  But, don't expect this to taste like chilled fresh espresso (and really, can you expect that out of a can, especially one labeled "espresso style"?).<br /><br />A pleasing grab-and-go coffee drink with only modest calories and a flavor reminiscent of pressed coffee.  Recommended. 4
This is delicious hot chocolate. It is best at 8 oz cup, but can be stretched to 10. And 8oz of strong coffee and you have delicious mocha 4
My Morkie had this ball for exactly 5 minutes and tore the rubber!  I am very disappointed because the concept is exactly what she needs!! 1
I bought these because I needed good edible markers for cake pops. I used wilton before I bought these and they weren't very good. So I figured I'd pay a little more and buy these. But after I bought them I realized they don't work really well on cake pops. They dry out as soon as you try to write on the chocolate. I did try them once on cupcakes and they worked pretty well. 3
This is a good coffee from Tully's, but it is not as bright as Full City.  Seems to be a little strong without the flavor you hope from a stronger coffee. 3
This stuff is pretty disgusting.  I don't care if Madonna, Tom Cruise or whatever celebrity invested in the company and carries a container of it around for photo opps, it tastes bad.  And as far as rehydrating better than water, umm, don't think so.  It might replenish potassium, although, unless you are participating in the Olympics, you probably are not going to risk a potassium deficiency from physical activity. 1
It is indeed a "rich and creamy chocolaty delight" if you use the smallest cup size on your machine.  Remember to shake the box well before using.  Some cocoa still remains in the K-cup after brewing, but regardless, you get a very satisfying cup of hot cocoa! 5
A friend of mine sent me some of theese, and I thought it sounded kinda gross. But found they were quite good for a snack, but the only place I've found them on the west coast is online 4
Didn't realize it was flavored and thought, when I had my first sip, that it tasted like chemicals. F-. Gave it away the next day at work. 1
My dog cannot get enough of these and I feed him 1 everyday and have been buying them for a few years.  Every year my vet asked what I dog to keep my dogs teeth clean!? 4
I normally drink Foldger's (sp) coffee and not much of that.  My regular coffee is definately strong in the acid department, at least for me.<br /><br />This coffee has no acid as far as I am concerned.  It had no acid aftertaste and did not impact my stomach at all.  As far as the taste I liked it less than my normal coffee.  It is stronger than Foldger's  (sp).  I would have given the coffee another star but my wife couldn't stand the taste so I figured it had to come down at least one star because of her complete disapproval.<br /><br />So I give this coffee 3 stars overall and 5 stars for lack of acid problems.<br /><br />AD2 3
Just like anything else from New Zealand this food is amazing. My cat can't wait for it, and plate is always clean. She loves it and I feel great buying Ziwipeak. They even put green muscles in this food. Overall food looks solid, packed with proteins and kiwi love. 5
I BOUGHT THESE FROM AMAZON PRIME FOR 10 ON OCT. 26.  NOW THEY ARE 26 PLUS 8 FOR 34 INC SHIPPING.  AMAZON PRIME NO LONGER CARRIES THEM OR OFFERS THEM ON BACKORDER, IF THEY WERE OUT OF STOCK.  I will look at other brands, but non as price attractive as those offered by amazon prime a month and a half ago.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SAOD4K">La Moderna Maria Roll Cookies, 6-Ounce (Pack of 20)</a> 1
I tend to be a regular coffee drinker - 3 to 4 cups per day. And periodically drink flavored coffee. Most are too flavored for me. I like a dark roast (though not as dark as French Roast). I DO like Starbucks' varietals and SOME blends.<br /><br />So, I was hoping for the best of both worlds when Amazon sent me the 1lb package to try. But it didn't live up to expectations.<br /><br />The coffee was a lighter roast than normal - more like Dunkin Donuts. And the Vanilla flavor didn't taste like just vanilla. So I read the package. Though it says "Vanilla and other Natural Flavors" on the front of the package the ingredients list reads as follows" Ground coffee, Natural Flavor (with corn maltodextrine, vegetable Glycerin), Gound Vanilla Beans, Indian Sarsaparilla Root".  Hmm. corn sugar and a natural vegetable product BEFORE the Vanilla? And Sarsaparilla? It's not in the name. That explained the different taste and the aftertaste I got. How about just giving us coffee and vanilla beans? This is to be premium coffee.<br /><br />I think I'll pass on this line of flavors in the future. Coffee preference is a subjective thing. There are lines at Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks as well as McDonalds. And Maxwell House still sells well.<br /><br />So you may or not agree with me but I just want folks who read this review to know the ingredients when they buy this "Natural Fusion" product from Starbucks.<br /><br />Steve Ramm (who generally reviews CDs, books and DVDs but DOES drink coffee too!)<br />"Anything Phonographic" 2
I purchased the Chicken & Salmon formula with the notion that- Hey! I watch what I eat, My kitty should too! Needless to say, my cat Mia was less than thrilled. In fact, she took two wiffs and walked away :( Granted I was feeding her Fancy Feast before- which I recently found out is like feeding your cat Mcdonald's every day! Super tasty but void of any nutritional benefits whats-soever... So after a few unsuccessful meal times, I tried spiking her meal with a dash of Fancy Feast? No dice. She ate the Fancy Feast and I swear gave me this look like- 'Nice Try Bucco- and you thought you were SOOO sneaky...'<br /><br />So to the previous Fancy Feast feeders- I say maybe try something else to slowly get your cat onto the health track? Or you might end up like me with 20 cans of food I can't use :( I've been trying other brands that have more gravy- with slightly more success! (Emphasis on the slightly-she drinks up all the liquid and I'm left with chicken strips!) Maybe I have a oober picky cat? But I'm thinking I will keep on trying and probably give this one another run once I've detoxed her from her fast food craves.. 2
I use the Keurig Coffee maker at home.  It's great, I love it.  Read my review on it here within this site.  For those of you who don't know - the Keurig "K-cup" coffee maker uses these little cup-packets of coffee grounds to make individual servings of coffee.<br />~<br />I recently bought the part for my coffee maker that allows you to brew your own ground coffee, such as this. I've used it several times, but the coffee always comes out watery or bitter.  I was hesitant to try this brand but let me tell you - it's AWESOME.<br />~<br />This coffee is now my new favorite one to make at home. I've had it several times now and it's always consistently awesome.  A nice bold flavor without being bitter or watery.  It's the ultimate coffee - a nice solid smooth coffee flavor without any harshness or tart aftertaste.  I highly recommend this one for any Keurig Coffee Maker users out there!!!! 5
I bought these for my almost 9 month old twins. I was totally shocked by how hard these wagon wheels were. I bought them thinking they would be like there other products, soft and safe to eat. While I can break them up into little pieces to eat that defeats the purpose I could just give Cheerios for a fraction of the price. I have to say i dont feel comfortable giving them a whole one to eat, they put in there months and they take forever to dissolve. Big miss on Gerbers part for these items. 2
I'm not picky at all when it comes to food but this beef jerky was some of the blandest jerky I've ever had. Not much flavor at all. I got the Teriyaki flavored. Maybe other flavors are better. 2
This has to be the most disgusting K-Cup I've ever tasted. I've had instant coffee that tasted better than this. Zero chocolate flavor, but even worse coffee. Would not recommend this one at all, don't even bother trying it. 1
My husband is a Beer Nut lover. Looked in many stores<br />and could only find small bags. Love these large cans. 5
These are WONDERFUL -- BUT, the title makes it sound like you get 24 bags that are 6.78 ounces each. NOT SO! Each bag is only 0.28 ounces. The 6.78 ounces is the amount you get for all the bags put together.<br /><br />As I said, these are wonderful! But they are very expensive for the amount you get.<br /><br />I gave them 4 stars because the title is deceiving! If you zoom in on the picture, you'll see the bag says 0.28 ounces. 4
I bought these for my sister who has pancreatic cancer. The Chemo is making her very nauseated and as I know ginger is great for that I thought these would benefit her.  The problem was the were so strong they burned her mouth.  They did the same thing to me.  I know these are great for some people just not for my sister. 2
I've tried pretty much every pepper covered peanut (or cashew) on the market and these are by far the best.  You'd better like spicy though. 5
These definitely work as treats, since my dog is very excited to get one.<br /><br />However, even though they are scored to break easily, they only break once, and half of one of these is still too big for a small treat for my 18-lb dog.  Half is about twice the size (or more) of several other brands of treats I have around, so I think these may be extra-big.  Might be great for big dogs who can barely taste regular sized treats!<br /><br />My other complaint is that the name of the product should be "Barley and Lamb" dog treats, since the first two ingredients are in that order.  Otherwise, though, the ingredients are pronounceable and look very healthy and I feel good about this dog treat....as long as I want to give her a BIG treat! 4
This is a flavor I don't normally find at my local stores, plus I can buy in bulk.  With things as they are, we take our savings where we can.  Add some veggies and even stir in an egg as the noodles cook and you can add some nutrition to these quick meals for not a lot of extra $$. 4
This is a very balanced and smooth light coffee great for a first cup of the day. 5
I enjoy trying new flavors, especially sauces and sandwich dressings.  I once inadvertently discovered that a certain flavor of a certain brand of salad dressing is pure heaven on a roast beef sandwich, and now I won't eat roast beef without it.<br /><br />When I saw that Taco Bell had come out with a new line of sandwich dressings, I figured it couldn't hurt to try.  As an Amazon Vine customer, I was able to get two free bottles, so I chose Taco Bell Bold & Creamy Chipotle sauce and Bold & Creamy Jalape&ntilde;o sauce.  The idea of trying them on a sandwich made my mouth water.<br /><br />I had a guest who wanted to try the Chipotle sauce.  OK by me; I figured I'd keep the Jalape&ntilde;o for myself.  He took one bite, on a ham and cheese sandwich, and pronounced it, "Flavored mayonnaise".  I remember thinking it couldn't be that bad, but it didn't bode well that he didn't finish the sandwich.<br /><br />A week or so later, I got some take-out chicken fingers and figured they'd be good to try the sauce with.  Since the Chipotle was already opened, I poured some on a plate used it to dip my chicken fingers in.  I dipped it in.  I tried one, two, three chicken fingers.  My friend was wrong.  It didn't taste like flavored mayonnaise.  It tasted like generic, store brand flavored mayonnaise.  Like real Chipotle, it had a mildly smoky, bacon flavor.  But beyond cheap - it was very, very cheap tasting.<br /><br />This brings us to today.  I had a friend over, and I made some frozen chicken (General Taos's Chicken, if you must know).  As the chicken was frozen and rather bland, I figured it was time to try the Jalape&ntilde;o sauce.  I put some out in a dish and we tried it, dipping our chicken into it.  Yecch!  This time, it tasted like generic, Jalape&ntilde;o flavored store brand flavored mayonnaise.  It wasn't very spicy, as I would expect Jalape&ntilde;o to be.  It also wasn't terribly flavorful and, on the whole, it reminded me of the Chipotle sauce, just a little more spicy and maybe a little more boring and cheap tasting.  I wanted to be as fair as possible, so I gamely continued on for another few pieces.  When I realized it had ruined my dinner and I'd had enough, I'd had enough.<br /><br />Shortly before starting this review, I dumped the two half-empty bottles of sauce into my garbage can.  From now on, when I think of sandwich sauces, well, "Yo no quiero Taco Bell".<br /><br />Not recommended. 3
I've tried both the illy issimo Caffe and the illy issimo cappuccino.  I gave the cappuccino 5 stars because it tastes like a creamy iced cappuccino made with espresso from a machine.<br /><br />The caffe is also good and also tastes legitimately like it's a not-strong espresso.  However, I didn't find it to be the same quality as the Cappuccino.  It's ok.  It tastes like an ok iced/sweetened espresso/caffe from an average coffee place.  I surely would drink it - it's just not a 5 star product.  Good.  Not great.<br /><br />Note: this drink does not have any kind of cream/milk in it.  It's a black/sweetened coffee. 4
I'm going to be honest here, I was intrigued by the marketing, packaging and general assumption that this treat would at least somewhat taste like peanut butter, after all, I only give my dog the best. I consider myself a first line of defense of sorts for my dog. After purchasing this product, I was sitting in my car and my curiosity got the better of me. I tried one. It didn't taste bad, but it definitely didn't taste like peanut butter AT ALL. Zero peanut butter taste. How does a company get away with such blatant false advertisement like this. It's shocking, shocking I say.<br /><br />But in all seriousness, there is no peanut butter flavor at all. Why say it when it's not true?<br /><br />Dog still loves them though. But then again, the only thing he doesn't like is olives. 2
This is the strangest tasting Amy's brand (or any other brand I have ever tried) refried black beans I have ever ate.  I have tried every brand that I ever found, it this one just tastes odd, and I like the regular Amy's refried black beans.  I think it is all the extra ingredients, specifically the green bell pepper and onion that give it such an odd sweet flavor, but I am not sure as I have never studied the ingredients before.  Under lying that sweetness is just a bland, non existent, "watery" flavor that does nothing for me.  I would have preferred a spicy flavor, so I have to add my own.  I will not reorder. 2
the tea was of high quality and came in biodegradable pouches that looked like silk bags, but I had two problems with it, first the orange taste was barely detectable, and the silk-like bags worried me because they did not state the material of the bags or how it might react to the heat of water that I would end up drinking, non the less these bags gave me a sense of luxury 4
I like the concept of this toy w/these rawhide strips but they are very expensive and after much wear on the toy the rings do not stay on well so they do not last very long.  Yes, my dogs are big agressive chewers but I was thinking the toy would last a little longer.  The strips are kind of thin so they are finished with it in about 10 minutes. 3
Good, easy to use, somewhat hard to get the caps on, but at the end you can easily dispose of these disposable Kups after using.<br /><br />Good that you can use your own coffee.  Fresh coffees.  I personally like coffees from Spain, Puerto Rico and other countries.<br /><br />The bad, sometimes is messy.  Coffee grinds seem to leak, creating a slight mess and the need to clean the machine.  This leak is more in the area of the Kups lid and cup.  And some times these grinds even get in your cup of coffee.  Just read other reviews about this.  Not sure if it could be related to how fine are the grinds of coffee.<br /><br />On the other hand, with disposable Kups you don't need to keep cleaning wire filter baskets.  That's a very plus.<br /><br />All considered will probably buy again, but wish a better lid/cup seal that will not leak.  Hope down the road they will offer improved DisposableKups. 3
Was a good product in theory but the oatmeal was flavorless, the fruits were ok, and it contained hard chunks that would not soften even after reheating it for an extra 1 minute.<br /><br />Seriously not worth buying but i do recommend the black bean soup. It kicks ass. 2
This product has improved our dog's breath and the tartar build up on her teeth.  I would recommend this product. 4
Amazon did not do a good job of packaging.  Product was broken in pieces when I received and cannot return!  Donot by from Amazon! 1
I thought french roast would give me more flavor and smell, same thing, nothing special about this coffee, when opens up, it is flat and plain, no lust and didnt smell much, seems like it's been in the shelf for a long time. Price is good, that's the only good about it, otherwise it is just so-so. 1
The Prepara Herb Savor Pod is advertised holding asparagus. That was why I purchased it, thinking it would be good for keeping asparagus fresh. In reality the pod will hold very few spears and they would need to be quite thin and short.  The ad is misleading. I'll keep it for storing herbs, but asparagus is out of the question. 2
Was searching under K-Cup Category for some Columbian Coffee.  Finally thought i found it only to find out that these were Pods not K-Cups.  Now I have a couple of cases that i amazon refuses to take a return on because they had messed up the categorization on these. 1
The breakfast bar was just ok straight from the package.  I decided to warm it up after a bite, and what a wonderful treat with my morning coffee!  Tasted just like fresh baked banana bread.  I could've ate two more! 4
Contains Italian Basil, Purple Basil, Chives, Parsley, Mint, Cilantro and Dill.  Like many others have stated, the Cilantro never grew.  I tried a replacement and it never grew either.  I have had to replace 2 motors in the Aerogarden itself. (I have 3, was so excited when I got the first one, I immediately ordered 2 more). Customer Service is easy to reach and eager to help...BUT...they keep getting complaints about the same kind of things, especially motors quitting...and have not solved the problem yet.  While it is quite enjoyable watching my salad greens, tomatoes, and herbs grow...it is quite aggravating have so frequent problems...and Cilantro is my favorite herb...can't get it to grow! 3
These Dental Sticks are perfect for my two dogs that have food allergies and they LOVE them and i like the price for them here at Amazon. 5
As someone who goes through lots of thyme (I use it in everything except cereal), I was pleasantly surprised to see this product on Amazon at a very reasonable price. Looks, smells and tastes just like any other thyme but you can not beat not running to the grocery store and paying about 5-10x more for a tiny bottle which would last maybe 2 weeks in my house :). 5
My husband is always hassling me to eat something good with protein, as I am a carb lover.  These white meat chunk chicken in cans are great, because I'm terrible at meal planning.  All of a sudden, I'll be hungry NOW, with no time to cook.<br /><br />So I open a can of this Swanson chicken, drain it, dump it into a tupperware, add a couple heaping tablespoons of lite Miracle Whip, and start mashing at the chunks with a fork.  I scoop up the newly made chicken salad with saltine, Ritz, or butter club crackers.  Ta-da, instant protein-filled meal.  This chicken would be great for serving to kids, too.  I ALWAYS have cans of this in my cupboards.  I can add some more flavor by adding ground black pepper, mustard, relish, and other kitchen staples.<br /><br />It is cheaper at my local stores.  But, if you can't get out to the store, I've always had great service from amazon! 5
This rootbeer extract is unlike any I've ever had before.. very heavy on the wintergreen notes! I think its possible that I might have gotten a bad bottle, I've tried a number of different ratios to try and make something thats drinkable but I gave up after six attempts! 2
This brand has a sweet, almost maple syrup taste to them. Also, they don't whip up smoothly - they stay sort of shaggy looking. 2
Great price and Quick delivery.  However, the package was  poorly packed.  The box was crushed and the package was split open, therefore compromising the freshness of the product. 4
I've had marrons glaces plenty of times before out of the country and these were a mediocre imitation at best. I figured it was too good to be true to get so much for the price - the good ones are very pricey. Instead of the delicious syrup they're supposed to have, these had that gross donut glaze. I tried to pawn these off to my little brother and his friends (they've never tried real marrons glaces) and they didn't even like these for what they are! Again, with these, you get what you pay for. 1
WILD RIDE WAS A LOT BETTER WHEN I STARTED EATING IT A FEW YEARS BACK. THE NEW PURCHASE OF SEVERAL BAGS (ATE TWO SO FAR) HAS BEEN DISAPPOINTING. FLAVOR PROFILE HAS CHANGED AND PRODUCT IS TOUGH AND DRY. GOING TO LOOK FOR A NEW REPLACEMENT BRAND. TOO BAD. PROBABLY GOT TOOK FOR A WILD RIDE (CRASHING) WITH THIS PURCHASE. 2
I loved this mold!  I wished I could have used it for more than one occasion, but it didn't last.  I did use it to make 30+ suckers for my daughter's first birthday. But there was going to be no way that the mold could be salvaged after that.  I would have liked to have kept to use on other occasions, but for the price it didn't matter to me that much.  It served it's main purpose :) 4
Ordered two for my partner who is on a navy cruise and he said that none of them broke and wanted more already lol (i guess they took to long to get there...so here's to purchasing more) 5
I have been using this tea for a few years now, and I drink the full 2 cups every night before I go to bed.  It begins to take effect the next morning.  I gave a bag to a friend to try & she loved it as well, she now orders it online. 5
I purchased this set to use with some bumble bee cake pops that I was making for my daughter's birthday.  Specifically, I was most interested in the black pen to draw a smile on the bee's face.  This was my first time using any kind of edible markers so I wasn't sure what to expect.  I had read that the Wilton ones tend to dry out quickly and it is difficult to write with them.  These markers were easy enough to work with.  The only other issue for me is their shelf life.  I have had them for about a month and have not used them recently so I cannot say, but for edible markers these got the job done. 4
Yuck. I'd use a more colorful title for this review than "cheese droppings" that means the same thing but rhymes with "cheese curds" but am not sure that'd make it past Amazon's content policies.<br /><br />You know how if you're baking a pizza or something and some of the cheese falls off and lands directly on the pan, then overcooks into a hard, crunchy, oily salt lick? Yeah, that's what these are. They're strongly flavored to hide the underlying horror. It doesn't help.<br /><br />I should admit that I'm not this product's target audience. I was just looking for a tasty snack, not realizing that these are intended for people on ultra-low-carb diets. But if you want to get 100% of your snack calories from fat, might I suggest pork rinds? They've got a pleasant bacon-y taste and are not foul abominations like these are. Or if pork rinds aren't to your taste, perhaps you could try drinking used motor oil. I'm pretty sure that doesn't have any carbs either, and can't taste much worse.<br /><br />I see that a few reviewers have said things that weren't entirely negative. Well, everybody's entitled to an opinion, and theirs is wrong. I'm stuck with a bunch of this garbage and I don't know what to do with it. I'd send them to my worst enemy, but I don't hate him all _that_ much. 1
A little Spicy for me - there is a solid block that needs to be mashed up.  Progresso is better :) 2
I got the plant in good shape however the the center bamboo and heart shapes started to turn pale and brown. I gifted it to wife who changed the water and washed stones very regularly. She even kept it in indirect sunlight when it was turning pale no use. Ultimately we have to cut the Heart shaped portions of bamboo, the rest of the plant so far is green but not sure how long. I even used bottled water as Chlorine in tap water may be bad for this. Very disappointed at this purchase. 1
At first bite the saltiness hits pretty hard but it kinda grows on you after eating a few. Don't think I'll buy again. 3
We love this cereal and the fact that it has probiotics.  I am not a big fan of the DHA from external sources such as algae, because it is not the same as the DHA found in breast milk.  However, the cereal is good and our baby likes it.<br /><br />Recommended for anyone looking for good organic cereal. 4
This is the best way to cook a roast.  Our local grocery went out of buisness and so I could not find this product till I looked here.  Please continue to keep this product available! 5
This rice is super easy to prepare.  I like it with a bit of Frank's Red Hot sauce added.  I'm<br />deducting a star, however, because the nutritional information on the site is wrong.  I dislike nutritional information that divides a single portion serving into fractions on the label but, at the very least, it should be accurate information.<br /><br />The nutritional information above indicates that it is 115 calories per "serving" or 230 per bowl.  When in fact, the label on the bowls indicate that it is really 170 calories per serving or 340 per bowl. 4
I received one of these bars free from Influenster.com in return for honest feedback.  I was glad to try this product and it's quite yummy.  Nice and soft (like I like) with a delicate banana/nut taste and aroma.  Reminds me of mom's homemade banana bread. Thanks Influenster and Quaker!!! 4
There is a warning on the package not to use the popcorn button on the microwave.  First of all, why would they create popcorn that cannot use the convenient popcorn button?  The recommended cooking time is 2 to 2 1/2 minutes.  Follow the direction, and the popcorn in the middle is burnt every single time.  I am switching to Pop Weaver. 1
I am not a coffee snob, but I find this strong is very strong in flavor.  I use the large cup selection on my maker and combine it with a cup of regular coffee.  I think it might be ok over ice. 2
This product is very strong, very pungent. I love strong ginger flavor, but this was way beyond my tolerance.  It literally felt like my mouth was burning.  I diluted it in 12 oz of water but it was still unpleasant. Finally I decided to add it to 8 oz of green tea as a flavoring, and it made a delicious 20 oz mug.  I would buy this only as a flavoring for a cup of regular hot tea, which was quite delicious that way. 3
My cat is 12 years old and very finicky about what she eats...she has never eaten dry food..she will starve before touching dry food. But..mostly she just meows as loud as she can and gets into mischief if she doesn't have what she wants to eat.... She loves this type of cat food, though. I don't know whether it is the cheese she likes, or the over all taste...but she devours it every time....I wish it was smooth instead of strips, as she seems to have trouble chewing it...I wish the grocery stores would stock more of it, as i usually buy for a month at a time... 5
Sometimes these markers work great and sometimes not so much. I do think that they work better then anything I bought at the store. 3
Costco has 32oz bags for 9.99. Chia is a great source of fer and omega's. I now use this instead of flax seed as you don't have to open them for benefits like flax. 1
The items arrived in a timely manner. I am not that impressed with the traps..zero luck so far...and the traps seem designed for bigger moles than I have (mine may be "pocket gophers"). The traps are too wide for their holes. Black Hole traps are far more effective for me. 4
For instant coffee - this is good!<br />Definitely cheaper and more convenient than buying coffee every morning. 4
Yes, these cups have to be kept in a bag or jar to keep their freshness. However, there are only 12 cups per bag, so I didn't find any flavor loss when I clipped the bag closed. I used 12 in about 15-18 days.<br /><br />I loved the flavor: a nice, rich cup when set on medium setting on my Keurig (which is what I always use except for some weak flavored blends). They fit perfectly in my B70 Keurig -- and I love saving on extra packaging.<br /><br />But I had a problem I don't see anyone else mentioning: Of the 36 cups total, 3 were duds. The water flowed them, but only light brown water came out. Three out of 36 is too high a failure rate for me. With regular k-cups (of which I've used at least 1200 in 5 years), I've only had maybe 5 duds.<br /><br />Therefore I rate this as 3-stars for now (not less as I don't see anyone else having had this problem). I might try this or another flavor again at some point because the coffee is good and the price is right. Then we'll see... 3
So fishy that our cat is all over this the moment I cut the packaging open.  The smell is very strong.  My baby did not take to it.  It is our cat's food now.<br /><br />Their other products are much better, but this one is way too fishy.  It doesn't smell pleasant when you go out to a friend's house or restaurant.  If I just wipe the spoon and bowl without washing after feeding this and put it back in the backpack, after I get home the whole thing reeks. 2
I ordered this coffee for my daughter to try. She's a second year med student and has had some Gerd and Lerp problems. Coffee was something that she's always liked but had to give up because of acid reflux. Although the Amazon Vine offer clearly said that they would send ten 3 ounce bags, only one bag was delivered. I emailed back and asked them to send the correct order.  Lo and behold, they once again sent one bag. I contacted them one more time to explain that there must be a coding problem in their system but this time I wasn't favored with a response. In the hundreds of orders that I've processed through Amazon over the years, this is the first time that Amazon has made a shipping mistake and not cleared it up.<br /><br />So both my daughter and I tried a cup. Neither one of us had any acid reaction -- but neither one of us would have ordered it again based on the taste. We both like a stronger and bolder cup of coffee and this one was weak with some sort of strange after-taste. Not exactly our cup of tea. Keep trying though, a lot of people with acid reflux are looking for a great cup of coffee. 3
Exactly as advertised. Plenty of space to set the Keurig brewer on top and still fit under a counter top (depending on counter top height). Cups fir in nicely and the drawer is easy to access and see what K-Cups you may want. 5
I have always thought that Orville Redenbacher's is the best microwave popcorn. Until this product came along. It is a failure in several ways. If you pop for even as short as 2 1/2 minutes, you will get about 50% good kernals, and the rest will be burnt. And I mean individual burnt kernals and a few solid masses of burnt kernals fused together! I have popped three bags so far and the result has been the same for all three. And I stood next to the microwave listening, as the product advises. At 2 1/2 minutes, there was still plenty of popping going on, but I stopped anyway.<br /><br />Then comes the challenge of opening the bag. The instructions are somewhat clear, but I was scratching my head on the first one or two that I popped. When you attempt to pull off the plastic bowl cover, you must pull very hard, and when you do that, the paper attached to the plastic tears and popcorn spills out. I tried pulling one side, but it didn't open cleanly, so I tried the other side, with the same result. I was determined not to use scissors because I didn't want greasy scissors that I would have to clean. I ended up on all three bags eating the popcorn with the plastic cover still partially attached. It was clear that any more attempts to remove the cover would have meant popcorn on the counter and floor.<br /><br />Finally, the picture on the box showing a nice buttery yellow bag of popcorn overflowing the top of the bowl is blatant false advertising. On all three bags I popped - at the proper time and temperature - the result was some yellow kernals, some grayish kernals (on their way to being burnt), and black, burnt kernals. And each time, the amount of popcorn was at least two inches below the top of the bowl. And many kernals were not popped.<br /><br />If an industrial design student presented this pop-up bowl for a class assignment, I think they would get an A minus for idea, and a D minus for execution. Didn't anyone at ConAgra foods bother to TEST this product before putting it on the market??? 1
The information on line did not include the fact that the product contains sorbital which can cause diarrhea and could have had a dangerous affect on my dog who has a sensitive stomach 1
Totally agree with the Nutri-Not reviewer above. If you are going to have candy or cake, this is better choice but just as artificial just slightly more fiber which is minimal for a healthy choice anyway. better to eat real fruit, but like i said, good for snack but not healthy. I eat the strawberry ones and I noticed blood on my toilet paper from wiping my behind almost every time I had some. That is not a good sign. Entenmans has similar fruit bars that are a couple calories less and you don't taste all that salt like you do with these. I am switching back. 2
The item shipped in an unsealed plastic bag within a brown cardboard shipping sleeve. Arrived with product loose and falling out of the cardboard.  No effort had been made to seal the plastic bag or the shipping sleeve. Unbelievable.<br />The product itself is very foul tasting with a horrible lingering aftertaste. Could be the coating?<br /><br />I am very disappointed in the purchase and would never buy again. Especially from this vendor. Stay away from these! 1
The gummy bear was not as big as I had expected it to be, but aside from that I am happy with this product. 3
I really wanted to like this product. I really, really did. Having to cut back on fats and sugars, this seemed an ideal product for me. However, I just can't cope with the flavor. Mixing the powder with sugar free jelly produced a water mess that seeped out the sides of my sandwich. Plus, the flavor was completely overwhelmed by the little bit of jelly I threw in, despite using two heaping tablespoons of powder. Using it on its own, mixed with water, produced a consistency that was more what I'm use to encountering with peanut butter, but again the taste was lacking. It tasted like an echo of a slightly burned roasted peanut. I'm sure the product is a great one for what it is, but I just can't see using it as a substitute for non-powdered peanut butter.<br /><br />I gave it three stars because the texture,when mixed with water, has a nice consistency, and it was very finely ground which made it easy to mix. I also think that it would be great for baking...maybe for rolling truffles in to give it a powdery hint-of-peanut coating. 3
I like Vita Coco water, however, inside of the box, the containers were packed on its side and the box was dropped and 1/3 of the containers were empty. VERY POOR PACKAGING.  Mike 3
Vet recommended for dental health. Cost on line was half that in vets office. Product does not store well once dog has chewed on it. 3
The cookies are soft but very dry and tasted nothing like an oatmeal cookie. It reminded me more of a Keebler Soft n Chewy cookie, with a few almond bits tossed in.  If the bits of almonds and chocolate were bigger I think my kids would of liked these cookies. They all passed on having a second cookie. These won't be making it into the lunchboxes this year. 3
I bought this with the whirly pop popcorn popper, and I made some as soon as I got them. It is the best popcorn I've had. I thought I would mind the smaller kernel size, but I didn't. There is substantially less hull than regular popcorn. The flavor is great. I suggest using peanut oil for popping popcorn. It gives popcorn a great nutty taste - really delicious. You can buy peanut oil at any oriental (Asian) store. It's better than olive oil (olive oil and popcorn is too weird for me). But peanut oil is perfect. You won't need butter flavor or anything like that again (artificial butter flavorings are full of chemicals). Now, we pop around three times a day and always crave this for a snack instead of junkfood. Try it and you'll be popping like us. 5
I'm a big fan of caffeine free Chai.  I really liked the Oregon Chai that was caffeine free but it's so hard to find.  This chai tastes different than the Oregon, but it's just as good.  Brew it with two tea bags per cup for a real taste treat.  The artificial ingredients don't seem to make much difference in the taste for me. 4
This was not bad at all. I had a bad experience with VitaCoco acai and pomegranate and it was horrible!!! It had that strong coconut flavor that I do not like. I had already bought this so I was nervous to try it. I was surprised when it barely tasted like coconut. It doesn't have that typical strong coconut taste. I usually stay away from anything coconut. Candy, food, beverages, etc. For some reason it gets me sick. But I wanted to try this, because I heard coconut water is good for you. I already tried the mango, pineapple, and pink guava flavors. They are delicious. Pink guava is my favorite. O.N.E. brand is my favorite. As long as I don't really taste that strong coconut flavor, then I will keep drinking this. 4
If drink disaster has a taste, this is it. BB pina colada mix was so bad, I thought it was expired. Using Splenda is a bad idea, Bob. If you read these reviews, sCRAP this recipe and if you gotta go sugarless, try stevia, much smoother... 1
These are just ramen noodles in a convenient microwavable cup. Noodles, a smattering of dried veggies and TVP, and a salt...I mean flavor packet. Prep is stupid easy...open the foil lid, add the contents of the flavor packet, add water to the line, fold the lid back down, nuke for three minutes, stir, and enjoy.<br /><br />The results are just what you would expect from a bowl of ramen. Lots of noodles and broth, and there at the bottom of the bowl, are a few vegetable bits and some tiny cubes of textured soy protein that is supposed to pass for chicken. The flavor is just about what you would expect from a chicken flavored soup, but with a nice spicy kick on the back of the throat. That spiciness stays pleasantly on the lips for a few minutes after.<br /><br />So what's not to like? Even if you aren't watching your sodium intake, this is a salt lick in a bowl. Even if you follow the "serving guidelines" on the nutrition facts panel and share this with a friend or loved one (Yeah, right!), you get over one third of your daily salt intake. If you are like most of us and hog all 3 oz. yourself, your sodium intake will be a whopping 74% of the daily recommended maximum.<br /><br />The price is also a bit steep for a ramen product. Overall it is not enough new and different from the ramen in the cello wrap for me to purchase this. 3
Well I havent actually ordered this product, and frankly Im not going to, I know that in some cases that flat rate shipping is standard, but paying MORE to ship it than to buy it is well just stupid! it weighs 1.5 lbs and costs $9.75 to ship when the product is only $8.50 in the first place!<br />Shipping rates need to come back down I know that people need to make money somewhere but do you really have to make money on the shipping? 2
This fence charger is probably a good unit, but it is for small animals, not deer etc.  The description indicated that it was for fences up to 5 acres.  It made no mention that it was only for rabbits, raccoons, etc.  I am inexperienced and had been told to look for a charger sufficient to electrify the size of my property which is 3 acres.  I did not know to check for animal size and did not notice it on the picture of the package until the package arrived.  Even the farmers who told me how to buy a fence charger had never heard of chargers for different size animals. 2
Kellogg's does not disclose that the ingredients in their cereals contain GMO's. That means the corn and sugar have had their DNA spliced with another species, usually a toxin or a bacteria. Kellogg's has contributed over 600,000 dollars to prevent laws that would require labeling of GMO's. But most Americans agree that they have a right to know what is in the food they are buying and feeding to their children. 1
These bars are tasty. Recently, many brands of health bars have come out with chunks of fruits and nuts glued together with a sticky sweetener, such as aguave syrup, honey or evaporated cane juice. KIND Bars are not exceptional among these bars, and all of these types of snacks are very good in my experience.<br /><br />What makes KIND Bars different is that a portion of the profits is directed to the PeaceWorks Foundation, which is a charity that supports peace in the Middle East. By "peace in the Middle East," they mean support for the "Palestinian Resistance" againgst the Israeli "occupation." This charity is considered centrist, and it rejects extremism, which it finds to be ineffective.<br /><br />Executive Manager of the PeaceWorks Foundation, Fathi Mohamed Hamdan Darwish, had this to say about the strategy of driving Israel into the Sea: "That solution is unrealistic and ineffective and can't be realized. We as a Palestinian people have historically paid the price of hundreds of thousands of martyrs and injured people and haven't reached this solution." 1
It's good alterative to junk food.  I reccomend trying TINGS TOO !!<br /><br />  These snacks are soooo  good. 4
I have a chihuahua that is the pickiest eater in the world!  I could not find any treat that this dog liked.  I finally tried the Pro-Treat Liver treats for dogs and she loves them!!  I actually have to give them to her at different times on different days, or she will get use to when she will get them.  Example, I was giving them to her when I got up every morning, so every morning she would wake me up at like 3:00 am so she could have a treat!<br /><br />These are the best treats and they are good for her!  It's a win win situation! 5
Switch has "100% of what you want" and "0% of what you don't,"  according to the can.  Also, according to the can it is "100% juice."  According to the Amazon product page it contains soy.  Quoting the printed page:  "Ingredients: 100% Juice (Filtered Sparkling Water Sufficient to Reconstitute Juice Concentrates, Apple, Grape, Tangerine, Orange and Acerola Juice Concentrates), Gum Acacia, Natural Flavors and Colors, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C). Contains Soy."<br /><br />There is an unusual taste.  It is difficult to decide whether it is the taste of the can or the taste of the soy.<br /><br />The price is surprising. The calories are shocking. One can has 140 calories.<br /><br />Who knows?  We may develop a taste for Switch. 3
And these are great.  Just like fresh roasted off the grill without having to peel them.<br /><br />Order lots of them because 3.5 Ounces add up to about 10-12 chestnuts.<br />These are great for eating out of the package or using in stuffing, etc. 5
Just average coffee.  For the price it's not worth it.  It's hard to find the minimum 29 words to say anything about this coffee. 3
The drink mix comes in a foil packet that is not easy to open. You'll need scissors.<br /><br />According to the instructions, you need to add hot water, so it is easy to prepare.<br /><br />I was surprised at how spicy the drink was. It's similar to chai tea, though you can also taste the honey and lemon flavors. I like spicy foods and drinks, so I thought it was fairly tasty, though the flavor had a slightly-off taste.<br /><br />I tried it first as a hot drink. However, since it was a fairly warm day I added ice cubes. Either way is fine, though it reminds me of the kind of thing I would drink if I was suffering from a cold.<br /><br />I suspect it's a healthier drink than most, but 70 calories a glass is a bit steep for me. 3
This product gives your popcorn the movie theatre butter consistency, but it doesn't seem to have much flavor.  The first time I used it, it seemed a bit grainy.  The next time, I heated it a bit before adding, and the grainyness was gone.<br /><br />I do think I will try something else though, as this was just ok. 3
Good product, but too expensive on here.  I can get Lars Pearl Sugar in a grocery store near my house for $4.50 for 10oz.  It's a bigger store, and they have an aisle where they carry a lot of foreign foods, which is where it's at, not in the regular sugar aisle, but I imagine most bigger grocery stores would carry it. 4
Arrived with no ice.  Too much cloves(?). Mushy, bland taste except for cloves. Expected more.<br /><br />Will try another brand next time. 2
I tried making some cool-aid with this stuff, and I had extremely painful gut-cramping ongoing diarrhea for like 10 hours. Hooray for finding out about this *after* drinking it while I looked only while buckling over in pain.<br /><br />Be WARNED that the packaging strongly discourages using this stuff for drinks of any kind, and even cautions you to slowly introduce this stuff into your diet because you body has to 'adapt to it'. 2
If you want to pay a lot for sugar, then buy this box of sugar. No Kiwi was hurt in the production of this so called Kiwi Smoothie, because it does have any Kiwi in it. 1
I strongly suspect this caviar, which is widely available in US supermarkets is a reason for fear of caviar in 90% of American population. This product only resembles real caviar in shape and color (artificial). It would not qualify for caviar in Europe. It's from the wrong fish, it has totally wrong taste, and it also has whole periodic table on the label. It's like dying chicken breast into red color, marinating it in steak souse, and selling it as New York Strip Steak...<br /><br />Real caviar doesn't come from lumpfish, and real caviar only have two ingredients - caviar and salt. Try Red Pearl Salmon Caviar if you want to try caviar. You can easily find it on Amazon and other places online. 1
This item is way over priced.  Don't pay $1 / cup.  You can get it around $0.60 / cup anywhere else online.  If you are paying $1 / cup, you might as well go to Dunkin Donuts. 1
It has artificial sweetener which not only taste bad to me but also gives me a headache. This should say light or diet to let the buyer know this. I would have never bought it had I known. It seems like it would taste good otherwise. 1
My cats love Weruva Meow Luau, but this flavor sits in the bowl and they barely will touch it. 2
I'll get used to it and it's not nauseating; but please don't tell me it tastes just like the sugared version.  I'm not diabetic; but cut down where I can.  By the time I've gotten through six bottles, I'm sure it'll taste just fine to me.  Did it with diet colas and low-fat milk.<br /><br />If your kids like it just as well, more power to 'em.  It's good to cultivate broadened tastes in kids so they'll enjoy a variety of foods and enjoy future travels more.  If you like it or, like me, figure you'll get used to it, great.<br /><br />Just don't tell me there's no difference?  No reason we can't adjust or even like this better, though.  We all have different tastes. 3
Product was well packed and shipped on time. I put the squid ink in the refrigerator to store. When I went to use it I saw that it expired on 11-11 That two months prior to my purchase date. I was not happy. Especially since I visit and shop at the store when I in Miami. 2
Great pasta.  I try to limit myself to whole wheat products.  This one is easy to make and has a nice flavor. 5
My wife and I both thought this is a nice cup of coffee. The bag has a one-way valve on it to keep the air out and arrived virtually flat. When brewed in our Cuisinart drip coffee maker it has a  nice aroma. I take mine with cream and sugar, and Mrs. B. drinks hers black. We both thought it was smooth, with no bitterness. Later it made a nice after dinner coffee when we added our favorite liquor. Tho I am no coffee snob, I can tell a good cup of coffee from a bad one, and this one makes the grade. 5
I haven't had any of the other Zevias, but this tastes awful to me. I'm a regular diet drinker and I was pumped this product uses Stevia. But the smell is precisely like cough syrup and the taste isn't much better. I dropped in some vanilla sweet leaf and held my nose and it was tolerable. Wish I didn't buy the whole case. 1
My daughter, living and working in DC this summer, introduced me to this product while home for a visit.  She encouraged me to give the plain version (just pure coconut water) a chance first, and by the second container, I understood the amazing qualities of this drink.  I felt so refreshed, hydrated, and healthy!  I later tried the kind with pineapple, which is also delicious, but I think the plain is more effective and purely refreshing when really hot, tired and thirsty, while the sweeter fruit infused version will be amazing as part of a cocktail.  Can't wait for 5:00! 5
Miss Vickies are better but unfortunately less widely available.  I'm not sure tough is the right word but there is a noticeable difference between the two brands and Miss Vickie's are better IMHO. 3
It doesn't get any better than this in the a.m.  Brew .. sit back .. sip .. and ENJOY! 5
But healthier than most of the other snacks I cram into my mouth(and that's gotta be worth something right?).  They taste good too!  Kinda sweet, kinda salty.  They're made with sweet potatoes so it makes sense.  Another interesting Popchips feature is that they are "popped"(hence the name, again, makes sense) rather than fried or baked... gives it an oriental rice snack kind of consistency.  All in all very pleased with these, give them a try for yourself, whether a health nut or not(a .8 oz bag of these is about 1/3rd the fat and half the rest of the nutrition facts numbers of a full oz of Lays for the record). 4
This trail mix is ok.  My beef is the amount of sunflower seeds in the mix.  If I wanted sunflower seeds I would buy them.  One quarter of the bag is sunflower seeds.  The crazy thing is there is no mention of sunflower seeds, I think that is "very" misleading. 3
This item had a great price and tastes great. The only thing that could make this product better is if the little plastic cup was recyclable or compostable. 4
I can't eat these oats, they have a funny taste to them.  My kids also think they taste funny.  My husband thinks they are OK, so he has 50 pounds of oats to eat on his own! 2
I really enjoyed this, and will probably be purchasing other flavors as well (if they are re-stocked - it seems that most of them are sold out).  I wanted something a little better than what I find in my area grocery stores, and this was really good.  The first time we made it, it was with milk, and it was a little too rich for me (which I thought was impressive, especially as I was only using skim milk), so I've since moved to a combination of milk and water, and it tastes GREAT (and I'll probably still make it with just milk, after adjusting more towards that over time).  My house is known for hot cocoa (we have at least 7 options right now), but everybody who has had this has enjoyed it. 5
I will not buy this product again. I cannot find the actual ingredients, Natural and other flavors are not sufficient for people with allergies. So far the peppermint is OK if I do not buy the minis. I may just stop buying Wrigley products in general when finding ingredient lists is this difficult. 1
the extra dessert delights sugargree key lime pie flavored gum is an amazingly limey mouth party.  it has a zesty tartness tempered with enough sweetness for balance.  having a piece of gum taste so much like a food is a little disorienting and while i did not really think i would end up looking like a lime (a la violet beauregard from willy wonka and the chocolate factory movie), it was a relief that i did not.  the only problem is that the flavor does not last as long as bubble gum or mint flavors.  but that might just be too much to hope for. 5
The candy itself was just okay.  The wrappers were terrible.  Very difficult to unwrap.  For that reason alone I would not buy them again. 3
the very first package i bought was good and flavorful but then I ordered a box which has 6 packages and was so exited to get them and thought they would taste the same  but noooooooooooo I was so wrong they tasted really like animal food I dont know why or what happened, now I have box of falafel that I cant eat. I will never buy it again. 1
Ordered malossol salmon caviar, received some orange mess in a regular green tin. Brave soul that I am - I have actually tried this nonsense. It does not come even close to resembling what a fresh, properly handled caviar should taste like. If I am still alive in 2 hours I guess you can call it "edible". 1
These are much better quality than the cheaper seeds I bought on another site. Originally, I had them on a six month subscription (a pound twice a year) but I've changed it to monthly. 5
As someone with nut allergy, I was so excited to try these!  I bought three from the local health food store after finding them on Amazon.  I didn't want to commit to a whole case before trying them.<br /><br />Although the package was sealed, the chocolate in each was hard and looked like it had fat bloom.  It didn't taste like real milk chocolate (the ingredients list it as a mixture of milk and white chocolates, which explains the taste).  The filling was very dry and not creamy at all.  My husband said it wasn't like Reese's cups.<br /><br />They were fun to try, but the quality was lacking quite a bit in my opinion.  I'd rather dip a chocolate bar in Sunbutter than buy these again. Maybe it was just a bad batch, but I was quite disappointed, especially considering the price. 3
I love this brand,  all kernels pop and they are a nice size, texture and flavor. 5
Wish they were stocked in stores but glad to be able to find them online. Not only food for white trash, they are low carb and make the perfect snack food. The aroma from the microwave during the cooking process is heavenly. Be sure to shake the bag per package direction. A must for the pork rind addict. After you try these, you will never go back to prepackaged rinds. 5
Worst toy ever!<br />-cheap plastic, not strong<br />-rope too thick prevents treats to fall out<br /><br />I have a super smart border collie and he got frustrated with that thing. Not because it's hard to understand how it works just because it's very hard to get the treats out even for me, even when he shakes it. The rope (too thick)prevents the treats from falling out.. and even when I removed the rope, the shape of the bottle makes it difficult as the kibbles roll inside but that's pretty much it, they barely ever get passed the neck. Which makes it a very expensive useless toy, I could have just use a small empty water bottle for no cost!!<br /><br />DO NOT RECOMMEND!<br />Try the kibble nibble instead, I have one and it's way better even if sometimes the treats fall out of it too easily. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005JU18S4">Busy Buddy Kibble Nibble Food and Treat Activity Ball</a> 1
This cereal I tried the other day and it was good.<br /><br />I think the Blueberries in it don't contribute to your health since I read:<br /><br />"According to a study in the March 15, 2009 journal Free Radical Biology & Medicine, ingesting blueberries with milk impairs the antioxidant properties of the blueberries. This is presumed by the study authors to be due to the affinity of blueberries antioxidant phenols for proteins."<br /><br />Also, for people who are concerned about GMOs, or "genetically modified organisms," - plants or animals created through the gene splicing techniques of biotechnology - The Kashi cerals that are Non-GMO are:<br /><br />Kashi Cinnamon Harvest, Autumn Wheat, Island Vanilla, Strawberry Fields, 7 Whole Grain Flakes, 7 Whole Grain Puffs and 7 Whole Grain Pilaf. 3
Wow! As soon as I poured some hot water over this instant drink mix, the smell of ginger was very noticeable. I thought the aroma was very pleasant and enjoyable. As for taste, you don't notice the lemon, but the ginger is very strong and packs a very strong spicy bite! If you love ginger, you will enjoy this drink, but if you dislike the taste of even a ginger snap cookie, steer clear.<br /><br />Although I liked this drink, I was disappointed with the nutritional information. Although it's all natural, 1 sachet equals 73 calories and contains 16 grams of sugar! That's a lot for a cup of tea! I'll stick with either Tazo Green Ginger Tea or The Mate Factor's Yerba Mate lemon ginger. You still get that ginger flavor without the added calories and sugar! 2
I love duck in just about any form, but this smoked DB is just way too salty. Tastes more like ham than duck. 2

This is ramen, a cheap, easy, and fast noodle meal that is pretty cheap. Its got its pros and cons, but mostly its pretty alright. The chicken flavor is good. Some people find it too salty, I like it as is. The price here on Amazon is comparable to some groceries when its not on sale, higher than others. Still, if you're like me and want to avoid the stores as much as possible, maybe paying a $1 more for 24 isn't such a big deal. Nutritionally its pretty meh. You could do a lot better. But its also a versatile base- you can always add lots of veggies, meat, other spices, pretty much anything to this to dress it up and make it a better meal option. We keep it in the house for quick lunches when no one wants to cook a meal just for themselves. 3
very little of either, green tea or honey. It's mostly sweetner, real and artificial, with a touch of tea power. I was really disappointed. 1
This has a very dark chocolate flavor that mixes quickly and smoothly in hot water. No chucks like most of the other brands. Milk chocolate is fine for those who enjoy that but for real chocolate lovers that enjoy the true flavor of dark chocolate, don't miss this. 5
When I was a child, my grandmother got some popcorn sent to her straight from the fields in Missouri.  It was white and SO tasty it didn't need butter or salt.  I've been on a search to find more ever since.<br /><br />This isn't it.<br /><br />The kernels are quite small but, worst of all, only about 40% of them pop.  That's a lot of "old maids" and makes this tuff pricey indeed.<br /><br />I contacted the seller with the issue; they told me to pop it at a lower microwave setting -- didn't help.<br /><br />I gave it 2 stars only because what did pop was OK-tasting.<br /><br />Keep looking... 2
Smells great, looks great and tastes great.  As a guy who likes strong espresso type coffee, I was surprised and impressed by the bold flavor with just a hint of Hazelnut.  With just a little half and half its great first thing in the morning. 5
This drink certainly has a nice and spicy ginger kick.  That made it interesting.  Other than that, it is honey sweetened.  I didn't notice the lemon flavor though - probably because I was too busy enjoying the ginger.  People that believe in that sort of thing think that ginger has some sort of curative effect.  I can't speak to that as I didn't have any ailments needing a cure.  Purely on conjecture, I think this drink would feel good on a sore throat.  I'd add whisky though.<br /><br />So, overall I found this to be an interesting drink but not one I'd push on friends, even if they're sick.  I have better recipes. 3
Sleepytime is a popular tea that has been around a long time due to its high quality. The natural flavors and ingredients have made it a required tea for the cupboard of persons interested in healthy eating for the last 30 years! The predominant flavors are of chamomile and spearmint--but the additional ingredients--including rose buds--create a satisfying, complex blend that is very tasty and soothing. Not only is Sleepytime caffeine-free but it contains herbs that are mildly relaxing and healing for the stomach. Drink this lovely tea before bed either with or without honey.<br /><br />Sleepytime contains chamomile, spearmint, lemongrass, tilia flowers, blackberry leaves, orange blossoms, hawthorne berries and rosebuds. The healing qualities of some the herbs in Sleepytime are listed below, however please note that there is insufficient quantities of each herb to have anything more than a very mild effect. Blackberry leaves, which are soothing to the stomach, contain tannins which provides a tea-like base for the flowery flavors of chamomile and rosebuds. Spearmint is one of the milder mints and is also useful to soothe tummy ache. Chamomile is a wonderful herb that has a relaxing effect; it also can be used to soothe tummy aches, headache, menstrual cramps and is a mild anti-fungal.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.<br /><br />Quote from the box:<br /><br />"Ultimately, the bond of all companionship, whether in marriage or friendship, is conversation."

bought two bags and at the time the details did not include the ingredients. says "naturally" not once but twice on the bag. am allergic to monosodium glutamate so this stuff might as well be guano. better-half ate half a bag and EVERY piece of it eaten was full of silverskin. 1
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000VMBDI">WILTON 13 PC GOLF SET 1306-7274</a><br /><br />I am very happy with this product I purchased this item for my collages retirement celebration. I have received numerous comments! WOW everyone wanted to know where I purchased these Items; of course I was proud to say amazon.com..... I would suggest my friends to Purchase this product from Wilton as the price is very cheap and the quality is very good... 5
My dogs love these, and I was giving them at least one a day.  Fortunately we were home the day my bulldog almost choked to death.  It was a very close call.  They are probably ok for small dogs, but big dogs tend to swallow the pieces, and that's where the problem is.  Watch out for this!!! 1
i love this coffee, it's my favorite however it doesn't come in decaf and i can only drink so much caffine without the side effects. please come out with decaf, we love coffee too. 3
I'm constantly looking for healthy dog treats that are not crazy expensive.  These are one of the better deals I could find when considering cost/ounce.  My Lab absolutely loves them and they are good for him too.  The treats are soft and moist, which is a plus for my dog.  They could easily be broken into smaller pieces, but I generally just give my dog a whole one when he does something good.  I wouldn't keep them in my pocket because they do smell a bit.  It's not an overly offensive smell, but strong enough that you don't want to carry it around with you all day.<br /><br />I definitely recommend these for all dogs. 5
I bought this along with the easy freeze ice cube trays for my two dogs. My vet put my lab on a diet so I have been looking for low calories treats to feed him for his evening snack. Each packet is only 30 calories and will fill one easy freeze ice cube tray (six large ice cubes for the extra large size). One packet will also fill my labs kongxl and my terriers Kong medium. They love it and make sure they lick their Kong's clean without getting bored with it. Overall a great snack! 5
Since I, like most people, suffer from dry skin in the winter, I decided to try an olive soap.  It does leave your skin squeeky clean with no soap scum residue.  The bar last a long time too. However, I still feel like I need to apply a moisturizer after.  I was hoping to eliminate that need. I may try Olivella's moisturizer.<br /><br />I would recommend this soap but you may want to consider adding the moisturizer to your cart too! 3
best coco water - plz bring back.<br />i've been drinking it for the last 3-4 years and this ONE [only 1 liter pack] is really the best.<br />unfortunatley, the manf. seems to have discontinued it - what a shame!<br />the small size product is not at all good - only this one.<br />hope this company gets some common sense and continues this product which was so good.<br />-------------------<br />ONE large - 5 stars<br />ONE small - 2 stars<br />ONE kids - 1 star<br />ZICO - upsets stomach - 2 stars<br />VitaCoco - tastes awful - 1 star<br />Bluemonkey - 3 stars<br />AmyBrian - 4 stars<br />C2O - 2 stars<br />naked - 2 stars<br />nirvana - 2 stars 5
I purchased a pack of 6 boxes of 33.8 ounce Vita Coco coconut water.  The package arrived fine.  I put 3 boxes in my refrigerator.  Boy, did they make a mess!  All 3 started leaking overnight.  My wife was not happy at all. I transferred the leaking packs to soda bottles.  I don't want to try putting the remaining 3 packs in the refrigerator and will transfer to soda bottles as well.  I wish I could get a refund, but there is no way to return now, and no easy way to contact the vendor.  This turned out to be a real pain! 1
Bigelow's Vanilla Caramel tea is delicious. It has a wonderful aroma. The flavor is delicate, soothing, and mellow. It is perfectly blended with the caramel and vanilla flavors. Makes for a very satisfying cup of tea, or a glass of iced tea. 4
For those who enjoy ginger, the Dundee preserves taste great on crackers and bread.  The texture allows for easy spreading, but it is not runny.  It also stays fresh if stored in the refrigerator. 5
Delicious!<br />Ideal to eat with fruit, and if you want to eat with some chips (is not too spicy) i like this very much 4
I order two (2) cases of cookies on the same Amazon order. A case of Ginger Snaps and case of Chocolate Cookies from another manufacture.  Both cases arrived quickly from Amazon.  But the ginger snaps had many bags where nearly the entire bag of cookies were broken up and in pieces.  The other case of cookies (Chocolate Chip) was perfect, Hardly any of them broken. 3
AMAZON SUCS TRIED TO EMAIL NO SUCCESS  STUCK WITH BROKEN LIGHT BULB<br />VERY POOR COMMUNICATION NO CUSTOMER SERVICE PHONE NUMBER AVAILABLE 1
Watch stores sales an you will get this item much cheaper. Cheaper in any store that sells cereal in the bags............ 3
This cat food was recommended by my vet because my 13 year old Cleo Cat was having trouble keeping any food down and was loosing weight.  It stopped her problems.  She doesn't eat as much as before since she seems to be more satisfied after eating which helps justify the added price.  It aids in digestion since the...ok sorry...smells are gone if ya know what I mean.  Had to add that so anyone experiencing problems with their cats can see there are a lot of benifits from this cat food. 5
I was able to use this Gluten free product and make it taste better than any restaurant by bringing the buttermilk to room temperature and separating the yokes from the whites and adding additional baking powder and baking soda to the recipe. I love it. Served with pure maple syrup brings it out of this world. 5
This is great plain or in a bowl with milk (and it didn't get soggy when I ate it as cereal).  More chocolate and berries would push this into a 5-star granola.  At first I thought my package was somehow missing the chocolate and berries because they'd all settled to the bottom and there weren't very many to begin with.  I was much happier with my second serving that included more of the perfectly sized mini-chocolate bars and the tiny bits of freeze-dried strawberries and raspberries.  I loved the flavor of the chocolate, but the berries weren't too noticeable given how small they were. 4
I love wintergreen Altoids, but I could not find them in any of the stores in which I shop, so I went on line.  I found their website and ordered thru Amazon.  I love Amazon, and even had a Gift card from my sister so I was able to use it to pay for these Altoids. THe whole<br />experience was smooth and easy. No problems. 5
I read the reviews of this dog food and everyone said their picky eating dog loved it. I have a miniature schnauzer who is 10 months old and he is a very picky eater! He was eating Nutro Max Lamb & Rice for puppies but started to show a little dis-interest in his food. I wanted to try something new and I chose this product. He did not like this food at all! I wouldn't buy it again, personally. The ingredients are good but my dog just didn't like it. 3
These are coarse, grainy and a poor substitute for the real thing.  I finally found Schar rolls which a cut in-half & toast. Excellent texture & taste! & their smaller size makes for good portion control. 2
There are some 30 cookies in the bag. Each of them is about as thin as a poker chip, maybe a bit thinner. Three of these skinny minnys make up 1 serving per the "nutrition facts" and have a whopping 140 calories of which 45 are fat. These cookies are as dry as the Gobi desert and cannot be ingested without some type of liquid. I used skim milk which, of course, added to the already substantial calorie count. There is supposedly fig and honey in these emaciated sized cookies but I could not detect either one. The cookies are edible so I have to give them a three. One serving was enough for me because of the high calorie count, especially the fat count. I gave the remainder to the mail lady who actually would benefit from a cheeseburger and a side of fries along with a chocolate shake. In the meantime, she will have to make do with the cookies and I expect a larger version of her to show up as soon as she finishes the rest of the cookies. 3
I like the convenience of having canned chicken on hand. It's great for soup or salad. However, I found the flavor of the Swanson's canned chicken to be good, however, the texture was so soft, it just seems to mush away into whatever you're making. My kids LOVE chicken salad, and they were so happy to see I had just made some. One taste and they were like, what's this? Why is it so soft, so mushy. I bought a dozen cans, so I have to finish them up and we will be eating mushy chicken salad for awhile. I don't recommend this product. 3
I chose a cherry flavor to test, because I like cherry tasting candy and beverages. I came home from work today tired, thirsty and ready for a break. I was happy to find The switch had arrived, and it was already nice and cold since it is a really cold day.<br /><br />I sat down with my laptop and my switch ready to take a break. I took a nice long drink and found that this tasted nothing like black cherry to me. I reminds me more of Robitussin cough medicine. Another flavor might be more tasty, but I won't be purchasing this product for myself. I will stick to the much for refreshing and flavorful IZZE beverage. 1
My wife and I have been using this unsweetened tea hot for years. great if your watching your sugar. Received this product in four days. One day earlier than ship date. My only issue was in the packaging. One of the bottles was broken and the inside was just lined with air bubble strips and no indication on the carton of fragile or glass enclosed. 4
I ordered Wolf Gang Puck's k cups, largely because of his reputation and my experiences at his restaurants, both of which are good. However, when I drank my first cup of the Breakfast Blend, I tasted no coffee...it was as if I was drinking hot water. I was very disappointed and will purchase only those k cups which I know to be good. Sorry Wolf Gang, this is a sleeper! 2
I'm not a proffessional chef or anything, but I've been quite happy with the product.  I recieved it in a few days - they were quick. 4
I received a sample of this from Influenster and was pretty excited to try it because it was an interesting concept.  I tasted it and thought it tasted just like banana bread.  It had an odd texture and seemed a bit dry though, which is why I rated it four out of five stars. 4
Great for making tapioca-like pudding with none of the carbs! I like to make chia gel and add that to iced teas and smoothies--the texture kind of reminds me of boba. It is a good source of omega-3s, magnesium, and calcium. Also, the combination of fiber and fat slows digestion and blunts blood sugar spikes. I will be buying this in bulk when I run out =) 5
We became acquainted with this mustard when we were in Switzerland and really enjoyed it. That was our reason for purchasing it. Great find!! We have liked this as much as the one that we bought in Europe! 5
Not Completely Organic.<br />Better bars out there that are 100% organic.<br />The chocolate can melt easily- so beware if you live in warm area.<br />Product contains ALFALFA- a controvercial ingredient as that it may aggravate Lupus and is a possible toxin. There are other companies who make bars without this ingredient for this very reason.<br /><br />Price is rather expensive for NON-100% organic. 1
Please ignore the one-star comments, if you check the bag the main ingredient IS in fact whole grain brown rice and the second is rice flower. With anything that is gluten free you have to add another "binder" which is where the corn flour comes in. For someone who has celiac disease and cannot have Sunchips, because they contain wheat (a key binder to any chip, cookie or cereal) this is an excellent product. My spouse and I buy these a lot because they are gluten free and absolutely delicious! 5
Very disappointing. I was expecting black olives. These taste like brown colored off flavor green olives. Never again. Should work ok in a salad but definatly not what I was expecting. 2
I (and my little guy) have loved almost all other happy baby products, but this was revolting.  On the up side, my dog loves it . . . 1
Let me start by saying that I really like these cookies. If you're going to give your child cookies, these are not so bad healthwise. However, the size leads you to believe that one bag contains a single serving, when it actually contains 2 servings at 120 calories each. That's a bit too many calories in a snack for a young child, I think. I buy snack packs so that when I'm on the go, I can open a bag and hand it to my kid. I don't feel that I can do that with these. 3
I usually make my own ginger-lemon tea, most often to keep colds at bay (as per the recommendation of Kimberly Snyder in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0373892322">The Beauty Detox Solution: Eat Your Way to Radiant Skin, Renewed Energy and the Body You've Always Wanted</a> (her immunity tea recipe is also available on her blog).<br /><br />I'm always looking for an on-the-go alternative to making the tea from scratch for the time when one is traveling and might not have the option of buying fresh ginger and fresh lemon, but at the time when one is more susceptible to a cold (lower immunity due to stress, jetlag, lack of sleep, etc.). Having to only add hot water definitely saves a lot of effort of tracking down the ingredients and time to actually peeling the ginger, squeezing the lemon, etc.<br /><br />I have tried the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SWB73C">Instant Ginger Honey Crystals Pack of 30 Bags - 18 g Sachets</a> and found those to be very heavy on the ginger. Comparatively, Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger & Lemon Beverage, which similarly comes packaged in a bag and needs to be mixed with water, doesn't taste overwhelmingly gingery.<br /><br />However, the Gold Kili product tastes incredibly sugary. It's the kind of drink that gets worse the more you try it. The first sip seems acceptable, the second seems iffy, and then before you know it, your body decided that it's a bit more sugar than you bargained for. I appreciate the fact that it's caffeine-free, but must it be overwhelmingly sweet to block the taste of ginger? 2
The Matcha came promptly.  There is plenty of it.  Those are the positives.<br />The color of the Matcha looks nothing like the photo.  It is a deeper,  darker more muted green.  It tastes similar to what it looks-muddy,  sort of like dirty,  grassy, water.<br />I have purchased much higher quality Matcha at very reasonable prices ($18.00 for 8oz.) in Japanese markets in NYC and L.A.  I purchased this to drink every morning and to use in cooking and frappuccinos.  So far,  it is best for frappuccinos where the flavor is enhanced with plenty of sugar and Mimic Cream (almond, cashew cream substitute).<br />I would not recommend this product.  Either spend more or keep looking.  Good luck! 1
These are great tasting, good quality cookies. But, they are packaged in cheap paper bags which offer no protection from damage. No matter where you buy them, you will most likely receive a bag full of broken cookies and crumbs.<br /><br />Campbell's Soup is the parent company of Pepperidge Farm and I have complained to them about their inadequate packaging many times and rather than improving the packaging, they just asked me to stop calling. Pepperidge Farm promised to send vouchers/coupons for replacement of the damaged cookies, but they never delivered on their promise. I was just told, "Don't call here anymore." 3
The Switch is marketed as "100% of what you want, 0% of what you don't"...meaning, the only things in the can are juice and carbonation. There is no added sugar, no corn syrup (high fructose or otherwise), no preservatives, no *artificial* colors ("natural" flavors and colors ARE added), and no gluten.<br /><br />The Orange-Tangerine flavor seemed to taste almost like carbonated Sunny Delight - according to the label, the juice flavors are apple, grape, tangerine, orange and acerola. It was quite tasty and had just the right amount of carbonation - almost like a soda that has been opened and left to sit for just a few minutes to let some of the excess gas escape. It was light and, dare I say, refreshing. For what it is marketed to be, it does quite well.<br /><br />The only downside is that I could probably do something similar at home - buy some Sunny D and add some sparkling water or seltzer, and it would probably be cheaper. However, if you're out-and-about and need something light, tasty and not loaded full of extra nonsense, then this would certainly fit the bill. 4
Gals, this Hadaki travel organizer is GREAT!  Perfect size and wonderful quality.  I use 2 -  one for my makeup and one for my toiletries.  Having 2 separate one's allows for me to keep things separate and make any last minute adjustments to my carry-on luggage in case my suitcase is over 50 lbs!  If all your toiletries (shampoos, body washes, lotions, etc.) are together with your makeup, you can't carry them on (liquids & gels over 2 oz).  It rolls up, but holds alot and has a nice, sturdy metal hanger hook so you can hang them on the back of the hotel bathroom doors.  These Hadaki cases are made with fabulous quality and I love them!  So will you. 5
It's flavor is okay, I was hoping for more of a spicy cardamon and clove flavor. 3
I can't really leave a fair review on this product because Im not sure if it worked or not. I paired it with Mother's Milk Tea and didn't see any results, but that could just be my own body. 3
I love liquor-filled chocolates.  I received these as a gift and found the gel-like liquor not to be very strong.  It was almost as if the liquor had been cut with sweet syrup and all the alcohol cooked out. A young child wouldn't even get a buzz from these.  The chocolate itself was OK -- better than Hershey's and Nestle but not as good as Godiva or Lindt. 2
Finally a great and easy GF option for pancakes, waffles, biscuits, etc from Bisquick!! Both of my kids have Celiac and absolutley LOVE this stuff.  Wish the container was bigger. But we're just happy to have better tasting options for breakfast now. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you.  Can't taste a difference, but the rest of the family uses the cheaper stuff. 5
I wish I had read that these are made in China before I bought them.  They are going in the trash - lesson learned. 1
I didn't pay as much attention as I should have regarding the volume.  I often see the larger cans at the speciality stores and foolishly assumed that was what I was buying.  I have never seen these smaller cans at the store.<br />But, my own fault for not getting up from the desk and looking in my own pantry to see how much 34 ounces exactly is!  Fine olive oil, I suppose.  Not sure that the price is competitive, however.  Will go back to Trader Joe's for such things. 3
These cookies are small, grainy and very crunchy with an awful aftertaste. And very expensive for such a small package of 16 cookies. Might be great for multiple allergies, But I was very disappointed. 2
I have two cats. One refused to eat this brand outright and the other eats it begrudgingly. Although it's a great value for natural ingredients, it's not worth the money as I had to throw out the leftovers every day. 2
i purchased the giant gummy bear on a stick for the Girlfriend, on valentines day.  Apperance wise she loved it, but as soon as she was done eating the bears ears, she stopped. Being sweet and polite she told me she was full, but i bought this knowing she loves gummy bears and i finally got it out of her, that it had a bad aftertaste.  Thank god i didnt buy the 5lb one, otherwise i would be writing letters to president giant gummy bear.  All and all i don't regret buying it, because just the look on the loved ones face when they first see the giant blob of high fructose corn syrup and sugar is worth it! 2
A friend of mine was sweet enough to buy these for me when she discovered them in a tiny market, and I'm still very grateful to her for being willing to buy them (expensive pasta!) without knowing if they were any good or not.<br /><br />Even my favourite spaghetti sauce could not hide the pasty, wet-dog odour this pasta gives off -- and the "flavour"? Forget it. Directions followed to a T, but this stuff just isn't worth it. No one at the table liked this stuff. Another disappointing gluten free pasta; don't waste your money. 1
My husband really likes seaseme chips so I ordered 12 packages, however I only got a 11 packages and all were crushed. This was a very bad job packing box and shipping. I won't order again. 2
My aunt has twelve dogs at her huge hilltop property.  Over the years, I've grown to love the dogs like my own.  This new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002LANN56">Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food 4.5 Pound Bag</a> was worth sampling.<br /><br />Likes:<br />>Our dogs are not picky eaters; six are adopted/strays so they're more than happy just to have food.  We fed this product to the eight adult (over 12 months old) dogs and they didn't hesitate to gobble it down.<br />>Top on the ingredients list is: Beef!<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />>This sample bag is much appreciated but the price is much higher @$2.20/lb. than the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005UL5PL8">Triumph Natural Lamb Meal And Rice Formula Dry Dog Food 40-lb bag</a>$0.97/lb. that we normally purchase.<br />>There's a whole gamut of soy products, corn gluten products, artificial flavors and colorings that are not recommended by our vet.<br /><br />Overall:<br />Nicely concocted food that our dogs like to eat but filled with questionable ingredients that may not be beneficial for our dogs in the long term. 3
I have ordered my Pop Chips from Amazon for months. The last boxful was nasty. My whole family agreed and we threw them out. They tasted old and rancid. I wrote this to Amazon and never heard a word back about it. I just cancelled my regular delivery. 1
Tasting a dab of this on a fingertip wasn't too pleasing: it felt too rich, too fake, and too underspiced (basically thousand island dressing with a slight aftertaste of chipotle).<br /><br />So I tried adding it to some food, and in most cases I couldn't even tell it was in there - with the exception that my burrito made orange drips on the plate.<br /><br />I'm sure I could get more of a taste profile (and more orange drips) if I added a LOT more of the sauce to my food...but that would boost the calorie count unacceptably. All in all, Taco Bell might do well to change the name from "Bold & Creamy" to "Bland & Fatty." 2
I am enjoying the use of this item.  It is good quality mayo and I use it with my tuna. 3
I generally don't like any salad dressings, but this is wonderful!  My husband even uses it on veggies.  It is light and a little runny (like vinagrette).  The taste is wonderful - the sesame is not overpowering, nor is the miso.  (I love soy and sesame, but not usually the miso taste, but this dressing is perfect.)  If you are looking for something new to try, definitely give this one a chance. 5
First, I expected this to be like dry jerky.  This was wet and soggy with a spongy texture.  There is something so off putting about the flavor, it's like wet dog food.  The first bite seemed okay, but I could not finish it even though it was small.  Regretfully, I decided to buy this anyway based on the reviews... I read all the one star reviews and thought "Heyyyy now, it can't be that bad! These people must be clueless. they must be expecting it to taste like real jerky, of course it's not!"  I was soooo wrong. 1
Good product, but $4 a box? I can get this size for $2.50 tops at my local Target or supermarket. What's the deal? 1
This product was a big disappointment.  The picture on the box is misleading.  These bars aren't chunky, the dough isn't flaky (more like cardboardy), they aren't filled with pieces of fruit, and if you didn't read the label (which claims about 30 items down the ingredient list that "yogurt powder" is added), you wouldn't have any idea you were eating yogurt at all.  The bars probably contain MSGs, with all of the "natural flavorings," etc.  Whatever calcium and other vitamins might be present have probably been added in what the ingredients list calls a "vitamin blend" -- there's too little food in the bar to give you much nutrition, anyway.  The experience is very much like eating a long, thin fig bar -- only not as tasty.  The fig bars I buy at my neighborhood grocery contain sugar, but also real fruit, whole wheat, no MSGs, and no trans fats. I'd rather eat one of them. I won't be purchasing this product again. 1
Well, once again a great product has been cheapened in the name of "American taste".  I find it hard to believe that anyone would prefer this "new" recipe that Lindt is using for its Chocolate sold in the USA.  I should of known something was up because I noticed that the Lindt bars were on sale for far too long at the supermarket.  That is often a sign of a product being cheapened some time after an acquisition from a conglomerate or private equity company; Kettle chips come to mind.<br /><br />Those who were previously in charge of marketing and merchandising Lindt bars in the USA had to know that their market was a little more upscale and refined than those who consume a Hershey or a Reeses.  I bet some new (American) management got involved.  That "market taste test" someone referred to is mostly BS; they already knew that Americans in general have unsophisticated child like tastes, that pander to the overly sweet, artificial and creamy.  Sweet artificial and creamy pretty much sums up American food with the exception of meats.  However in the case of meats sweet artificial sauces and fake smoke flavor abound for "dipping"; Americans love their finger dipping food!  Coming off the diatribe, it is clear that Lindt is now more interested in competing with Hershey for the taste of the "average joe".  After all it costs less to produce chocolate for their taste.  So the gamble is this; will they profit more by making a cheaper bar and competing against Hershey for the taste of Joe average or by keeping their quality high and catering to those who know better?  American management is notorious for pursuing the "quick money", and I know this is a pretty audacious assumption but i bet that Lindt hired on a few Americans to run local manufacturing / Marketing and this change is being conducted at their behest.  Short term, these American managers look good (the quick win) because they lowered their cost basis by decreasing production cost.  Long term, American management mostly moved on and Lindt is now a cheapened brand that just barely survives (in the USA) competing with the likes of Hershey.  We shall see, but I will not buy another Lindt product while Stateside.<br /><br />Can anyone advise of an alternative European dark chocolate bar (70-90%) that is reasonably priced and available in the States.  My favorite bar,  Neuhaus is very expensive and limited in terms of availability. 1
I wanted desperately to love, or even like this drink mix, but am not having success doing so. I love mint tea but this tastes all green tea to me. It's too strong a green and too weak a mint flavor for me to enjoy it. Every once in a while I'll try to tolerate a bottle again hoping I change my taste. It's not gross and so clearly is appealing to some people. 2
Ernie, my pooch, LOVES these treats.  He'll do trick or command just to get his Zuke!<br />Seriously, these things will make your dog do anything....so, buy two bags! 5
These cashews have a definite kick to them. They are spicy and would be perfect with an ice cold beer on a hot summer day. The container keeps them fresh. These nuts are highly recommended. 4
REALLY ENJOY THE 'SNAPPY GINGER' TASTE IN MI-DEL GLUTEN-FREE GINGER SNAPS.<br />THIS CASE SEEMED TO ONLY HAVE ABOUT 5-8 WHOLE, IN TACT COOKIES IN EACH PACKAGE.  THEY WERE MOSTLY GINGER SNAP CRUMBS!<br />I HAVE ORDERED THESE GLUTEN-FREE COOKIES OFTEN AND THE MOSTLY CRUMBS WAS A FIRST.  I HAVE BEEN PLEASED WITH OTHER MI-DEL GLUTEN-FREE COOKIES I HAVE ORDERED IN THE PAST.<br />HAVEN'T DECIDED IF I WILL ORDER A CASE OF THEM AGAIN. 3
NOTE: This review is based several uses. I don't use hair conditioner very often because it weighs down my hair, but I thought I would be fair and give this product a try.<br /><br />At first, the smell of the product coming through the bottle was strong and overly sweet. What surprised me was that it actually has a pleasant, not overpowering smell once you squeeze it out of the bottle.<br /><br />As for the cons, the texture is thick and feels like heavy lotion. This worried me, because as I mentioned before, certain conditioners weigh my hair down. I used a dime sized amount and coated the top and bottom parts of my hair with the product, then rinsed thoroughly. However, when I tried to dry my hair, I realized it still felt heavy with conditioner. I had to rinse for a few more minutes before I could try to dry and style again. A week later, I tried again, unfortunately to the same results.<br /><br />I can see how this can benefit other users. This conditioner, however, is definitely not for me. 3
NO FEAR, as energy supplements go, is okay. Based on one can, it seemed to provide enough caffeine to fuel my typical Saturday, although a busy workday would have been a better test. (Alas, the Vine program only provides one can, so I couldn't compare.)<br /><br />It has a nice, fruity flavor, with little aftertaste. The carbonation seemed a little weak, which gives it a sort of "watered-down" feel.<br /><br />Like other energy drinks, NO FEAR contains taurine, an essential amino acid for felines which they get from their carnivorous diets. (In cats, a deficiency can cause blindness.) As for its health benefits in humans, the jury is still out. I'm not convinced it has any particular benefit, except that listing it as an ingredient probably increases sales.<br /><br />I only mention that because NO FEAR and other emergy-drink products tout themselves as "health" drinks, but that's not necessarilly true. If you buy NO FEAR, do so because of its caffeine content. NO FEAR contains about 83 mgs of caffeine per 8 ounces, which is more than Pepsi Max (69 mg) but less than a typical cup of coffee (110 mg) or black tea. NO FEAR is certainly an option if you don't like the taste of coffee or you just prefer cold, fizzy drinks.<br /><br />But maybe an extra dose of taurine in the morning will hone your catlike reflexes and allow you to attack your day like a leopard taking down a gazelle!<br /><br />Right before your six-hour nap. 3
Stash Tea Company Cranberry Pomegranate<br />Price: >$4 ordered in a 3 pack less than $10 (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0046KO7JA">Stash Tea Company Autumn Teas Trio Gift Set, 3-Ounce</a> + Free Shipping)<br /><br />Caff-O-Meter: 0mg<br /><br />Ingredients: Hibiscus; Rooibos; Cranberry Flavor; Pomegranate Flavor<br /><br />Received this as part of a 3 pack of teas for the holidays (Cinnamon Vanilla, Pumpkin Spice and Cranberry Pomegranate).<br /><br />-Smell (2) - The smell is not strong, but it is present. I am not a big fan of the smell of cranberry so that may be why the score is low, if you enjoy that smell you may be surprised.<br /><br />-Taste<br /><br />+Unsweetened:<br />++Hot (1) - Flavor is very bland, if not for the smell I would think I was drinking hot water with the tiniest bit of flavoring.<br />++Iced (1.5) - Tastes a bit better over ice. but a bit thinned down<br />*I prefer my teas Iced and 1 cup to .5 packet of sweetener. So unless it wows me, without sweetener will always be lower in points so to compensate I add .5 points to the unsweetened taste average.<br /><br />-Sweetened<br />++Hot (2.5)- Adding the sweetener (1 pkg of truvia) bring out the flavors a bit more, again I'm not a fan of the flavors so that is apparent in this review but the sweetener definitely improves the flavor.<br />++Iced (3.5) -  Better over ice! The flavor is definitely brought out more by the sweetener, would certainly take this over a sugar laden ocean spray cranberry cocktail or something of that nature. I could even see using this as a mixer in some adult beverages the taste is there for it.<br /><br />-2nd Steep (2.5) - When the tea was steeping the second time I was concerned I was in for further disappointment, the color is certainly lighter but the flavor is about the same level.  I always rate this to see how economical a tea is.<br /><br />Summary - My typical everyday go-to iced tea is a blend of hibiscus (for the BP lowering qualities and taste), and other flavors, and I am on a rooibos kick as of late. However as previously stated, I do not typically like the flavors of cranberry and/or pomegranate therefore I would not ordinarily be attracted to this flavor to begin with and am only drinking it because it was included with my order. I will certainly finish the box, but I would not buy it again. If you enjoy the flavor of pomegranate and or cranberry you will most likely enjoy it, and I would certainly not discourage you from it.<br /><br />I have many other tea reviews so keep checking back. To get a better idea of whether or not we have similar tastes in teas check out my profile (I used to actually hate tea). 2
Yikes!  What was I thinking when I ordered 12 cans of this  stuff?  The food pantry may be getting some.<br /><br />It tastes like.....well, I can't use the words I'd like to.<br />Let's just say that it has no character at all...no distinct taste....if yu blinded yourself and then drank the coffee, I don't know if you'd even know it was coffee!<br /><br />I use just more than the amount suggessted;..;...doesn't help. 2
I like this product because it is low in calories and it  produces a smooth PB of good quality, if you follow the instructions.<br /><br />However, it is not as tasty as any other peanut butter, especially the commercial ones such as Jiff, Skippy, etc. And it does not satiate you in the same way, since it doesn't have the fat.<br /><br />I happen to like natural PB and this one tends to resemble their taste. I will conyinue to buy it for what it is and despite the price. 3
We received a gift box that contained the Stonewall Farms Pancake Mix and they were out of this world. They are the lightest, fluffy and flavorful pancakes and waffles you will ever taste.  And the price on Amazon is a big savings over ordering from Stonewall Farms.  Don't shy away from the larger size and the two pack because you will devour these pancakes in no time. 5
I have loved Starburst candies for many years. My favorites are the Fave Reds. I tried Flavor Morphs today. To me, they have a kinda generic taste, not committing to anything in particular. I guess that's the point. I don't like the little beads because in some of them, they crunch when you chew - don't like that texture. I'll stick to my Fave Reds. 3
They're called "Whenever bars", but one would probably do best to reserve these for dessert. With that being said, these delicious little treats are packaged individually and are portable enough to go anywhere. And so, in that sense, they can be eaten "whenever". They are also advertised as gluten-free and wheat-free, as well as having 0 grams of trans fats.  But these bars are by no means going to make it into The Evolution Diet. They are by any standard artificially extreme foods. They are artificially extreme, and, at the same time, extremely delicious. Just run off the extra fat tomorrow, and you'll be all right. 5
Great, high- protein snack without meat.  I would give it 5 starts if it were not so sweet. 4
My Maltese absolutely LOVES anything that Exclusively Pets makes. But if you really want to train your pet, give him or her a cheese treat! The greatest thing about their products is that they smell exactly like whatever the package says. The cheese treats smell like Cheez It! The carob cookie treats smell like chocolate chip cookies... So forth and so on. I used to buy these locally but saved buying them online. 5
I have a 5 year old boy and 3 year old girl.  I mixed it with water.  The girl refused to drink it after one taste.  The boy drank a little, but didn't want to finish.  He then tried it with apple juice, but just couldn't enjoy it.  My wife and I tried it and didn't like it either, so I can't blame the kids.  This stuff doesn't dissolve completely either, so it looks like your drink is full of sand (I swirled diligently).  I don't know what I'm going to add this stuff to so that it doesn't go to waste.  Also, as another reviewer mentioned, the can is half empty, which I think is deceptive marketing. 2
Mediocre "health" drink as it is...but at this price?????  This is mental when the same thing in Japan is about $0.50-0.80 per can.  The most expensive available was of course on Amazon Japan at about $150 per can.  Save your money and buy something local. Basically you are drinking curry powder, so yeah...if people are insane enough to believe this has serious health or energy benefits, then I'm sure the price also seems reasonable to those people. 1
I enjoy Bigelow's Green Teas (especially the Green Tea with Peach as noted in one of my other reviews).  I enjoy this tea as well.  When steeped properly, it has a delicate flavor with hints of pomegranate and acai but not overpowering.  It is not nearly as strong, in my opinion, as Bigelow's Green Tea (original flavor) but delivers a wonderful organic option that I enjoy almost daily (trading on & off with my Bigelow Green Tea w/ Peach).  Subscribe & Save delivery once again makes this an affordable and worthwhile purchase.<br /><br />I highly recommend to any lovers of green teas, herbal teas, and/or organic teas. 4
Good with lots of ginger spice-  although some find it to be a bit much. People like it 4
I used the CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Strong Lengths Nourishing Shampoo and Conditioner for a week.  This shampoo is made for people with long hair, so I wanted to try it.  The smell is very clean, and the shampoo isn't all watery like a lot of other shampoos.  The first day I love how it makes my hair look.  It gives my hair a volume it doesn't usually have, but by day 2 my hair is flat and oily.  This shampoo and conditioner may work better for you, they just didn't work with my hair and scalp. 3
This particular brand and blend of Green Mountain coffee is one of the best I have ever tasted or enjoyed.  Its got a nice body, is NOT bitter, and goes down very smoothly.  Would recommend to any coffee drinkers for their morning fix to get moving. 5
***<br /><br />It's a struggle to devise a way to review this product in a way that makes it interesting to read.  The bars are as advertised (although they were smaller than I expected.<br /><br />Cocoa shows up pretty far down the list of ingredients, although it's difficult to tell exactly how far because there's a mistake in that list, which is that there's an opening parenthesis with no closing parenthesis.<br /><br />Not very interesting so far, right?<br /><br />Well, OK, I can also tell you that when I fully opened up one of the Mylar pouches and laid it on the floor, my cat did eventually lick off the teeny amounts of chocolate that were stuck to it.  He's named Bently Geene because he was born with a tail that's permanently bent into a Z shape, but while that's mildly interesting it has nothing to do with Kellogg's Special K Granola Bar, Chocolate and Peanut Butter, 4.76-Ounce (Pack of 6).<br /><br />I guess what I'm getting at is that this product just isn't all that interesting.  It doesn't disappoint, but it doesn't surprise.  The tastes and textures are acceptable but no more.<br /><br />As has become my practice in Vine reviews, I have tested whether this product performs well in uses for which it was not intended.  As an example, if you spin up one of these bars in a food processor and rub the resulting substance deeply into both sides of your $10 rib-eye steak before searing it, you'll have wasted one otherwise perfectly good $10 rib-eye steak, not to mention one 60% perfect granola bar.<br /><br />And you know how when you want to mark your place in a book you can either dog-ear the page, which I was taught in grade school never to do, or insert a bookmark?  Well, you CAN use one of these bars as a bookmark, but according to a rather stern email I received yesterday from the people at the Johnson County Library you shouldn't.<br /><br />And you know how sometimes in jail you don't have any cigarettes to trade?  Well, according to my experience I calculate these bars to be worth approximately five cigarettes each.  I don't know how other granola bars compare.<br /><br />Finally, if you find yourself training my dog, PheyeG'hdeaux, (pronounced Fido, of course) in the finer points of Fetch, you should use something like a tennis ball or a plush toy.  I don't know about your dog, but with mine if you throw a little chunk of Kellogg's Special K Granola Bar, Chocolate and Peanut Butter, 4.76-Ounce (Pack of 6) and say, "Fetch," he will perform the first half of the procedure perfectly correctly every time, which is to run up to the object to be fetched and take it in his mouth.  Where he falls down EVERY SINGLE TIME SO FAR with these granola bar chunks is in the second half of the procedure, which is where he's supposed to run back to me and deliver the fetched object.  What he does with a tennis ball is just that: He returns it to me in his mouth.  But what he does with chunks of granola bar is to eat them up right there on the spot, which is pretty much the opposite of what I'm shooting for.  Now, your idea of Fetch might be different from mine, but as I see it it's really the second half of the procedure that makes the first half make sense.  Well, anyway, you might regard PheyeG'hdeaux's behavior as an endorsement of these bars' taste, but what we're talking about here is a dog that, if given the chance, will happily eat Bently Geene's poop.<br /><br />On that note I give three stars.<br /><br />*** 3
This is the first coffee machine that I've owned and wasn't dragged over by a family member.  I do enjoy it and have been using it since I got it without any of the issues that I've seen in the reviews here like the scaling problem.  I do pretty much only use water run through a filter in it, I felt the need to say that.  The unit works like a charm, my only complaint is that I wish this model gave you more control over the size of the cup, instead of the strength.  It makes about 3/4 a cup or just under, and it's always a crapshoot if I'm filling a travel mug.  Other than that, I love it and would recommend this as an entry level coffee maker. 4
I had tried Green Mountain Sumatra Reserve and found it delicious and strong. It's not available on "subscribe and save" so I read the reviews and opted for Wolfgang Puck. My husband likes it and I like the flavour but it's very weak in comparison to the Green Mountain. I have to order something else for me. 3
I ordered this product and when it came the steamer wasn't working, so I returned and bought another one. It was working good until 45 days. It broke, didn't want to start and the steamer wasn't going more than 10 min. So that's it I am returning (again) and now getting another brand. 2
Since learning my husband has celiac disease, he hasn't been able to eat pizza with us on homemade pizza nights. It used to be a treat. So I was excited when I first tried the bread mix thinking he could enjoy pizza again. However, the dough never seems to bake throughout; it always turns out gummy. We've tried letting it rise even longer than the hour recommended, even that didn't help. I still have a few bags left so I'm going to try something other than pizza. 2
I thought broccoli and peas are good for my baby, but pears seem to be the most ingredient. It tastes sweety. I don't hope my daughter has a sweet tooth. BTW, the package edges may be not safe as teether. 3
The pricing is quite a bit higher than in the grocery stores.  It is not available in all stores, but I have found it conveniently enough for my purposes. 2
My dogs LOVE the taste of this PB Stuff 'N Paste and I like and appreciate the convenience of being able to add PB to their Kongs with no mess whatsoever. That being said, I went through an entire can of this stuff way too fast. The label says it's concentrated and to use it sparingly, so I did. The problem is, if you have large dogs like I have, you will probably go through a can of this in less than two weeks. It's too expensive for me so I'm back to using real PB in their Kongs. 3
Caribbean Joy coconut milk offers a tempting price, lower than its competitors.  There's a good reason for its low price: by all accounts it tastes like half the visible amount is coconut milk, the rest being water.<br />Neither good for pina coladas or cooking, this is a poor value and I can't recommend it to anyone. 1
I eat these all the time as a meal replacement/snack. They're pretty good - I enjoy the taste and you can't beat the convenience. I'd recommend them to people. 4
The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WHPNI0">Bertolli Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Super Value Size, 51-Ounce Bottle</a> is a nice product.  The taste is definitely great and this oil is much more flavorful than the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WHR2MU">Bertolli Extra Light Olive Oil, Super Value Size, 51-Ounce Bottle</a>.  Extra virgin olive oil is much tastier for salads or simple recipes than the light olive oil.<br /><br />Of course you have to make sure you are getting the proper oil for your needs and recipes.  Sometimes the light olive oil is called for by certain recipes.  Some people also need to use *light* for health reasons. Olive oil is generally considered to be healthy so those people should be the exception.<br /><br />The other thing to keep in mind is the price.  This is one of those products where it really pays to subscribe.  It's on the expensive side anyway, but subscribing makes it more bearable.<br /><br />You can never have too much high quality olive oil when you love to cook.  This stuff gets used quickly.  So even though it's a nice sized bottle don't be afraid to subscribe!<br /><br />Enjoy! 4
Months ago I had my first butternut squash soup, hand made at a fancy restaurant. I do not like canned soups... but I saw this in our local grocers, and remembering the soup I had at the restaurant, I decided to try it. It was delicious! It is my favorite lunch go-to now. I have added shredded roasted turkey to make it heartier, but as for taste it is wonderful. I order the case on Amazon, which is cheaper than my local store. I also tried their french onion soup which is really good. I have avoided the others simply because in their best form, I don't like chicken noodles and tomato soups, but for the 2 I do like and have tried, they really made something from canned soups, and I'd recommend them. 5
It can do the job but doesn't have the real fresh taste of Parmesan. Some additives that prevent the grated cheese to stick, make it taste floury. 2
My doggie always ate his food in one gulp and then let out a HUGE burp after eating because he gulped too fast! Now he is eating MUCH slower because he has to work for it.  Product is new, so we have to help him still, but this turns it into an interactive play toy rather than a feeder. He never gets frustrated with it because it is fun for him to drag it around by the rope. Durable, fun for him, easy to fill, but I did think it is a little pricey.<br />Now if only I can get him to drink his water slower... 4
I love the taste and the gentle crunch of Popcorners, but the Butter flavor has lots of whey, salt and other ingredients that over do the really lovely taste of the "chip."  I'm one of those people who don't do well with Whey and if you are too, consider the sea salt version which is my favorite.  They are less salty, and contain only corn, oil and sea salt, no extra additives.<br /><br />What I do love completely, is the size of this little bag. It's perfect for a snack, great for a car trip, and just the right amount. And the cost is just over $.40 per bag for a healthy yummy snack.<br /><br />If Whey's not an issue for you, you will probably enjoy the taste of the Buttered version as it is very close to the taste of movie theater buttered popcorn. 3
My dog absolutely loves these and she is very picky however I am returning them due to the numorous recent cases of illnesses and deaths occurring from chicken treats that have been manufactured in China.<br />It is NOT worth the risk to me, sadly to say I will have to find another brand. 1
These almonds are nothing short of incredible- they are so delicious! If you are trying to follow a low-carb lifestyle (for dietary reasons or weight loss) and need a 'sweet fix' after meals, then this is a wonderful option - only 6 g. Net carbs! And the taste is so yummy! They are just sweet enough! I'm so glad that amazon sells them in bulk, because I could easily go through one container in a week! 5
I'm not sure any of these can be considered "good" tasting, but I like the Lemon-Lime better than the other flavors.  Helps to keep them cold, of course, but sometimes you just have to plug your nose and down it.  It works for me, but I don't use them on a regular basis.  I mostly just have some on-hand for those slow, dragging days when I knew I needed to get something done.  Decided buying in bulk on Amazon was better than paying gas station prices. 4
we don't let our children drink caffenated beverages - or soda that has plain sucrose (sugar) in it, in large quantitie -<br />so Knudsen's spritzers are perfect - fruit juice and sparkling water - what could be simpler.  And the flavor variety is great -<br />different than standard juices - they like almost all of them.<br />However, on a unit basis, this is expensive juice.  where cans of soda can be purchase in bulk below 20c per 12 ounce can - Knudsen is getting about<br />$1 per 10.4 ounce can.  So on the value side, a bit tough to swallow (pun intended).  Knudsen used to sell 12 ounce cans, and they were actually less expensive,<br />but they discontinued them....  I guess they wanted to make more money. 4
The following ages in our household tried these "french fry" sticks: 44, 37, 18, 10, 5 and none particularly liked them.  They were just very bland and did not really taste very potato-like to us.  The 17 year old thought they tasted like potato and pepper and liked them. 2
To me, these are nothing like the regular Altoids and are not breath mints. They are pleasant-tasting little candies in a cute convenient tin, and that's as far as it goes. The mintiness is just not strong, and the wintergreens are definitely weaker than the peppermint minis. I'm not a dragon-breath person, but still, one of these mints is too small to have any effect on my breath. Four or five will freshen my breath for a short while - maybe 15 minutes. At this point, I think the Icebreakers Frost mints are the best as sugar free breath mints. 1
These chips are awesome. The light airy texture makes them a pleasant snack. I am dieting and thesse fit in reall nice. Gives me that salty, crunchy yummy taste that keeps my points low for the day. I love them. I have recommended them to all my diet buddies and they love them. I haven't tried all the flavors yet, only those in the variety pack but trust me I will be tracking them all down and hopefully find my favorite. That may be difficult they are all so good!!! 5
I'm on long-term antibiotics and found that regular coffee triggered reflux and other GI problems - so I've switched to decaf - found the Gevalia decaf T-discs at Bed, Bath and Beyond but they are rather pricey and I don't like to go shopping - so using Subscribe and Save, these are a lot cheaper and are delivered to my door -<br /><br />I make a cup of this every morning and have half with my oatmeal and then mid-morning, have a snack and finish my cup - just right! 4
The packet of these seeds that I received must have been old because I don't believe even 10% of them grew. I tried some several times in soil and water and only got a few sprigs of grass. I garden regularly (I live in Florida) so it's not that I don't know how, and I even followed the instructions to the letter, but they did not grow. 1
We used to eat these pancakes every week with fruit instead of syrup. We have introduced our friends to these. Amazing that such health and flavor could come from a complete pancake mix.<br /><br />Unfortunately it seems that Kellog's now owns Krusteaz and they changed the recipe approximately in Fall 2011. Here are some of the changes:<br /><br />- Sugar almost doubled.<br />- Fat up by 33%.<br />- Salt up by 8%.<br /><br />Hmm, so much for my tasty healthy alternative. Seems like there were plenty of to-sweet pancakes available on the market that appeal to children.<br /><br />The new recipe mix currently says "Improved Taste" on the package. I wish I could find a source for the old recipe and buy enough to last to the use-by date. There does not seem to be any way to ask Amazon sellers details like this about what they are selling.<br /><br />The new recipe is still the best tasting pancake mix that we can find, but how can you want that much sugar in something you are going to pour syrup over? We are looking for an alternative. 4
I gave this item one star due to the flavorless quality of this drink.  I have not used this product before, just went on the product name...usually very good. 1
Every person I try to pawn one of these drinks off on has one sip and the rest is thrown away.<br /><br />I bought a 12 pack of each flavor two months ago... still have 10 left in each pack.<br /><br />The coconut water from concentrate in New Zico is bad for me. It gave me and my girlfriend heart burn.<br /><br />Natural coconut water is better than concentrate. 1
I really enjoy this hot chocolate with a little fat free half & half for creaminess. Being that I am not a coffee drinker these k cups offer a nice change from tea. The local stores sell this as well but it's half the amount of cups and almost the same price. Buy from Amazon. 5
package arrived on time but pieces broken and chocolate melted. Price was twice as high as at Costco (too high).  Dissapointed with product. 3
I've been looking for a new extra bold coffee to replace the Timothy's Midnight Magic that I really liked.  This is not it.  I've tried to like it, but it has a bitter and unpleasant flavor to it.  I'm shopping for another brand again. 2
Love this product! I am a huge fan of Quaker's Oatmeal to Go bars. These are comparable. They are a bit smaller but do contain more nuts and other ingredients. They are delicious warmed up and a great breakfast on the go or a mid-day snack. 4
These cardamom pods were very fresh and aromatic.  I have been keeping them in a ziploc bag to keep them fresh.  The amount and quality of cardamom you get from this seller is excellent.  I would highly recommend, as I could not find green pods in stores! 5
I have always trusted the "Newman's Own" brand.  From popcorn to salad dressings, I have never been disappointed in one of their products.  Until now.  Each dog treat is scored to break it easy and is of similar size to a fig newton about 2" X 1-1/4 inch and quite thick - about 1/2 inch. And hard as a rock.  I am all for organic products, but when my dogs don't care for them, it's not like I can bribe them to eat it like I can with kids.  Our dogs are around 15-20 pounds and I think these dog treats are a little bit too hard for them.  The first time we tried to feet these treats to them they turned up their noses. They were absolutely NOT interested at all.  The next time we tried they carried them around in their mouths for a minute or so, and decided, for some reason, that they were inedible.  However, the third try must have been when they were REALLY hungry because they appeared more interested. But this is more like rawhide than a "treat". Our dogs really had to work on this for a long time. Our younger dog, a Shih Tzu did okay and after about 15 minutes was making headway on eating it.  Our elderly Japanese Chin who is 14 (that's 98 in dog years) was  much more fussy.  She seemed interested for awhile and even though she still has all her teeth, she just couldn't be enticed to do much more than sniff it. Perhaps a larger dog would like these better. I haven't given up on "Newman's Own" brand but I doubt that I'll try their New Zealand Ranch Style Dog Biscuits (made with lamb and barley)again. 1
I thought this would be an interesting combo to introduce to my daughter but I've learned that it's hard to convince an 11-mo to eat curry. She doesn't hate it but I can't get her to eat this like the other flavors. Maybe I'll try again when she's older but for now this is not a hit. 3
I found this cold coffee beverage to be pleasant. It has a full-bodied coffee aroma, and a nice smooth coffee flavor. There are fifty calories worth of sweetener in it, meaning it is a sweetened coffee, but only mildly so. I enjoyed it over ice. As it comes in the can, it is a straight sweetened coffee beverage with no cream. It is enjoyable as it is, though I enjoyed it most with a bit of milk added and over ice. It contains 155 mg of caffeine (a can of Mountain Dew contains 54 mg and Red Bull contains 80 mg, by comparison), so it could serve as an "energy drink." It's not fresh-brewed coffee, but if you have a taste for chilled coffee beverages and are turned off by the overly sweetened varieties that are usually available cold, this one may be worth a try. It is expensive, though, and it seems overpriced for what you get. Though the flavor is good, I think I will settle for a cheaper alternative. It doesn't live up to a good cold-press coffee in my estimation. 4
The Bees were perfect, however there were only 12 on each card as opposed to the 16 advertised - this left us quite short on our project:( 1
This is the second flavor from Izze I have tried.  The first was the Clementine.  Tasty and not syrupy I really enjoyed the flavor.  I tried the Blackberry.  Unlike the Clementine flavor the name of the drink also makes up one of the juices used to make the beverage, blackberry.  Like the Clementine a cocktail of juices from concentrate are added like Apple Juice and Lemon Juice to give a balanced flavor.<br /><br />This is not a drink to hydrate in quantity so much as a tasty pick me up.  The drink does not have caffeine or added sugars so I don't feel bad about drinking it.  It isn't overly sweet so it adds a bit of energy rather then making me tired.<br /><br />90 calories for just over 8 ounces is starting to get up there for me.  That is enough calories that I at least have to think about when I drink the beverage.  A great drink, a good company and thumbs up in my book.  The only issue I had is the calories. 4
If you are looking for mild ginger flavored snaps...these are not it.  If you however, enjoy a very strong ginger taste, give these a try. 1
This is a convenient gift for drop in guest or just a small thank you for neighbors.  It always seems to be appreciated to give a box of this tea 4
This is a great snack to have instead of potato chips. Lower in calories but still delicious. Will be ordering them again. 5
These are handy if you are trying to low-carb and miss your pasta fix. They aren't exactly like traditional pasta, naturally, but for us they do fill the void. 3
As someone on a low sodium diet I have to make many types of food which most people buy, such as applesauce,bread, ricotta,and granola. I think these bars-and other Larabar flavors- taste 'chemical' to the point that they verge on artificial, despite being haled as all natural.  "Natural" does not equal tasty,and it often means nothing important. Besides tasting better,I wish the sodium levels were more readable - and lower.Sure fat,sugar and protein are all important,but more people die of cardiac disease and hypertension -linked to high sodium in the diet- than from lack of protein. 1
These Grove Square Hot Cocoa flavors are by far the best tasting we have found for the Keurig. We took a chance on these due to the high review ratings and it was a pleasant surprise that all three flavors are really good.<br /><br />Dark Chocolate - My favorite, very good even on the "large" cup setting<br />Milk Chocolate - Excellent on the "small" cup and good on the "large" cup setting<br />Peppermint - Everyone likes this one, on either cup size setting<br /><br />These do contain Sucralose in addition to sugar, I don't notice the taste but my wife does (but she still likes them).<br /><br />Highly Recommended! We tried these in the smaller variety pack, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005K4Q64K">Grove Square Hot Cocoa Cups Variety Pack, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers, 12-Count (Pack of 3)</a><br /><br />CFH 5
smokehouse almonds are great but i just can't take all of the salt so i rub some of the salt off of them and then i go to town, if they sold lightly salted ones i would probably not only be addicted but broke as well from eating them so much love love love this product and will buy again. 4
Honey Dijon flavor: okay flavor, but both my girlfriend and I thought they left a bad aftertaste. The aftertaste is sort of like old cheese (presumably some folks like this... I'm not a fancy cheese eater), and it lingers for at least an hour. I'd give this flavor a rating of 2 stars out of 5.<br /><br />We have also tried the NY Cheddar flavor (4 stars), which we both liked better, and they didn't leave any long-lingering or bad aftertaste.<br /><br />I'd give the consistency of the chips 4 stars. The chips are crunchy, but also greasy enough that I keep a napkin near or wash my hands after eating Kettle Chips. 3
The bottle was much smaller then I expected. The gum itself is OK, but too small and way too expensive for my plebeian tastes. Think I'll stick with sugarless gum. I wouldn't buy this again. 3
the  quality of royal canin is outstanding, and thr price from this vendor saved us more money that if we had purchased locally! 2
I was getting VERY worried, when I read some of the other reviews here.  Specifically, the "One Star" reviews, to which I always go, to see if the faults these other reviewers find with any merchandise would prevent me from buying it.<br /><br />WOW!  They sure seemed to hate the KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE 9-OUNCE BAGS, (PACK OF 12), that I had bought as 1 ounce bags, liked A LOT, decided to subscribe....and then, for good measure, got 2 orders of the 9 ounce bags.<br /><br />Yes...I love potato chips....especially these KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE FLAVOUR....but others seemed to really HATE them...or at least, hate how they had changed.<br />But then I realized they were talking about OTHER FLAVOURS!  Amazon, in it's deep wisdom, has obviously seen fit to put ALL comments concerning ALL flavours of KETTLE, (and other brands of?????) potato chips, TOGETHER!<br /><br />Of course, this DOES have SOME advantages, because most potato-chip lovers, (like me!), enjoy eating several flavour, and brand varieties.  So, comparisons can be made easily.  Also, as we're all potato-chip lovers, but each person has his or her very favourite flavour that they are reviewing, we are, here a sort of "United Nations of Potato Chip Lovers"....all different, but all united in our love of Potato Chips!  (The rest of the world can REALLY benefit from the example of our tightly-knit, but ever...er,...expanding...group here, I think! : )  But -- not at first realizing that these<br />different flavour reviews were all together, did cause me a little confusion and dismay.... at least to begin with.... (Amazon should have mentioned that this is the "Kettle Potato Chip Review Forum"! : )<br /><br />I am happy to report that KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBEQUE FLAVOUR, are totally delicious!  (At least they are in the one-ounce bags...hopefully the same product in the 9 ounce bags will taste the same!)  These are definitely chips for ADULTS, however -- and/or children whose stronger-than-adult taste buds can withstand the very strong flavour of these chips.  They are NOT the strongest flavour I have ever had...that was from a jalapeno pepper chip which was far too strong for even me!<br />These Backyard Barbeque chips by Kettle, however, have just the right amount of sweetness, (with honey powder, onion and sugar), to take the edge of the stonger flavours<br />(paprika, chili pepper, cayenne pepper, and natural smoke flavour), of which there is less, (they come further down in the list of ingredients than the sweeteners.)<br /><br />The complete list of ingredients of these KETTLE BACKYARD BARBECUE CHIPS, (in the 1-ounce bags, and hopefully, in the 9 ounce bags as well), is as follows:<br /><br />Potatoes<br />Vegetable Oil, (Safflower and Sunflower Oil),<br />Honey Powder, (Dried cane sugar, honey),<br />Rice Powder<br />Sugar<br />Salt<br />Onion Powder<br />Tomato Powder<br />Paprika<br />Torula Yeast<br />Garlic Powder<br />Chili Pepper<br />Citric Acid<br />Cayenne Pepper<br />Paprika Oleoresin, (Colour)<br />Natural Smoke Flavour<br /><br />Naturally cooked, natural ingredients.  The combination is a true taste treat!<br /><br />Of course, as with all ptato chips, moderation is the key.<br />Potatoes contain a LOT of potassium....which gives energy and othr good things....but too much of which can damage kindneys.  The vegetable oil is great -- but too much oil, (as well as too much starch, from the potatoes), can hurt the eyes.  Natural smoke flavour is SO yummy....but it, (as well as sugar), has -- in very large amounts -- been linked to cancer production<br /><br />As far as the starch from the potatoes and oil go, this<br />can be ameliorated, (a bit), by drinking TEA...which is good for the eyes.  But as far as the potassium, (energy - good, too much -- bad for the kidneys), and the sugar and natural smoke flavour, (too much leading to cancer production) -- the only thing is to do what is good in everything.....M O D E R A T I O N...!<br /><br />Twice or three times a month, I allow myself to go on what I call a "Potato Chip Diet".  I eat only one large bag, (or the equivalent in small ones), of potato chips all day.  I supplement this with tea, coffee, and lemonade, as well as several servings of Carnation Instant Breakfast Essentials, (I like the Dark Chocolate flavour)  This adds up to fewer calories than I would normally eat, if I had my normal three meals a day plus snacks.  It also teaches me to eat s-l-o-w-l-y, because that one big bag, (or many little bags), never lasts as long as I'd like.  Anyway, with excercise and sensible eating, the rest of the month, (and keeping my scale nearby, and weighing myself at least twice a day, every day), I've taken off ten pounds in the last three months! : )<br /><br />These BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips from KETTLE,<br />are totally scrumptious.  Except for those jalapino chips, (which tasted good, but were far too spicy for my own taste buds), I have yet to meet a potato chip I didn't like to eat.  These Kettle BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips, with their combination of potatoes, sweetness, and spices, have truly become one of my top five favourites....if not the VERY first favourite, of all!<br /><br />Flavoured potato PERFECTION! 5
I buy these with subscribe and save.  I like the flavor and aroma.  Going on month two and I am not tired of them yet! 5
Why should humans get all the good stuff? I love the simple, organic ingredients in these treats. Newman's Own is a wonderful brand in that regard, so it's nice to see that they've moved into pet foods as well.<br /><br />Because of the hardness of the treats, I'd say that they're best suited to bigger dogs. I'm a little nervous to offer them to small dogs or older dogs with more fragile teeth and jaws... they have no "give" at all and don't break apart easily (which is why they need to be scored in half). But they do seem to go over well, and it's nice to be able to feel good about what you feed your dogs. 5
i found this Nescafe 3 in 1 Regular Instant Coffee 30 Sticks (600g) in my local farmes market selling it for $7.99 1
Just received my order of 2 boxes of 10 podz each. I bought Columbian Supremo. I have a Senseo pod coffee maker.<br /><br />When I put my first podz in the Senseo, I thought "Gee the podz looks a little small". I was right. The podz was too small to be pressed tight so some of the hot water bypassed the podz. I could see right away that it was coming out weak.<br /><br />I don't give up easily. I put the second podz in a make-your-own plastic pod container. I had to stuff it in a little but it fit and sealed well so all the hot water went through the coffee podz instead of bypassing it. The coffee came out much stronger by sight.<br /><br />Now for a review of the taste which is obviously very subjective. First I should say that I like strong coffee (ever since a trip to Europe several years ago). Strangely, I do not particularly like Starbucks coffee because it seems bitter to my taste. Judging by the millions of Starbucks devotees my taste preference is not in the majority. Well if you like Starbucks you will probably like the podz flavor. It seems a little bitter. Now of course this is only one flavor so I don't know about other flavors.<br /><br />If the vendor is monitoring this review, he/she should change the podz description to qualify which coffee makers can use these podz. 3
I have been drinking fine tea for a few years now. I have a couple of favorite Assams that I have enjoyed for some time. Both are graded TGFOP and both are superb: filled with body, complex flavor, malty. But over the years I have become concerned about pesticides used in foods. I have chosen to use as many organic food products as I reasonably can. I recently tried this Stash Premium Organic Assam Tea.<br /><br />This is a very good tea. The pouch is filled with quality loose leaf product. My uneducated guess would be an approximate grade of FOP or perhaps TGFOP.<br /><br />The taste is basic, unadorned Assam. Malty and full of body. It is not as complex as teas from the finest plantations. By complex, think of colors. This tea flavor has maybe one or two colors, where a complex tea from a fine plantation might have 3, 4, or more flavors you can distinctly identify.<br /><br />Still, at a fair price and with an organic grade, this will be a regular choice at my house in the future.<br /><br />I would prefer to see an organic tea packaged in a non-plastic pouch though. 4
I recently paid $4.80 for a 4-pack (same size packs, same product). The product is pretty good... kind of a dal-sort-of-thing, but I cannot see forking over such $$$ here for it. Look elsewhere! 1
I specifically bought this set due to the description saying there were Drambuie filled chocolates. Being as that is a favorite of a good friend of mine, and I will be at his house for thanksgiving. It was very disappointing to find that the actual assortment varies. I also bought a separate assortment with Malibu, just to find that it was already in this one.<br /><br />Now I will have to mail sellers and ask them what assortment they have prior to ordering, as silly as that sounds. I tried mailing JollyCandy and politely explaining my misfortune. I asked if I could buy a second box possibly with a different assortment, including Drambuie. They only took the time to send back a very rehearsed list of what their assortment was, referring to me as "Dear Customer", and not even taking the time to apologize or even acknowledge my question. I guess since I wasn't "Mad", there was no reason for consolation.<br /><br />As for the actual chocolates inside, they are pretty good, as good or better then I remember them a few years ago. 3
I'm a big fan of coffee, so this beverage piqued my interest.  I have tried Starbucks drinks both at Starbucks coffee shops and from the supermarket.  I like them.  This drink is not as sweet.  It seems there's just enough sugar to take the bitter edge off.  When ice is added it makes a refreshing enough warm weather beverage, though I have tasted better.  What the product has going for it is convenience.  The 6.8-ounce cans are easy to store in the refrigerator and can be taken out and drunk quickly.  No process of first making iced coffee.  That's a definite plus.  It is not as satisfying at room temperature.<br /><br />The flavor, apart from being strong, is harsh to the taste and does not provide the satisfaction that a Starbucks or other espresso drinks in a can/bottle do.  As a pick-me-up, the drink is appropriate, since its hefty dose of caffeine will give the drinker an infusion of energy.  Compared to other similar drinks on the market, sugar content is low (which accounts for its bitterness).<br /><br />For those averse to caffeine or those who have trouble sleeping if they drink too much brewed coffee, this beverage is a no-no.  These days, many folks have cut down on caffeine intake, so this product might be counterproductive to weaning oneself from addictive caffeine. 2
These cookies have a great, lemony taste.  The only bad thing was that they're thin and many of them were broken. 3
I started out thinking they were OK, a little more substance than the breakfast bar from Whole Foods.  But after I ordered a 12-pack (I didn't realize it was 12 boxes of 8), and had eaten them for a couple of weeks as I was flying out the door, I realized they were not really very tasty and kind of dry. 3
This is my wife's absolute favorite Earl Grey.  Me, I find that while the Bergamot flavor is nice, I like a tea base that is a bit brisker. 4
This is neither fancy, nor a feast, it is indeed a mockery of all things cat food.<br /><br />I am disappointed, sir.  Disappointed indeed. 3
All 3 flavor packs are very tasty and low calories.  They travel well & are not crumbly like some of their competitors.  I would buy this again. 4
I have been making pumpkin pies and other treats for years.  And I have noticed how over the years that Libbys Pumpkin has become less and less dense, no doubt to keep the pricing and profit margins at a certain point.  The problem is that I have to adjust my recipes so that the mix isn't so liquid.  I have also complained to Libbys to no avail -- they simply issue the typical corporate lie as if they're responding to a first time user. 3
This is nutricious, I guess; but certainly easy to stick in the microwave.  The flavor is fine; but I think a bit bland, and a bit dry.  Better to add something to it.<br /><br />I'll add bits of left-over meat or maybe a little canned chicken.  Then some sort of sauce, ranging from soy to sweet & sour or teriyaki.  Use your imagination; but I think you'll be happier using this as a starting point.<br /><br />Then you have a very nice lunch, prepared on a good and easy rice base. 4
This is a very neat gift for someone you know that is into cooking and eating.  It has a wide variety of exotic salt represented in the collection.<br /><br />There is a surprising amount of salt in the collection.  In other words, each tube holds about as much salt as would fill a small salt shaker. 5
Apparently Chef Michael is not a real person, it is supposed to reflect the care Purina put into it's ingredients.  Looking at the food, it is not much different looking than Beneful. It has pieces of "tender" sirloin, which is tender by dog good standards.  It also has pieces of "potato and green bean" kibble.  Sounds like they are eating better than I do.  Looking closer at the ingredients there is a lot of soybean meal, ground corn, and corn by-products.  It contains 28% proteins, which is a lot higher than Kibbles N Bits and slightly more than Beneful.  However, the price is also higher.  I don't think the higher price is really worth it.  If you are concerned about what your dog eats, you are going to want to find a product with real ingredients and less filler.  I have had dogs for years and am not terribly concerned about it, so I stick with Beneful.  It is the most nutritious in the affordable price range. 3
Pomegranate makes for an excellent aromatic in this tea, but unfortunately it does nothing for the taste as the combined flavors of Green Tea and Pomegranate make this tea taste like bubble gum that has already had its flavor chewed out of it. I still drink it, but will do so only until I can find a local seller of Green Tea with either Mango or Peach. 3
I have no idea if this tastes like the real thing (I'm going to guess no), but it is very tasty.  It's easy to make and is filling.  Most instant noodles are either too bland or too spicey for me, but this has a perfectly seasoned broth.  The noodles are firm without being too tough like some of the Annie Chun soup bowls.  I really liked the huge pieces of green onion in it as well.  Good product and my new favorite flavor.<br /><br />Huge downside?  1940mg of sodium per bowl, which is more sodium then you need in day never mind one meal.  Ouch.  The bowl has 2 servings and rounds out at 440 calories.  Not something you want to eat very often.  I really want to buy them again until I read the label.  It's too bad, but it's not something I'll eat again. 3
These are very colorful but not the best tasting. I used them for my sons first bday as we were having a very large party and didn't want to buy 20 mini cans but taste wise the quality was not there....the look was great. I'm sure no one knew any better after all frosting fixes all. 2
I found out about this product a year ago when I began training for an ironman. The long training days and intense interval work was beating my body down. I needed something I could take that would help get me ready for the next day's training. I have had nothing but great experiences since incorporating this into my workout regime. Vanilla Core Power reminds me of soft serve ice cream! 5
I had read the reviews and so I ordered the Good Seasons Caesar Dressing.  I was really disappointed that it didn't taste at all like Caesar dressing.  I do remember reading that one person said that he/she didn't think it tasted like Caesar, but with all the good reviews, I took a chance.  I am just as disappinted in all bottled "Caesar" dressings as well as in the many recipe's I've tried.  Wish this had been "the" dressing, but sadly, it wasn't. 2
The cans are listed as 13 fluid ounces each, but I measured and each can was 12 ounces or less.  Since you have to have equal parts water and formula, I had to carefully measure each can.  Each can was different.  The formula itself worked fine, but it was misleading as to how much I was actually getting for the price.  The already mixed formula is much cheaper per ounce than this or even the powder. 2
Didn't care for it. Color is wrong, doesn't have the flavor. Tastes almost as if it were watered down, or, maybe, birch beer lite. Gonna have to try a different brand. I had pretty high hopes, too, as Pa. is the state where I first was exposed to birch beer. Can't recommend this brand. On the off chance that someone reads my reviews, I will sing loud praises when I find one to my taste. 1
Not hot at all. Like the other low star reviewer, I got suckered by seeing 'habenero' in the name and the 12 oz size. Some people might like the flavor, citrus-y and it has some fish sauce in the mix (according to the ingredient label), but if you're looking for hot this ain't it 1
I thought these would be a little bit more like potato chips, but they are small bite-sized bits.  That is totally fine, but they weren't particularly GOOD.  I think they have more of a rice-cake consistancy than a potato chip consistancy.  The taste is a little weird too.  If I eat too many of them they make my stomach upset.  UGH. 2
I love a cup of decaf to enjoy in the evening with a sweet treat. Why should I spend a lot of money to enjoy my decaf cup of joe? I love getting two shipped at once- stores great in my freezer to keep the coffee fresh and delicious tasting since I don't drink my decaf everyday. Thanks Amazon for a great deal on my coffee! 4
I recently purchased for the first time a kefir product.<br />It was a lowfat cultured milk with peach.<br />I was extremely disappointed. Being from Argentina and used to drink "drinkable yogurt" of the finest quality, I had waited for years to find a liter-sized drinkable yogurt. I think I will have to keep waiting.<br />Yogurt was extremely acidic.<br />The quality is good but the taste is not. 2
I was excited to get some new treats for my cat. When I had the package in front of her she was rubbing all aganist it so I was hoping she would like them. I gave one to her whole at first and she ignored it. I thought the treat may be too big for her since they were a bit bigger than silver dollars so I broke it up and put it in her food dish with some of her food. She basically ate all her food but ignored the pieces of the treat.<br /><br />I do like that there is nothing artificial in these treats. The box states that what is contained in the treats include: chicken, turkey, turkey liver, turkey heart, pumpkinseeds, apples, carrots, ground chicken bone, butternut squash, ground flaxseeds, montmorillonite clay, broccoli, lettuce, spinach, dried kelp, apple cider, vinegar, parsley, honey, salmon oil, olive oil, mixed tocopherols with citric acid, rosemary, blueberries, alfalfa sprouts, persimmons, inulin, sage, and clove. However, even if it is all natural, if the cat won't eat it, it does me no good.<br /><br />I know all cats and dogs are different so some will like the treats. However for me, I will not be buying these in the future. 2
hello found betetr tasteing popcorn with butter flavor half cost at [...] rojos popcorn kits. when you get them for only 19.00 8oz 24 pack kits they have smaller kits too each and very cheap shipping fast recieveing much better taseing kits i actually fell that im in the threater with these kits and i even ordered 5 boxes more of 24 packs i enjoy them so much 3
I generally like my food spicy, but these noodles are just too hot for me.  So much so that it takes away from the taste.  Unless you really, really, really like spicy hot food food, these may be too much for you. 3
no visible package damage, As each bag was opened, small pieces of broken chips. Yes, they did taste okay to eat. 2
I have no complaint about the product itself. I likely would have rated it very good had it not been subjected excessive heat somewhere along, before it arrived. Although I ate them, each one was sticking to the wrapper and<br />difficult to eat without sticky deposits on my face and hands. 3
Have used Paul Prudhomme's Seafood Seasoning for many years. Although I have tried others, nothing compares to this one. I have used it only on fish. 5
The crunch is out of this world. I always have to pre-apologize to my office mates when I have these for lunch.  They don't mind, but I do when they smack/crunch too loud - I digress.<br /><br />These are one of my favorite items my Kay's.  They don't have an aftertaste, maintain there crunch factor and are just plain good. The sweetness is not overpowering and the protein content helps to fill me up.<br /><br />They are a main staple as a treat and/or lunch addition. 5
Outstanding!  DElicious!  What on earth are these things? Simple. They're a yummy mix of nuggets made from organic popcorn and organic dry roasted soybeans. They're so delicious your head may actually explode once you taste them. Slightly Unsalted, but majorly addictive, these crunchy snacks are good for you. 5
We bought the "small" toy with the rubber rope for our 19 lb mutt who gets very whiny when he's bored. I must say it's the best treat dispensing toy we've given him. It's way less noisy than the Buster Cube and the same amount of treats/kibble lasts longer. Other treat dispensing toys have gotten chewed up quickly and this one hasn't. Benji is an easy keeper and doesn't need much food. If we put his morning ration of 1/4 cup of kibble in the tug-a-jug it takes him about 40 minutes to get it all out and by that time he's panting with exertion.<br /><br />I do *not* recommend this toy for use on bare floors if you are there to supervise as you probably should be. The jug itself is very hard plastic and Benji could care less about manipulating the "rope" to get the treats out: he simply throws the jug around until food comes out. If I were to give him this toy in our kitchen the noise would drive me crazy. On our carpeted living room floor the noise is tolerable.<br /><br />The only distraction that works better is a bully stick which of course is silent but they are expensive and I don't like to use them every day. Alternating them with the tug-a-jug has given us some peace and quiet. Altogether a good investment in our situation. 4
POD is a generic word, and nothing in the description said that it was for Senseo machines. I'm glad it works for Senseo because it sure doesn't work in my espresso (Starbucks) machine. 1
We've had this door for over a year and a half now, and it has worked well the whole time.  It's a bit noisy; not too bad, but I wouldn't want to be trying to sleep too near it.  Also, be aware that a six foot man can get through the opening.  We had paramedics come to the house with an incorrect address for a call.  Our dogs happily escorted one of them to the door, it opened, and he was able to crawl in and look for the victim. Otherwise, the door is locked from the outside and it would take considerable noise and effort to get it open.  Anyway, I'd buy this again.  I'll write a separate review for the collars/receivers, but the short version is, don't bother with the (even) more expensive version. 4
The fragrance is strong and floral - lovely.  The tea is dark golden brown  and much more like a fermented Oolong than green tea.  I didn't like it at first, because it lacks the gentle subtlety of the blend of green and jasmine.  It's almost like an afternoon tea with jasmine added.  Over time, this tea has grown on me, and I like that it is a bit stronger than a typical jasmine green.  However, when I want that delicate flavored, I look for something else, even the Bigelow (and I'm not a great Bigelow fan). 3
Specifically they love this flavor.  I've taught them to do tricks using these treats because the cats want them so much that if they can figure out what I'm asking, they do it to get the treat!  But they are smart boys.<br /><br />I don't like some other treats because they are as small as kibble.  These are big enough for me to hold between two finger tips while the cats take them.<br /><br />My cats ask for these each night around treat time.  One of my cats eats dry food almost exclusively (no canned food, no meat scraps, etc) and he is often the first to ask for these treats. 4
I rather enjoy mexican hot chocolate and am used to getting the thicker ground Ibarra style version.  The ingredients are quality and it makes a good drink appreciated by guests but unfortunately is not exactly what I wanted. 4
My girlfriend (Ash) and I have never made Gingerbread Houses before. After checking out the reviews for the various houses we settled on this one. It was shipped promptly, so we set out to make an amazing house (while watching holiday movies). The first thing we noticed was a corner of one of the walls had broken off. This was easily fixed by smearing some icing on the edges. It held well and you could not even tell that it was broken. The key is letting the icing dry long enough, so it acts like glue.<br /><br />Constructing the house was not too hard. We let it sit and then we started to ice the roof. This was hard. The instructions say to cut a 1/4 inch hole in the bag of the icing, but this is too big. It made gobs of icing go on the roof. Ash ended up having to use her fingers to smooth the icing out. We could not outline the windows, and we did not achieve the thin spray of icing the picture shows on the box. This is the one thing that prevented me from giving this kit five stars.<br /><br />The frosting tastes great. The candy does too and it is plentiful minus peppermints. We are still eating candy pieces. They stuck well to the house thanks to the frosting. The Gingerbread tasted good for Gingerbread. We aren't huge fans of it, though, which is something we discovered after attempting to eat a house.<br /><br />We had a lot of fun making this house. I outlined the process (with pictures) on my blog here:<br />[...]<br /><br />You can see how easy it was for us to construct our house.<br /><br />Overall, we were quite pleased with our experience and plan to continue the tradition of making a Gingerbread House next year. This kit is great for beginners, so long as you cut a smaller hole in the icing bag. 4
I like this coffee.  It's much better than instant.  I keep some packs in my desk for those long afternoons and I also started carrying them when I go camping.  If I can go wthout another cup of instant coffee from a jar, I'll be happy. 5
The initial taste does hint of black cherry, but then the apple and grape juice filler comes to fore and dominates the after-taste.  It has a slight metallic taste and is not very pleasant.  The carbonation offers no benefit in the taste or feel category.  The price is high - about $1 per 8 oz can.  If I want juice, I'll stick with real juice without the carbonation. 1
My cats won't eat it.  I have kept it out for two weeks and they would starve before they ate enough to survive. 1
I've tried several other brands of roasted salted almonds available via the Internet and in stores.  The Blue Diamond brand is definitely the best tasting of all. 5
I am originally from Russia and my husband is from Argentina. Both of us didn't like this brand at all - it didn't get that consistency that Russian buckwheat has.  These groats come out like mashed potato. It is too light color. I tried to roast it - I got it a little brownish but the taste didn't come back. Who has tried buckwheat from Eastern Europe (Ukraine, Russia, Belorussia) would know that buckwheat has nice smell - before you cook it and after. This one smelled strange.<br />After I cooked whole package and we didn't like it - our dogs didn't want to eat it too. I had to add their soft food so they would eat.<br />Probably it makes a big difference how buckwheat was raised and where. Also how it was processed. Something is missing in this one. Still looking for Russian product.<br />By the way, some my friends who tried it the first time liked it a lot. So it could be good for you also if you don't know the best. 2
First, let me state that I brew most of my tea in a gaiwan, hence, I use loose leaf tea.<br /><br />White tea is one of my favorites so I'm always on the lookout for a nicely priced Bai Mudan.<br /><br />As much as I love Bai Hao Yinzhen, I just cannot afford to drink it exclusively due to the volume of white tea I drink.<br /><br />I thought this was a pretty good price and when I opened it up it didn't look too bad either.  Much to my surprise, after taking the first layer off the top (I transfer my tea to good tea tins) it was nearly all powder/dust with hardly any intact leaves.  This is extremely problematic if you don't use any filters or screens (like me).  I don't mind when some tea leaves get in my tea and it is pretty much normal if you don't pour through a screen, however, this was so broken up that it was just unworkable.<br /><br />I have only opened one bag at this point so there is a chance that it was just that bag or possibly even a bad batch but at this point I most likely won't be ordering it again.<br /><br />That being said, the whole leaves that were there (on the top) looked fine.  It does have a bit of a green tea taste (vs some other high quality white tea I am used to), however, it isn't bad or anything.  Definitely drinkable on a regular basis if the bag wasn't mostly powder.<br /><br />I took a couple pics so I will post them...keep in mind this came in two pouches, I poured into tins and that is where I took the pictures (the product does not actually come in tins). 2
I had bought similar treats for my dogs in the past and they loved them.  But these came individually wrapped in plastic which permeated the chew with a plastic smell (and I assume flavor).  My dogs won't touch them.  Don't waste your money. 1
Great, high- protein snack without meat.  I would give it 5 starts if it were not so sweet. 4
Sell me more! These things are the perfect breakfast. No, they are just perfect. Better price then the local grocery store and better selection. 5
Just Sweet, no flavoring that I could taste. While not expensive for what it is supposed to be, real expensive to use as sugar syrup.<br />Guess I'll stay with Carnation flavored creamer. Altho I really don't like to give Nestle anything. 1
We have been using this "cheese sauce" mix for several years.  I make a pretty decent Mac and Cheese with it.  Considering we are allergic to all things dairy, this is as close as we get to something cheese-like, so I am not complaining. I add more soy milk and soy margarine....and it has no cholesterol... So, if you can eat real cheese, enjoy. For those of us who cannot, this fills the gap. 4
- Obviously the beef is not prime rib as the name "Jack Links Prime Rib Beef Tender Cuts" suggests.<br />- It's salty, contains MSG and doesn't taste as good as the steak nuggets.<br />- The smell is too strong, especially its  "natural smoke flavor" ; eating in a room is not recommended. 3
I normally feed my dog a semi-premium brand called 4Health which I get through Tractor Supply Co stores and my dogs love that food. It's the usual "boring" food, all the same shape and color, little round brown balls. So when I opened this bag of Chef Michael's and put some in their bowl they loved it! After all this is a change, but is it a good change? Like other reviewers I'm not impressed with the ingredient list. For the price it seems like there are far too many fillers in the food. And the food is a bit "moist" and in my experience working in a pet store dog food with moisture can easily start to bread mold and other bacteria. I'm not saying this bag had mold but it's a concern I have. My dogs did like this food, it's a nice treat for them but I think I'll stick with my current brand. Sure I'm paying about 25% more per bag when matching pound for pound but the food I feed them now doesn't contain the fillers, doesn't contain the coloring and doesn't have moisture built into it which creates some worry but also creates more weight so all in all it's less food when you consider it. Plus in my house my dogs don't do well with moist foods. It creates a mess on the back end if you know what I mean.<br /><br />I would pass on this, it's ok for the occasional treat or change if you want to mix it up a little bit (ensure you do so responsibly so you don't get your dogs sick), but I wouldn't make this a daily food for them. 2
This sauce was no where near as hot as it claims. Tried this sauce along with Dave's ultimate insanity sauce and Dave's was way hotter then this huge let down. Was very disappointed with the low quality of heat it didn't have. 1
I love Eight O'Clock Coffee.  It is a good value and the coffee is delicious.  The flavor is rich, full, and consistent.  I sometimes try other coffee but I always come back to Eight O'Clock and it's always delicious when I return.  My husband is a convert too (quite a change for a guy who used to love Dunkin' Donuts' coffee).  We prefer the French roast (I like my coffee strong and dark).  We haven't found Eight O'Clock in California so I'm really thankful that Amazon sells it. 4
first time that i received this item with no fizz,still tasted good,but i like the fizz.hopefuly next one will have the sparkling 2
I was hoping the pears would mask the spinach and peas flavor, but it does not and my daughter doesn't care for it. 3
I have been very pleased with this variety pack of baby food. The pack contains three each of pears, peaches oatmeal banana, apples and apricots, and peaches bananas and raspberries. My 6 1/2 month old daughter loves all of them, especially the peaches bananas and raspberries! I have been very satisfied with Earth's best with one exception. The metal lids have a lining that contains BPA (as do ALL lids on glass babyfood jars), so if you're set on staying away from BPA, you'll want to get your baby food from companies that make pouches, like HappyBaby and Plum Organics. I make a lot of my own babyfood, so I feel that feeding her SOME food from glass jars is acceptable, especially for varieties that I can't make. I do also buy a lot of HappyBaby, and I'm very satisfied with the quality there also. All in all though, a very nice variety of good tasting fruits! 5
This pasta is good but a bit on the bland side. It is very filling and cooks very well. One package goes a long way. I like corn pasta better, however. But if you have a wheat allergy like I do check this pasta out. 4
There is a reason orville made it big... big kernels are easy and fun to eat.  small lady finger kernels aren't.  the popcorn tastes great, pops good, and I don't get any husks in my teeth.  The problem is that because the kernels are so small it is almost a chore to eat. 2
I bought this on a whim because I found some jam made by the same company and absolutely loved it. I didn't expect much more than basic waffle and pancake mix. This is so much better.<br /><br />It's easy to use and makes moist, fluffy pancakes that are to die for. I am never buying Bisquick again. 5
While I have not purchased this from Amazon I have used it for many years.  It makes a super layer for, my version, of Zuppa Engelesia and mixed with cream can be incorporated for Pate Choux.<br />I don't live in Hollywood any more so it is getting more difficult and thanks to Amazon I find it it available and in larger cans.........  I plan to order soon.<br /><br />Gino Rossi<br />Mangia con passione chef/caterer 5
I had previously purchased the chicken and the duck from this line so I wanted to try the beef liver.<br />Well, my dog likes the flavor but I don't like how dry they are. They have very sharp edges and I had to be creative to soften them a bit so that my dog wouldn't suffer from a rapture in the esophagus while eating them as they are. The other 2 (chicken + duck) are a little chewer than this one. I would not buy this again unless texture improves. 1
These chips are tasty and low in calorie.  If you are gluten free they are a great option as a to-go snack.  We love them. 5
It is hot. Not as hot as Dave's sauce, but it's hot. The popcorn is good - light and crisp.<br /><br />Too bad there's not a breakfast cereal with this stuff on it :) 4
I enjoy the flavor of this coffee, however it brews very weak. I usually brew the biggest cup possible, but with this one I have to go to a smaller cup. If you like mild coffee, this is a good one for you. I like a stronger, beefier brew, so this is not my favorite. 3
Next to Gummib&auml;ren, Phantasia is my favorite Haribo candy. This product did not taste as fresh when ordered from Amazon.com as when it is picked up off the counter in Germany, but came close, and is certainly better than much American candy. 4
I first had tried this ginger drink while vacationing in Puerto Rico.  Since then I have purchased this in the Asian stores... it's delicious and so good for the stomach.  When we went on our cruise I took my own supply and used it on a regular basis for if needed sea sickness.  It taste delicious and good for all that ailes you... 4
I've picked up the smaller size at convenience stores and have always liked them.  I read some of the reviews and one person mentioned how very salty they were, but I bought this pack of 12 anyway.  I thought maybe he was just a little sensitive, but, wow, he was right!  I like the flavor, but cannot eat much of it at once. I eat only a small amount each time and close the package back up.  The small ones I get in the convenience stores don't seem this salty. 2
ANOTHER GREAT WHOLE BEAN FROM COFFEE BEAN DIRECT. WE DRINK A LOT OF COFFEE, AND LIKE BOTH QUALITY AND QUANTITY. SO WE GO FOR COFFEE BEAN DIRECT, AND HAVEN'T TRIED ONE WE DIDN'T LIKE. THIS BREW IS HEARTY AND AROMATIC, NOT BITTER. A GREAT COFFEE. BUYING IT BY THE FIVE POUND BAG IS THE WAY TO GO, AND I THINK COFFEE DIRECT IS THE BEST DEAL OVERALL. 5
The Cherry Pie flavor is, for me, far too tart. I really prefer the pecan Pie bar out of all the "Pie" flavors. 2
I order K-Cups in the 50 packs all the time and look for the good discounts.  However, the Tree Hugger was too weak, actually tasted "watery".  I normally order the organic coffees, Columbian and sometimes donut shop, so my preference is not for 'robust' coffees.  but, this was too weak even for my taste. 2
This bar tastes good but I was disappointed to see that it has 25g carbs and isn't good for a low-carb diet.  It does contains 20g protein.  I will go back to my more expensive Atkins High Protein bar. 3
Paris is a Yorkie, loves me to throw the Rawhide so she can capture it. Provides hours of chewing enjoyment. 4
I think these are my favorite cookies ever. Really light and creamy. Too bad you can no longer find them anywhere for less than two-hundred count! I don't think I need THAT many. 5
I have two German Shepherds. I use these as training treats. I also use them when I brush them, which they don't enjoy so much but know they will get treats. We have tried every treat available. These are the best. 5
I took it at 5am yesterday. It is now almost 3am the next day and I am laying in bed and skin feels tingly, can't sleep at all. I feel like I am at super sayan level 4, power of the red monkey. I could shoot ki blast out the window if I wanted too. Maybe some kame hame wave's too. 3
This dill weed came in a sealed package but it must have sat around for a very long time.  The dill weed did not have any smell or taste.  It was basiclly some green organic material.  Not very useful for cooking.  I have ordered other Frontier products in the past that have been just fine.  Perhaps it is just this supplier.  Recommend you buy from another source. 1
This tea is definitely worth trying as you may find that it's your favorite.  I've tried Irish Breakfast from most online Tea Shops to try to find one that is superior.<br /><br />Taylor's has some fine teas, but I didn't find this variety superior enough to keep buying it.  I do buy their Yorkshire Gold, which is much stronger and great for when I need that.  I found that I enjoy Trader Joe's Irish Breakfast Tea just as much or more than this brand at around half the price or a little less. 3
I was very excited to get some hot chocolate cups for my Keurig and even happier there was a variety pack.  I read the reviews and even there were some negative ones, I went with it anyways.<br />I tried the milk chocolate.  It has such a weird taste to it.  But I gave it the benefit of the doubt and tried another later that night.  Same weird aftertaste.  I asked my husband to try it to make sure my taste buds weren't off. He commented that it had a "hot plastic-y" aftertaste to it.  Not even worth drinking.  Too bad I have 34 more cups that will go to waste. 1
Don't let the "Earth's Best" name fool you .. as stated in multiple reviews here - CHECK THE INGREDIENTS!  No wonder so many positive reviews here have the same theme, "My kids will only eat Earth's Best!" .. Well that's because they are all SWEETENED, which is one of the worst things you can feed to your child regularly.  They WILL develop a sweet tooth QUICKLY, and will start rejecting pure vegetables / other good things because of this.  There is no need to inject applesauce or other sweeteners into other foods.  That's just shameful, and there is only one reason for it - so the child will eat it and only want this brand.<br /><br />Best advice - if you must buy pre-made food, be sure the ingredients are just the main ingredient(s) and (if needed) water.  That's it.  Don't buy a vegetable that has "applesauce" or another silly ingredient added just to make the child love it and want that brand because it's sweetened.<br /><br />Shame on Earth's Best as a company.  Kudos to their marketing department for creating a name whereas consumers will automatically be drawn to them because they think it's a great product based solely on the name. 1
My dog absolutley LOVES these treats.  However, they are made in China.  There have been a lot of reports lately about dogs getting sick from treats (especially chicken jerky treats) made in China.  I never heard that this brans is a problem, but I am not taking any chances. 1
Lime and chili? When I saw that on the package, I was most intrigued! It seemed like an odd combination. But I like the taste of lime and I really like the zing of a good chili.<br /><br />Well, the label is half right. The taste of lime is really quite distinct and refreshing. I really enjoy that part of the equation. But from my experience with these chips, the chili taste is overpowered by the lime (or there was not much of the chili flavor to begin with).<br /><br />Still, the lime test is so refreshing!<br /><br />All in all, a good product because of the lime. But, in the end, rather unsatisfactory, because the pairing of lime and chili doesn't quite work. 3
Marshmallow, chocolate, cookie...put it all together and its a visit to my grannys house as a child. Where she would break out the Mallomars (her favorite) and let us grandkids demolish them in seconds. I would always eat the cookie part first than the squishy marshmallow chocolate hat.<br /><br />So we were looking forward to this box arriving from Amazon, we hadnt had these in years.<br /><br />The anticipation was thick, were they going to be as good as we remembered? would they still smell so sweet and chocolatey? Rustle, Rip, Tear...and .....sad face.<br /><br />All the cookies had seperated from the tops, the chocolate coating the cookies and marshmallows had cracked and separated, turning an ashy brown color. I picked up a cookie and bit into it...stale. I picked up a mallow top hat and the chocolate fell into my lap. The expiration date wasnt past, and they were packaged ok, so I dont understand what went wrong.<br /><br />They were just nasty, and broken and disappointing....more sad face. 1
the clams we're ok overall, quality ext accept only calf the can is filled with clams and the other half is mostly juice. also i expected larger chunks rather than small pieces. product is good though. 3
I grew up in a diabetic household so I have always been aware of the difference between "people" food and "diabetic" food. Of course it was only recently that I was put on the non-people stuff exclusively.<br /><br />These candies are surprisingly satisfying. I have a doc who says artificial sweeteners are for those who haven't yet admitted that they aren't allowed to have a sweet tooth any longer. May be true but these little candies are quite nice.<br /><br />They are, in fact, hard. That is a nice change from diabetic candies when I was a child. They have a decent mouth feel and an almost caramel taste. I don't catch an aftertaste. So, when I "need" a fix, these are nice to have around the house. Won't mistake them for "people" candy but these really are amazingly lifelike. 4
I do not drink cow milk and was on soy which was sinking me further into estrogen dominance.  Remembering that I had liked goat milk when I had the opportunity to drink it fresh from the goat in my home country.  I started to do some research online to see if it would be a good substitute and what do you know, it was.  Yes it is not fresh straight from the goat milk, but being able to have it again has been a blessing.  Thank you Mayenberg for both the powdered and evaporated milk.  Thank you Amazon for offering it a price that is not breaking my purse. 5
I have four dogs, two males and two females, of the Heinz 57 variety, all sizes and shapes, and they LOVE these treats!  Since this was something new, they were of course a little hesitant at first, but after eating just one they caught on really fast and all begged for more.  As I removed each treat from the bag, I had each dog's most rapt and focused attention.  I like the ingredients, nothing fancy, just good stuff for dogs.  I will be buying these again. 5
We love happybaby products, our twins like most of them.  Unfortantely this is nothing like the others.  Very dry, paste like.  Babies refused to eat it. 1
I ordered the product a few weeks ago, and the beef jerky is very hard to tear and chew.  Some of them were like rubber, and it just took forever.  I would not buy it again.  Kind of disappointed at it. 1
I am a big fan of anything Annie's so it is no surprise I give these 5 stars. There is simply no comparison between 'the chessiest' and the truly chessiest mac & cheese - which is Annie's. I enjoy the white cheddar the most. 5
These are the GIANT Smarties candy rolls.  I was not reading carefully and thought these were the smaller rolls. However, these work very well.  You can hand them out as treats using just one roll instead of three or four smaller rolls.<br /><br />The price was good compared to others advertised on Amazon.  I would make this purchase again.  Check on saving shipping by ordering more than one box at a time.  That makes it an even better bargain. 4
Just found out that my wife's cat has diabetes.<br />Vet prescribed insulin and modified diet.<br />The FF "Classic" varieties - at least every 'classic' I've checked so far, are the closest to a RX diet I can find.<br />More proteins and far less carbs than most animal feed.<br />Similar fat content to other canned foods.<br />Vet has yet to weigh in on this, but she was interested when I gave her a comparison breakdown of RX food vs FF Classic and a couple of other mass-market brands.<br /><br />I wish there was more info available online.<br />Nutrition info, for starters.. I can get that from Mfr,  but I know that formulations change - sometimes 2-3 times in a year.<br />Today's formula may not be what I am grabbing from the shelf, or what is shipped to me.<br />Also, the amount of food -  FYI, these are smaller, 3oz cans  and the recommendation is 3 cans per 10lbs of cat each day.<br />  (I'm more of a dog or other larger animal person.. so 3oz cans are tiny to me.)<br />Looking at it another way, if you have a ~12lb cat, or lighter but active (or pregnant, or &lt; 2 years old), then this 24 pack is one week or less of food.  Buy more, or consider adding treats, dry, or other foods.<br /><br />Debates on price - well, I can get this "on sale" considerably cheaper ( 20% less) than Amazon with frequent local sales, coupons, coupon doubling, etc.<br />Amazon price is comparable to everyday price where I normally food shop, and I shop every week, on the way home from work.<br />I only pay about 3.5% sales tax, so tax & gas aren't a big issue for me.<br />I am a member of Amazon Prime, that makes free 2-day shipping & no tax pretty convenient.<br /><br />Good product, price is good enough,  and Prime makes it convenient.  It fits my current needs with a diabetic cat.<br />Food is gross to me, and I eat nearly any human food, even 'delicacies'.  (Think of this stuff as"pink slime" with color & scent)<br />  If I were rating on appeal we wouldn't have gotten this far.<br />The cat seems to like it.  2nd cat with several teeth missing also likes it - very water-soluble, nearly dissolving without stirring.<br />More info would be the 5th star.<br /><br />.. debates about pricing belong in another forum, or maybe over coffee in your local *mart. 4
I don't usually drink energy drinks and I stopped drinking caffeine a little over a year ago, but had a long drive and I was exhausted so decided to give this a try. It worked great for the first 2-3 hours. I had a boost in energy, was more alert and felt fine, but into the 3rd or 4th hour my heart started racing, broke out into a cold sweat and was horribly jittery. When I got home my head started spinning and I couldn't sit down for hours. It was the worst feeling ever. I seriously felt like I was overdosing on a drug. Finally after 7 hours I felt a little better and was finally able to fall asleep, but all into the next day I felt horrible, entire body ached, felt unrested and still jittery. I know not everyone will react the same way, but be careful with this stuff. I did a little research afterwards and found information that suggest it is possible to OD on caffeine and Vitamin B. Maybe the percentages in this drink were just too much for me. 1
These strips are not very generous,kids would want more sugar They taste just o.k. Very adult. I'm sure If you are old like me they might be perfect. I still think each serving should be  bigger that's all 2
The Melitta Creme Brulee Coffee is bland and flavorless, despite its flavored nature.<br />Whether drinking it black or with a bit of creamer, I was hard-pressed to recognize<br />this product as coffee at all. It might be OK for those with weak palates, but I want<br />my coffee to TASTE like coffee. The Melitta Classique Supreme is a far better choice,<br />especially for the price...how can that one be so good and this one so lame? I don't<br />know, but I hereby advise you to walk away from Creme Brulee toute de suite.<br /><br />By the way: the package is difficult to open without spilling some contents. 2
Overall this would have been a nice gift.  Unfortunatly when I recieved mine it was damaged.  I went to gift wrap it for my mom upon recieving it in the mail,  and the top chocolates were damaged and had leaked on all the others creating a sticky mess.  I emailed the seller as instructed on the invoice I recieved,  but never got a response.  I tried the liquer stores around town but it was too late they were all sold out. 2
I saw these in our local commissary one day and decided I *had* to give them a try.  I was only looking for something that might be a better for me choice to satisfy my sweet tooth.  I had no idea how much I would like these and have to have *more*.  I got one bag of the Raspberry and one bag of the Maple and I love them both!!!  I'm thrilled to see that they are a much healthier alternative than most baked goods, especially than the ones I normally choose.  I am not someone who is health consious or tends to read labels before buying an item.  I love these twists and am looking to buy them in a larger quantity so I can enjoy them more often!  They are light and flaky and satisfying and good...a must for me! 5
I love Vita Coco and thats why decided to go for this product. However, when I received the package - I was totally disappointed. I have opened 4 packs and all are used. Usually, every pack has two seals - one on the top and one at the surface of the pack. The one at the surface is broken suggesting it is a refilled and not original Vita Coco. I will highly advise you against this seller. Please avoid at any cost. 1
My twin girls love this! I wanted to give them fish but wasn't ready to prepare it myself. These are perfect! I've tried Sprout pouch meals and didn't really like them, so I was a bit wary of these. But these pouches are easier to empty, and the texture is great for 10 month olds. My girls eat it right up. 4
This Donut House "Chocolate Glazed Donut" K-Cup is very smooth and does indeed have a distinct Chocolate Glazed Donut flavor. The aroma while brewing is wonderful but the coffee is not too overpowering.<br /><br />Being a Type 2 diabetic, this is as close to real donut that I can get, so taking it with Splenda and Half&Half is a real treat in the mornings for me. My son (not diabetic) likes it better than other flavored coffee, but he says there is a bit of a chemical after taste that I didn't notice and it hasn't stopped him from making several cups for himself.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH 4
I moved from NY to SF, the land of the coffee snob.  I missed my cheap tasty coffee.  Thank God Amazon sells my favorite-est cheap flavored coffee!  If you're not in to the burnt starbucks flavored 'gourmet' coffee and just want an pleasant cup of joe in the morning, look no further.  Unless you prefer Hazelnut, then check out 8-O'Clocks hazelnut beans... 4
These crackers rock.  Wish company would let you buy assortment since you have to buy minimum of 6 boxes at a time. 5
We love Earth's best. Its hard to beat their variety of flavors and organic offerings. You can also buy a vegetable variety pack, gourmet meals, or my favorite, the seasonal! Good Price on Amazon too, especially if you do subscribe and save!! 5
This cookies are really tasty and I will definitely be reordering.  I ordered the package of 16 small bags to be able to have a snack to carry with me to places unlikely to have anything gluten free, and I'm glad I ordered this product. If one is signed up for the autodelivery program the price is pretty reasonable. The little bag of 4 cookies helps me with portion control because if I had the whole box I would probably plow right through them.  They are very flavorful and taste just like cinnamony Snickerdoodles; there is no weird aftertaste as with many GF foods. (I have also had the oatmeal cookies and found them crispy too but much more bland; they would be good with coffee.) I've even considered crushing the cinnamon thins to make a crust for cheesecake but haven't tried that yet (would buy a box to do so to avoid the need to open multiple bags).  The cookies are very crispy, so if that is an issue for you, take note. (I know my false-toothed father would have to soak these in milk to be able to eat them, but I believe he would think they were worth it!) 5
I thought I was geting a variety package of coffee.  There were  2 lemon drinks , 2 green tea, 2 chia tea and 2 decaf coffee.  Not enough real coffee in this product. 3
Great tasty way to start your day yet shrinking your fat cells. I don't think I would need any other tea after this one. I have tried other Pu Erh teas, but this is the best tasting one. Again I am not a coffee drinker, but always started my day with black tea, may be being raised in Europe had its effect on my taste. After knowing about Pu Erh tea in Dr. Oz show for fat shrinking quality, I tried different brands and found out this one is the best. 5
Hickory smoked sea salt "Durango" has a wonderful aromatic scent and flavor.  There is a strong measure of salt due to the coarse sea salt, but if that is what you are looking for then you will enjoy this.  I would like a little more hickory for the ratio of salt, but I still appreciated this product.  My husband and I use it regularly as do three of our children. 4
This product tastes good, but like the other person posted.....this is WAY OVERPRICED!  >$8/box???!!!!  I love the taste; the sugar content is not too terrible; and the calories aren't too bad, for me anyway, but the thins ARE very crumbly; I eat them over a plate.  This is NOT a snack-in-the-car treat, unless of course you don't mind getting crumbs and possibly chocolate all over yourself and your vehicle. 3
I used to drink Ghirardelli Chocolate Mocha hot chocolate as a treat on weekend mornings when I was working.  I'm now retired and started drinking it every day.  I was afraid that I would get tired of it drinking it every day instead of just as a treat.  Well, that didn't happen at all.  I am now what I would call addicted to it.  I have it every morning with my toast and my GMA on TV.  I recently went to my mother's place for several days and truly missed my favorite morning drink.  I couldn't wait to have it the morning after I got home.  Next time I'm going to be gone for several days I'll make sure I take a canister with me.  I love that I've found this product on Amazon and even that I have to opportunity to have it via automatic shipment.  I started having trouble finding it in the stores we shop so the automatic shipment it great. 5
I just got the new shipment with new formula which has more Sodium, more Calories and less Chicken.<br />I canceled my subscription. 3
Thank you for the fast delivery of my order, the 6lb bag of Midnight Blue popcorn. It popped on the stovetop just fine, although I think this company also sells a popper, which we haven't purchased. We will enjoy this tasty snack for a long time to come, and have plenty to share with a few friends and family. 4
As another reviewer noted...This is like crack for dogs! My dog likes jerky but loves freeze dried liver. The tub may be a but much but is the best value. 5
I've gotten this flavor larabar from the grocery store and loved it. In fact, that was the reason why I purchased it from Amazon - because the cost per unit is so much lower. The peanut butter cookie bar from the grocery store was moist and delicious. The bars I received from Amazon taste stale. They're dry and crumbly. The expiration date is not until 2013 so I don't understand why they would be this way but they are. I won't be reordering any more Larabars from Amazon! 1
I have been using the product for several months now.  The dogs seem to like it and having it delivered is really nice.  What more can I say? 4
clearly the more expensive puzzle games may offer more, but for what you pay, this is nice.  My dog enjoyed it, and caught on after a try or 2.  at first she took the yellow cover and ran... thinking that was the prize, but i called her back to show her the treats, and then it was on! 3
The food is great, but the bag that I got from amazon seemed very stale - half of it was smashed to powder, and you can get a better pricess elsewhere. 3
This coffee is a little strong for me, but with a little bit of sugar, milk and/or creamer it's perfect. I have a cup of this almost every morning! 4
I give my 4yr old standard poodle one of these per day.  She LOVES them.  They seem to help keep her teeth white and her breath fresh. 4
Bought it thinking this would plug into the Wii and I would be able to use my condenser microphone with it. Well, long story short, doesnt work. But it is still usable with a PC/laptop to record audio. But we can do that with a builtin mic also. Would u like to pay 1$ towards the presidential election? 4
Just wanted to make sure its clear that this product is NOT a fruit leather.  This is a fruit flavored snack.  The packaging clearly states as much.  Only one of the first 5 ingredients is fruit, the rest are 3 sugars and one oil.<br /><br />Hopefully Amazon can re-categorize this product appropriately. 3
This will have to be short, but sweet as I have a tail to chase... Shockingly, as a dog that likes to eat unhealthy table scraps and turns his nose up to anything "organic" and "healthy", I have to admit that I really liked these treats! Woof! Woof! 5
The Quaker chocolate and almond naturally flavored oatmeal cookie is really not bad.  I recently got a package of six individually wrapped cookies.  I ate the first one, and was surprised at how fresh it tasted.  You can really taste the milk chocolate, as well as the small nuts in the cookie ( I assume the chocolate and the nuts are not larger in the cookie due to the company wanting to control calorie content).  And speaking of calorie content, each cookie according to the package has 180 calories.<br /><br />Some of the few drawbacks with this cookie are the small size of the nuts and chocolate used to make the cookie. As I mentioned above, I am sure the company did this to control calorie content.  This cookie also bills itself as a "good source of fiber" - that is right on the package - yet I could not find any type of breakdown on fiber content per cookie on the box package or the individual wrapping.<br /><br />In summary, this is a product that will appeal to women trying to pack a more nutritious lunch for themselves on a work day or for their children in their lunch to school. 4
Just the shaking of the bag and they come running.  I call it "Kitty Crack"...and I am currently feeding about 19 of them.  One of the ways I can trap to spay/neuter them. 4
The Popchips were excellent - had excellent flavor and low in calories.  When you eat these - don't need another potato chip! 5
These bars have a core of unappetizing protein goo, covered with a thin sheath of white chocolate analog. It didn't taste like white chocolate and even my roommate couldn't stomach these. 1
I have ordered this exact item from Amazon a few times before. It is basically two 12 packs in one box. One of the 12 packs was already opened and was missing four of the mini bottles. This is the first time I have had this happen. It's not worth sending back, but it's extremely annoying.<br /><br />I will say that the product is great otherwise. It's virtually identical to 5 hour energy, but it costs half as much. The berry flavor isn't great, but it's not terrible either. 4
I have 3 chihuahuas and I thought these would be better for them since they are smaller than a full ear. They still were too much for the little guys. I would say a dog 20-30+ pounds should be able to handle them better than my 8lb guys.<br />They had a strange smell and felt slightly oily to the touch. I don't know if that was something added to them to preserve them or it was natural.<br />My chihuahuas are fussy and they liked them I was just worried about blockages since they seemed to swallow large chunks of them. They didn't have any problems and my 4lb was able to handle them I just wouldn't buy them again since my guys are too small. The bags were a good size for the price. I bought three and should have bought one bag.<br />I rated them 4 stars since they were of good quality just better for larger dogs in my opinion. 4
This lefse' isn't even worth one star, but that was the lowest Amazon would let me go.  There is no flavor to it what-so-ever.  You can't taste the potatoes or the butter, all you taste is flour and it's very dry.  It used to be better years ago when it slightly resembled the taste of potatoes, but as it is with many items, they must have found ways to save a buck at the expense of the quality & flavor.  Don't waste your money!  You're better off investing in the equipment to make your own, or finding a website that sells an authentic "home-made" variety.  I grew up in a Scandinavian household that made traditional lefse' for family gatherings, trust me when I say Mrs Olson's is absolutely horrible. 1
Amazon website automatically suggest these pods with Nesspresso machines.  These pods are huge and INCOMPATIBLE with Nesspresso machines.  Please beware of that.  The coffee maybe good, but it's advertized with the wrong products.  As far as I can see Amazon is not selling Nesspresso pods at all. 1
Although it sounded delicious, I was very disappointed in this coffee. The coffee has a strange, chemical aftertaste ... cup after cup, not just once.  Even when it brews, it creates a chemical sort of aroma.  In fact, because our single-serve pod coffee brewer was new, I started thinking the problem was the brewer.  We assumed it was a left-over manufacturing plastic or metal aftertaste coming through in the water.  I even e-mailed the coffee machine maker (Bunn) to see how to remove the aftertaste.  Imagine our surprise when a month later we opened a new pack of pods (regular Colombian, not flavored) and were delighted that our machine makes great coffee.  When we made a cup of the Senseo Vanilla again -- back came the off-taste and aroma.  Perhaps it's the "artificial flavors" used?  Be forewarned! 2
The Natural Balance Alpha Grain-free Trout, Salmon meal and Whitefish Formula is working very good for my dog. There is no digestive problems. It also keeps the fur shinny. Be sure to provide a lot of water for the dog as he always drinks a lot an hour or two after the meals. 5
We have used this product before and love it, so decided to send some as a gift to friends.  The cans were received dented.  Two of the cans were significantly dented.  The 3 cans were taped together, but no other packaging was in the box.  One side of the box was torn.  The shipping receipt was not included nor was the "gift" message that we had requested.  Our friends had no idea where these 3 beat up looking cans of Walnut Oil came from or who sent them until we called and asked if they had received them.  Shipping was also suppose to be in 2-3 days.  Was not received until day 6.  Will find another way to purchase this product, but not through Amazon. 3
If you love Pirate's Booty, then you'll find that these Tings are exactly the opposite. Light, oil free and perfect mix of condiments makes the Pirate's Booty tasty, but the Tings feel greesy, heavy and completely bland. Do yourself a favor and do not even think of trying these if you're a fan of the other product from Robert's American Gourmet! 1
First, let me say that my cat loves these appetizers, and she gets one every night as a treat.  For that, I would give this product 5 stars.  However, the entire experience including value for my money and such drops this to 2 stars because of the change in packaging, change in number of trays sent and NO change in price.<br /><br />First shipment contained 12 trays as it was expected to, however, the second shipment was a different packaging box and only contained 10 trays.  What the heck?!?  Maybe that doesn't seem like a big difference to you, but the price didn't change with the change in the number of trays.  I don't like getting ripped off, intentionally or not. 2
These are the best protein bars that I've ever eaten.  It's a huge plus that no sugar is added and they are gluten free.  LOVE THEM.  I've purchased them twice from Amazon and was very disappointed (both times) in the condition of the product.  The chocolate looked dull and old like they had been in Grandma's freezer for too long.  Further the taste and texture were also a bit off.  My 4 and 5 year old boys love these.  They will split one before a soccer game or a mid afternoon snack. My advice is to buy them elsewhere and you will be pleased. 3
I dont want to order this if it the new recipe.  Can someone verify the one that is offerered is the original.<br /><br />thanks 3
I had no idea these were so overpriced until I checked them out on the company's website.  I thought they would still be OK since I had already bought them for my little shihtzu, but when I opened the bag, they smelled really weird to me.  I called the company to tell them I thought something was wrong with them because they smelled nothing at all like the larger peanut butter treats.  I was assured by Marianne that they should.  She is sending me a replacement and a trial pack of another flavor for little Sheldon, so we know their customer service is good.  She thinks that they weren't stored correctly before they were shipped, but that's all she could guess without seeing them herself.  I order some of the dogranola treats and they are another hit, just kind of big.  The bigger treats are great and probably the smaller ones too...just not these. 1
Although not exactly as I remember raisin bread, it's a welcome treat after so long without. It has a good texture, toasts well, but could have more cinnamon flavor. It is somewhat pricey, but I miss bread, so I splurge a little.<br /><br />Update: I need to warn consumers that, although this packaging should last until the expiration date, you must examine this bread before you use it. At $44+ you can't eat this bread too fast, even though it is light. As I got to the last three loaves, I noticed mold on most of the slices. I hoped none was tainted that was already eaten. It was well before the expiration date. I now have too much of a distrust of this product to order it again. The Ener_G company took the bad bread back and will send me replacement loaves. They asked why I didn't order from them. From now on, I think i will. It can't be any more expensive. This price is no bargain. 2
I ordered this product 9/15 and have stll not received it 10/18 so I can't review product only poor delivery. 1
Olives are yummy and a good diet snack, but I just can't quite give this 5 stars. Why?<br /><br />Because first of all, the flavor is occasionally too overly strong with some of the packs I've picked up. I love the taste of chili powder mixed with olives, but sometimes the flavor just isn't as consistent from pack to pack. I'm fine with some changes in taste, but some packs have it packed on while others have been fairly weak. This isn't enough to keep me away from this flavor, but it can be aggravating.<br /><br />The only other issue I have is that I wish that this was resealable. I don't often eat all of these in one sitting and I don't really like having to bring a second bag with me in order to seal up the portion I don't eat. It would be nice if the bag was resealable via a ziplock top or a small piece of adhesive fixed to the bag. I didn't deduct a star for this, but it's something I'd like to see.<br /><br />Otherwise this is a great product. The olives are always freshly kept in the bag and are of a good size. There's no puny little olives here, which I like because it's easy to get full when I eat these as a snack. 4
I thought this would be a nice compromise between what I like for dinner, good chicken and pasta with veggies, and what my son likes, anything resembling macaroni and cheese.  The cheese sauce was creamy with a balanced flavor, but I had to add extra chicken pieces (good thing I was using pre-cooked rotisserie) to get a goood cheese to pasta/chicken ratio.  Without the extra chicken this would have been too cheesy for my taste.<br /><br />My biggest disappointment was the "broccoli" that in the end looked like big parsley flakes rather than broccoli. Although the prep was easy and relatively quick, I was reminded why I like my own quick recipes that allow me to have real vegetables of recognizable pieces and real cheese which I personally prefer to Velveeta.<br /><br />Would not buy again. 2
Not sure, but have been reading about Himalayan salt and apparently there is a high fluoride in this salt according to several reviews I've read, and that's not so good.  However, it looks very nice in my salt mill and tastes much better than Morton salt and I don't use it everyday.  Also, it's mined in Pakistan if that really matters. 4
I bought these bars as a quick meal replacement or snack, but my 4-year old son (an extremely picky eater) has enjoyed them for breakfast more than anything else I've offered!  He thinks they are candy bars and requests at least one daily.  The nutritional information on the package suggests that they are an even healthier, heartier choice than granola or cereal bars. Now, if he would just leave me a few... 4
I was excited to get this flavor and the reviews were great. I am sorry to report that I am not impressed at all with this flavor. It is somewhat weak in taste and I can BARELY taste the butter toffee. I will not buy this again. 3
I have been buying organic apple juice and there was sediment on the bottom indicating it had apple pulp.<br />I had to mix the bottle before drinking the juice.  This juice does not have pulp in it.  Disapointed! 2
I shared these with my two older sons, then ordered more. These are great to put in the glove compartment for after work. 5
I bought the large high tech pet door 8 months ago. From the beginning, it took buying 5 collars before I could get 3 that worked. The collar radios are cheaply made, they fall apart. The nylon collars themselves easily come unravelled and are virtually impossible to find replacements.<br /><br />The door itself worked perfectly for 6 1/2 months. Then it began sticking in the open position. I have reached out the manufacturer several times, but have NEVER received a response. After reading their website FAQ, I decide to replace the motor assembly. This requires completely removing the door from the wall, removing no less than 28 different screws, prying the fly wheel from the old motor, attaching the new motor assembly to the fly wheel. Next, I wanted to test the new assembly, but you can't set the door upright without reinserting the majority of screws. Thankfully, the door worked perfectly. I reattached the back completely, then reattached the door to the wall... All for the tidy sum of 90.00 with shipping.<br /><br />One week later the door began sticking again. I contacted the company again... Still no response... The symptoms this time were a bit different. The door opens, then attempts to close 5-6 times, before successfully closing... AND this only happens as the day goes on... Not early in the morning or after several hours of non-use... I re-read the company website FAQ... They suggested replacing the motor assembly AND motherboard... After several days of no response from the company, I was getting desperate. So I ordered the motherboard... 60.00 later, the door is still acting the exact same way... Working perfectly in the morning, but sticking as the day wears on... I have spent almost 700.00 with this company and they have failed to respond to a single email or phone call... They suck! 2
We eat a lot of cold cereal for afternoon snacks, instead of for breakfast, and this cereal fits in with its not-too-sweet not-too-peanut flavor and crunch.  But it's also not-too-interesting and not-too-memorable.  I would never crave it and don't plan on purchasing it if I see it on the grocery store shelf.  Ho hum. 3
Not bad tasting but it is not for everyone. It is fattening for sure. It also kicks up a funky smell after you cook it. Too many calories packed in each box. 2
I have been drinking Good Earth Sweet & Spicy tea (herbal) for years. It has been my favorite herbal tea for as long as I can remember, and I traditionally have a cup after dinner. When Costco stopped carrying a few months ago, I turned to Amazon and got six boxes in one order. Big mistake. Since the manufacturer has changed hands and the box went from light brown to purple, the tea also got seriously degraded. The difference is astounding, as I still have old tea bags from the last manufacturer and was able to directly compare. There is a distant hint of the old flavor that I pine for each time I take a sip, but what I am mostly met with is a harsh and unappealing flavor, and the longer it brews it just gets grosser rather than sweeter and spicier. It's tough to explain in words this distinct difference in flavor but trust me, it's disappointing. It is no longer the Good Earth that we all know and love so much. 1
I was so surprised how sweet this tea was I was sure it had sugar, but when I checked on the package no sugar was on the label. I did see "artificial flavors" which I am suspicious about. Anyone know what that is about? Anyways, other than that, a great tea. 4
This stuff is great. I just had to give it a good rating. I didn't know if I'd like this, but my fianc&eacute;e suggested we get this instead of the other tea varieties and that was a good call. 5
I was really looking forward to trying these chips since I love cheese but I was SUPER DISAPPOINTED! I am a big fan of Kettle Chips but these tasted somewhat stale and almost plain! They are supposed to have a cheddar taste but you cannot taste any of that...it's annoying. I do not recommend this flavor..salt and vinegar and buffalo bleu are my favorite. 2
I have recently started buying Erin Baker's Breakfast cookies because they are a fast, easy and nutritious way for me to start my day.  This flavor is not always available as it is a limited edition flavor, but fear not, these cookies do very well when frozen and can go directly from the freezer to the microwave for about 40 seconds, and you have a nice chewy delicious cookie.<br /><br />This flavor is delicious-some of the major ingredients are whole grain rolled oats, raisins, dried apples, walnuts, coconut and spices (cinnamon, nutmeg and carrot cake spices).  The cookie comes in at 310 calories, 18% fiber, with 17g of sugar and 15% iron.<br /><br />I was doubtful that a large cookie would sustain me, as lunch for me is about 5.5 hours away, but I have no problem, this cookie is filling and delicious.  As with any fiber filled product, make sure you do drink fluids.<br /><br />If you do buy these or any of the other Breakfast cookies, be assured that you can freeze and microwave, so on the limited edition flavors, you can buy extra if you really love a particular flavor. 5
I ordered 2 4lb bags, and they were delivered today. I open the box and both bags are melted. Great. Just great. These were ordered for a candy bar at an event next week. Why wouldn't they be packaged with something to prevent this? I was home when it was delivered so its not like it was sitting outside in the heat. Money waisted. 2
As the title states, the main fault with this oatmeal is the artificial maple flavor. It's slight, but leaves an odd taste in my mouth. I mean, oatmeal is healthy and good in itself; why add that extra artificial sugar if it detracts from the overall taste of the food? In this case brown sugar would have been enough. Or at least use real maple syrup.<br /><br />Texture and consistency is up to you, based on how much water you put in and how long you cook it. I put in different amounts of water and I thought the oatmeal tasted best with more water. My guess is that the water diluted the strong sugary taste so that it was more palatable to me. I still give this product 4 stars, because most flavored instant oatmeal have this issue of using artificial ingredients that affect the taste.<br /><br />Ultimately, after trying different kinds of flavored instant oatmeal from various companies, I think I enjoy plain oatmeal with dried or fresh berries the most. Healthy and good, what more can you ask? 4
I usually use Rolands truffle oil.<br />I bought this brand to try (it was so cheap that it was worth to try) The difference in price between rolands and this brand is enormous, but also the difference in quality. I dont think truffle oil is a staple for the kitchen, unless you make rissoto three times per week, so if Im gonna make rissotto once per week or twice per month I will use the good stuff (especially the difference it makes in the dish).<br />This oil is very aromatic, but when you use it in your food it almost doesn't have any flavor.<br />It was very disappointing. I wont buy it again. 3
They won't taste the same as other gummies.  And they were less chewy than other gummies like Albanese (best tasting ones I've found) or Haribo.  Chewiness is one of elements I love about gummies, so I will not purchase Yummy Earth again.  But if you are really looking for a  healthier substitute, judge for yourself. 2
This is a very mild Pistachio Oil. I tasted some in a restaurant recently and thought I would try a purchased brand before making my own. It doesn't seem to have any bits of Pistachio in it which was what I expected. But it goes well in a salad and I guess I could add my own bits of pistachio to it. 4
This is regular Paprika you buy in the grocery store. Its good and a great price. 5
Hubby and I love the taste of coconut oil...but this one had no flavor at all.  We thought that was rather odd.  I wouldn't buy it again. 3
Just mixed this with water to create a paste to put on celery.  Very good substitute for regular peanut butter!  Love getting a nutty taste without all those fat calories! 4
I purchased this tea a few months ago, and have been loving the flavor of it. However, of the 40 tea bags I've used, 4 have not been completely sealed along the side of the tea bag, causing tea to spill everywhere when I open the package or to leak pieces of tea leaves into my cup. With the price and taste, the tea's certainly still worth it, but you may need to be careful when you open the individual tea bags! 4
This was my favorite popcorn. 5 stars all the way, until... Some bean counter decided butter doesn't need a picture of a squatting Indian. The squatting Indian on the Pop Secret box is gone, and with it the taste of what was hands down the best stuff lining the underside of my couch cushions. With land o' lakes, I could eat a bag. With their new knock-off butter i'm forced to occassionally stop and scrape the gelatenous film from the roof of my mouth. Then I consider the other places that film has to be. Plus, the new stuff tastes like the tongue of an otter mired in oil. Bottom line: bring back the Indian, bring back the good stuff: I could die in her arms tonight. 2
I have been a good customer of yours for above subject and now I do not find a thing. Where, how and when can I buy more links?<br /><br />Debbie<br /><br />dnorvell@insightbb.com 1
Five stars for shipping speed.  Ordered on Friday, 25 May, estimated delivery Friday.  Arrived Wednesday morning via USPS, as FedEx Smart Post delivered to my local post office on Tuesday...around Memorial Day weekend.<br /><br />Local stores stopped carrying this product.  I have had great success using product to brine meat in water solution.  I have only had failure in my three attempts using the dry cure method, all beef turned brown and not pink, succeeding in depleting my cure stock.<br /><br />Reviewers have mentioned this size quantity should last users for a prolong time period.  Perhaps I will expand to try sausage and Canadian bacon.  Thanks for those ideas.  My primary goal is seasoned corned beef and pastrami.<br /><br />If I resolve the technique for dry curing London broil for above meals, I will upgrade this product to five stars and pass on the correct amount of cure per pound and inch thickness.<br /><br />Also, deduct one star from Morton website, who removed cure information and now offer a pamphlet customers can buy online.  I used to review the website information before curing. 3
These are great for a quick but out of the ordinary meal. I love curry but never have the chance to eat it.  Now I can fix it myself. 4
Another no-ship flower.  There is nothing worse than thinking you have a gift covered only for it to not ship. 1
I think to be honest, most of the protein bars do not taste good at all. If they are, then they have quite many bad stuff in their ingredients. This bar taste fairly better than lot many but I would still never buy it again. All that being said I'm going to finish my current order that I received. I eat it when I'm too late for my evening snack and I've nothing else to grab. 2
It's back at Costco!  For those of you who were so disappointed when Costco discontinued this cornbread, which is the very best, weep no more.  I visited my local Western PA Costco yesterday and lot and behold, there it was.  For what I paid to get it through Amazon's vendor, I could have bought at least two in the store. 2
candy came fast but was not what was pictured. It was the new variety with mango and pinapple, NO watermelon or blue. bummer 3
Found these while looking for good, cheap, low-calorie snack packs to buy in bulk for my office.  After my first shipment, I decided to have two boxes shipped to the office monthly via subscribe & save.  My next shipment arrives in two days. I'm so excited!<br /><br />Gotta have my pop chips... 5
I have to small poms and neither one of them would eat these. They actually have a good smell to them and even smell like parmesean cheese but both just snubed their noses up. I gave the package to my dad and his dog loved them so I guess it just depends on the dog. Mine must be a little too spoiled. 2
Although I like the idea of 100-calorie packs, I don't think that these cookies are as good as others. Perhaps that's because the cookies that Amazon sent were dry & stale. I checked the expiration ("best by" date) and found that it was in a mere 2 months. No wonder. Terrible, just terrible.<br /><br />We won't be buying these again. 2
Taste good, come two pouches per order. It took me a good month to eat them all, maybe even longer. Price is good, shipping I thought is a little steep though. 4
This chili mix does fine on its own, but it's best when you add your favorite ingrediants.  I don't care for most of the Bear Creek soups (very pasty) but this one's worth a try if you don't have a favorite. 4
Well, I like it.  Everyone is different.  I'm an energy freak and have tried MANY, so when I say I like it, it means the energy it gives is good enough no jitters and the taste is so much better than others i've tried.  My boyfriend tried it and the first thing he did was spit it right back out..lol...like I said everyone is different. 3
These contain MSG, which creates a reaction in many gluten-sensitive individuals.<br /><br />Ingredients:  Pork and Beef Pepperoni, (Pork and Beef, Salt, Corn Syrup Solids, Spices, Dextrose, Lactic Acid Starter Culture, Monosodium Glutamate, Sodium Erythorbate (made from sugar), Garlic Powder, Oleoresin of Paprika, Sodium Nitrate), Salt, Corn Syrup Solids, Spices, Dextrose, Lactic Acid Starter Culture, Monosodium Glutamate, Sodium Erythorbate (made from sugar), Garlic Powder, Oleoresin of Paprika, Sodium Nitrate, BHA, BHT, Citric Acid.<br /><br />Amazon.com should have a clear policy to label all food items sold here with a full ingredient list. 1
Wow what a deal. These taste just as good as the expensive brands. Most definately will be buying these again. 5
My 45 lb lab mix loves these 24" rawhide bones but they only last 48 hours at best. She's like a wood chipper when she gets going. So according to her it is a 5 star product based on how much she loves it. But in my judgement it is sort of expensive for 2 days of chewing. I will buy this product occasionally but will seek a more economical alternative. My guess is that most dogs will not chew it up as quickly. 3
In no way would I consider these k-cups having a bold flavor. In fact, I usually have to use two of them on the espresso setting to get any enjoyable flavor from them.  If I were you I would stick with the Donut Shop k-cup as it has a more natural coffee shop taste. 3
better then I expected. I notice there was some complaints that the muffins were dry.<br />So I sprayed the mix before cooking with a butter flavored publix spray which is canola oil.[same as pam butter spray].<br />This did the trick& they were great 5
Every can in the case looked as if it had been drop kicked and thrown. Had I known this would be the condition I never would have purchased it. 1
The taste is great, but more than half of the bag came melted together making them relatively unenjoyable and hardly easy to eat.  Sad. 2
packaged cheese - what a great idea. add monosodium glutamate, not so good. It's a shame they've gotta add MSG to cheese. 1
I totally agree with the other reviews - great product, rotten pricing decision that sticks it to loyal customers. Up yours (stronger message to follow!) 1
Mark Twain once said, "The difference between the almost right word & the right word is really a large matter--it's the difference between the lightning bug and the lightning."<br /><br />This quote came to mind when I first tasted Newton's Fruit Thins, which are trying to ride the name recognition of Fig Newtons.  Don't be fooled.  The difference between Nabisco's Newton Fruit Thins and the hallowed Fig Newton itself is of lightning bug/ lightning proportions.  The Fig and Honey Newton Fruit Thin is not only thin, but pale by comparison, especially if you like the taste of moist figs such as the old-school Fig Newton provides.  THIS cookie is as dry as an animal cracker, if somewhat sweeter.  It is advertised as containing raisins (which I like) and figs (which I also enjoy), but they amount to mere flecks in the cracker -- too little fruit to impact taste and just enough fruit to get caught between your teeth (they were a bit hard and dry).<br /><br />Nabisco tries mightily, trumpeting the lack of high fructose corn syrup (this product uses old-fashioned sugar instead) and the fact that it provides 8 grams of whole grain per three cookies (for those taking notes, that's 2 g. dietary fiber and 140 calories with 5g of it from fat).  Trumpet away.  When I eat a cookie, I'm being willfully bad; and if I'm being willfully bad, I want to REALLY enjoy the taste of my cookie, calories be damned.  Using that as a barometer, this cookie scores a 2-star rating at best. 2
Please, please, please, please, PLEASE bring back the old Spearmint Altoids flavor! They used to be my favorite type of Altoids until this New "Great" Taste came and ruined them. This new flavor is not sweet at all and just tastes all-around disgusting. It's bitter and tastes like those foul cough drops that, no matter how bad a cough I had, I would never make myself take. You took a wonderful thing and changed it for the worse - much worse. Please revert back to the old recipe! 1
This is a great Tea. I use a french press to make my Tea. A lot of people use a coffee maker, And I have too in the past.<br />I have found that if you use a french press and hot water from your water dispenser and let it steep as per the instructions this will be the best tea you have had in a long time. Don't take my word for it TRY IT. 5
I have bought several of the Vitality canned dog food products and have found them all to be of good quality. The product looks more like a stew than a processed meat and it smells better. My Labrador is finicky and she appreciates this product better than  most. 5
I really did not think my picky a** dogs would eat them. I tossed the treats to them and waited for the sniff of dis approval. Waiting...waiting.. chomp chomp and they are gone to another room to enjoy the treat in peace. Two dogs give them a paws up. 5
I've bought different types of packaged chestnuts.  They all tend to be less sweet than fresh chestnuts.  This one is also not as sweet as fresh chestnuts, but it IS sweeter than other packaged chestnuts.  In addition, it's organic.  However, it's a bit pricey.  Thus, 4 stars. 4
This is some of the worst stuff I've ever tried to drink. It's even worse than that awful stuff that comes out of those machines where the cup drops down and fills it. I tried it on the various cup size settings with my Keurig machine and it just goes from bad to horrible when going from the larger size to the smallest.<br /><br />It's a complete waste of money.<br /><br />I just tried another brand that's similar and it's no good either. If you like chocolate water, buy these. If you have it in mind that you are buying "Hot Chocolate" with a milky or creamy flavor... that's not what this stuff is.<br /><br />Yuck! 1
I decided to try this based on two things...  First - I was intrigued by the name.  "Foglifter" implied that it might have a nice kick to it.  Second, the reviews I'd seen (forget if the reviews were here or another site) were encouraging.<br /><br />The flavor is good, but it's very weak.  I feel like if I could take two k-cups to brew one cup of coffee, then I might be happier.<br /><br />I like a more robust coffee - like a Jet Fuel or a Dark Magic... or an Italian Roast or sometimes even a French Roast.<br /><br />If you're looking for a milder brew, this is very good.  But for me, it isn't lifting the fog hard enough.<br /><br />Enjoy! 2
This is a pretty typical sweetened packaged espresso drink. It's adequately strong, could always be stronger, since odds are pretty good you'll be drinking it iced. For my taste, it could be a bit less sweet, but it's not cloying against the coffee, and it's a nice sugary sweetness.<br /><br />I tried it straight and iced, with and without milk, and liked it all 4 ways.<br /><br />During the summer, I try to brew a big strong pot every few days and keep it in the fridge for iced coffee, but I like this as an option to keep on hand in the fridge for days I run out and don't want to wait for my usual stuff to cool. It would also be a convenient take-along booster if you're traveling somewhere with questionable coffee or visiting family members who brew theirs like a weak tea. The flavor and strength is much better than the starbucks instant packets, which are also a decent take-along booster.<br /><br />With 155mg caffeine (about 1.5x an average shot of espresso, similar to a good cup of strong brewed coffee), this has a nice pick-me-up with a low pee factor.<br /><br />For my money, it's a bit too pricy for what it is for everyday use. I'm too cheap for coffee at home at $2 a pop. 4
Not nearly as good as I remember them.  Not sour at all.  Fruit flavors leave a lot to be desired.  Only 1 or 2 cherry sour candies in the can.  I'll stick to Zotz (also purchased on Amazon). 2
I love that this drawer holds so many k-cups! Its great to have them right under the machine. Its great for those times when I am having company, I can load it up with what I know they like. Each time someone different comes over, I can just simply put their choices in the drawer and they can make a fresh beverage any time they want, they dont need to dig in my pantry or come get me to make something for them. Handy to have! I love it! 4
I like hot drinks like coffee & tea, and I like the flavors of lemon and ginger.<br /><br />This drink has a pleasant aroma and a spicy/sweet flavor. The ginger flavor is very strong -- almost like eating a Ginger flavored Altoid. The ginger's spicy flavor lingers in the mouth for a while after each sip.<br /><br />This drink is great for cold days and I bet it'd be super soothing if you had a cold or a sore throat. I may pick some more of this up if I see it at the grocery store. 4
If you are looking for absolutely guilt-free snacking, keep looking.... However, if you are craving a snack: crunchy, salty, buttery satisfaction, minus the preservatives and unhealthy ingredients of normal snack foods, Grandpa Po's is the way to go!  It is the closest you'll get to guilt free snacking that wasn't found in the fruit/veg aisle in the supermarket.  4 simple ingredients make this crunchy popcorn soybean snack extremely satisfying and "not-so-naughty" when compared to the million other snack foods out there, not to mention the many unpronounceable "mystery" ingredients included in them - not the things you want to put in your body.  For my destination wedding, I brought a few cases of Nutra Nuts to put in my guests' welcome bags.  Well, no one even mentioned all the other local gourmet treats that were in the bags -the Grandpa Po's were the hit!  Everyone was walking around w/ their Grandpa Po's Originals pouch in hand: "these things are GREAT!"  Clever packaging allows you to reseal and keep them fresh for the next urge to snack - although usually not necessary for this customer! 5
This is not a typical K-Cup, this is a powder. If you are hunting for a new coffee, this is not it. Imagine those cheap bags of hot chocolate in a more expensive K-Cup, and that's essentially what this is. Got it for $9 and I still feel disappointed. Doesn't taste bad, but nothing impressive. Do yourself a favor and skip this one. 2
Bought this after reading all the favorable reviews. The pasta clumped into a massive ball when cooked according to directions. I tried unclumping and rinsing off the "slime" as it cooked. When I poured out my pasta what had been an entire pack had turned into about 1/2 cup. So much for a family meal that I could participate in without having to eat special food. I will never buy Heartland products again. 1
I don't much like sweet potatoes or things made with sweet potatoes, but these are really very good.  They have an unusual taste that is hard to describe.  It's a little on the sweet side; perhaps too sweet for some; great for others.  Popchips (any variety) are not quite as hard or crunchy as regular potato chips, but that seems like a plus to me.  They have a nicer consistency than potato chips.  I have tried other varieties of Popchips too and I like them all.  This one is of the more interesting flavors and it is sure to be a big hit.  Popchips are far less greasy than regular chips because they are not fried in fat.  Not sure of the exact process, but the result is a wonderful chip that I prefer to regular chips.  I wouldn't call these healthy, but certainly better to eat than regular greasy chips.<br />I would eat Popchips all the time over other chips, except that the bags are small and they are a bit more expensive than other chips.  The extra you pay for these is worth it if you like this style of chip.  I can't imagine anyone not liking Popchips, although perhaps not everyone would like this flavor.  Give it a try and you will most likely be hooked. 4
I love all of the Blue Diamond Almond flavors and they are my favorite snack. This one is one of my favorite flavors and I eat these almonds for a snack because I view them as being healthier than other types of snack foods. This flavor is ideal as you get the freshness of perfectly roasted almonds with just a little dose of salt.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor has only 2% of your daily intake of sodium which is good for any snack food.<br /><br />The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away. If you don't like the super bold and spicy flavors then this flavor is the perfect one for you. This is as good as it gets in snack foods and good for your body and diet.<br /><br />I like all of the Blue Diamond Almond products as I feel that they are healthier for you as long as you don't overdo it in eating them. 5
This popcorn package is a great idea.  It has MANY flaws.  It is very difficult to pour the oil into the popcorn popper.  It is best when you heat the oil for  3-5 minutes and then add the popcorn and seasoning.,  The popcorn does not pop completely.  There are lots of left over kernels that never pop.  I am very disappointed in this product.  I will not purchase this product again. 2
You can taste the wood in the respect it taste like the coffee was roasted over wood.  It is VERY smooth, I detect no bitterness or over roasting.  Nice flavor.  My newest favorite amoung the k-cup line.  My old favorite was Donut Shop but not any more.  I am not as pleased with the other Caribou flavors but this one really surprised me. 5
I love garlic; in tomato sauce, on braised dishes and elsewhere.  I can handle garlic when I expect it.  I didn't expect it here.  At least not in this strength.  I guess I'll have to go back to the red & white cans.<br />Hey!  You may like it.  Not for me.<br />I used one and threw the rest out. 2
I love white polenta but most of what I find in the U.S. is very coarse.  It still tastes great but the texture leaves a lot to be desired.  Moretti Polenta Friulana Bianco is amazing - the creamiest and finest I have ever seen. 5
I drink a 5 hour energy 2-3 times per week when I need the boost to make it to the end of the day and sometimes to get my day started.  I like the 5-hour energy over coffee.  Coffee tends to let me crash and the 5 hour does not. 4
I like the idea that it's more healthy than other soups on the market, but people are not going to continue to buy this if Annie Chun doesn't improve on the taste.  I would eat it, but my kids think it has a blah taste. 2
It smells good, tastes like black tea, and it is decaffeinated.  I didn't really taste the creamy sweet flavor of vanilla.  In other words, the tea tastes like normal black tea if not for the vanilla aroma.  I think I'll go back to green tea based tea. 3
I am so disappointed with these almonds.  They are soft and have a slightly bitter flavor.  I roasted one bag hoping it would crisp them up, which it did, but didn't improve the flavor.  At least my dog likes them. 1
I bought two bones for my small dogs(yorkie and bichon). I believe they enjoyed them at first, but later in the day they had stopped playing with them and at dinner time I noticed they were not eating as much as they normally would. I have to guess that these toys might be to hard for my small dogs. A few days later my brother brought over his beagle and she loved them. The chicken flavor is noticeable when you take them out of the package. I would recommend these bones for medium to large breed dog. 2
This food has EXTREMELY high levels of protein. Not all dogs need a high protein diet, and in fact for some it can be quite dangerous. While my dog was on Orijen, my vet discovered that he had elevated liver enzymes. Many dog food health websites advocate high protein foods, but these can be very dangerous. Dogs that don't have a lot of energy and/or have little body fat (like sighthounds) do not need this much protein, and processing it can be very bad for their livers. This is a high quality food, I love that it is made by a small company in Canada, and many people have had great success with it. But know that it is NOT for every dog! Please be careful and keep in mind that more protein is not always better if you are considering this food! 2
Puppy loves the food.  Never has digestive issues.  Love the 16 lb bag, so I only have to buy one per month. 5
I ordered 3 boxes of 18 each.............and opened one box to find they were PODS and not<br />for Keurig, AND I can't return them!!!?????  Yes,the pods fit into the Keurig but<br />the end product is weak and awful.  I am most disappointed 1
We love this seasoning. Easy, fast and great on chicken, fish, pork, etc. Just melt a stick of butter and stir in this seasoning until it becomes a loose paste. Brush on protein, and sear on a hot pan. Cast iron is best. Always skin side down. when dark, place in a 400 oven until cooked to correct temp. Enjoy! 5
Gluten Free foods tend to be extremely expensive when compared to "regular" foods. This licorice follows that trend. For the times when you'd like to treat yourself, Candy Tree Organic Licorice is a tasty and safe treat for Gluten Intolerant people. Amazon seems to have the best prices on it too. 4
My cat recently freaked out over some catnip that came with a bed I bought him so I thought I'd order some more.  I couldn't find the same brand but this "Xtreme" catnip sounded like it might do the trick.  Not even close.  My husband swears he saw our cat lift up his paw and yawn after smelling it.  If your cat is like mine you'll probably get a better reaction out of any other catnip out there. 1
I have 4 adult Shih-Tzus and while they do prefer it when I cook for them...... they do eat this and it has helped eliminate the brownish tear stains they get when I feed them some dry foods. 5
First, I'll give the manufacturer some credit for making a no-additive, sucralose-only product. The problem with this product is: it's just too weak, in flavor that is. 1 gram of this "pure sucralose" tastes about as strong as 1 gram of a Splenda packet, for comparison.<br />If you don't mind spending a lot for a little bit of pure sucralose taste, then maybe this is for you, but cost-conscious customers might want to look elsewhere for a no-carb, non-calorie sweetener. 2
I tried to use the cheaper cereals with my baby and she would refuse them.  From the moment she tried the HappyBellies, feeding became so much easier.  She loves the way it tastes.  My only complaint is that I wish it came in bigger packaging.  I feel like I am always opening a new can and would rather there be less packaging.  But at the same time the cans are very easy to transport when traveling. 4
This is pretty decent coffee. Not the best, but if you have acid problems it helps a lot! After drinking this, I had less acid burn in my esophagus. 3
This is a delicious product. I had not heard or seen anything Quaker-based other than the oatmeal, which I have as a household staple, so I figured that since it's a Quaker product, it must be good!  Guess what?  I was right!  It was moist, chewy and not overly sweetened.  It had just the right amount of everything.  I had it as an afternoon snack along with a cup of coffee and it was awesome.  I'm looking forward to finding them at my local supermarket and having this as a treat every so often. 4
I have brought these few times, the first bottle that we have received seems to mix well, also the taste was good , but the next 2 bottles were not as good as the first one. It seems to be a hit or miss if you buy this product it might come out good or bad. These powder seems to come in two different packaging one is purple and other is green, I tried both and they seems to taste bad. BTW also tried perfect acai which is costlier but the taste is much better then this one and also it state the ORAC ingredients etc upfront 2
Was making homemade Farmer's cheese for one of my cooking videos. Had GF toast points, grapes, and these crackers on a plate. Slid a knife full of cheese across the top...all going well... and then took my first bite on camera, had to fake a smile. These were very dry at first, and then turned rather pastey in my mouth. Took them home, noone in the family would touch them after one try. I ended up giving these to my active-duty hubby who took them to the base. He described them later on as "hard to choke down, even with milk" crackers! Nice try though. Keep it up. You'll get it.<br /><br />Other products by Glutino, like the preztels, are delish. Someone needs to come up with a good cheddar cheese cracker. Then I'd be happy. 1
This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. 1
If you are a farmer with lots of farm cats, this is the perfect food - and because it is primarily sold at most farm and fleet stores I think that it is meant for farm cats. The ingredient list is marginal quality though, which can be expected. Most of it is corn and grain products, with a few meat by-products here and there. Better than Iams but not by much.<br /><br />I've been feeding my cat on Diamond Maintenance for 2 years without a problem but I will be switching to something with more substance soon. If you're looking for a cheap option for lots of cats, this is a good product to buy in bulk; but if you have a domestic cat you wish to keep around for awhile, I'd suggest something else.<br /><br />And hey, if you're looking for a good alternative, get Chicken Soup For The Adult Cat formula. Great stuff, doesn't cost a lot, and is much better than the regular Diamond food. 3
Progresso has always made some of my favorite soups.  Their numerous choices have provided a needed variety in my often soup-centric meals.  Some of their soups have a light broth, some are thicker, and some verge on being very stew-like.  However, lately I've noticed a marked tendency toward watering down their previously thicker soups such as Lentil and Beef Pot Roast.  Their Three-Bean Chili with Beef was created in this vein and the tomato-flavored broth is thin and watery.  In order to compensate, Progresso seems to have decided to overuse chili powder in any soup which has been tagged as Mexican or Southwestern in origin.  Thus, the sole flavor one was able to taste in this particular soup was chili powder.<br /><br />On the positive side, the beans are plentiful and well-cooked.  The beef was not fatty or grittle-laden, although it was not plentiful in the can I cooked.  There were a number of small tomato pieces and a bit of what appeared to be jalapeno peppers.  It would have been wonderful if these flavors had been melded into a more balanced tasting soup.<br /><br />It is because of Progresso's current overuse of chili powder - perhaps to mask the inadequacies in their newer soups - that I have rated this soup as a three-star product. 3
The plant dried up to nothing , it's dead ! I am trying every thing to bring it back. But no luck yet. 3
I've always gotten another popcorn, Orville's - and love it, but I was happy to see an organic brand. Made it for the first time tonight and blech. Perhaps it's an old bag, but it really needs some flavoring on it because it tastes like nothing. I actually at one point forgot I was eating popcorn and thought - wow, this puffed rice is getting stuck in my teeth. 2
This product contains partially hydrogenated oils which is very detrimental to your health. I would rather pay more for a product which does not contain transfats. 3
On the ingredient list, and you can tell. Not a bad mouthfeel, and certainly superior to some of their other 'Natural' attempt, but nothing spectacular. 3
I accidentally bought these chips (thought I was getting original pop chips), but have to say, because they are a little tart, I don't seem to be eating them as quickly, (good for my diet!).  If you like the taste of vinegar, you will like these. 3
Stash have tried very hard to get quality product for the consumers. The tea comes fairly close to the best on the market -  this is quite an endorsement from an Indian palate who has nearly 30 years of twice daily Darjeeling tea drinking "experience". 4
This is pretty retarded - how many have you sold, at DOUBLE the cool, refreshing retail price? You're a freak. 1
Patak's makes the best curry around. I frequently use it in my Yellow Chicken Curry Dish which is a favorite with both my husband and seven year old. 5
This HEMP OIL is excellent stuff. For real, if you are using fish oil, this actually has MORE omega 3's and has many other medicinal values.<br />Combine this with hemp seeds (in smoothies) and you will notice a difference in any aches in your knees and your hair will shine and your body will be filled with antioxidants.<br />ANYTHING HEMP ROCKS. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED in this product and it came on time and was packaged well. (3) bottles for this price is a great value. 5
These are decent, but if you want a realllly good salt and vinegar chip, try Boulder's Salt and Malt Vinegar chips.  THOSE are awesome. 3
I tried out the "NO FEAR SUPER ENERGY SUPPLEMENT" on a 7 hour road trip recently.  I think it helped to keep me focused which, for me is HUGE because I am sleepy when I drive.  So, for that I think it worked great.  Tastes a little fruit punchy to me.  Try it if you are looking for  energy and clear thinking.  I'll definitely buy it again. 3
I found this really offers a crunchy snack for me while doing the no carb diet.  However, I find I can make my own from shredded paremsan, almost as good! 3
Recently diagnosed a gluten-intolerant, I have been looking for products that allow me to resume a semblance of my former life. These snack bars fit the bill. They have the mouth-feel of a traditional snack bar, and a pleasant tart-sweet fruit flavor. 5
The problem with this Angel Hair Pasta is the texture of the cooked product. I boiled my first box cooking it on the low side of the recommended time on the box and the pasta still came out somewhat gummy. I ate half and saved the other half for the next day. It was still gummy the next day but I managed to eat it anyway. I will continue to experiment with times and see if I can improve on it, but unless I crack this nut, I won't be ordering it again. 2
Cheez-IT crackers are a great little snack - easy to eat, full of flavor and with a good shelf-life they are easy to keep on hand. Although I'd mostly stuck to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ONVON4">Cheez-It Baked Snack Crackers, Original, 13.7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a> flavor, a sale at Kroger's Grocery Store last year had me experimenting with some of the other flavors. Although the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004CYNTZ8">Cheez It Baby Swiss Crackers, 13.7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ONPN22">Cheez-It Baked Snack Crackers, Duoz, Sharp Cheddar & Parmesan, 13.7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ONPN9K">Cheez-It Baked Snack Crackers, White Cheddar, 13.7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a> flavors were good, my particular favorites were the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZXFWP2">Cheez-It Snack Mix, Baked Snack Assortment, 10.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 3)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00317ERWQ">Cheez-It Baked Snack Crackers, Italian Four Cheese, 13.7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a> flavors.<br /><br />Now Kellogg's has added a new Mozzarella Cheez-Its flavor, and I couldn't resist trying them. I have to say they aren't bad, but they aren't even close to being my favorite flavor. I think one of my favorite parts of the Cheez-Its experience is the bold flavor in their crackers, and the Mozzarella flavor is a bit too mild to suit me. Like I said, they aren't bad, but I wouldn't say they are great.<br /><br />Of course, something like flavor is a really subjective thing. Other people may prefer the mild flavor of the Mozzarella Cheez-Its to the bolder tastes in their other offerings.<br /><br />In all honesty, after discovering the Italian Four Cheese flavor, no other Cheez-It really comes close for me, with the exception of the Snack Mix, which is really completely different from just a Cheez-It.<br /><br />Do I recommend the Mozzarella Cheez-Its? I think they are an interesting flavor and are worth trying yourself. Everyone's tastes are different, and although I prefer the other flavors, you might very well consider the Mozzarella your own favorite. 4
The so-called crabmeat is pure mush. I don't think it is really crabmeat. Forget about it !!!! 1
Simply awful.  This product should be taken off the market immediately.  They did absolutely nothing for my 2-yr old dog's teeth.  I gave him about 4 per week until he almost choked to death on about the 10th one.  Awful, dangerous product, simple as that. 1
Working to reduce m my body'd PH, helping to reduce the effects of my psoriasis, using twice a day first in the morning, last at night, mixing with a half a lemon and 10 oz of filtered water, seems to be helping 4
This is the best tasting protein drink I've ever tasted.  It really reminds me of chocolate ice cream. I was disappointed when I read 21 total carbohydrates and 290 calories per serving.  The product may be appropriate for someone who burns a lot of calories, but not for anyone on a low carb diet. 4
After reading other reviews on this coffee, I was conviced I had to try it.  It's o.k., but really tastes much more like the cheaper WalMart brand coffee.  It doesn't even compare to Starbucks, not even close.  I wanted to give it a fair try, and after about a dozen cups I can say, I am disappointed enough to not reorder it.  If Coffee Bean Direct coffee's are all like this, I won't be a return customer at all.  I have a one cup coffee maker, grind the beans fresh for each cup, so it's not a case of making a pot and letting it sit.  I really wanted to LOVE it after reading other reviews, but I just don't, and I doubt I will even after five pounds.  I'm gonna try roasting the beans a little more myself to see if that makes any difference. I've never done that, but at this point, with 4 1/2 pounds of coffee beans left, I have to try something to make them taste better..  If that works out, I'll post again, but I'm not holding out much hope.  If you want really great coffee, you should look elsewhere, Coffee Bean Direct is just not cutting it...Good luck.<br /><br />July 9th,2012:  Update.  Well, I tried "roasting" the beans a little more.  Took a small amount and put them in the toaster oven for 15 min. at 400 degree.  They smelled good, but tasted horrible.  So I'm using the beans as I bought them, and making due.  Still not the great coffee I had hoped for, but drinkable.  Someone wrote a review of these beans talking about how they had a "chocolaty and vanilla" flavor.  Way off base! Or, it was someone at coffeebeandirect.com with a phony review.  Not even close.  When I am finished struggling thru this five pound bag, NO MORE..! 3
First purchase I got were okay and I enjoyed them.  But the second batch were just too salty to eat, I ended up throwing them out. When they say super salty... they mean it..all salt no licorice. 2
I have tried a variety of K-Cups for my Keurig Brewer and find Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend works best for me in taste.  I shop Amazon when offers are available including free shipping.  Amazon has been a good source for buying various items, including books, and I recommend them highly.  Delivery is as promised as well as products reliability. 5
My dog tends to get stomach problems if he's fed non-organic food, so I'm careful to always buy him organic (he probably eats better than I do). He snarfed up these treats readily and clearly enjoyed them, with no resulting tummy troubles that we saw. 5
Having read the other reviews, I wonder if mine had just gone bad.  It has almost a fermented alcohol-like smell.<br /><br />My husband got the cashew bar, I got the banana cookie.<br /><br />Both were were so nasty we threw them away without eating them. 1
Bought this along with a lot of other jerky to test out and after about two weeks it went moldy.<br /><br />No, it's not salt. It's fuzzy and green and hairy.<br /><br />Tasted fine while it lasted. Pretty standard pepper jerky. Didn't try it after it went moldy... 2
I am doing this review simply as a 'heads-up' for those who may think this is coconut oil for cooking - it is not!<br /><br />I use coconut oil in my kitchen for cooking - this came up on an Amazon search for coconut oil, but it's not for cooking, it's a hair oil.  Yes, that's clearly stated in the Product Features, but some folks may not see that.  It may not be eatable, for there's something in it that is keeping it from solidifying at room temp as normal coconut oil does - perhaps a chemical.  But as you can see, Amazon is treating it as a 'Grocery' item, and that alone will cause some to order it as a food item.  In my opinion, it should be labeled as a hair oil, and more clearly stated in Amazon's description.<br /><br />Be careful. 3
Since soy and anything made with casein is not an option for us, I was happy to find this mix.  This does not taste or smell like cheese (otherwise I would give it 5 stars), and we didn't like it when we first tried it.  However, since it is still pretty tasty in its own right, I tried it a few more times, with a few weeks between each time and eventually I found the right thickness for us (I also added a little more salt).  This is the case for pretty much all other replacement food items we've tried, because we are on a very restrictive diet which leaves us very few options in the ready-made/semi ready-made category.  By now (5 months later) my 5 year old probably can't remember how the real cheese tastes like, so as long as the food is tasty, he is happy.  As for me, I am happy to find one more item that can save me some time in food preparation. 4
They shipped 6 business days (8 real days) after my order.  And the arrival date exceeded Amazon's max. estimate by 3 business days.  It seems from their feedback page that they have been late many times but ppl are happy about the quality of tea.  I can understand that, but I guess the online stores I've been using are just too good.<br /><br />Also it doesn't say anywhere on the product whether the flavor is natural or artificial. 2
The smell is very enticing to my two dogs, but quite objectionable to my husband. I gave half a treat to both dogs and my shepherd mix threw up within minutes of eating it. I'm not sure if it was the treat, but I'm a bit hesitant to try it again. 3
This chamomile tee is of average quality, but the most annoying part about it is that the expiration date on it was a month away from when it came.  I think that's a little fast to go through a 24-pack of chamomile tea, when you have a variety of K-cups at your disposal. 3
Review your order carefully! Listed at $22.69 but when checking out this item jumps up by Two ($2) dollars! What gives??? 1
I first tried these Newman Ginger Mints from a local grocery store. They were packaged in an Altoid-like tin and were the same size, shape and texture as Altoids.<br /><br />I wanted to find a cheaper place to purchase, so I came to Amazon and found these. I assumed they would be the same - just in a roll.<br /><br />They are not the same! The flavor is spot on, but the texture is very chalky and they are as big as life-savers.<br /><br />I would purchase again, but I think I will try to do some more research and find the ones in the tin. 4
Not impressed with this stuff at all.  Even though it's a tad expensive, I figured I would be getting my money's worth.  Nope!  You get a lot of clear gel bait in one tube and that's about the only good thing I can say.  The gel comes out insanely fast and sloppy and I could never manage to moderate it to a slow and steady release.  Once set, the ants barely even noticed it was there.  If I had to guess, I'd say that maybe 5-10% of the ants coming in and out of my house ever fell for the trap.  Some would just go near it and then walk away.  It managed to kill off a few, but not the colony.  Not even close.  The guy who gave it a 5-star review must not have heard of Combat.  MUCH better bait.  On the plus side, Hot Shot still makes great killing sprays.  But their bait is very disappointing. 2
Switch is a fantastic replacement for sodas. You still enjoy having the carbonation but with fruit juice. It is very satisfying. 5
The pear, pea, and green bean flavor is not a winner in our house.  My 13 month old spit out the first taste. I've tried it several times with her, even chilled from the fridge. But she doesn't like it. I tasted it and the pea flavor is prominent. 2
Why does Lipton tea taste so bad recently? I have been drinking it for years and now it's disgusting. I will be throwing out this box. I noticed others have made the same comments recently. [...] 1
It's great-tasting jerky, but if you're trying to avoid sweets, you might want to steer clear of this.  A one-ounce serving has seven grams of sugar.  Seven grams is almost a quarter of an ounce.  So a quarter of this product's weight comes from sugar.  Not exactly what you'd expect from a dried beef snack, but not much different from several other brands.  In fact, most popular brands have 5 or more grams of sugar per ounce.  If you don't mind the sugar, go for it! 3
My goldendoodle is picky and likes to change up his food once in a while. So I decided to try two other brands....what a mistake.<br /> Newman's own is really the best: my dog looks better, feels better, and the quality of food is very good. Do not do like I did and experiment around...my poor dogs stomach....stick with Newmans. 5
I used another one of the Clorox brands of cat litter, one that was more expensive, for my last cat who passed away. Now that I have two kittens, I thought I would try to save money. I found the Odor Shield formula at the local Big Box Store - only it did not say if it was scented or unscented, as it shows on the pictures here. I even wrote to the company, asking to verify before i purchased it, but they merely sent back a form letter. So I thought, it was by the same company that made the other litter, how bad could it be? For clumping ability, odor control, and my cats using it - it was very good. However, it was indeed scented, and there was now dust everywhere - not just near the litter boxes in my laundry room, but over most of the house. Also, the kittens reeked of the scent for quite a time after they had finished using the box. When one of my kittens started itching, I switched back to the other, more expensive brand of litter. Although I am still not sure if the extra scent and dust from the Fresh Step was the cause of the itching, I won't bother trying any box of Fresh Step- even if it says its unscented and low dust. Because the other litter has proved my point, and I can now fold clothes in the laundry room without worrying that I am putting clean clothes on top of a washer/dryer covered in litter dust. Sorry, Fresh Step, I was hoping on saving some money here. Anyway, although I did not purchase the cat litter from Amazon, I just wanted to warn others before they made the same mistake I did. 2
I ignored the other reviews about how these were now being made in China - I had checked the warnings and was comfortable that Dogswell hadn't been mentioned.  I've bought them many times, and my dog loves these treats!  Unfortunately, the most recent batch I got last week smelled really awful - like a mix of chemicals and rotten meat.  None of the bags I've gotten before smelled anything like this, and it was so strong that it filled my apartment with the odor.  I threw them out and would not recommend buying them.  It's not worth the risk. 1
The Red Caviar is very fresh and melts in my mouth in the way it is suposed to do.  I don't know how they can improve the packing, the can came all slime.<br /><br />It was send well packed (refrigeration) and it came on a timely manner. 4
Ginger is a naturally healthy remedy that is used for calming the stomach, seasickness, stimulating circulation/metabolism and is even good for arthritis. It's lingering spiciness is not appealing to everyone. Ginger Tea directions recommend 350 ml  (about 8.5 ounces) of hot water per packet. One mouthful at that strength was TOO STRONG for me. Too spicy initially and lingering spiciness for awhile afterwards. It did make me sweat so I can see using it as a cold remedy to naturally break a fever, calm the tummy and a worthy addition to the medicine cabinet. I did add an additional cup of hot water to the mix to make it palatable but the spiciness still lingered.<br /><br />I didn't find the tipping point where sipping this Ginger Tea became a pleasureable experience I'd enjoy on a regular basis. This is definitely NOT for the BLAND crowd. I  didn't discern lemon OR honey with either the original version or with the additional hot water, just spiciness. Although I can see the medicinal benefits of Ginger Tea, it's NOT my cup of tea.<br /><br />UPDATE: 4/10/2012 After Dr. recommended I cut back on caffeine I needed a warm drink that didn't leave me craving another like my "coffee treats". The flashback of this beverage returned. I ordered the pack of 6 and drink ONLY ONE A DAY compared to the 3 coffee treats a day - sure the calorie reduction will show eventually. The lingering spiciness is not conducive to munching any snacks either = less caloric intake. I've even used the mixed beverage with soy sauce and a splash of vinegar as a base for veggie soups. The lingering spicy ginger flavor leaves me feeling satisfied and minimizes my "grazing".<br /><br />***STILL 3 STARS so not to sway readers that it's the best thing since sliced bread. It's OK and works for me and my purpose :) 3
I ordered a case of this popcorn using the automatic re-order system.  After reading some of the reviews about the quality of the popcorn, I chose to give it a chance, price being one of my primary reasons for ordering and the automatic re-order feature.  Well, as they say, you get what you pay for.  Only about 2/3 of the kernels pop and of the ones that do, the popped corn is very small in size.  The product tastes really good, what you're able to get from the package.  By the time you figure the amount of unpopped kernels, you would be much better off spending a little more money for a premium product. 2
This was the nastiest flavored coffee I have ever had in kcups. I purchase many different kinds of flavored coffee and caramel is my favorite but this one made me gag. It smelled like buttery cheese and the taste was not what I expected. I will stick to gloria jeans and timothys flavored coffees. This was my first wolfgang puck kcup and will be the last I order of his brand. I thought maybe I got a bad cup but I brewed 3 and I opened the other box and tried those since it comes with two boxes and same nastiness. 1
I think Shake and Bake can truly be a lifesaver. I've tried store brands, but this is definately something you want the name brand of. Chicken and pork comes out tasty and it's so easy to make.<br /><br />The only complaints I might have are that I think it should come in a resealable pouch- I never use the while pack at once and generally the cooking times recommended on the box are about 5 to 10 minutes short. 4
taste great but if your using an air popper not so great the little seeds will fall out before popping. 2
most people i know have a favorite piece in bridge mix--the smooth, dark chocolate ovals with the jellied orange inside.  i tasted these sunkist sticks at costco and they're almost as good.  the chocolate outer covering isn't quite as smooth.  however, i've since been frustrated and have been unable to find them in any food store-not jewel, costco, dominicks, treasure island. 3
First, let me say that I prefer extra-bold K-Cup coffees and only occasionally drink a medium blend, and never decaf. I bought three Wolfgang Puck coffees several months ago: Rodeo Drive Blend; French Roast; and Sumatra Kopi Raya. All three are quite drinkable, though they do not measure up to a few of the extra-bold blends from Coffee People: Kona Blend; Organic Blend; Jet Fuel; and Black Tiger. Even better than these, though, is my new favorite, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M7TTYG">Green Mountain's Revv</a>. Those who prefer a strong, dark cup of coffee (even at the larger mug setting) should try that brand.<br /><br />Previously, I had found the dark-roast Green Mountain coffees rather boring, but Revv lives up to the hype, both in strength and flavor. Another great Green Mountain coffee is their Espresso Blend (though Amazon doesn't stock it, so the prices tend to be higher here than in brick-and-mortar stores such as Bed Bath and Beyond). Finally, a favorite regular over the years has been <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M5W7YQ">Emeril's Big Easy Bold</a>. It's a very nice coffee, though don't expect the New Orleans experience of chicory flavor.<br /><br />Bottom line: You won't go wrong with the Wolfgang Puck coffees, but for my taste they do not stand out among the available bold coffees. 3
I recently contacted Amazon and Vita Coco, due to the new nasty taste. I thought I had gotten a bad batch and literally poured all of them down the drain. Amazon was great and sent a replacement free of charge and I received it the very next day. But no luck, same nasty taste. After a little bit of researching found out that they decided for whatever reason to add new ingredients. Why?. Anyways, The taste with the NEW ingredients is nothing more than a mixture of water/sugar/vinegar, and it leaves a sour taste in your mouth. So dissapointed. I cancelled my subscription because it not longer tastes like real coconut water, and threw the second shipment I received away! 1
As with any food product, your opinion may differ. I found that this meal was very short on flavor, and not visually appealing. It does not look at all like the picture on the cover. The pasta, the chicken and the 'sauce' were all the same color. The 'sauce' appeared to be some melted cheese food product. I should have tried this first from the (more expensive) store that sells them in units, not packages, because with this item, eating it once was more than enough. 1
This is by far my favorite licorice....to the point I have a case delivered on a regular monthly basis......an option offered by Amazon......a VERY convenient service...... 5
if every seller was like JR mushrooms the world would be a much better place. They wont stop until there customer is completly satisfied. I ordered some winter black truffles from them and got my package lightning fast but came to find out that it wasnt what i ordered. I called JR and they said they sent better quality black truffles that cost more for the same price and this story doesnt end they even sent a jar of the original truffles i ordered just so i can taste the diffrence FOR FREE!!!!!!!!! Name another seller that would do that. 5
I have always enjoyed Orville Redenbacher brand popcorns, whether it is SmartPop or Natural or Sweet & Savory type. And with such past experiences, I went ahead and bought this particular popcorn (Pop-Up Bowl Butter Microwave Popcorn), even though this particular product is way more expensive than the bag version.<br /><br />First impression: Packaging looks great and the illustration on the box lures you to try it at once as soon as you look at the box.<br /><br />Cooking: I used my Sharp microwave 1200 W, 1.2 cubic feet of sheer raw cooking power. Even though my microwave has sensor based cooking feature for popcorn and other food items, I set the microwave timer to 2 minutes and 30 seconds, so as to not leave anything to chance. Instructions on the pack are very clear about up & down side markings, cooking time, handling instructions etc. After cooking for 2 & 1/2 minutes, I carefully removed the popcorn bowl (as it miraculously transforms itself into).<br />Now comes the little tricky part. Instruction on the bowl clearly indicates how to handle the bowl and how to remove the top plastic off the bowl, so as to dig in and help yourself with the buttery popcorn. So I tried opening the bowl by pulling the plastic from one side, but to no avail. So I tried the other side with more frustration and no better result. I contemplated using a scissor to cut the plastic open, but then I would have to clean the scissor, since all the residual butter would be transferred to the scissor creating a mess. I was surprised that all this hype and commercial about bowl popcorn really amounts to such bad packaging. Then, I forcefully pried open the plastic and got hot residual vapors on my fingers. Boy, what a scalding experience it was!! But I endured the agony so as to try this new popcorn.<br /><br />Taste: Popcorn kernels were large and uniform, and so were popped popcorn. It smelled very buttery, very aromatic indeed. They were crunchy, buttery and crisp. However, I could not have distinguished this final product from the regular Orville Redenbacher popcorns from regular paper bags.<br /><br />Conclusion: If this product tastes the same as regular same brand paper bag product, why am I spending 3 times more money to buy this item? So that I could just eat from a bowl instead of a paper bag? Now I am not a dodo and neither are regular Amazon customers looking for a better bang for their buck, so then what on the earth would make one shell out more money? I am amazed at the marketing department at work here. Do they really think that giving people bowl instead of a paper bag would somehow cast a Harry Potter like spell on us and force us to buy this product on a regular basis? Well guess again marketing guys, as far as I am concerned, No Popcorn Bowl for me. If you like the idea of eating your popcorn from a paper bowl, and if you are willing to put up with the inconvenience and mess and higher price, then this is the product for you.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) Clear instructions<br />2) Tempting packaging<br />3) Giant uniform popcorn<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) EXPENSIVE<br />2) No easy way to tear apart the plastic top off the final popcorn bowl<br />3) Did I mention EXPENSIVE 2
I have been drinking Costa Rican Coffee for years. What came out of this bag was too bland to be Costa Rican.. Or maybe just too old. 1
Kettle chips now look, feel and taste like Lays.  These chips used to be my favorite when it was crinkle cut and hefty.  Now, no longer my favorite. 1
Glennys organic soy crisps have always been my favorite brand until the last few times I've ordered the 6 pack from amazon.  The crisps are overcooked and have a burnt flavorless taste to them. I wind up throwing out most of the bags because they taste like cardboard. I'm given up on Glenny's organic crisps. 2
These are okay, but not the best and definitely not worth the hefty price. I wouldn't order these again, nor would I buy them if I saw them in a store. I usually really like Chocolate, Toffee covered almonds, but these really disappointed me. The toffee tasted only of butter and salt, the chocolate had very little flavor at all. I usually prefer to give favorable reviews, but there is no way to spin these to make them sound any better than they are, and what they are is over-priced and tasteless, and what you do taste isn't at all good.<br /><br />Hope this helps and Happy Shopping! 2
This Quaker instant oatmeal tastes good, however in order to truly feel like you have had a fulfilling meal, you need at least two of the packets as a serving. I brought this to work so I would have something to eat when I forgot to bring my breakfast in. It is a little dry and the consistency is like that of paste, so I tend to add a little half and half just before serving to make it a little creamier.<br /><br />It is okay in a pinch, but not something that I would want to consume on a daily basis. 3
While I like the company, these potatoes were just a little too much for me to handle, the sauce was very salty and very garlicky. I'm not sure if I would buy these again. 2
I've used this particular brand of 'white truffle oil' to make truffle butter for my steaks.  I have also drizzled over popcorn for an amazingly new taste.  So if you love the smell of truffles, then you'll probably like this product.<br /><br />My gripe is with the labeling.  It makes it seem as if real truffles are somehow involved with this product, they are not.  If you look at the ingredients, there are two:  olive oil and white truffle aroma.  Well truffle aroma is just 2,4-Dithiapentane.  You are buying 'perfumed' olive oil that smells like truffles, or at least what most of us have been lead to believe truffles smell like.  So buyer beware, it tastes and smells great, but this is not a real truffle product. 3
Bottom line, these taste like cheap hotel coffee. Your least favorite Nespresso capsule variety is 100X better tasting than these capsules. Taste is what matters, ECC capsules are awful.<br /><br />This goes for Cremoso, Indiad'oro, Espressivo - unfortunately, I bought all three types. Hardly a difference between them, but I listed them in awful to undrinkable order.<br /><br />However, if that's not enough of a reason to avoid, consider these;<br /><br />-they're difficult to insert in Nespresso machines<br />-they're difficult to remove from Nespresso machines<br />-they frequently blister during brewing, thus "brewing" coffee from the side of the capsules<br />-they are stale right out of the package (though the expiration date reads otherwise)<br />-all ten per box are not quite vacuum-sealed in plastic, hence opening the plastic hastens further spoilage<br />-they are only a dime less than real Nespresso capsules!!!<br /><br />I actually threw away unused capsules, they were that bad. They are not worth free. Quite weak for a company started by a former Nespresso executive. Perhaps they have a serious quality control issue in the U.S.? 1
I've only used this product to make pancakes so far, but so far, so good.  Except of course for the first attempt.  When I mixed the batter according to the package directions, it appeared WAAAY too thick to possibly make pancakes.  Sooooo... I added and added and added liquid until it seemed like pancake consistency.  DO NOT DO THIS!  That first batch, although the crumbs tasted just fine, didn't hold together, couldn't be flipped without the entire thing falling apart, and frankly made a huge mess.  Entirely my fault, admittedly.  I plan to try using it for pizza dough and deep-fry coating soon. 4
Read the reviews and thought this coffee was 5 stars.  Received the coffee and proceeded to open the package. What wasn't there was any aroma. Had to stick my nose inside the package to even smell if it was coffee. Caramel? Well I proceeded to brew a cup. Smelled like normal 3 star coffee, tasted like plain ole coffee. Nothing special just plain ole coffee. 3
Loved the original!  Hate this new recipe.  It was fine to have alternative recipes - weight control (BS BTW), less sugar.  But, to make the alternative the only option a consumer can buy??? Horrible decision and even worse product.  I could not even eat one bowl of this mess.  it is so far off the mark that I would rather go hungry than attempt to eat this crap!  My dog could make a better batch of oatmeal with some kibbles and her butt!  This product is a disgrace and should be taken off the store shelves - never allowed to return! 1
I am very pleased with this gluten free bread mix. It has very good flavor. It even smells like real bread baking. 4
I really like the "on the go" mixes that are single or double servings in a tube. I drink the Ocean Spray and Crystal Light ones all the time. I like iced tea so I figured that I might like this too. That wasn't the case. I found this didn't mix in as well and while it smelled awesome, the favor just wasn't there for me. It smelled like strawberries but didn't really taste like them. There was maybe a hint of strawberries when you first take a drink but the after taste from the green tea didn't really work for me. I think I'd skip these next time. 3
I am a big fan of Kind Bars.  However the Kind Plus, Almond Walnut Macadamia + Protein bars left a biting aftertaste as though they were rancid.  I tried two bars with the same result.  Will not order the bars again<br />On the bright side, the Almond & Coconut are delicious.  Will definitely order them again -often. 1
Muy buen producto. por su tama&ntilde;o, uno lo puede llevar a culquier lado junto con su laptop y hacer culquier grabaci&oacute;n, en cualquier momento. Antes de tener este producto, tuve muchos problemas con la entrada de audio en mi mac, pero con el icicle por fin pude tener una entrada decente para cualquier micr&oacute;fono. Hasta el momento no genera ruidos de ning&uacute;n tipo y la calidad es impresionante para algo tan simple. 5
I use currants a lot. They are difficult to find in the supermarket so I am now on a subscription delivery system with Amazon. I put them in baked goods, in rice pilaff (with allspice and onions for an Armenian pilaff) in chick pea salads to add a touch of sweetness to a savory dish, in wild rice and farro salad, in a braised chicken dish with lots of onions, etc. You get the idea. They are not just for baking. You can be creative and add a handful wherever you want a bit of sweetness in a savory dish. Because they are tiny they can be a bit dry so it's best to soak them and drain them well before using. Or keep them in a container in the refrigerator after you've soaked and drained the entire box. That way they are ready to toss into whatever you are cooking that day. 4
I should've done more research before buying this product. My dog seemed to have very little appetite when she was on this food. She had skin problems. She had loose stools. Unfortunately I didn't want to believe that it had anything to do with the food. I finally decided to look into it after months of trying to get her to eat it more regularly and found that my problems weren't uncommon with this food. I've since switched her to Blue Buffalo food and her skin problems have gotten better, she has become more energetic, her stools are no longer loose and she happily eats. 1
I bought Wasa Crisp'n light crackers at my local supermarket yesterday because they were out of the Wasa rye crackers I usually by - that I really like. This was the last box and I am so happy I bought it!  I love these!  I enjoy most of the crackers by this company, but this is now my absolute favorite and I plan on buying it through Amazon because it is cheaper, I can save time and gas physically shopping and the convenience (Amazon has great customer svc.) is what I appreciate!  By the way, I enjoy these crackers plain and I've eaten them with salmon cooked lightly in olive oil and capers and it was superb! 5
All I can say is that our two dogs love these things almost more than anything else. They each get one a day and very much look forward to that special time. These long lasting treats are well worth the money for us. 5
These are disgusting and inedible. They are incredibly small cuts, almost like slaw. They are packed in citric acid which has completely saturated the product and gives them a horrible aftertaste. I can't believe this product is even being sold as it tastes nothing like palm hearts. I just purchased an entire case of 12 and will be throwing them all out. 1
there is not much one can say about Hawaiian punch.  my kids love it.  the only r eason i took off 2 stars is that i ordered 8 64 oz bottles and received 4 128 oz bottles.  i need the smaller bottles so my kids can pour on their own.  i will have to revert to going to the supermarket for future Hawaiian  punch needs. 3
These beef jerky strips are really good.  Texture is just right.  Flavor is peppery, but also just right.  Could be more smoky for me.  This is a repeat buy on my part. 4
The coffee is just OK, a little weak. The price is a little high and it is not worth the extra money. 3
The Wabash valley purple popcorn is really good & a lot fewer hulls than the regular grocery-store brand. It is the favorite in our house! However, if you go to the company's own website you can buy the 6 lb bag for $8.99 - almost twenty dollars cheaper than here! You will have to pay shipping, but even with the shipping it is still cheaper than the amazon price. 4
I had high hopes for this as I really like dragonwell tea. Sadly, this did not live up to my expectations. Perhaps it was old (purchaced as part of Amazon's grocery clearance)and had lost its flavor, as the cup it makes is drinkable, but bland and uninteresting, but all three Tao of Tea products I purchaced disappointed me. If you keep your expectations low, it's an OK tea. 2
though i did not purchase this through amazon, i did get this recently from thw grocery store, and have to admit im really disappointed.  i followed the instructions the first evening EXACTLY as instructed with the included paper, and no results.  the second day, i brewed just a little longer, still no luck, (basing this off some other comments from other users here on amazon) then today i only did 6oz, not 12 as the paper instructs, and even brewed this for 6 minutes.  still nothing.<br /><br />i really wanted this to work for me like it has for others, i had heard good things and was so excited, but still no luck.  i guess im one of those people this doesnt affect. ill keep trying it daily till i run out, but looks like ill have to try something else.<br /><br />as for taste, its not bad. just tastes like tea leaves, not deliciously fantastic, but not nose-pinchingly undrinkable. good luck to anyone else. hope you have more success with this than i did 1
I have 2 very food motivated pugs (never met one that wasn't...). The outgoing one LOVES banging this toy around the house for hours. The shy one won't go near it. the first day with this, I filled it up almost full with kibble so it dispensed more easily, but she still got frustrated trying to figure out how to use it. After a couple of days, she can empty 1/2 cup of kibble from the small one in an hour :) and will continue to play with it as long as it has food in it.... the larger the treat size, the harder it is to come out. A couple kibble falls out every minute or so; a treat the size of a Zuke's Mini Bakes will come out every 5 to 10 minutes. I put 1/2 cup kibble and 10 mini bakes inside to keep her occupied for an hour. Note: the more full the jug is, the faster the dispensing rate (good for unmotivated dogs). The smaller the jug, the more full it is when a given amount of food is placed in it, thus if my pug had a hard time with the small size, I would buy the x-small so she could get the food out more easily. After a week of using it, I realize the small size is just fine.<br /><br />Pros:<br />dog loves it<br />durable<br />keeps them occupied for unlimited time<br />i like the "difficulty" level of this toy: it is not too easy that it's emptied in 15 minutes like a treat ball, but not so hard that she won't play with it<br /><br />cons:<br />rope is difficult to clean and attracts moisture<br />the noise as she bangs it around the house is insane 4
Yes, these gluten free cookies are absolutely delicious!  There's just no getting around that.  As I was munching my absolutely delicious cookie I had a look-see at the Nutrition Facts printed on the wrapper - that's when I had my second "WOW!".<br />ONE cookie is TWO servings - when was the last time you cut a cookie in half?  So....if you are glutinous enough to eat your entire cookie at one time, you have consumed 340 calories (100 are fat calories)and 40 mg. of cholesterol.  I was astounded to say the least.  As someone with a gluten allergy, I can tell you that there are other really good cookies out there without these kinds of overloads.  Try the Glutino sandwich cookies, for example. 3
<span class="tiny"> Length:: 1:38 Mins<br /><br /></span>skip the Pad Thai. go for this.<br />edit: this soup has moved up to the #6 spot when I typed in Dr. McDougall today. I'm glad, because I want to order this for a while, and don't want this soup to be seen as unprofitable by Right Foods (Dr. McDougall). 5
I love this pasta!! It's not sticky like gluten free rice pasta and doesn't have the weird taste of whole grain pasta. It's pretty much the same to me as regular pasta and I grew up on italian cooking. Now that I have digestive issues I eat gluten free and have to say this is my new favorite pasta! Thanks Amazon for your subscribe and save which makes it affordable as well. Eating healthy is expensive and it's great to have this option to make it more affordable!! 5
I love the tast of the the cranberry squares.  A touch of tartness, dense but soft to the palate.  Eating them in place of other 'sweets' seems to kill the urge to gourge on other sweets for me.  My wife finds them too dense, so if that is a problem for you... best to try it as a 'test' and see if you like it first. 4
A kind friend bought a six pack of these for us to try out. My pre teen has Celiac and our kitchen is GF and we are always willing to try out different GF items. Our current bread standby is from Glutino and, while it is not perfect, my kids enjoy it - especially when used to make french toast!<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EVG8H4">The Gluten-Free Pantry Favorite Sandwich Bread Mix, 22-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />The first four packs I made I followed to the letter. I was a little disappointed that the instructions on the back for using the bread mix for oven baked bread, bagels, pizza dough, cinnamon bread and egg free bread all stated in large bold lettering that it required the use of a heavy duty stand mixer. I don't have one and so those options were out for me.  But still, using the recipe for breadmakers turned out decent (if fairly flat) loaves. I made the basic recipe and the sweet bread. The instructions state that you should make this on a Basic White bread setting instead of the Gluten free setting on your breadmaker and that is what I did.<br /><br />(Note that if you are buying this mix to bake in your oven, the package states that you need to use a stand mixer!)<br /><br />My child said that the bread was okay but that it had a wierd texture and taste to it. I think the texture was due to the grainy nature of the 3 rice flours in the mix. The flavor, I think, is the Millet flour which tends to have a bitter aftertaste. Millet does have good nutritional value but if the flavor turns off the child from eating it what is the point??<br /><br />Anyway, I still had two packs to go so I decided to tweak things a little. I made the sweet bread recipe again but this time I used butter instead of oil and baked it in my Zojirushi breadmaker on a programmed gluten free program and Voila! The bread rose beautifully! It had a light airy feel to it; a bit spongy - almost like a cake. The 1/4 cup sugar covered up the bitterness of the millet, home made butter (could use unsalted) instead of the melted oil made it rich - and it tastes almost exactly like Challah bread!<br /><br />So if you are just GF and not CF as well, this is a sure fire way to make some excellent sweet egg bread.  And if, like us, you miss your Shabbat Challah, this bread mix will be a wonderful addition to your kitchen! 4
My dughter used these, and loved the fresh taste of the tomatoes!  Said it was like she had just picked them fron a garden! 5
I was disappointed by these eucalyptus leaves - they have a stale, oregano-like smell. Ask your local florist to get you some fresh leaves! 1
I got this as a gift for my girlfriend's mother who had mentioned getting heart burn from coffee - even though she loves coffee.  I thought this might make a reasonable fix to the situation.  After trying though she seemed to be a little less worried with the heart burn and little more concerned with the taste.  She didn't have heartburn, but she also didn't drink very much either - due to taste.  She thought it tasted a little stale and bland.  Maybe it was just a bad batch, but seems the process to limit the acid also limits the flavor.  Too bad, I had hoped this was going to be a big winner. 2
Good product. Dogs are vary satified with it.  Would like to have in a larger bag(20 lbs.), if this could/would be an option. 4
When we opened the box, we found it to be full of small worms. My husband was able to remove them with a small brush but they shouldn't have been there in the first place. We have gone through many many boxes of greenies and this is the first time we found worms in them. The dogs love the greenies and it helps their teeth a lot. 3
This product is great. The flavor was to die for. I will purchase again, when my sugar high goes away?  : D 5
I like Sprout foods, but the texture on this one is thick, it's like a clump of mac n cheese that got left in the pan overnight and solidified.  I have to really work it to loosen it so my daughter doesn't gag on it. 2
The wasabi flavor was not as strong as I like. I have had others (in the large 39 ounce plastic jar from Costco that were better, but they are no longer available.  These are an adequate substitute.  The smaller container is handy.<br /><br />PK 3
sweet, juicy and yummy. I have to try hard not to eat too much at one time. So addictive. It tastes just like those in Asian market. Actually this one tastes a bit better. 5
I have two dogs.  One dog ate all of it, but he even eats durian fruit. The other was very hesitant and didn't finish it. I won't buy this again. 3
At the time of this review, the online product information does not list allergens. I took a chance with Newman's Own because another of their amazon products listed ingredients but did not indicate any allergens. And in my experience, many dark chocolate products are not processed with peanuts. Unfortunately, both Newman's Own products I ordered contain peanut warnings.<br /><br />Specifically for the peppermint cups: May contain Peanuts, Other Nuts, Milk Powder, Wheat, and Soy.<br /><br />My son couldn't enjoy them due to his peanut allergy, however, I found them to be very smooth and creamy. 3
Loved the original!  Hate this new recipe.  It was fine to have alternative recipes - weight control (BS BTW), less sugar.  But, to make the alternative the only option a consumer can buy??? Horrible decision and even worse product.  I could not even eat one bowl of this mess.  it is so far off the mark that I would rather go hungry than attempt to eat this crap!  My dog could make a better batch of oatmeal with some kibbles and her butt!  This product is a disgrace and should be taken off the store shelves - never allowed to return! 1
I don't know which herb is so tasty in here.. but it's a great combination.  I don't like licorice flavors, and this tea is great because I can reap the great benefits of licorice root, without tasting it!<br /><br />It really does help my symptoms, and drinking it for prevention has worked great for me as well.  And you cannot beat the shipping price (free with super saver shipping) with Amazon. 5
So far this is the closest thing to the Thai restaurant I've tried.  And though it's close, it's still not exactly the same.  It does have that one spice that other Thai teas are missing. It's really outstanding. 5
For some reason my husband ordered a TON of this stuff for me for Christmas.  We live in Chicago & it's cold so I didn't try it right away.  I was craving something sweet so I finally made some tonight.  It tastes like icy chocolate, & it's a bit chalky.  To be honest it reminds me of the old powdered slimfast.  I've got a whole canister and 5 packets of this stuff & I don't know what I'm going to do with it. 2
The flavor of the tea is strong and smooth, and a flavor that you would expect in a good English Breakfast Tea.  My only complaint is that the tea is ground very finely, and the tea caddy doesn't keep tea particles from getting into the tea, and some are fine enough to even pass through a tight strainer.<br /><br />The Assam of London loose tea that Amazon carries is much better. 3
I guess if you want to keep raking in the money you have to fudge and mislead folk.  That's what SmokeHouse has done by adding 'USA' to their name.  I can say this without fear because the packages I have sitting on the kitchen table in front of me clearly say that this is a "Product of China."<br /><br />You know, the China where they feel free to add melamine to products for human babies (2008), and dogs and cats (2007 and 2010) -- all so that the protein levels register higher than they normally would :(<br /><br />I am so disappointed.  Honestly, my little Jack-a-Bee puppy loves their products, but I won't be purchasing the Chicken Chips or Chicken Breast Strips again.  I can't imagine telling my children that the lively little pup they love was made sick (or died!) because of some cheap-*** short-cut.<br /><br />I'd rather pay more money and have it manufactured here in the States.<br /><br />Pam T~<br />mom/blogger/dog lover 1
This was okay in a pinch, if you like Velveeta.  The broccoli in the package was very small, almost like some dried herbs.  You'd be better off throwing in some frozen broccoli while cooking this.<br /><br />I tend to make things from scratch, but if you're rushed for time & need to get something on the table, this was acceptable. 3
I made the mistake of buying a 50 pack of these k cups when they were on sale. The first few were decent, but the more I drank them, the more I started to dislike the flavor. At this point, I'm pretty much forcing myself to get through them since I don't want to waste them. The best way I can describe the flavor is a mixture of watered down coffee and old, stale butterscotch candy. Ugh. 1
I have never had good luck with Pro Flowers.  Flowers/plants came in boxes, knocked around, bashed, wilted.  Tried 2 or 3 times, for awhile(10-15 yrs ago) they were THE big online floral service.  Not anymore, and certainly not for me.<br /><br />Update:5/17/11<br /><br /> Mother's Day Special 2011:  All day long Neal Boortz was pushing the $19.95 Mothers Day Special: "A Dozen Roses, click on the microphone at website, type in Neal (Boortz)  get free vase!"  Well, I did all that, and clicked submit, but right before it submitted I noticed my total was over $63!  I immediately went back to the website and cancelled.  I saw the $10 shipping fee, bringing the total to $29, approx, but failed to see the fine print: $10 Extra charge for Saturday shipping, $16 extra charge for a pink vase instead of clear, and whatever extra shipping/handling fees they added bringing the total to  almost $64.  I apologize hugely for missing all that fine print, but will NEVER use Pro Flowers for anything, advise you look elsewhere for florist needs.  Words of wisdom: find a florist in you hometown that you like, use them for everything, even out of town stuff.  If they treat you right at home, chances are they will treat you right for out-of-town orders. 1
I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY DOG AND HE TOOK ONE LOOK AT IT PLAYED WITH IT FOR A FEW MINUTES AND NEVER LOOKED AT IT AGAIN- IT WAS A WASTE OF MONEY.. IT DID NOT INTERESTED HIM AT ALL.. SO DISAPPOINTED... 1
Jack Links' turkey jerky is so delicious. This stuff is dry and stringy. Do not like. I might end up putting it in soup or something. 2
Very satisfied with this product ; excellent flavor and texture; recomment for those looking for good  breakfast choice 5
I can only go as low as 1 star on the review, though I'd like to rate it a "0"- this item still shows in stock, but clearly isn't, which is why my order was canceled from Amazon today. Amazon suggested I search out the item again, and in doing so I see that this same vendor states the item is available. Not so.<br /><br />Technically this review does not relate to the quality of the product, just the ability to be able to ship it. Good luck! 1
I ordered this after I tried the Green Mountain Hot Chocolate just to try something different and compare. The other reviewers are totally correct. There is a really strange after taste. I threw out the whole box. I had a cup of the Green Mountain today and was so relieved to know I can have yummy hot chocolate again. Pass on this brand. 1
I've tried several of the Blue Diamond jar almonds and the Butter Toffee almonds are the best.  They would probably be my favorite almond, but they're high-carb. I guess the trick is to only eat a few at a time....  We can all do that, right?  :-)<br /><br />I agree with the other reviewer who said that the Blue Diamond almonds in the cans are better than the ones in the jars -- my favorite are the Vinegar & Salt -- but the Butter Toffee almonds are the exception. 5
These have pretty good flavor which doesn't disappear after the first minute. They are stickier than Charms sour balls or Lifesavers, but they are each individually wrapped so they don't stick to each other and half a roll doesn't grab all your pocket lint. 3
Delicate ground hazelnut cookies for a Ladies tea, NOT for children or most men! Appreciated only by sophisticated palates, because they are neither cloyingly sweet or fatty. Set these aside for unexpected guests you'd like to impress. 1
I have to agree with the other reviewer that the package does not seem consistent with the contents.  I'm not taking any chances on plastic in the microwave. I'll stick with Earth's Best. 2
I've been more concerned about my dog's health these days as he starts to gain double digits.  My little dachshund of nearly 11 years isn't as spry as he used to be.  Additionally, he's been getting fatty lumps on his body that are apparently common with some varieties of dogs, but unwanted nonetheless.  I've read the lumps in particular can be caused by feeding dogs a diet too high in carbohydrates and low in protein, so when I saw these beef sticks were grain-free, I jumped on it.<br /><br />I feel very safe knowing these things are made in the USA.  Buying electronics, dishwashers, and clothes made in China or other parts of Asia doesn't make me that uncomfortable, but feeding my dog food from those areas really frightens me, given what's been covered in the news lately.<br />And of course my dog loves these things!  They're decently hard to chew through, so it's almost like a small rawhide chew toy, but made out of real beef, not whatever the heck those things are made from.<br /><br />Overall, I feel pretty satisfied with my purchase, and have signed up for the subscribe and save shipment option.  The only thing I'm not too thrilled about is the price, but I guess for my peace of mind the price is right. 4
Can't tell if I'm really satisfied with these or not.  First, they're hard.  Almost like hard candy.  I tend to mix it with my cereal hoping that they'll soften from the milk but they don't always do.  I'm not sure if you can really benefit from these.  They're so dried that they seem "lifeless" as in the majority of goji benefits have been sucked out.  I won't be buying these again unless I see improvement from eating the rest of these hard goji berries. 3
Looks can be deceiving, especially with this product:  The cute, tiny can looks great, but don't fall for it!  This little guy packs an amazing 140 calories per 8.3 oz can.  My favorite 24 oz Arizona Iced Tea(black/white tea with sugar) has almost just as many calories(150) and almost 3 times the size of Switch.  Also, do not be tempted with "100% Vitamin C and 20% Vitamin E" pitch either.  Most of us consume 100% of daily Vitamin C without even trying through foods and anything extra get eliminated.<br /><br />The taste however does feel a bit more natural than other artificial orange sodas though, so that's the only plus.  Also, if you do not worry about gaining weight, I guess this is a good way to get a sugar rush in a tiny can.<br /><br />Overall, a good-tasting product, but there are many other low-caloric alternatives out there.  A can of Diet Coke and a multivitamin anyone? 3
Best flavored k cup I've ever had! I recommend this for everyone. Great flavor! I've given it to all my friends and they get hooked. 5
The first shipment was truly colossal in taste and size, The second shipment was colossal in taste but at least 1/2 of the can is pits and pieces. Very disappointed-had bought the can to use for entertaining. Very hesitant to buy again. 3
Who takes a sugarless product and suddenly adds sugar to it - without changing one speck of packaging (except the ingredients list and calorie content)?  Manipulative? Fraudulent? Stupid? Whatever the rationale, Cascadian Farm messed up big time on this one.  I'm going to avoid the cereal and the whole brand from now on unless they make a change (Remember Tropicana's rollback of their ugly new packaging?  Consumers CAN impact these corporate choices by switching allegiances). 1
These chili lime chips have only 100 calories and 4 grams of fat per bag. Most 100-cal snacks that I have had are tiny portions, but these chips are a normal sized serving.<br /><br />They aren't my favorite Pop Chip flavor, but there definetly is a lot of taste. It is strong flavor that grows on you. When I first tried them, I would have said 3 stars, but now I really like them. A few other Pop Chip fans I talked to rate them at 3 - 4 stars too.<br /><br />In the end, they are pretty not-too-bad-for-you, but the taste is, well... a matter of taste. 4
We love Reeses in our family &lt;they're kind of an obsession>, esp the holiday-themed ones! Unfortunately, we were very disappointed with this particular purchase. The turnaround time with Amazon Prime was wonderful, as always, but every last one of the Reeses Eggs were squishy and had melted in the bag. For Reeses fans such as ourselves, we were very upset. :( 2
I have been buying Purely O's for the past few years.  Yes, I was paying a premium, however it was worth it.  The ingredients were organic, these was a decent fiber content, and most importantly, there was no corn or sugar.  Recently General Mills (company that owns Cascadian Farms)decided to covertly change the formula, add a bunch of sugar and corn, and pass it off as the same cereal.  I opened the box and thought that that there was a packaging mix-up.  I thought they put the Honey O's in the Purely O's box.  I called the customer service number (which I have never done before) to let them know.  To my surprise I was told that it was not a mixup, and that they had changed the formula.  I was stunned.  I had finally found a fortified cereal without all of the junk in it that I liked.  Now it is just another overpriced mainstream sugar cereal.  Obviously General Mills is trying to maximize profits by cheapening the ingredients in their line of foods.  Poor form in my opinion.  I agree with the other reviews.  At the very least, inform people.  They have lost me as a Purely O's customer, and I question whether or not I can trust the brand in general.  Don't bother with this cereal.  It's no longer worth the premium you need to pay. 1
My dog enjoys these treats in moderation.  Because they are dried, he seems to enjoy them less the more he eats them.  With water, the treats may be much more flavorful.  After having a fair amount, he starts to lose interest in them until he can drink.<br /><br />This brings me to a question regarding serving size.  The container recommends 2-3 cubes per day for a medium breed.  The issue I'm having is that the size of the cubes is so very inconsistent.  Some bits are the size of a pea while others of a grape.  The rest are a variety of sizes in between.  Some consistency would be preferred.<br /><br />Also, this product comes highly recommended for training because it is low in fat.  My dog certainly won't learn anything with just 2-3 of these per day.  Like most dogs, he is highly motivated by food so 20-30 treats is more accurate.  To make this possible, I have to dice them up into smaller pieces or shift through to find the little bits.<br /><br />At least these treats are natural and thus healthier than some of the other options.  I just didn't expect to have to prepare them first. 3
i dont get the big deal. First of all they are not nearly as delicious as regular chips so they dont even satisfy the same chip craving in me. They taste okay but slightly carboardy styrofoamy - i.e qualities that you do NOT want in a chip 3
I purchased the hemp oil for my mom to help with pain relieve. The Omega oils are suppose to help with join movement and pain. I have noticed that when she takes the vitamin her pain is less than the times that we are out and she has to wait. 5
I bought these looking for a healthy alternative to fruit roll-up type snacks, and they are insomuch that healthy means they dont poison you, however they have nothing to offer more than a heaping 15g of sugar (half a soft drink), more or less the same taste for each flavor, little to no nutritional value (being mostly apple juice), and all that at $.66 a piece. Not a big deal given that there are no real alternatives, except wait, they taste exactly like prunes, which have 10x less sugar, alot of nutritional value, and cost about a 1/3 of the price of this pathetic attempt of pushing empty sugar on kids under the guide of being healthy organic food.<br /><br />Clif Co. stooped to the level of major corporations and attempted to manipulate its customers through deceptive marketing practices. They have certainly lost my business. 1
I couldn't drink the full cup. It was sweet, and somewhat off, maybe like coffee that had sat in your cup all day, and you don't notice that, and take a big swallow of it. Not awful, but not great. I normally like illy espresso and am willing to add a touch of sugar to that. Perhaps it's another person's idea of a "touch" that makes it not palatable to me. 3
I have no idea what all these reviews for this brand of dieters tea are talking about. I followed the directions nothing happened. Brewed a stronger cup-still nothing.Even measured out the water to 6oz and let the tea bag seep for five minutes-nothing just stronger tasting tea. On the box it tells you not to drink more than 1 cup in a 24 hour period- I drank three the other day not even thinking about it and nothing happened! Just tasted like cranberry tea and nothing else. Strange. 1
I've been enjoying this tea for years.  This tea is good mornings, afternoons or evenings.  My local store went out of buisiness....Thanks Amazon!  I use a bodum tea press to prepare a pot. 5
While the shipment was quick...more than half of the cans in the shipment were dented.  One cat liked it after introducing several times... the other did not like it. 2
Ok first of all right when I opened the package which came in two days since I used two day shipping, The can was dented all around and literally punctured in some spots. I have the can in the right temperature and follow the directions, It has been exactly two weeks and not even a sprout is showing. I cannot contact seller for some reason because the option is not there, so this smells kind of fishy. I demand a refund or another NON DENTED/WORKING can. 1
I tried this and the first cup was wonderful and then lo and behold, only hot milk, no coffee.<br /><br />Don't these people have some kind of quality control?<br /><br />Trying to make coffee for company and having only milk was very annoying and the other couple would not even consider buying the machine. 2
The label is misleading. Cento actually sells two kind of San Marzano with the same label other than one that says D.O.P. certified. You will receive the one w/o the D.O.P. if you order from Amazon. I have made the mistake in the grocery store not realizing Cento sells ones are D.O.P and ones that are not and did not realize till it was too late. The true D.O.P. ones I have to say make the best sauce! You can taste the difference. 1
I love split pea soup, and normally I make it from scratch, but it can take an hour or more. When I saw that this product cooked in a mere 10 minutes, I was pretty excited. I figured it was probably composed of cooked and freeze-dried peas that basically just needed to be reconstituted, and of course some kind of seasoning. I didn't read the ingredients on the bag, though, until I got home. Oops.<br /><br />Reading the list of ingredients, I was immediately skeptical. The first thing listed was modified corn starch. Corn starch?! Split peas create a thick enough soup, I can't imagine why they needed corn starch, let alone why they had to use more corn starch, by weight, than actual PEAS. I went ahead and prepared it anyway, figuring it would surely at least be edible.<br /><br />Well, it was edible. It was pretty salty, but I could live with that. It was the texture I just couldn't take. This soup has the mouthfeel of a soup thickened with corn starch (surprise, surprise)--like egg drop soup at a chinese restaurant. Which is fine for egg drop soup, but I found it utterly impossible to reconcile with my conception of split pea soup. Any peas were few and far between, floating in the viscous starchy liquid alongside a few sad rehydrated carrots. Just... gross. I finished one bowl and dumped the rest down the garbage disposal. 1
I love green tea and all it's health benefits.  Until I found this brand I was making my green iced tea at home. The blueberry flavor is subtle, but just enough. I love that it's not high calorie but refreshing, and it tastes so good it doesn't need a lot of sweetener. 4
The bite size chewables are wonderful - 2 or 3 every few hours lets yu diet and never feel hungry. 5
I used to get these instore and found a cheaper deal on Amazon. I recently realize when you open the bag, there's a strong smell (like plastic or chemicals). I tried a little bit myself and the smell is just so strong that I can't bear it. I tossed everything everything away and would not buy this again.<br />It's made in China. You don't know what they put in the chicken strips to get them addicted or .... sick.<br />AVOID! 1
So Far this is the only K-cup I've found thats tastes great with a normal brew!  It's not watered down like the regular stuff, and dosen't taste burnt like the bold stuff. They only K-cup i'm buying from now on! 5
fairly easy to cook, a little nutty  in (taste )for some . 4
While the flavor and quality of this chili is great, the 108-ounce can is mostly liquid. The number of servings is listed as 12, but the reality is that it will only serve about 5, unless you add more of your own ingredients as the first reviewer indicated. I won't be purchasing this again. 2
Spent more and purchased this because of glowing reviews.  Drinkable only if you use a lot of flavored creamer.  Best results for me come from Irish Cream or Creme Brule creamer flavors.  I won't serve this to company. 2
Five Gum is a new product from Wrigley's. I'm always on the lookout for new gum since I like having something to chew while I'm driving. I came across this back in august and was pleasantly surprised. The flavor lasts a really long time and is relatively strong. 5
But Fuzzy prefers the salmon primavera to the yellowfin tuna. However, Toto (aka Totolicious) loves it. I have to keep writing until I reach 20 5
After reading the reviews here stating that the Iron content of Ella's Kitchen Spinach packs was incorrect, I checked out their website to see for myself. Hmm.. no announcement there stating that an error had been made. So, I contacted the company wondering if it was a misunderstanding. No, it's true. The Spinach flavor only has 4-6% DV of Iron... NOT 120% as has been clearly indicated on the pouches I have been buying for my son for OVER A YEAR! I have been purchasing these packs by the case thinking that if my son did not eat enough other Fe-rich foods on a particular day, at least he would eat this. I mean you know how difficult it can be to get little ones to take in enough iron, so I thought this was a great option. IF I HAD KNOWN that it only contained 4 or 6%, then I would have given my son other additional Fe-rich foods or continued making my own purees. I guess I should have known it was too good to be true when I noticed that the first ingredient is in fact APPLES not Spinach as the front of the pouches would have you believe.<br /><br />What upsets me the most is that there is not even a warning or announcement on Amazon or at Target stores stating that there has been a mistake?!! If the company knows, why isn't this info passed on to the consumer?!!? Here I thought I was purchasing (a more expensive) but also more nutritionally complete product for my baby and to find out it's just as void of nutrients as all of the other brands on the shelves. I really thought this company was exciting and different and focused on kids' nutrition and health. I guess not. I am asking for a refund at the very least. Honestly, the company is lucky if parents don't decide to take up a lawsuit for their negligence in getting the word out. The incorrectly labeled packs should be recalled like anything else- not left on the shelves to trick parents! Normally, I am not one to overact and am certainly not litigious in the least. Humans (and companies run by humans) make mistakes. It's natural. But as a physcian and a mother, I am really annoyed by the lack of respect shown to consumers in failing to notify the community of this error. 1
We sampled a number of different K-Kup blends and this one seems to be the closest to what my wife describes as a smokey flavor, overall a great cup of coffee. I prefer a less bold taste but it's a  a definite 4.5 stars. 4
for everybody's information, o n e coconut water is made in the philippines..not brazil as claimed.. it was only a brazilian who  developed the business but the coconuts came from the philippines..<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LL0R8I">Vita Coco 100% Pure Coconut Water, 11.1-Ounce Containers (Pack of 12)</a> 4
This mask smells amazing and does clean my face well.  I didn't give it 5 stars because it did dry out some parts of my already dry skin!  I don't think I would purchase this particular one again but definitely would try another Alba mask.  I LOVE ALBA!! 4
I grew up on King Golden Syrup back in Pennsylvania, and have missed it greatly since moving west in 1978. Until recently, I had depended on the generosity<br />of family members to ship me the occasional bottle, which we would then use so sparingly that sometimes I would forget that I had it on the shelf! So nice<br />to find an entire six-pack for such an affordable price.  Tiny bit of disappointment when it showed up in plastic dispensers, as opposed to the classic glass bottle pictured in the add.  Pleased to announce that the quality was still very, very high! 5
Go Raw has several others bars that taste really good. This one is not one I would buy again because of taste. 1
Very little response from cats or kittens to this product as compared to some fresh I grew last year (it is a weed and grows easily). I will not purchase again. Shipping and packaging were good. 2
I ordered three catnip chew rings, mostly to justify the shipping expense.  As it turns out, the ring is not large and easily could have been shipped in a padded mailer for a fraction of the cost.  I had hoped my new kitten would use this as a teething ring and my older cat would also enjoy one.  Neither cat has the slightest interest.  Thinking perhaps the catnip was past its prime, I rubbed them in some fresh to entice the cats to at least play with them.  One mouthful of the fringe was enough for each cat.  I gave the third ring to a friend who fosters kittens.  Not one of the five she has would use the ring.  I sure can't call these a good deal. 2
I was really excited to try these out as salt & vinegar has always been my favorite flavor. I have to say that the taste is spot on but the texture was off-putting for me. I could get used to and somewhat liked the stale cracker feel but they left an awful coating in my mouth. It was akin to plain Smartfood popcorn. I'm guessing it has something to do with the production of popped foods. Not bad but not something I'd try again. However, the two positives are that they are significantly cheaper on Amazon by almost a $1.50 per bag and have less fat content than baked. If you're a fan, this is a great choice. 2
I can see that many people like this tea, which surprises me--but there are plenty of teas for all of our different tastes! I'm only writing a review to warn non-tea drinkers not to assume their guests or gift recipients will like it.<br /><br />I drink hot tea--but only black tea--continuously throughout the day and someone gave me three boxes of this as a gift because it was reviewed highly on Amazon. :-) I've tried several cups, thinking I could do something with it to make it palatable to me, but I can't.<br /><br />I think both the dry tea bag and the final product have an unpleasant aroma. The taste of the brew is offish in some way and the after-taste isn't pleasant to me either. I served it to two friends and one thought it was good but not as good as other Rooibos she had tried. The other friend sipped for awhile and left it. She commented on the dried grass smell, which was what I didn't like either. I can tell that a lot of people like it--I just wanted to warn that many might not. 3
Simply Awesome. I love bold coffee and love French Roast Brews. This is a truly wonderful FR blend. Dittos for Deidrich FR, both are awesome.<br /><br />I also tend to like the BOLD COFFEE PEOPLE KCUPS...Most all I've tried have been bold and flavorful, each with it's own distinct flavor. 5
Although my kids love the giant gummy bears there could be a better assortment of flavors when they ship. We tend to get more of one flavor and not enough of the others. Cherry, Green Apple and Grape seem to be the most popular with my kids and we tend to get more blue raspberry and orange.... 3
I am very concerned that this product does not state anywhere whether the soy used in it (couple of ingredients are derived from soy) is GMO free? From my understanding, over 80% of soy and corn seeds is genetically modified, so chances are that soy from this product is modified which would NOT make it a healthy product at all! 2
I bought this because the price was good and it was convenient to carry to restaurants. I have been using xylitol for several years and like that it has NO aftertaste.  This product has a bad aftertaste.  The little bit of sucralose they added to the xylitol to make the product sweeter takes over and leaves a sickening aftertaste.  If you are used to using Splenda or other sucralose based products you probably will not notice it but I really did.  Will not be buying this product again. 2
Not a quick meal to make when you are in a 'hurry', you have to let things cook for a while. Waiting for the water to completely soak up is required before being able to add in necessary items.<br /><br />Broccoli already comes in the package, but I took the liberty of adding in actual pieces, along with diced up imitation crab. They were probably why the casserole came out a step above several box dinners.<br /><br />The Velveeta is provided, and yes-- it actually is authentic Velveeta. It's not the powdery kind which could have been packaged. You get to easily stir it into the casserole at the end of the cooking time. The cooking time itself is what takes the work. This product is for people really good at following directions because everything is divided up into separate packages with multiple steps.<br /><br />This isn't something which you'd want to eat 'every night' and might not be the healthiest option, a light version not yet being available. But it does taste edible especially when you take extra time to customize it. 3
These taste very good, but aren't like the BEST things ever either. In order of my preference (gross to good) with explanation: The "rainforest" flavor one is my least favorites (I don't recommend this particular flavor). has a weird cayenne pepper aftertaste to it (don't get me wrong, I love cayenne, but not in a cookie!).... The "tropical" one tastes as if corn bread was turned into a cookie version (not a bad taste. Really good, actually!)... the "Original" is very great. I forgot the taste though, but I remember liking it..... "Alpine", in my opinion, is the best - it tastes like a European type of christmas cookie. it has a chocolaty (carob) taste to it, but not overly-sweet. 4
This is the 2nd order i have placed for Bob's Red Mill Organic Flaxseed. It is a good quality whole flaxseed. We grind it a little at a time and sprinkle it on cereal and in yogurt. It keeps a long time in the freezer. I have been using this flaxseed for about a year now ,eating a tablespoon about every day and have noticed that my skin is softer , plus it keeps me regular, if ya know what i mean !!! Flaxseed is also a good way to get in some of the Omega 3's, that the body needs. 5
Dr. McDougall Right Foods food cups are, for the most part, excellent.  The ingredients are of a good quality, and most have a good taste to them.<br /><br />The two downsides of the product are that they're relatively high in sodium, and of course the cost.<br /><br />The food cups are perfect for those who want a quick snack, and they also work well when poured over such as pasta, rice, or a baked potato. 4
The glitter itself is very beautiful, however I wanted to clarify for all future buyers that it is NOT edible as seems to be implied many places. Note the disclaimer they have included in the product description. The label on the package (which is covered up by an inventory label that has to be very carefully removed to be read!) clears says it's "For Decorative Arts and Crafts" and an in-depth google search will reveal that this product SHOULD NOT BE eaten. So basically it's very, very expensive glitter. 3
all the chocolates looked like they melted and then were cooled again. Shape was deformed, chocolate stains on box, and the wrapper was all oily on the outside when I tried to open them. Disappointing 3
I received this item on time.  The packaging was great.  The gluten free Bisquick is a great addition to our gluten free pantry. 5
Oh, Well,  not into these at all.  They aren't finicky about treats, either- all they need is to hear the word 'TREETS!' and they'll eat just<br />about anything offered.<br />These just get me a puzzled look. 2
I was hesitant to try this cocoa after all the horrible reviews about how it tasted so bad, and had a really bad Sucralose flavor. I don't know if I'm just not as picky as others or what it is, but I thought this hot cocoa was really good. Creamy and rich, and almost TOO sweet. I don't think it has an "aftertaste" though, how some have described. I used the middle water setting on my Keurig or "small mug"...7.25 oz., I guess. Everyone has their own tastes and preferences, but as for me, I really like this product! 5
i've never met a dog who didn't devour this food with tail-wagging, tunnel-visioned gusto. it looks like tiny pieces of beef jerky and if you have a picky eater they'll probably be delighted with this food.  it's grain free and super expensive but worth it -- it has helped curb the awful gas of our 13 lb chihuahua/min-pin. as a bonus, his coat is shinier too. (now if we could just make his breath & body odor better).... the only reason i gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the price. 4
I thought it was caffeinated. I was wrong. It put me out of energy for 20 days. Never again. BUT, the taste is good. A little strong though 3
This is the first Aerogarden kit that I have not been pleased with. My two Cilantro pods did not sprout at all. I contacted Aerogarden and they said there is a known issue with the Cilantro and they are investigating ways to fix it. I would not recommend purchasing this kit until they work out the problem.<br /><br />The other herbs are growing just fine. The Epazote is growing like crazy- although I'm not sure what to cook with it. 2
Good product just a little mellow on the pumpkin pie flavor to me. A little sugar on top before you brew picks it a enough though. Overall good coffee 4
I think these are a bit boring (I like my cooked peas at least salty and preferably spice-enabled) but they do undeniably taste like peas, and my toddler begs for them ("peas! peas!"). I suspect she likes the crunchiness. I bought a single package to try them out and bought the multi-pack today. I think they'd probably be good in homemade trail mix, too. 5
I've tried all the iced tea flavors, and buy far like this one best. It could be a touch stronger, but i load it up with alot of ice so I'm sure that doesn't help either, 6 cup setting is my pick also. But all in all way better than a scoop mix brand iced tea mix 4
First, to the efficacy of the product:<br />It leaves a filmy coating on our hands (and, we assume, other skin areas, including scalp) even after many rinsings...not a pleasant feeling...and yet, we do not notice any real difference in dandruff control. We used it every other day for a week.<br /><br />In addition, the scent is very strong...and some may find it unappealing.<br /><br />Finally, as at least one other reviewer has noted, the packaging does not hold up well in transit: our sample arrived in a padded yellow envelope via USPS and was leaking all over the place. We thought it was inadvertently damaged during shipping...and disposed of it; Amazon very nicely shipped another one out, but that, too arrived in a leaky mess. This time, we cleaned it off and proceeded to test it out, with the above results. So, if someone does order it online, just be aware that this might be an issue.<br /><br />So, overall, we cannot fully recommend "CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, Strong & Full" based on experience, but as with any product like this, it might produce better results for others, so it might be worth a try. Just be careful with the shipping, and maybe wait for a decent price for the first time around. 2
I've tried every bold k-cup and this is one is one of my favorites.  Very nice flavor and strength. 5
I am usually not big into ramen noodles, especially the one's with extra veggies or sides. I always get the chicken and nothing else. I decided to try this one because of the Chef's Best stamp. I tried this and i must say it wasn't bad at all. I didn't realize it would have real chicken bits in it, carrot, and other veggies. The taste was good, i did add a little tony's seasoning salt (that's just me i add it to almost everything). Overall i was surprised, but in a good way. It was quick, the directions simple and easy, was a huge serving, i couldn't finish it all, and was just as good as the ramen noodles chicken that i usually eat, if not better. 4
I made this cake for my birthday yesterday and was disappointed.  I have eaten gluten-free cakes which taste no different than cake made from wheat flour, so I know it can be done.  This cake texture is mealy, the cake is dense and tastes like corn.  Not like cake should taste.  With butter-cream frosting, it was edible, but I will not make it again. I'm still searching for the perfect GF cake mix. 2
I never drink this tea alone. I always steep it with another tea, such as Oolong or Jasmine because the taste isn't the best. I use honey and sugar to sweeten and down the hatch it goes! Expect some, um, gastrointestinal responses the next day. Sometimes I feel a bit of cramping and sometimes I don't. Sometimes it will take most of the next day for it to 'work'...and sometimes it won't!! 4
Grove square Hot Cocoa is just the right amout of milk chocolate, not to much chocolate, just the right mixture. Delicious! I say a good cup of hot chocolate. Try Grove Square Hot Cocoa, Milk Chocolate K cups for Keurig Coffee Makers. Enjoy! I did. 5
First, I have to confess that I expected this Kona blend to knock my socks off.  It didn't do that, or even come close to it, but it is a perfectly adequate coffee even if it is not what I would call a great coffee.  It is very mild, not bitter, and can be made in various strengths according to individual preference with no bitter after-taste.  I don't feel that I wasted my money but I am not sure I shall buy Jeremiah's Kona Blend again. 3
Got these for the hubby for Father's Day, they are not bad, but Plow and Hearth have the best cashews, crunchy & flavorable. These were passable but if you are a cashew nut, I would not recommend them. 3
Fruit juice has lots of calories, so at home, we often dilute grape or orange juice with water or seltzer and ice. We like the flavor and the bubbles make for a more refreshing drink. The Switch is a portable alternative - a little carbonation, nice flavor, more like tangerine than orange, and 100% of the daily requirement for vitamin C. When convenience is important, The Switch is a good, healthier alternative to soda. 4
This matcha smells like a nice light matcha.  I really love jasmine so I had hoped that the scent would come thru, but it did not.  For those that are not into a strong floral jasmine flavor, this is the jasmine matcha for you!<br />My first impression of this matcha was, "Where is the jasmine?"  I opened up the pouch, preparing it for the tin that will keep it fresh.  The small size fits perfect in the tin with a little wiggle room...enough to be able to get the measuring spoon in.  I was unable to detect a "flavor" in this matcha.  That of course does NOT mean it will taste bad, just not what I expected.<br />I always make sure to warm up my bowl and chasen under a bit under water, sitting in the bowl.  My matcha does not cool down as fast when warming the bowl.  All items ready...bowl, chasen, matcha, water and my sifter!  I'm becoming a matcha pro now.  No need to go looking for my tools, they were all handy.  This matcha brings me to a place where I imagine sitting with friends passing around a matcha bowl contemplating our day.  I would love to share this outdoors on a warm spring or summer day.  Today is 60 degrees so I have to use my imagination.<br />First I mixed 2 oz of water with 1 perfect teaspoon of matcha. Once that was properly mixed I added a teeny bit of sugar and 6 oz of water.  Last time I had a total of 7 oz and the matcha was bitter.  After going back to my 8 oz I tried the matcha and still felt that it was a touch bitter.  I added 2 more oz of water and a bit more sugar.  I know it's psychological, but I feel healthier drinking this matcha!  It's just so light and fresh and reminds me of a health food drink.<br />The smell of this matcha once mixed with water takes stayed the same, light and vegetal.  I am now curious how the Pure Jasmine Matcha compares to this one.  I was torn between them when placing my order.  The quality of the matcha is very good.<br />I'm not sure if this matcha will make my keep cupboard.  Red Leaf Tea has so many flavor offerings that I think I'll try those before going back to this matcha which doesn't seem far off my normal matcha.  My plan for the rest of Jasmine is to mix it to my health food drink which is a vanilla base.  I ordered the large size so I will save a bit for next spring when I can enjoy it outside.<br />To try Jasmine Matcha from Red Leaf Tea visit here:<br />[...] 4
The box no longer says made with real Land O'Lakes butter and evidently it no longer is.  The taste is off.  Evidently Diamond Foods (present owner of Pop Secret, General Mills wouldn't have made such a foolish decision) has no taste for quality.  This used to be the a premier pop corn.<br /><br />Now its just a kernel of what it once was. 2
Ordered these to be delivered on the tenth of febuary due to description saying they arrive in bud form. Well I received them on the 14th, Valentines day. Had I wanted to give my wife some ugly closed buds for a valentines day present I would have requested the 14th and not the 10th. So when I realized I would not receive them when requested, a date that would have given them time to open up I had to go purchase flowers locally. Not to mention that upon arrival of said buds, well after one look I can tell you that there is no way in heck that they would bloom to look anything like the picture, seems to be lacking like half the flowers and two of them that were sent have the stems broken not too far below the bulb s so there's two less from the already lacking amount. 1
I've been feeding this food to my cat for about a month now. I had it mixed with his old food for 2 weeks and have been feeding him only the Royal Canin for the last 2 weeks.<br /><br />The only good thing I can say about this food is his fur has gotten thicker and his skin isn't flaky. Aside from that, a cat who has NEVER had stomach problems has been experiencing diarrhea and vomiting in the last week. His poop smells WORSE and he hasn't had a solid poop in 2 weeks either. This food has truly been an awful experience and I will not be buying anymore. 1
Yes....Gracie really rushes into the living room to enjoy one of these treats in peace.  Any time she thinks something is really special...off she gos.  The treats are big enough that I break one into two pieces for a mini-dachshund.  She thinks she's eating candy and I know she's eating a treat that is full of healthy, organic ingredients.  So she's happy and so am I.  Highly recommended. 5
there is no miracle in these noodles to losing weight. the smell and look of these alone, once you open the package is enough to make you lose your appetite for a few days. I threw them out before i threw up 1
I just received the plant.  I paid extra for a quick delivery to secure the plant's condition.  It arrived on time, however it arrived wrapped only in moist news paper,without any protection for the plant.  The plant is completely smashed. This was, for me, a complete waste of my time and money.  I paid more for shipping than for the item itself and it didn't do a bit of good.  Very disappointing. 1
I emailed the company several times they never emailed back i left about 5 voicemails because they never picked up the phone they left me very unsatisfied The Online Candy Shop ships damaged goods it came on October 8th 2010 so it wasn't hot outside so why was every candy melted and the ones i sampled tasted disgusting i recommend ordering this product from a different store. 1
The nose evokes the earthiness of white truffles, just barely.  The white truffle presence in Bartolini is weak with mineral (almost chemical) notes, not the earthy, warm and almost intoxicating fragrance you expect from white truffles.<br /><br />There is no such thing as white truffles (oil or otherwise) on a budget.  The real thing is expensive, a deserving price for the experience you expect. 1
Rough cut brown sugar cubes make people who don't normally like coffee want to try it, and people who do love it.  It's expensive, but it's a really nice touch. 4
The old recipe for 70% Lindt bars was perfect -- it was just the right balance, and my favorite dark chocolate bar at the price point.<br /><br />The new one is flavorless and waxy, tastes like I'm biting into a brown crayon.  I'd rather eat a Hershey bar.  No idea what Lindt is thinking.  Their website says they made this change after extensive consumer tests showed folks wanted a "smoother" taste with a "less intense cocoa flavor."  Who on earth would buy a chocolate bar advertising 70% cocoa content and expect it not to be intense? 1
The Switch Kiwi Berry carbonated fruit juice tasted good, but it was too sweet and had too many calories for my liking. I could drink a regular can of soda. Going forward, I probably would not buy this beverage because I do not like to drink that many calories (135) or sugar (33 grams) in one sitting. 2
I expected a more spicy product. I used as an additive as specified in our local paper recipe section. 2
I purchased this  after watching a vegetarian recipe on YouTube. I added it to my Chilean Sea bass. Big mistake! This almost ruined my buttery, expensive fish. Perhaps it works well on meat. 1
This seller offered the best price i could find on the web.  I was pleased with the speed of delivery.<br /><br />the product was in great shape and well packed.  I'll do business with this company again!<br /><br />kids love astronaut ice cream! 5
I was so excited to see TJ's sipping chocolate on the shelf today. But then I compared the ingredients to last year's. Uh Oh!! Looks like they have downgraded their ingredients terribly!!<br /><br />Last year's: cocoa powder, cane sugar, chocolate liquor, cocoa butter.<br />This year's: sugar, cocoa processed with alkali, natural flavor (soy), salt.<br /><br />Why did they have to mess with a good thing? 1
So disappointed with this product. Bought it online because I thought it would taste high end homemade. It is going out to the troops in Afghanistan and I wanted them to have a taste of home for the holidays . Unfortunately, I found I could've saved money and just bought Crunch N' Munch. This product has a bunch of un-popped kernels per bag; not randomly (which would also be bad) but at least 3 to 4 kernels per bag. I thought they would put their product through more rigorous standards of quality, but i see that is not a concern with this vendor. 2
Lurid...weak, chemical tasting all describes this K-Cup. French Vanilla is not the best flavor but Van Houttes makes it seem like the worst. If you like weak, chem-tasting coffee then you will love this! 1
Probably because it doesn't taste like coffee.  It is flavorless.  I saw the good reviews and thought I'd get a couple boxes and now I'm stuck with a bunch of k cups that I don't want to drink because I'd rather literally drink any other k cup I've ever tried.  As you can see I'm not a fan of these k cups.  These are the worst ever. 1
The rice flour in it is a crude gritty grade (cheap?). If you've ever used Thai rice flour <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EYC096">Thai Rice Flour - 16 oz</a>, you know that rice flour does not need to be this unpleasantly gritty.<br /><br />I tried compensating for the grit by using Bisquick Gluten Free to make Johnny cakes since the cornmeal is sort of gritty. But sadly, after you chew you are still left with this unpleasant grit like fine sand in your mouth. 2
Would not recomend this food, my 3 chihuahuas,an 1 greyhound eat this food free feed, an have lost excessive weight. They eat & eat an still loose weight. My dogs are very healthy have been to vet, vet said its the food. I changed their diet an after only 1 wk have gained all the weight back they lost. 2
Got these chocolate almonds for a great deal.  They are high quality and taste good, but they are more of a darker chocolate than a milk chocolate.  I'm not a big dark chocolate lover, so this wasn't great for me, but for those that like dark chocolate, you'll probably enjoy these a lot.  Be aware...5lbs is A LOT of candy!  :) 4
I think this is a great green tea powder.  I add this powder to a 24oz water bottle and it has a nice light taste, I prefer it unsweeted so that I may add a sweetner if needed.  Great price for the quantity and the quality of the product. 5
First, I have to confess-I LIKE coffee! However, there are times it simply doesn't like me. That's why I was excited to try the Puroast Low-Acid Coffee-French Roast. Finally, maybe I would find a less-acid-y coffee that tasted like coffee without the side effects. Unfortunately, this one wasnt it. When I set it to brew, I was waiting for that pungent aroma of coffee to waft through the kitchen. I waited. I waited. Finally, a small hint of coffee aroma. OK, so if I couldn't have coffee aroma, I'd settle for coffee flavor. Unfortunately, I was again disappointed. If this were put to the blindfold taste-test, one would be hard-pressed to identify it as coffee. It had an odd, almost chemical taste that wasn't exactly pleasant. I thought it might 'grow' on me-and even forced myself to drink a second cup. It didn't grow on me, sorry to say, although I didn't feel any acid after-effects like I often do with regular coffee. Puroast upheld the low-acid portion of the bargain admirably . . I just wish they'd have upheld the coffee part as well. I wont be buying this as a coffee substitute; I'll either deal with the acid-and have both the taste and smell of coffee-or do without. 2
This pasta is NOT good - not for Italian dishes, at least, although it might be okay for Asian noodle dishes.  Besides the taste, it also goes gummy and sticky really easily.  Try Tinkyada's brown rice pastas instead - Tinkyada tastes almost the same as regular pasta, and cooks up firm.  You don't have to settle for strange tasting pasta just because you can't eat gluten! 2
I was very excited to recieve my shipment today then to be disapppointed because 2 of the flavors that I was told would be in the package were not there! I really wanted to try Creme Brulee and Raspberry Chocolate truffle!  I am looking forward to trying the others but had I know I would not receive these flavors I would not have ordered this product!  I also did not recieve the Pink Ribbon flavor! 3
I want to like Kettle because they contain no corn oil or soybean oil (which are both GMO, and also my kids are allergic to corn and soy), but darnit, these things bite back! On the plus side, the sharpness of them may keep you from mindlessly enjoying too many. On the minus side, a mouthful of cuts and scratches is not worth it. Do they have to be SO hard and crunchy? What's wrong with simply light and crispy? I vastly prefer Lay's texture, but suffer with Kettle due to the absense of GMOs and corn/soy. I wish they'd come out with something less harsh on the mouth, though. 3
First thing is their web site. It is terrible.  I wanted to complain about their candy but was unable to do so on account of the web site.  Secondly, there were little sugar crystals imbedded in the chocolate that were quite noticeable and ruined both the flavor and the texture.  I would not buy them again. 2
I thought it would have a clean, crisp taste, but it honestly tasted just like every other orange soda I've ever had.  Maybe that's deliberate; maybe they're targeting people who would otherwise drink orange soda, unless presented with a more "natural" alternative...  Regardless, it tastes exactly like carbonated reconstituted juice concentrates, with some orange coloring thrown into the mix, i.e., nothing special. 2
This was a fine food until some time in early August, 2008. I bought two bags, this formula for my old, 140 lb dog, and lamb meal and rice for my 1 year old. They had loose stools the entire time. My older dog finished his bag, and I switched him to Innova, the diarrhea cleared up immediately, so the argument that Canidae makes on the web site about needing to make a slow transition is at best specious. I will have to throw out the remaining food for my young dog, to get him back to normal. Investigate the very large number of complaints on the web about the new formula before exposing your pet to it. 1
I initially purchased this soup because it is not packaged in a can with the carcinogen BPA, or Bisphenol A. BPA is especially bad for men since it acts as estrogen. So bear creek chicken noodle soup seemed safe. Well I found out after consuming this soup that the food industry only has to report trans fat content from triglycerides--not from monoglycerides or diglycerides. But trans fats are inevitably formed in when mono- and diglycerides are manufactured. Since bear creek soup contains both monoglycerides and diglycerides, there is in fact trans fat in the soup. So basically it is perfectly legal to say any food product does not contain trans fat when in fact it does contain trans fat. In addition to being able to put as much as 0.5 grams of trans fat per serving, not in the entire package but per serving and rounding down to zero the food industry has pulled another one over consumers. So before you or your children consume any product with monoglycerides and/or diglycerides, do some research about their dangers to your health. 1
Can't find this or anything like it in our stores anymore.  Good to know I can get it on here. 5
Not the coffee for us. Very strong. Did the subscribe and save, for got to cancel the next shipment, went to and complete the return forms- No such luck. Great idea, just tastes awful. First item that I could not return, back to buy coffee at QVC, they will take it back if we do not like it. 2
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DZH1CM">Pamela's Products Chunky Chocolate Chip Cookies, 7.25-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />  What has not been mentioned in the ad is that Pamela's Cookies are GLUTEN FREE.  As I have a Wheat allergy - these are a delight.  Especially the ones that have nuts in them.  Thanks for having them on line, don't have to search for them in the grocery store.  Barbara C. Varner, wife of K. W. Varner, Jr. 5
We love lots of different Newman's Own products, and have been devotees of Sockarooni pasta sauce and the mint chocolate chip cookies and the Caesar dressing for years. So we had high hopes for this chocolate. But sadly, those hopes were not fulfilled. The chocolate is good, not overly sweet, but just does not seem to rise to premium grade. The mouth feel was not as silky or smooth as we would like, and frankly a bit waxy. And there was something just not very distinctive to the chocolatiness of it all. 2
Great gift for all ages! I purchased these giant canes before and the recipients loved them so much, they kept them and would not eat them. 4
I love this green tea.  It is a good price for my use with my Tassimo machine. 5
My Georgie has very severe allergies and will probably be taking meds for the rest of his life. Luckily he LOVES Pill Pockets and will snarf them down, even with a big Baytril AND his antifungal pill inside! Pill time is SO much easier now; I just wish I could find something as effective with his nasty tasting liquid meds. I'll try him with beef flavored, too, for a change of pace. 5
I don't drink a lot of coffee, but when I do I prefer it black. If a coffee requires sugar and milk to taste good, it's not for me. I expected anything from Melitta to be a quality coffee, and I was not disappointed, but neither was I delighted.<br /><br />The good:<br />* Fills the room with a welcoming aroma, one of the better-smelling coffees I have had<br />* Taste is not too bitter, even when made a bit on the strong side (if Starbucks is too strong for you, you will like this)<br />* Package is vacuum-sealed for freshness<br />* Better than your average grocery store coffee<br /><br />The not-so-good:<br />* Not the best coffee I've had by far. I would put it below Seattle's Best and some of the coffees I get some a local organic store.<br /><br />Overall, it's a good coffee and we will definitely use it up without complaint. I replaced our normal office coffee with this and everyone enjoyed it, but they would not necessarily want to pay a premium over the bulk coffee they normally use. 3
Very quick in getting my order to me.  Would order from them again 5
I love peanut butter, but I don't want to get the fat and calories that the real peanut butter gives you so I purchased this PB2. I sprinkle it dry over sliced apples and it pretty good. It is a bit on the salty side which I really don't care for.  I sprinkle it on top of vegetable salad instead of salad dressing and it's pretty good as well. 4
The fresh tasting Libby's Organic Corn, no additives! I can't believe Amazon can offer such good tasting corn in a can so cheap! But for taste and value, this can't be beat. 3
I recently started eating healthier and needed a low calorie chip to eat with lunches at work. I usually love anything ranch flavored and was excited to try the new Southwest Ranch cracker chips. Their flavor was actually TERRIBLE! I literally thought they tasted like poo. I could only force myself to eat two or three chips. I then had my friend taste them (hoping I could give away the box) and he hated them too. Now I have almost a whole box of these  that I will be throwing away. The texture wasn't very appealing either so I'm not sure if I will ever try another flavor. 1
i received two 9 in x 9 1/2 inch bags containing 1 pound of anise seeds.  i am so stoked about the the culinary possibilities.  the spices were fresh and smelled wonderful.  i will buy from FRONTIER again.  i looked up some info on the Internet which indicated that to impart a stronger flavor to toast before using.  I CANNOT WAIT TO START COOKING!!!  thank you, FRONTIER 5
These are good and low calorie. I keep them in my office for when i want a light lunch. I don't noticed that they are low sodium, but i don't eat a lot of sodium anyway, so it may taste different to someone else. 5
I love rice and this was good with all kinds of textures! I am allergic to so many things but this soup was awesome and no hives! Win WIN! 5
I love this salt!!  The delivery was quick, the price was reasonable and the salt imparts a wonderful flavor to everything I eat!  And, it doesn't burn my tongue!  I will be using this salt for ever more! 5
We were very pleased with our 5lb bag of french roast. My boyfriend is a coffee snob, but we're on a tight budget these days and even he had to concede we were spending an awful lot on coffee. Buying one bag of this saved us $15.<br /><br />This french roast is not quite as good as my boyfriend's local house-roasted preferred blend, and it is a wee bit more acid than the Whole Food's "Early Morning Buzz" that I drink, but after a few days we stopped noticing. Next time I'll buy two bags and freeze one - the last bag we got was fresh enough to make that an option. I'd like to try some of the other blends from Coffee Bean Direct, too.<br /><br />The bag is laughably large, by the way. You'll open the box and say "Whoa - now that's A LOT of coffee!" 5
My dog will try any treat at least once,but HATES "Better than Ears Premium dog treats.Your dog might be different. 1
These bars are the perfect size for a quick snack and delicious as well.<br />I would recommend warming them up for a few seconds in the microwave first as this makes them taste so much better!<br />Not only is it a great snack on the go, but it's healthy as well and combined with the yummy taste, this makes these bars a must.<br /><br />*I received a sample from Influenster. 4
I am aware of the disclaimer and that the picture may not indicate the proper merchandise. However, the ingredient list I assumed would be an accurate description of the product. Not so. Romanoff recently changed the formula for their Black Lumpfish and have added several ingredients that in my opinion have ruined a great product. Upon recieving the shipment we were extremely disappointed that the product shipped was of the new formula. We purposely sought a vendor that would sell the older version after being able to find only a few local retailers with a limited supply. Very disappointed that Amazon would not have a more updated listing for the item. 1
Makes a great sugar free iced mocha with coffee, ice, skim milk and truvia.  some chemical taste if not diluted. 4
The product does come in one bag then boxed. I was fortunate that I did not have any come open in transit. Also I am loving the fact that they do not have to be refrigerated (so I can keep them at work). 5
I purchased this product in response to a recommendation in some low carb books. I find that the salt is too fine and the holes in the jar too large putting way too much salt in food. Will not purchase again. 2
All of Amazon's food items should have a nutritional guide to view. If I had known the second ingredient on the label was brown sugar with 9 grams of sugar, I never would have purchased the nuggets! The texture of the nuggets is fresh and chewy but too much pepper for our taste and too sweet. My husband likes to take the single serving bag in his lunch for a snack so I thought he'd like to try something other than the strips. Sorry Jack Links but I won't be ordering these beef steak nuggets again! 2
My cats absolutely would not eat this food so it was a waste of money..it is just sitting in our cabinets.  I will donate it to a shelter... 1
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EH2AMA">Mrs. May's Dry-Roasted Snack, Pumpkin Crunch, 2-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 24)</a><br />Pumpkin Crunch is great.<br />Stick with 2oz. size (2 servings)<br />Much too easy to consume entire 5.5oz. bag without realizing it.<br />:-D LOL 5
Not heavy on taste...low fat and 0 trans fat.  Everyone loves these...trying to buy more but Amazon is out of stock!!!! OMG 5
Though they might be a bit pricey for just the average dog owner like myself (as opposed to say someone in a profession working with dogs), they're great treats.<br />Perfect size for the quick little snack on the run.<br />And yeah... my dog loves these. At 13, she's getting pretty finicky, and these will gather her full attention.<br />Recommended. 5
The product is all that it says it is which is why I gave it 5 stars.  However, I do have issues with the product, namely, me and my family members can't take the smell.  The taste is horrible so I put it in a lotion cream and rubbed it on my skin.  This was a few weeks ago and though I've since changed my sheets, the scent is still in my bed.  Ultimately, I stopped using it because it made me smell in a way I did not like.  It smells like an Indian spice and while it didn't work for me, scent-wise, it may work fine with someone else. 5
These are nice but I have to admit I love my coffee and I like it strong, I bought these because they said they were strong but they really aren't.  If you like a light to medium cup then you will like these.  If you want a strong, full cup of coffee, I don't think these are  what you want. 2
This salt has a slightly earthy taste. It is moderately coarse. I bought a ceramic grinder for when I would like to have it a little finer. I love this salt! 5
We love Larabars, tried some new flavors this week, and the Blueberry is pretty bland. I'd choose other flavors over this one next time. 3
My dogs love these. But when I looked on the package to see where they came from, I had to pull off a sticker on the back, and in very small print it say made in china.  Very disapointing, to say the least, especially when they were clearly trying to hide that fact. 2
Well I liked the idea of the noodles. I took seasoning from an oodles of noodles packet and put it on the Shirataki noodles. Still way to much sodium there, but I was just testing them out. They were just ok. I could tell they weren't real noodles. It was a texture thing. I haven't given up on them though. I still plan on trying some of the recipes out from the web site. I also plan to try some of my own recipes out using them in place of other types of noodles. Slightly expensive at Two dollars average for a seven ounce bag. But what diet food is cheap? I even decided to buy the rice noodles and want to give them a try as well. Will get back to you on my final opinion. 3
the noodles were pasty and smelled horrible and fishy...just a suggestion if you are dieting.  Just skip noodles all together. 2
I ordered a box of these Oatmeal Raisin as well as well as the Orange Cranberry flavored bars through the Amazon Vine program. Frankly, I cannot think of why anyone would buy these alleged "health" bars. Each of these bars are 200 calories, have 7 grams of fat, 10 mg of cholesterol a whopping 34 grams of carbohydrate and only four grams of protein. Also, based upon a 2,000 calorie per day diet they don't provide any Vitamin A, or Vitamin C, 4% of the recommended Calcium, 8% of the Iron, 6% of Thiamin and 10% of Magnesium. At the time of this writing, this Oatmeal Raisin Flavor bar was not yet available for sale but different flavored 12 packs of this same brand of bar sells for around $19. Not only do these bars fall short from a true health standpoint but they're not very good tasting either. They're not terrible but the consumer would definitely want to have it with coffee or tea. As a stand alone bar it's got kind of a chalky texture. There are so many truly healthy and good tasting bars on the market that I don't see this brand becoming a favorite in many households; certainly not in ours. I would have been mad if I had actually paid for these bars. 2
I love steak, although I don't eat it all that often anymore. When I do have a steak, though, I absolutely love the taste of A1, which brings out the best in any cut of meat. Although I am not too enthusiastic about putting it on seafood (which the label suggests as a good idea), I think it goes well with any kind of beef, and works well on chicken and turkey as well. It is an essential ingredient in many marinades, and is generally one of the most used items for meat preparation in my refrigerator.<br /><br />What many people don't realize is the long and noble history of A1, which dates to 1824. In 1824, when a king's palate reigned supreme, Henderson William Brand, chef to England's King George IV, created a sauce for King George for use on meats. King George was so impressed with it that he proclaimed it "A1," and that's how the sauce got its name.<br /><br />Beyond the history lesson, though, I think King George was correct in his gustatory proclamation: this sauce really is "A1"! 5
This is my second box of greenies that I have been quite pleased up until today.  I pull out on greenie and found a WORM along with larvae!! This is horrible.  I had this box for 3 months.  I emptied the box and found about a dozen more worms and was disgusted.  I couldn't believe greenies product was contaminating my dogs.  The expiration date is dated 2013 so this clearly shows that there is something wrong with this product.  I hope someone from the greenies department will give contact me to fix this.  I will be posting these comments on every doggy treat review forum/website until I hear from someone so I know that they are trying to fix it and shows how much they value their customers and product.  I don't know how long I have been feeding greenies with worms in them so my two pups will now have to go to the vet. 1
This product was very good when I began buying it but lately it is terrible. There is no taste at all. That's the reason I no longer purchase this item. Thank you. 1
I really like the concept of this brand. In fact, I was quite thrilled reading all of the ingredients.<br /><br />The biscuits are dry and a bit on the hard side, but despite being a bit older, my dog ate any that were proffered to him. The crunchy bits are probably good for cleaning his teeth. He's a 10+ year old 80lb Doberman-Weimaraner mix and not a picky eater, but he wasn't overly excited when offered the treats. Maybe he was just wary of the new food. He seemed relatively pleased after the first taste because he begged for another. However, later that night he had a bit of an upset stomach and had to go out more than once.<br /><br />I know that dogs may typically have a range of upsetting digestive reactions to new foods. I'd advise only offering one or two treats until their digestive system has a chance to adjust.<br /><br />I think I'm going to give it a few more days to see if he adjusts and still can happily enjoy the treats because I'd much rather give him these than the fake bacon garbage. 4
I added this to my grocery wishlist as an Amazon recommendation which popped up after I had added something else. I really should've taken a minute to look at the product page, or to realize what would happen before it was too late and someone bought this for me:<br /><br />Nearly HALF THE STUFF IN THIS THING HAS PEANUT BUTTER.<br /><br />To which I am deathly allergic.<br /><br />Peanut allergies are fairly common, so why the hell is half of this thing peanut butter crackers? I can see putting 10 packs of peanut butter crackers in here, maybe 12, but TWENTY?! WHY?!<br /><br />Let this be a warning to people with peanut allergies -- AVOID this product. You'll be stuck with a massive pile of crap you can't eat. 2
I relied on the ingredients listed on Amazon's site.<br /><br />Ingredients<br />Peanuts, Dry Roast Seasoning, Tapioca Dextrin, Natural Flavoring, Salt.<br /><br />Guess what? When the product arrived I read the laundry list of about 20 other ingredients.<br />According to the actual label the Dry Roast "seasoning" contains MSG.<br />Now I'm not that paranoid about MSG but if the product has it as an ingredient it should have been listed on Amazon.<br />I wish they had shown the nutrition label. It also contains added sugar.<br />What's wrong with plain dry roasted peanuts?<br />The taste is about what you would expect. Peanuts with a flavor coating.<br />I will not buy them again.<br />Also it is a 12 pack. 1
I like pop-tarts, and a pack of 12 is a convenient way to house them. 5
Since I have not been able to eat fat there are many things that I miss eating.  Tortillas were something I ate alot and really missed.  You would never know that these are fat free.  The only complaint that I have is that the tortillas stick together and I have torn many of them.  I would say that in the big picture I would rather have a torn tortilla that no tortilla at all. I plan to reorder when I run out. 5
I sent this gift to friend of mine whom was recovering from surgery. The gift arrived, but the get well note, that was to accompany the gift, was left blank. For several days my friend did not know who sent the gift. What a bummer. 1
I made the mistake of believing that Science Diet was the best choice for my cat after the woman at the animal shelter mentioned it as the food they use. After doing some research I realized that Science Diet is no better than any grocery store generic brand or Iams (I would NOT recommend ANY of these options).<br /><br />The main ingredients are Chicken By-Product and Corn. Here are some interesting facts: Cat's can't digest corn...in fact, they are obligatory carnivores and only eat up until the point of reaching optimal nutrition. When I fed my cat the science diet he ate ALL THE TIME, constantly. After switching him over to Castor and Pollux Indoor Cat Formula he eats much less now.<br /><br />Also, By-Product means just that...beaks, feathers, toe-nail clippings, meat not suitable for human consumption, dead animals, etc. -- Totally not worth the $$$ ...it's cheaper just to dig in the trash and puree it yourself (doesn't sound so appealing does it??). Science Diet is notorious for implying superior quality products when they are in fact no better than all the other terrible pet food you find. Don't let your vet fool you either- vets usually get a 40% cut from Hill's to sell you their cat food.<br /><br />My recommendation is to use common sense and to do some research. Try brands like Newmans Own or Castor and Pollux as they have wholesome ingredients and a proven track record.<br /><br />I later called the shelter only to hear that they are required to feed the animals Science Diet as it is donated and they have a special arrangement with Petsmart to house their animals in their in store adoption centers. A requirement is to exclusively feed Science Diet to the animals.<br /><br />TRY THIS INSTEAD: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BCUBZ0">Castor & Pollux Ultramix Indoor Feline Fomula Dry Cat Food, 15-Pound Bag</a> 1
I have 2 dogs and this product is used for 'treats'.  I believe that there is some improvement in mobility with the one dog<br />that has a problem getting aroundl 4
Good finishing glaze.  I little different than what I have used in the past.  It is worth having in the pantry for a little change. 4
These are tasty, but after I'd eat a bag, my heart would practically seize. I looked at the packaging and it was 275mg of sodium. I threw the rest away. What a bummer. So tasty, but way way way way way too much salt! 2
I drink coffee quite often but I'm not really a connoisseur. I did, however, invite family and friends over (some of whom are avid coffee drinkers), and we devoured the 11oz bag of Melitta Cafe Collection coffee in about a week. I had a bit of trepidation over trying this coffee, since I had never purchased pre-ground coffee before, but after the first cup, my reservations vanished.<br /><br />Like other reviewers, we were dazzled by the rich scents that were released when we opened the bag for the first time. It was surprising then, that the resulting coffee didn't have that much aroma. Don't get me wrong - the coffee tasted great, but I wanted a richer experience.<br /><br />Overall, we concurred that it's better than most store brands like Costco's Kirkland Signature or lower-priced brands like San Francisco Bay, but Starbucks own beans or some of the beans available from Peets produced better coffee. In the end, Melitta provides a good value proposition that I can certainly live with. 4
Baja Bob's products have all been pretty good so far, so I wanted to try this sour apple martini mix.  It is very tasty and yes tastes like sour apple - kind of like a jolly rancher.  If you like apple jolly ranchers, then you will love this.  It is a little  sweet so it isn't for everyone, but you can't even tell that it's sugar free. 4
the tea itself doesn't seem hearty enough to stand up to the spices. What I mean is that even after waiting the right amount of time for my cup to finish steeping, I have a cup of chai that's spicy but not really strong enough for me. I don't like stuff toxic; that's not the problem. I think perhaps this tea is just not meant to be very strong.<br /><br />It's got a great level of spiciness, however, and it smells wonderful as it's brewing.<br /><br />Stash Company--how about just a titch more black tea in each bag? :-) 4
I have bought ground flax in the store, there was always a rancid aftertaste.  This is the best tasting flax I have ever had.  BUT, I have to throw it in the coffee grinder, and then pick out little rocks that are barely bigger than the seeds.  I found this out the hard way after using the seeds whole.  Nothing like working a bite trying to find where the rock you just bit is.<br /><br />After you grind, sift the powder and black stones will be evident.  I have about 1-2 per quarter cup of ground mixture.  Perhaps this is something you organic foodies are used to, I am not.<br /><br />I have only used 1 bag so far, so I cannot comment on whether or not the stones are in the others, but I highly doubt it was a fluke bag. 3
I am running out of the Amore brand of anchovy paste that is not salted but Amazon is out of stock on the brand.  I enjoy Crown Prince sardines in olive oil so I am giving their anchovy paste a shot.  These do not give as much depth of flavor as the Amore brand so I am going back to the Amore. 4
When i first opened the box it looked perfectly fine. the expiration date was april 2012 the bag seemed fine. That is until i went to open the corner. The resealable pouring spout was already opened. The seal is supposed to be intact until it is opened for the first time. To me it looks as if someone had reused this bag. Im not entirely sure if it is even the same dog food. Someone could have just put in what ever they feel like and called it "Canidae" and charged me $55.00. The dog food looked different as well. it had the same texture but the pieces were all bigger and a darker color. I had a bag of canidae that i had from before so i compared them! I will not be feeding this to my dog. I guess lesson learned from buying on the internet. maybe my story will make you think twice. on the bright side the price was cheaper and the shipping to hawaii for me was less than a week! free shipping i may add! So buy at your own risk! My dogs health isnt worth taking a chance that it could be canidae in there! I want to be certain that it is 100 % canidae!!<br /><br />-Phillip 2
I've really enjoyed every Starbucks Via variety I've tried -- the Italian and Colombian roasts, caramel and iced coffees especially. However, I've been hoping for a more mild blend since Starbucks can be a little too strong at times. So I was really excited to try this Breakfast Blend via, which is labeled as "mild." Sadly, it's anything but. It's not only still strong, but also bitter, and leaves an awful sour aftertaste. I can't bring myself to drink another cup, even if it means a waste of money. Horrible. 1
This all natural licorice is very good -- I highly recommend it.  I bought this as I a read natural licorice is good for an upset stomach. 5
I will start with some helpful info..<br /><br />-Nespresso machine: Pixie<br />-Ne-Cap capsules 100 pcs. ($23.29)<br />-Coffee: Lavazza - Crema e Gusto 250g enough for 50 capsules ($5.75)<br />-Empty capsule weight: ~1 gram<br />-Filled capsule weight: ~6 grams<br />-One capsule preparation time: 60-70 secs<br />-Cost of filled capsule: ~$0.35<br /><br />The main reasons for purchasing the refill capsules are, being able to enjoy the coffee I like and save some money.<br /><br />I haven't encountered any troubles with the capsules EXCEPT that you dont get the best out of it, as most of the hot water is spilled into the used capsules container; although I had the capsules filled, pressed and sealed appropirately. Therefore, I had to reuse the same capsule, however, sometimes replaced it with another one. The reason of water spill/waste is that Ne-Cap capsules are shorter than Nespresso capsules. Thus I assume if they were the same size, the capsules will perform much better.<br /><br />This option is somehow economical, nevertheless, sometimes you may need to use two capsules to enjoy your Espresso, or Cappuccino cup.<br /><br />Conclusion, if you are not enjoying the taste of Nespresso flavours or you like to have your own ground coffee, and want to save some $$$, go for it..BUT dont expect the same performance and cleanness of Nespresso capsules.<br /><br />Update 2/8/2012================<br /><br />When I first used the Ne-Caps, I gave it 3 stars. After using almost 30 capsules, I got to believe that it's not worth it and that Nespresso capsules are irreplaceable. I tried all possible ways to enhance the performance of the capsules, I made more holes at the base, also I dilated the existing ones, but all my attempt were useless. The shape of Ne-Cap pods should be modified to look like nespresso ones. That way, I believe they would be better. So my advice is to stick to nespresso despite the price. Save yourself the time and headache and enjoy your easy, tasty coffee. 1
I recently was diagnosed with Celiac, and tried these brownies. I LOVE THEM! They have a bit of a gritty texture as compared to regular brownies, and they are SUPER chocolatey. It is the most intense chocolate flavor I've ever had in a brownie. But I like that kind of thing, so I love 'em! Plus, they don't have a ton of fat and they have fewer calories than non-GF brownies, and because they are so chocolatey, they satisfy me quicker than what I remember with non-GF brownies. The ingredients are all organic too, which is nice.<br /><br />Highly recommended. :) 4
This is a smooth not bitter coffee. It's a little more pricey than some which are just as good, but it has a good sweet flavor, and I can recommend it. 4
my dog loves these small biscuits plain. she loves playing with them and then eating them. i tried the fancy flavored ones and she seemed to not really care for those. then i bought some more of the plain small biscuits and she was happy again. they help keep the teeth clean and to freshen the breath. they have 12 minerals and vitamins. they add some variety to her diet. i am very happy with this product. 5
I had coconut trees growing in my backyard in Southeast Asia, and enjoyed drinking coconut water right from the coconut itself. Taste Nirvana Real Coconut Water with Pulp is the closest to the real thing that I've found. 4
Supposedly increases milk production? Yeah, I didn't see a difference after drinking this for a good 3+ weeks. Aside from that, it doesn't smell or taste very good. Very herbal medicine-like. 2
I was expecting a very high quality coffee but this wasn't quite it. It's a lot stronger than I was expecting due to the serving size printed on the label. It was pretty strong even for me and I like strong coffee.<br /><br />However, I adjusted the amount of coffee and after a couple of tries I got a nice pot. It has good, but not great flavor. Definitely better than Folgers and the like but not top tier quality.<br /><br />I recommend this to anyone looking for something a step up from Folgers. 3
This product is over salted and so foul of artificial flavor that its not worth anything. A waste of money. 1
Though i'm not a huge fan of oatmeal, this product delivers on great taste and convenience. All i have to do is grab a pack and get a cup of hot water from Starbucks for my morning breakfast. It's simple, filling and a great combination for me.I say go get this product for taste and convenience. 4
Our 9 month old originally was spitting up a lot. We had him 1st on Similac regular, then went to Similac Sensitive and finally to Similac Soy.  The soy did the trick. He was on similiac soy for the past 6 months. When the Similac recall went through, my wife became disgusted with Similac and suggested we try a new brand. I was reluctant but did so anyway.  We reminded ourselves that as babies get older, they become less fussy, less gassy and maybe they don't need SOY anymore if that's what they were used to. So I went to my local Whole Foods store and bought the Lactose Free Baby's only formula. AN instant hit !!!!! My son loves it ! Seriousely. He gobbles it down...all 6 oz in once shot. Before with the similac soy, he would have to take a break in between.  My wife actually tasted the milk and said it is delicious compared to similac soy.  Well, if adults like it, I am sure babies would too !  I am very happy thus far with our choice. We were going to get Natures Best, but read that the way they extract their DHA is not ideal. Glad I realized that.  So far so good ! We always thought that our baby would be stuck with SOY formula...thank's to the similac recall and some good old fashioned parent intuition, we realized that is NOT the case.  I am happy about that since SOY can cause some hormonal problems.....babies and adults alike.  Thank you Baby's only for making an excellent product ! 5
I order a vast quantity of this sugar about twice a year.  We use it on everything. Actually, once you start using raw sugar, white sugar falls short in the taste department. 5
This coffee is a good, medium tasting coffee. It doesn't have the bitterness and it doesn't leave that awful after taste in your mouth. I like a good, strong cup of coffee and this one is perfect. 4
In the beginning I tried to cancel the order because I felt that it was not what I wanted exactly which is (Lindt Gold Bar).<br />But It was a great surprise to find in the package what I wanted exactly. The image here is an old one that should be updated.<br />The packaging was great with thermal insulation and cold packs for the chocolate not to melt in the hot summer.<br />the price is really the lowest. I searched the internet to find a better price and the best I got was 7.50 usd per each + shipping.<br />That's why I said it is JUST PERFECT. It made my day 5
I found this to be a nice alternative to juice and to the usual pepsi that I normally drink.<br /><br />It had a nice light flavor with just a little carbonation.  I don't believe tangerine is the right name for the taste. I would say a tart orange juice is more accurate. However, the name of the drink does not take away from the quality of the product.<br /><br />I let my children try a little bit of this and they too thought it was a very good taste.<br /><br />The cans are small, smaller than a coke can, but I found one to quench my thirst better than any of the caffeinated drinks I would normally pick up. 4
have always loved snowcones and at 74, still do. haven't had any for years and got an ice shaver for gift recently, so really enjoying them again. good stuff///////// 4
Liiked this product.  Nice fresh lemon taste and convenient size in case wanting to travel. 4
Not only are the truffles excellent, but the package arrived in record speed with standard shipping chosen.  We are very pleased with our truffles and with our experience with this company.  We will be ordering from them again! 5
The popped corn was very small and didn't seem to have a lot of corn flavor,  Ok, but dissappointing. 3
It was quite a commitment for me to buy this quantity of pork rinds from Amazon but I decided that I would "give it a go" since I like the pork rinds that are sold in grocery stores and I figured that these could only be better since they'd be fresher when microwaved.  They taste great and I think that they have the perfect amout of spice.  HOWEVER, two things....the smell is "funky" when they come out of the microwave.  Regardless of the taste, I can't seem to get used to the smell.  Secondly, when it comes to popcorn, I have to pop popcorn less than the directions on the package in my microwave or it will burn.  I found it to be the opposite with these pork rinds.  I had to cook the port rinds LONGER than the directions say on the package, otherwise they wouldn't be popped nicely and were a bit chewy.  So if you find that you cook these and they don't seem crispy enough, cook them in your microwave longer than the directions say to do so. 3
If you like green tea that brews for 2 minutes max and you do not "stew" your tea by just leaving the bag in until the tea is bitter, this is the tea for you! Of course, it can be done that way, but IF you have refined tea taste, then you will like this tea. I, personally, love the taste of a good green tea. I am so glad to find this brand available online. No one sells it in my area. 5
Try this one, great decaf and maybe it'll help make you think you're in the tropics. 4
I love chamomile tea and I like green tea...but I have to be in the mood for one or the other, not both simultaneously.  Somehow, Timothy's has managed to put both of these tea flavors into one product and both my husband and I do not care for it all.  It's not horrible, it's just not what we care to taste in our chamomile tea.  We are truly disappointed and would not recommend this product as the green tea flavor is overpowering leaving very little true chamomile to taste :( 2
I love Tully's Italian Roast. It is my favorite of all the robust coffees available. I bought this 50 pack and when it arrived there was a note that it was "outdated." I was given the opportunity to return it for a refund, but I don't have time to fool around with returns unless absolutely necessary.  This coffee was good enough to keep, but no where as good as it usually is. The coffee is excellent, but the company from whom I purchased this should have not sent me outdated coffee. Obviously, I will never by from this company. I will, however, continue to buy good Tully's Italian Roast. 3
Usually I'm not a big banana nut fan, but this Quaker bar was absolutely fantastic and filled me up! Delicious taste, low calorie. Absolutely a great snack or breakfast on the go! Thanks Influenster! 3
I have been using International Delight French Vanilla for years and I've been ordering it through Amazon for the last two years.  It is the perfect addition to every cup of coffee.  Ordering online is just convenient.  For the most part it is very good quality.  However, occasionaly there is a handful of defective creamers that are either empty or impossible to open.  There is always one in every box that leaks. 4
The Sea Salt and Pepper cashews from Emerald were okay.  They weren't as delicious as the almonds I reviewed the last time around.  I felt that the<br />salt and black pepper were just too overpowering for my palate. If they toned down the seasoning, then you might have something.  That's my only complaint with the product, otherwise they were good.  The cashews were nice and fresh and I love the sea salt flavor.<br /><br />If only they would ease up on the salt and pepper.  I would mildly recommend this product. 3
Although I prefer to get my tuna in the foil packages, what I had ordered appears to no longer be available through Amazon so I tried these and they are handy and pretty goo eating for one.  Toss on a salad, or use on bread or toast to add good quality protein. 5
Got these Kettle Chips Sea Salt & Vinegar (15 5oz bags) and was not impressed. Tasted kind of flat. I was eating some out of the bag, when I looked down into the bag and noticed a hole in the bag about the size of a sesame seed. Then I started looking at all the unopened bags and MANY of them had this type same hole. Some bags had multiple holes. One bag had a hole the size of a dime at the bottom of the bag like a rodent had got to it. The box they shipped in had NO holes so they we're packed this way. So much for quality control and who ever let these ship should be fired. Needless to say I'll never be eating anymore Kettle products and expect a full refund from Kettle or Amazon.<br />M. Martin 2
Orange-flavored EBOOST is a fairly standard energy/vitamin drink.  It has 50% our the daily recommended value of zinc, 1667% of vitamin C, 100% of B6, 41667% of B12, 75% of niacin, as well as several other vitamins and nutrients, with only 5 calories per serving.  The B12 amount in particular is very high, and I'm not sure how if that is really necessary.<br /><br />It is supposed to be orange-flavored, but it also contains green tea extract, and I didn't think the orange taste was very authentic.  In fact, I found this drink to be overpowering and unpleasantly bitter.  The first time I tried it, I followed the directions and added 1 package to about 8 oz of water.  However, I found this unpalatable and had to dilute it until I had used 4 times as much water as instructed.  Because the vitamin levels are so high, I don't really have a problem diluting it to such a large extent, but other people might prefer something that is drinkable after following the directions. 3
To be fair, I've only tried this as a sweetener for coffee.<br /><br />I thought a toffee flavor would be a delightful addition to my coffee, so I picked this up. It has a distinct and unpleasant aftertaste--which is not unusual for artificial sweeteners.  This, however, is much stronger than other sweeteners.  I'm sticking with my Sweet 'n Low and shoving this in the back of the cupboard.<br /><br />For the seller, though, I have nothing but good things to say.  Prompt shipping and no problems. 2
pee-ew. you know sometimes when something smell bad you secret want smell more?  like fart. and sometimes bad smell is good smell. like musty man smell. this is stinky perfume smell for food. no flavor if you want to taste truffle.  I no recommend put on body people think you homeless.  Maybe if partner has truffle fetish then use on food and body.  bottle is cute. me big hands make bottle look like playtime barbie teacups.  I use for party once on salad and people think genius.  i use for mac n cheese.  so good my husband makes scent. 3
these are good for your dogs teeth.  they sell them at most vet offices for more.  the only complaint is the different sizes, some are bigger and thicker, while others are smaller.  i cut the bigger ones in half for my dogs 4
I do not eat a lot of crackers because of all the partially hydrogenated crap in them, but I purchased these for a party thinking they might be slightly healthier than normal crackers-I was wrong. Although there are "real" vegetables in the ingredients list, they are very far down on the list. Additionally the vegetables in the crackers are part of a "dehydrated vegetable blend" and the vitamins you would expect to be in many of the vegetables (eg vitamin A in the carrots listed in the vegetable) are not much higher than in normal crackers.<br /><br />Questionable marketing and name aside, the crackers don't taste very good. I could barely taste a hint of onion and pepper, and none of the other vegetables listed on the crackers-I am guessing I tasted the onion only because onion powder is also listed as an ingredient. They have a strong wheat taste, which I thought was surprising since it lists enriched flour as the main ingredient. Additionally they had a very distinct cardboard taste once you have chewed them a few times.<br /><br />I will not be buying these again and I would not recommend them to anyone.<br /><br />Ingredients I got off the box: Enriched flour (wheat flour, niacin, reduced iron, thiamine, mononitrate {vitamin b1}, riobflavin {vitamin b2}, folic acid), soybean and/or palm and/or palm kernel and/or canola and.or partially hydrogenated cottonseed oil, dehydrated vegetable bled (contains carrots, onions celery, cabbage, red bell pepper, tomato, parsley), sugar, baking soda, high fructose corn syrup, onion powder, (flavor enhancer), natural flavor, artificial color, disodium guanylate (flavor enhancer). 1
After reading about the benefits of coconut water, I decided to give this brand a try.  I have tried a few other brands with a juice added, but they all have lot of extra sodium.  Be sure to read the labels.  Some have less potassium in them than the Via Coco brand.  I felt like this was better for my husband to drink than Gatorade. He works on a/c during the summer and is out in the heat all day long. 5
Batter does not get mixed thoroughly in the package no matter how much shaking and tapping you do.  Alot of the batter was left in the container handle.  Produced very thin, tasteless brownies. 1
<span class="tiny"> Length:: 1:39 Mins<br /><br /></span>(* this review was originally posted for the 3 oz size, a verified purchase by me on Amazon)<br /><br />I purchased three well reviewed brands of catnip for Tristan, my six month old Savannah cat. In the video, I have just placed down three plates of catnip from freshly opened packages. The brands from left to right are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00028HN5A">Sojos Certified Organic Catnip</a>, in the middle is the product in this listing - Cosmic Catnip (this video review shows the 3oz jar), and on the far right we have <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VNEII0">Frontier Catnip Leaf & Flower C/s Certified Organic, 16 Ounce Bag</a>.<br /><br />Like the little bear at Goldilock's table, Tristan tries a bit from each plate; at the end of this clip he seemed to have no *overwhelming* preference for any particular brand though. As far as his physical reactions to each (sampled separately), he did not act "stoned" nor hyper, he merely scratches on his scratch pad a bit more with catnip than without catnip and gives himself a good stretch. He also strongly prefers catnip infused mice to non-catnip mice and I'm happy to oblige.<br /><br />As as far which *I* prefer, if it's all the same to the cat (and it seems that it is) here's my take on things -<br /><br />The Frontier brand is by far the least expensive at just under fifteen dollars for 16oz. It is slightly more coarse and seems to have a little bit of stems mixed in. VERY fragrant though and turned out to be a close second favorite of the cat reviewing the products. I would definitely buy the Frontier brand again and use it for stuffing toys generously or for "marinating" his little cloth mice. Organic and suitable even for human consumption if you like it as a tea.<br /><br />The Sojos brand (1oz can) is the most expensive - by my calculations comes to over a hundred dollars for 16oz!. The description says it produces a "harmless, euphoric state" but we saw no evidence of that. Smelled fresh but definitely a milder aroma than the other two brands; had the finest chopped leaves of the three. Hand harvested if that is important you or your cat.<br /><br />With the Cosmic Cat brand, we *may* have a winner.....<br /><br />When the camera was off, Tristan returned to the Cosmic Cat sample several times more so than the other brands. I repeated this little taste test for the next two days and Cosmic Cat had a small but definite edge over the competition. I'd have to say that I agree with his choice; the Cosmic Cat brand leaves are darker and more fragrant than the other two brands. The leaves are also cut just right - not too fine/not too large, and no stems or coarse pieces. I find the Cosmic Cat brand's price reasonable, the storage container is very convenient, and the 3oz* size is enough not to be too little and not so much to get stale and spoil.<br /><br />Hope you find this information useful in choosing for your own cat or kitten. 4
My dog just didn't like the taste of them which surprised me since he likes food.  Tried each flavor same result.  I cannot recommend. 1
Super good cookie for breakfast.  They surprisingly fill me up for a couple of hours (which for me is WONDERFUL).  I insist on eating as soon as I wake up in the morning, and this is a great way to get some whole grains and healthy stuff on the run.<br /><br />Perishable (which makes me happy) so don't stock up unless you have room in the freezer.  I keep mine in the refrigerator and so far no problems.<br /><br />My son likes them too. 5
this product is grainy and smells very strong. my son didn't care for it and when i tried it i didn't either. when i did further research on this product i was disappointed to learn that they use a process that involves hexane to separate the oil used in their "barrel drying". 1
I am so glad i started using this butter to cook with, it just makes anything taste great. the flavor is really buttery. Baking is also fantastic i think it adds moisture and a wonderful texture to foods. A must have in any pantry and it doesn't need refrigeration, so it always ready to use and easy to spread. 5
Kettle Brand chips used to be so good...oily, crunchy, flavorful. I suspect the company has been bought out and the recipe has been changed for the worse. Now they're no better than any other big name brand chip. Try the Good Health Kettle Style Olive Oil chips instead. They are as good as the Kettle Brand once was. R.I.P., Kettle Brand chips. :( 1
It didn't work well for me in the microwave. Will not purchase a 2nd time. 1
Kavli Crispy Thin Crispbread is the right consistency for multiple uses.  The taste is fantastic.  It's fresh and pleasant to eat.  Kavli products are the best. 5
The Caribou Blend k cups have fulfilled our household's need for a plain old cup of coffee in the morning that isn't anything fancy, but still gets the job done.  We were searching for a blend that was smooth and flavorful while still being easy to drink and mild.  I particularly like medium roasts and I don't care for a coffee with a lot of acidity and a bitter aftertaste, so this one fits the bill.<br /><br />The only downside to this k cup is that the aroma.  It wasn't the most appetizing after the first cup was brewed, but it made up for that in taste.  This isn't a point that really bothers me, but I could see it being a downside for some people.<br /><br />When I brew this blend on my way out the door, I often throw in some french vanilla creamer and it's my perfect morning caffeine kick.<br /><br />So far this is the best average blend we've tried.  We're open to others but until we find something better, we're sticking with the Caribou Blend. 3
These "Whenever Bars" taste like soft chocolate chip cookies. The coconut flavor is very good and natural tasting.<br /><br />Don't be deceived by the size of the package. The wrapper is much larger than the bar. Still, it is a satisfying snack and comes in at a respectable 180 calories.<br /><br />I eat them around mid-morning or as a late night snack. I do not avoid gluten, wheat, or dairy (these bars are wheat-free, gluten-free, and non-dairy) but do enjoy organic foods and was pleased to see healthy ingredients including oats, agave, chia seeds, brown rice flour, etc.<br /><br />Once these become available in the Subscribe and Save program I feel certain I will subscribe. They are great to have around for a low calorie, sweet treat. 5
I first discovered Somersaults a couple weeks ago and they were quite good. Not only did they taste exceptional (Sea Salt and Salt and Pepper varieties), but the nutritional content was excellent, quite in contrast to most snacks. As such, I bought a third variety and this one was the Dutch Cocoa. Alas, I just don't care for these at all. The first two tasted like a very interesting salty and nutty snacks. These tasted like stale cookies. Okay, some people might like them, but I'm not one of those. I'd still say that they're good in their nutritional value, but I don't care for the taste on this variety. I'm going to have trouble finishing the bag.<br /><br />Gary Peterson 3
I've tried this out, and honestly it's far more cost effective to pick up some organic (or heck, even regular) peanut butter from the grocery.<br /><br />I find filling the toys up with the peanut butter & freezing them for 10-15 minutes is an ideal way to keep the fur babies busy. 2
My cats would give this stuff 5 stars for sure.  I would only give it two stars, just because it's not the most nutritious food in the world.  I mix some Deli-Cat in with the Purina Pro Plan that comprises the majority of my cats' food.  When they leave food though, they leave the Pro Plan.  Evidently the Deli-Cat tastes better.  T have read and been told that the best cat food should have real meat and rice as the first two ingredients, which this definitely does not. 3
This is the only time I will order this.  I like coconut and I like water but this stuff is nasty.  Maybe I got a bad batch or something but I won't make that mistake twice. 2
I received this product from Amazon who sent me the oldest stock possible. The postage alone cost about $60 and i ordered about $60 worth of the product. Most of the items I received were only 2 to 3 weeks from their sell by date and are rancid or stale. It was a huge disappointment receiving these and I will never order this product again.Neither will i recommend anyone buy this product from Amazon. It makes you think that Garden of Eatin products are not good but I have bought them before at my local grocery store and they tasted great,so I know for sure that the problem is with Amazon stock. For me, thats $120 wasted as returns are apparently not possible. very very disappointed with Amazon.com, because i shop at Amazon.co.uk very often and have rarely been disappointed and even when there have been disappointments, they are immediately rectified. Amazon.com does not allow refunds or returns on this item, so beware! 1
These are pretty decent and don't taste like cardboard. They make good S'mores too. My only complaint is that they don't seem to get hard even when made into S'mores using the oven. 3
Be careful when odering this, because they say it's a 6 pk, but you will only get a 4 pk, plus the formula goes out in 4 months.  So if you did like I did and got it early for grandchildren your out of luck!  So I know I will not be buying off of this site again for food for my grandchildren, because they won't be able to eat it. 1
This is good tasting granola. The granola itself is crunchy but not too dry by granola standards, and filling. The dark chocolate is very good quality. The berries are tasty and not sweet at all but add a little acid.<br /><br />If you get a handfull of granola with both together that is a good combo. But the bag is mostly granola and that doesn't happen too often. Nonetheless, the overal product is still very good, healthy, and good value for organic and low sodium. A good snack to try that you can feel good about. Recommended. 4
My Rottie, with a sensitive stomach, is able to tolerate these treats well.  The best part is she actually has to chew them for a few moments...if you have a Rottwieler you know what I mean.  Any treat is chomped on in 1 second and gone... I feel good about these treats because they seem very healthy for large dogs...although, my daughters Chiauau loves them ! 4
Seriously, this is one of the best bar gadgets one could ever find! It just arrived today and I've already put it to the test. It's so easy to use and makes stuffing blue cheese olives quick and easy! It's also extremely well made with a great design. Only thing that could make it better would be a button/feature that dispersed pre-made belvedere martinis :D Definitely no complaints. 5
Nutiva is a company based out of Sebastopol.... California. Their hemp seed is excellent for stir fries, salads, and their 13 ounce pouches last awhile. I've used their hemp seed as a substitute for sesame seed in stir fries in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0836194942">Simply in Season Expanded Edition (World Community Cookbook)</a>, as well as in the Mayan Wonder Bars and Rasta Pasta Primavera in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0825305845">Vegan Fusion World Cuisine: Extraordinary Recipes & Timeless Wisdom from the Celebrated Blossoming Lotus Restaurants</a>. It's versatile and has a subtle nutty flavor. They add extra protein. Nutritious and delicious! 5
Recently tried this milk chocolate k cup from Amazon. The only thing this drink has in common with chocolate is its color.Of the 13 items listed as ingredients  cocoa is number 8.It has a chemical smell and a chemical taste.If you buy this junk don't say you were not warned. It does not deserve ANY stars. 1
It seems like a pheonem deal and you saying, yeah i wont regret this. Tastes like crap after the second pack. 3
My dogs really like these. My six year old adopted Spoodle came to us with bad teeth and a weight problem. She had 14 teeth pulled and is halfway to her weight goal, and has learned to like crunchy snacks.<br /><br />My ten year old lab likes anything, but also needs to watch his teeth and his weight.<br /><br />I like to give them a treat before I leave the house, so that they are happy instead of anxious when they see me get my coat and keys.<br /><br />These treats are perfect at only 18 calores each, and the dogs are excited to eat them. The lab makes short work of it, but the Spoodle gets to give her remaining teeth a workout. ChristineJW 5
I don't like to drink sodas because they really aren't good for you.  Water can get boring, so I thought this might be good.  I saw what was printed on the box, "blackberry pomegranate flavor with other natural flavor, no aspartame".  Hey, that sounds good, but further box reading shows it contains sucralose, here is one comment I found about sucralose:  According to the book Sweet Deception, sucralose is made when sugar is treated with trityl chloride, acetic anhydride, hydrogen chlorine, thionyl chloride, and methanol in the presence of dimethylformamide, 4-methylmorpholine, toluene, methyl isobutyl ketone, acetic acid, benzyltriethlyammonium chloride, and sodium methoxide, making it unlike anything found in nature. If you read the fine print on the Splenda web site, it states that "although sucralose has a structure like sugar and a sugar-like taste, it is not natural."  That kind of ruins this drink mix for me.  If a company (Lipton) wants to put Natural all over its packaging, then be natural all the way, not just a few ingredients. 2
I received this product in the mail yesterday. It was a different dino than pictured, but the description notes that it pay be. My dog (a 35 lb beagle/lab) chewed most of it up by last night. Other Nylabone products are fine for him, but this one doesn't look like it will last long. Also, it is a lot smaller than I anticipated. 2
This coffee was not what I expected but enjoyed it greatly.  I was looking for a stronger vanilla flavor but after trying it I enjoyed it a lot. It was light and smooth and left no aftertaste.  I would recommend this to others. 4
When one purchases a product that is called Newman's Organics, one would expect organic food.  Not just the vegetables, which are much less expensive to be organic than the meat or chicken.  I was very, very disappointed to find out that the chicken is not organic.  For a couple of dollars more, just buy real organic dog food. This dog food isn't exactly cheap, so you expect that they will provide what they are advertising.  This whole "greenwashing" thing needs to be regulated better.  If someone uses the word organic in their description, it better be organic.  Otherwise the consumer is being deceived which is unfortunate.  Newmans has a great reputation, I buy a lot of their products, but this was intentionally deceptive and it makes me reconsider buying anything from them in the future.<br /><br />On the positive side, my dog loved it, she would lick the bowl around the room for 20 minutes after the last morsel was consumed.  I have no idea what they put in it that tasted so good, it's like the crack cocaine of dog food.  She has never been a finicky eater, she'll pretty much eat anything voraciously, but this stuff really rocked her epicurean world.  Too bad she isn't getting any more of it. 2
Right now I own 3 cats that I found outside, a good eight years ago, and I found another cat which I adopted also.  I have always fed them Eukanuba Adult Lamb&Rice dry cat food, and they truly LOVE IT!  When you first open the bag you can smell the savory aroma!  Of the 3 cats that I found outdoor and adopted, one turned out to be a Turkish Angora and the other has markings similar to that of a snow leopard, and the third cat I found out is part Egyptian mau.  I also feed a feral cat who has been living in my back yard for 10 years.  They all love this food, and even when they changed the formula of this food a few years ago, they still eat it and love it!  If you read the ingredients, it is excellently made, and a real plus for their diet!  They've been eating it for years now, and I have yet to see any of my cats turn up their nose to this food.<br /><br />The other dry foods that my cats love is Fancy Feast Gourmet Filet Mignon Flavor with Real Seafood & Shrimp Dry Cat Food and they've just started eating Eagle Pack Natural Pet Food, Indoor Formula for Cats and a cat food brand called 'Artemis'.  I haven't any problems with them eating any of these dry foods, and I've been rescuing cats for over 30 years now, and have owned as many as 7 cats at one time.  One set of kittens were born outdoor and I brought them indoors with their mother and kept them all until the day they passed on(they all lived to be close to 20 years of age) and they too ate Eukanuba lamb&rice and loved it!<br /><br />I have had foods that they turned up their nose with like 'Chicken Soup' and 'Taste of the Wild'.  The same way we humans have our likes and dislikes is the same way that these cats have their likes and dislikes.  What's good for one cat might not be good for another.  You just have to learn your cat, and see what they like and just give it to them.  While my cats are in love with Eukanuba lamb&rice, maybe your cat will also or maybe not, but it isn't fair to not try this food because of a review where the owner says that their cat doesn't like it. As previously stated, maybe your cat will not like it or maybe your cat will love it!  I've tried cat foods based on good reviews figuring that the food will automatically be a hit and sometimes it was and sometimes it wasn't!  It's all up to the cat! 5
I have tried several incarnations of this tea, both in bags and loose. Numi's loose version is cut bigger, which means less sediment, but I prefer Stash's smaller resealable bags.<br />I really like the sweet taste and often mix honeybush with rooibos. 4
Many of these exploded making a huge mess with grounds spewing in and out of the cup and onto the counter.<br />After the first one I thought maybe there was one bad one.  I have seen it before with Green Mountain brand but rarely,  Maybe one out of 10 boxes.<br />After the third one exploded I tossed the remainder in the trash. 1
I bought this because of the good feedback and bad luck that I have had with canned crab. I was hoping that this product was different than  previous canned crab that I have had. Alas, it is just a little better. Unfortunately, canned crab just seems to be not very good and I have  to stick with fresh expensive crab. 3
These are one of those thin, more subtly flavored cookies that work better going with a hot beverage than on their own.<br /><br />I do like the regular Fig Newtons better, but these serve a different purpose, so comparing them isn't really that fair.<br /><br />3 stars because I feel the flavor could be improved, but all in all they're not bad. 3
Apparently they used too much synthetic flavors that it just burns your tongue. Also there's too much oil ... almost made me choke ... 1
I originally tried this as a Whole bean and loved it.<br /><br />When I saw it available as a K-cup I bought it right away.<br /><br />The rich flavor and great aroma has become a favorite.<br /><br />It isn's always available but I get it whenever it is 4
I picked these up for my wife so she could make coffee out of any brand she likes. They work perfectly in her new Keurig that I got her for Christmas. You couldn't ask for better. 5
Freeze dried liver has a hypnotic effect on dogs. They LOVE it and will do just about anything for it, so it is a great treat to use for training. (Powdered freeze dried liver is even added to many dog medicines nowadays-- heartworm and arthritis tablets, etc.-- because it causes the dog to scarf the medicine down like a treat.)<br /><br />Freeze dried liver has a dry, hard, yet powdery/easy to chew consistency. It comes chopped/cubed. It is extremely lightweight due to the fact there is so little moisture in the product (thus the low weights on product labels).<br /><br />Even though your dog will love liver treats, you shouldn't overfeed it. The manufacturer recommends 1-2 cubes daily for small dogs, 2-3 cubes for medium dogs, and 3-4 cubes for large dogs.<br /><br />The largest package sizes of liver treats tend to be far more economical. I recommend buying the larger tubs, as you will save lots of money, you'll have a handy treat supply around for a longer time, and your dog will never tire of this product.<br /><br />There is really zero waste with this product. When you near the end of the tub you'll find some powdery bits of dried liver at the bottom. Your dogs will go CRAZY if you sprinkle this dust over their dog food-- it's a wonderful reward that is easy to use.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Here's the nutritional analysis:<br /><br />-100% freeze dried liver<br />-NO additives or preservatives.<br /><br />-Crude protein..... not less than 50%<br />-Crude fat..... not less than 5%<br />-Crude fiber..... not more than 3%<br />-Moisture..... not more than 6% 5
This is too expensive.  Buy it in the stores where you can get a single can for $2.30. 1
Marley Coffee comes with no directions on the package, only the statement that it's single serving. It doesn't state what system of coffee brewing this was manufactured for.  The aroma is wonderful, however, I'd describe the coffee as mild not medium roast.  I was, therefore, disappointed in the flavor. Perhaps if it was brewed in a cone system or similar, I might have had a stronger result. 2
While the coffee is very tasty with lots of flavor I can't help being bothered by the high price. Everywhere: on line or in store. And the official site has it for 9.99/ box with 16 capsules of which 8 only is the coffee the rest is the milk. Well we need that too, still. 4
I'm a total chai tea freak, so when I see a chai tea that I haven't tried yet I pick it up.<br /><br />Twinings isn't bad at all, but there's just not enough "chai" in the tea.  It's basically a black tea with the barest hint of chai spice. 3
Much as another reviewer indicates, these bully sticks were anything but "thick".  My dog goes through bully sticks on a regular basis and to even call them standard sized was an overstatement.  My dog likes them so I have no complaint about the quality.  The problem is he can go through these at a rate of one a minute.<br /><br />If you are looking for small bullysticks these will suffice, but you can find them for far less elsewhere.  If you are looking for sticks bigger than a pencil, keep look elsewhere. 2
I ordered these without having tried them before- I tried a similar product made by a different brand (possibly a slightly different flavor?) and loved them, so when I saw these I thought "yes!" and ordered the bulk pack.<br />When I tasted them, however, my stomach said, "no!"  These are disgusting.  I repeat: disgusting.  They taste like ketchup, mustard, LOTS of sugar and EGG.  Which mixed together tastes like vomit.  Say, what you might expect after eating cotton candy and a corn dog and an omelet and then riding the tilt-a-whirl.  I have tried them several times to see if it is "an acquired taste" but, for me, it is not.  These make me nauseous every time.  Too bad.  I really wanted to like them.  Anyone want 4 and a half bags of this? 1
I'm not the best cook, but I like to try new things to make my diet healthier.  I confess that I LOVE ramen noodles, and this product helps me cut the salt content.  The flavor packet that comes in Ramen noodles usually has between 600-900 grams of sodium per serving (2 servings in the packet...I eat the whole thing, so that's a LOT of salt.  This Miso contains 880 grams sodium per tablespoon.  I add a table spoon to my ramen, then just a light sprinkle of original flavor packet, cutting the salt almost in half, while still adding a nice savory flavor.  I also add a handful of frozen peas, but I like to keep it simple.  I'm sure there are many other recipes and uses to be found out there, so enjoy! 5
I get these for the front desk at my office because customers love them. A couple were melted (i get into them myself, hehe). But who cares because they are the most delicious chocolates ever made!! 4
While "Wild Ride Beef Jerky Cowboy Strips" do have a good Hickory taste and are very tender (per treated), they are also fairly salty and leave a lot of "gristle" in your mouth. I also like that it doesn't have MSG (I'm alergic) but am disapointed that meat likely comes from outside the USA.<br /><br />On taste alone, my family is split on this jerky with 2 of us liking it (me and my son) and two of us not (my wife and daughter). We all like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EPPDOI">Wild Bill's Hickory Smoked Jerky, 6.5-Ounce Package (Pack of 4)</a>.<br /><br />I will not likely buy this brand again, even if it is on sale. 3
THESE ARE ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL COOKIES AND WE WERE LOOKING FORWARD TO RECEIVING OUR ORDER. HOWEVER, WHEN THEY ARRIVED, MOST OF THE COOKIES WERE BROKEN INTO CRUMBS. I THINK THESE COOKIES ARE TOO THIN TO ORDER BY MAIL; BUT I WAS REIMBURSED, THANKS TO AMAZON. 3
My husband does not like whole wheat anything but he liked this pizza dough. It was very simple to make and spread on our pizza stone. We put Rossi Pizza sauce and mozzarella cheese on and it was great! 4
I love this ricemilk.  It has the consistency of almond milk and no soy. 5
At this price I though for sure it was for more then one box of peeps.  Nope, I was wrong.  Local store had these for 0.95 and these were over 4 bucks.  You live you learn.  Stay away from this product!!!!!!!!! 1
I ordered these chips due to other readers reviews being so good. In addition, my pregnant wife and I enjoy foods that are portioned and easy for taking on the go. But the main reason I ordered these chips was that they are a health conscious choice and the flavor does not disappoint!

Smokehouse used to be USA chicken now CHINA.  I have been buying this product for a couple of years, and I always buy the USA MADE version.  Beware not clearly stated this is China 1
I don't eat chips often, but when I do, these are some of my favorites.  They have all the flavor and texture of traditional tortilla chips, but it is the subtle lime flavoring that makes them special.  The lime flavoring appears to be a seasoning that has been sprinkled on.  Some chips seem to have minimal flavor and I find myself looking for those with the most.  Still, none of them have quite enough for my tastes.  I wish that these chips had more than just a "hint" of lime. 4
I really liked this product and am sad that I can't get it with Subscribe and Save anymore. Why not? ( 4
ESPECIALLY AS WE GET OLDER, THE LINING OF OUR STOMACH GETS MORE SENSITIVE TO HARSH CHEMICALS AND SUBSTANCES.  LOW ACID COFFEE IS A COMMON SENSE SUBSTITUTE THAT LOSES NO AROMA OR TASTE IN THE PROCESS.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. 5
IF THIS IS YOUR FIRST HAPPY BABY PURCHASE, TRY AGAIN, THE REST ARE AMAZING! I love Happy Baby. My daughter eats this companies products all the time.  Chick Chick is great, Beef Stew is wonderful, but Gobble Gobble is weird.  My daughter didn't mind the taste, but I could not get over the texture.  It looked like a giant blob of wet dog food.  It was more putty-like than any other flavor.  I actually had to cut bites off of it.  I am grossed out just thinking about it.  Good thing there are other flavors. 2
I have tried many kinds of Glenny's soy crisps and find this one to be a bit too sweet for my taste. I prefer the onion, garlic ones, which are much more satisfying as a snack for me. For those who like sweet snacks, this would be a good choice. 3
My dog is a chewer. She loved chewing on them but I'm pretty sure it's what upset her stomach. I am going to give her another one today and change my review if she doesn't get sick again. It could have just been a coincidence. For now, just 2 stars. 2
Red mill's pumkin seeds are simply the best! Other seeds or "pepitas" don't come even close. Red mill's seeds are crunchy and very tasty. They are product of the U.S., not China like most pepitas. Well worth the price! 5
The illy issimo Coffee Drink is simple and delicious.  The taste is bold and flavorful, although perhaps not as strong as Starbucks.  Note that the Caff&egrave; drink comes in sugar-free (unsweetened) for those on low-carb diets, but the "Beet" sweetener in here is medium, not too sugary, and does not overpower the drink. 4
This "New & Improved Spearmint" has obvious chemical flavor additives...which to me similar to peppermint. If I wanted peppermint, I would buy it! Also...who needs to ingest more chemicals? Our bodies arn't made for man made chemicals! It's a shame that Wrigley's took a good product & made is detestable!<br />[...] 1
As a snack directly out out of the can I found these dry.  I guess when I think of chocolate almonds I like the mouth feel of actual chocolate melting and thus these almonds left me wanting more.  However, I found them to be an excellent ingredient in recipes that call for almonds.  Since they have  a LOT less salt than the typical almond they do not conflict with the sweetness of a dessert and the coating seems to keep them more crunchy in the batter.  I used them both whole in  brownies (fantastic) and chopped in choc chip cookies (great).  I chopped up too many for the cookies and used them to dust over vanilla ice cream served with the brownies.  Everyone raved about them. 4
I had read about, tasted and really liked this distinctive style of black pepper obtained from another vendor (World of Spice?). So when placing an order with Angelina's, I included this item and was very pleased by the price. However, they were completely nondistinctive, from the beginning. I don't know if they were stale from the start, or not what they were represented to be, or as the Test Kitchen recently reported -- not all tellicherry peppercorns are alike from different vendors. Anyway, while I generally like Angelina's products and believe this vendor is a good one, I give a thumbs down to this particular item. Try them from another vendor. 1
This is not a bad beverage but great either, and given how messy it is to make I wish I hadn't bothered with it. The serving size is huge; I used my biggest mug and I still had to stop the machine early to keep it from overflowing. It uses 2 milk cartridges and in between them 1 espresso cartridge. It's hard to taste the coffee at all in the result because there's so little of it compared to the milk. Unsurprisingly the milk tastes like reconstituted powdered milk and the flavor is just a bit off compared to natural milk. So you get a huge serving of milk that doesn't even taste great, with a tiny bit of coffee somewhere in it. I ended up making it with just 1 milk and 1 espresso cartridge and even so it tasted a lot more like milk than coffee.<br /><br />The visual effect of coffee sandwiched between milk looks beautiful on the packaging, but keep in mind that you won't see it unless you actually have transparent mugs or heat-proof glasses.<br /><br />Finally there's just no good way to remove the used milk cartridges from the machine without spilling hot milk on your fingers and making a mess. They're only half empty when they're done and if you don't flip them over extremely fast, you'll get hot milk on your fingertips. I am particularly sensitive to heat so this might not be a problem for others - however the issue about the cartridges dripping over the machine and all the way to the trash can will always be there.<br /><br />The beverage has an interesting flavor and it's a pretty original idea for a coffee machine so I don't regret trying it once, but it's not worth bothering with on a regular basis. 3
I've always been a huge fan of 5-hour energy drinks, but it's just too expensive for me to take on a regular basis, I know I tried! I've always preferred not to drink coffee, the only way I can stand it is if I overload it with sugar so that's kind of a bust. My co-worker who is a crazy health nut introduced me to this energy stack, Energy Booster Stack (90 Day Servings!) Better Than Jack3d, Red Bull, Monster, Hemorage, Caffeine, Rockstar Drink which I've been taking in the morning and really liking it. If you ever taken raspberry ketones, dmaa, or yohimbine extract then you know what I mean when I talk about an energy high that feels different from caffeine.<br /><br />I also like the cost, very affordable. I'll always be a 5-hour energy drinker here and there but if you need a consistent source of energy and are concerned with price, this is the most effective and cost effective energy booster I've found. Hope this helps someone! 4
My baby has been eating this brand since he was 6 months. I like the convenience of high quality/yet not overly pricey jar food like this. It is easy on his stomach. Never had any health issues with it. The "dinners" are a bit more filling than the usual watery vegetable puree but it still does need a little cereal to thicken up. Summer vegetable is his least favorite. The zucchini (like cucumber) smells pretty strong. He would eat it now but when we first started, he hated it. My son loves the other 3 flavors and that's why I continued with my subscription since it's more expensive to buy them separately. 4
When the product was received the box was broken, some of the chocolates were broken, and the chocolates were upside down and scatter throughout the box. I also found that the chocolate itself tasted fine, but the filling was sub par to say the least. Some tasted bad, but most were just bland. I would not recommend this to anyone. 1
Item not as pictured or described. Smaller, much smaller. Tho I will admit the one I got was in good condition, it wasn't what I expected.  Green is beginning to yellow at the bottom ends where attached to trunk.... It was wrapped pretty tight but no fragile on box or other such info for postal carefulness just some packing peanuts thrown in the box... Wish it was more as pictured but for 12.00 I can work with it! 2
I am not Muslim, but was interested in this jerky because of its low carb content compared to some other brands of "sweet" jerky out there.  It has a slightly sweet taste and great flavor (spicy...but NOT hot)!  It is easy to chew and doesn't leave your fingers sticky. I wish it came in more economical sizes (6, 9, or 12 oz sizes), but that doesn't seem to be the case.  It's a great jerky and might just be addictive, which probably makes the 3 ounces bag size a good choice...after the first 3 ounces you HAVE TO STOP (at least long enough to open another bag)!!! 5
I have purchased the Oskri dark chocolate with coconut bars and absolutely loved them! This time the dark chocolate was not available so I tried the milk chocolate. I figured they wouldn't be as good as dark chocolate since i prefer dark but thought they would still be tasty. The package I received was dented and the chocolate bars were melted. It makes it hard to open since each bar is bent and chocolate is stuck to packaging. The bars themselves taste a little stale. Needless to say this purchase was a big disappointment as I love coconut and chocolate. 3
I was giving my dogs Science Diet Puppy food from the time I got them at 8 weeks. Science Diet changed the formula about 3 months ago and the food just did not smell or look right. It was very oily and fishy smelling, which I realize they did at more fish oil. After about three weeks of the new food, I noticed my puppies (well now 1 year olds) skin was very flaky like dandruff and they both had been continuous licking their paws. I took them to the vet and he said they had food allergies. He wanted me to take them off the Science diet and put them on pumpkin and pinto beans for 7 weeks. Well, under duress I tried it and my dogs did not eat for 3 days. I decided to try the Newman's organic and after about 4 weeks their coat looks so much better and the licking has really decreased. I am so glad I saw this food when I was doing research. 4
This is a very pretty container, and my granddaughter loved the blue color when mixed with water-- but--- it tastes more like coconut than chocolate-- should be labeled hot coconut drink. 2
All the 5-star reviews convinced me to buy these...I wish I hadn't :(  It's been two months since I purchased them and I still have four out of the six containers unopened.  They're just blah.  Now the chili lime flavored almonds from Blue Diamond, on the other hand, are Mmm Mmm good! 2
I absolutly love these candies that are only put on the market at Christmas and Valentine's Day. I would buy them all year if they were available: SO you can imagine how excited I was tao be able to get them for a while through Amazon.I can wait untill Christmas when they will be available again. 5
I like these pitted prunes for breakfast in the morning, they are good with cereal and are high in fiber. I have always liked SunMaid products and I  like these prunes. 4
It has been said, that dogs often show signs of their owner's personality and quirks---that our bad behaviors become their own.  In fact, my dog's Vet recently told me, that if he sees an obese dog, he can just glance at the owner, and they will often share the problem.  Not only that, but I've seen photos of dogs and owners, where I swear there was a shared physical resemblance.  What do we try to do, make our dogs into a little mini-me?  With this sudden jarring epiphany, I think we're in trouble here.<br /><br />Although my dog is far from a 'mini-me,' at 126 lbs and 30" tall, given the opportunity to select a healthy, organic snack, over an inferior product, well...let me just make this analogy.  If I'm really having a craving for a snack, and there is a bag of Cheetos in the cabinet, I'm more likely to grab them, than the 'all natural' carrot sticks and celery in the veggie drawer. Enough said, and I clearly know better.  My Shepherd doesn't. He eats a high quality food, but I have let him dictate his treats, based on his observable level of enjoyment. In essence---we DO spoil our dogs, and ourselves.<br /><br />In test after test, given the opportunity to select the 'Newman's Own' treat, over my dog's favorite bargain brand---okay, Milk Bones, he would go for the MB every single time. But, toward the end of the bag of Newman's Own, I began to notice a change in enthusiasm.  Maybe eating healthy for humans and dogs, alike, is an aquired taste, or simply a change in habits.<br /><br />Will I purchase Newman's Own, after this trial? Absolutely! I'm sold on the all natural ingredients, the absence of chemicals and the product analysis. The only thing I found missing from the product description is the calorie count, with recommendations for appropriate number of treats, daily, which I think is important for managing weight. Although with the few 'natural' ingredients listed (Organic Barley, Organic Lamb, Organic Carrots, Apples, Organic Palm Oil and Organic Molasses, preserved with Mixed Tocopherols---a source of Vi E) I doubt the calorie count could be that high, as these are not large treats.<br /><br />These treats are hard, and dense, which gave my dog a good dental workout, even with his mouth the size of a small alligator. Of course, it was gone in just a minute (but so is everything else), but smaller dogs would likely enjoy chewing on one of these for a while.<br /><br />I say, give them a try. You won't find anything healthier (per the product description), unless you decide to make your own dog biscuits, which many of my friends are now doing. But, doing so, wouldn't be more cost effective, because you would need to purchase all organic, while baking them in small batches due to preservative issues. 5
You can buy the same bag of chocolate at any Michaels store for $2.99.  I got a ton of bags on sale for $1.99 there!  Don't waste your money or your time waiting for this bag 1
Like most other 'sauces' in this heat range, this sauce adds heat to a dish without significantly affecting the flavor.  When you want to control the flavor of a dish with its other ingredients and just add pure heat, this is ideal.  The bottle has a dropper attached to the lid, so it is easy to meter out just the right amount.  Although the price seems a bit high for such a small bottle, it really is a good deal since it only takes a small amount to add a lot of heat. 5
I wish I had noticed the list of ingredients before I purchased this product. It is not just cheese. Read the ingredients. MSG is bad for you and there are about 15 ingredients besides the cheese. YUCK! I will throw them out. They don't taste that great either. 1
The flavor and texture of the macaroni is decent; not as good as Tinkyada rice pasta products I've had, but palatable.  But the "cheese" sauce is seriously lacking.  I had to add a considerable amount of shredded cheddar cheese to make this actually taste cheesy.  Given the high price per (puny) serving, I shouldn't have to be doctoring it up to get to taste like macaroni and CHEESE. 2
I love this brand of dog food but the pups just didn't like this particular flavor.... 3
Can get it  same or lower price elsewhere...Don't see the point of ordering. Like this then. The other comments solidify this idea. 1
Okay, a lot of chicken breast treats from China are causing dogs to be sick (see the FDA website for details).  This is not one of them, but when I started buying it, it was made in the USA.  Now it's made in China.  Although my dogs have long loved this treat, I'm in the process of searching for a replacement made in a safe country. 1
I ordered three of the trays (being a date nut) and found that two were old or stale. I admit to not checking the out-of-date on the exterior package, but still - dried out fruit.?! The last tray was fresher, but the experience was soured at that point. I'm disappointed. 2
This is the best dog food I have ever purchased, and having been a dog training for over 4 years, I've purchased A LOT! We first tried this food when our new addition (an 8-week old German Shepherd) joined the family, and we wanted to keep him on a natural dog food. With any purebred dog, health can be an issue, and you don't want to fill your dog with by-products and plant fillers from day one. This food is praised by unbiased pet food reviewers, and I don't understand why there isn't more publicity for this product. Our other dog, a 5-year old English Bulldog with constant skin/allergy issues, was switched over when we discovered this brand, and she has not had an allergic reaction since! We didn't realize how much it had to do with diet. Her hair used to fall out in spring (not just normal shedding, but actual balding from hair loss), but this has alleviated that problem as well. Now our shepherd is a year and a half old, and he's eating this Large Breed Adult Lamb & Rice flavor. He's not a big eater, but he loves this food! Will definitely keep him, and all future pets, on this brand as long as they keep their standards as high as they are now!! Kudos Diamond for making a wonderful natural dog food.<br /><br />SIDE NOTE: I would never buy regular Diamond brand food. If the bag doesn't say "Natural" on it, the standards they are kept to are WAY lower and the quality suffers immensely. Stick with Natural (it's a couple dollars more at most!) and your dog will be happier and healthier and live a longer life! Isn't that what we all want?!? 5
Melitta Cafe is a smooth, flavorful coffee that compares well with regular coffee.  This is not the typical weak decaf blend that is true of many American brands.  Melitta has a rich, deep taste and a nice dark color.  Tastes great black or with cream.  As a stand alone coffee (no cream/sugar) it has a smooth, though strong flavor just like regular coffee.  This coffee is especially great as an after dinner drink.  Strong enough to taste like regular coffee but decaffeinated so it will not prevent sleep later.  Great coffee. 5
These are definitely the worst snack I have ever purchased in my life.  Dry as the Sahara Desert, not much taste, and way overpriced.  Save your hard-earned money for something else. 1
I liked it very much.I would give it five stars but when I got the pocky all of them were melted together and it was a mess! 2
Reality strikes.  I have been drinking this tea every night for 10 years !  It is the best thing to keep me on the straight n narrow! 5
I have made waffles with this mix twice and pancakes once.  The texture is perfect. Because they are whole wheat they are hearty but they are still fluffy.  They are slightly sweet and smell so yummy while your waiting for them to finish................  The next time I order the three pack I'm going to try one of their other products. 5
Too often someone does not bring all of the supplies.  These canisters make is so much easier to get a fresh cup of coffee without grounds to clean up afterwards! 5
For health reasons, I try to eat highly nutritious low carb foods. I love tapioca but it's 100% carbs with no nutritional value. I was introduced to chia seeds and it is a highly nutritious low carb food but it is also a fun food. It absorbs 12x its weight in liquids and puffs up and reminds me of tapioca with a strawberry seed inside (and that's what it tastes/feels like). Another one of my favorites is the Mexican drink called: Chia fresca, which is basically soaked chia seeds in lemonade. You have to experience it yourself to know why it's so popular.  One lb. added to liquid will create 10-14# of highly nutritious food.<br /><br />Chia seeds (best known for the chia pet) are high in protein, 5x the calcium of milk and high in Omega 3 oils. Chia seeds are seeds of an herb and are grown in Mexico, south & central America and were the food of the Aztecs.<br /><br />I would think you could make faux tapioca pudding with just coconut milk, chia seeds & sweetener, but I don't know how well the chia would absorb the coconut milk since it's so fatty. (Can of coconut milk, 1/4 cup chia seeds & sweetener to taste) I make it with 2 cups of water, 4 scoops of whey protein, then I soak one cup of chia seeds in this and when it has plumped up, I add 2 cans of coconut milk and sweetener. Sometimes I cream a package of cream cheese into a can of pumpkin, cinnamon and add that for more nutrition for a pumpkin pie tapioca pudding. 5
Glad to find these in a one ounce size but the bag seems a bit less than full. It's hard to find single serving chip bags that vend well. Sometimes they are too wide. or too plump with air. Bag size is good. BBQ flavor is about an 8 out of 10. 4
These nuts are a decent snack on their own and I've made cookies with them as well. They are slightly sweet and I don't think the Splenda taste is overwhelming or unpleasant, but that is obviously a personal preference. Bought them on sale at Target for $3 a package, or about half the current listed price here. 2
I decided to give this product a try after reading all of the health benefits. I wanted to try something new and healthy.<br /><br />I cannot stand the taste of this drink. It tastes like very watered down tomato juice. It is just not for me. If you like tomato juice, or watered down tomato juice, then maybe you will like this product, but it just does not appeal to me in the least. (The tomato taste comes from the Pomegranate).<br /><br />The little containers are nice. They have a twist off cap which is also nice. My shipping box was totally destroyed though. There was no tape on the one side, so the box was completely open. The case to the drinks itself was tore open too. All of the juice containers were laid inside the shipping box, since the product box was tore open. I am thinking this happened during transit, but there is no way to tell for sure. I get UPS deliveries almost every day and have never had something arrive in poor condition like this, so I don't know what happened there.<br /><br />Anyway, I do not recommend this product. The flavor was horrible and very bland. Others may like it if they like very bland/watered down tomato juice products or very bland Pomegranate products. You DO NOT taste any coconut flavor at all! 1
I mixed this into a Bulgogi type of recipe.  Decent taste, don't use too much though 4
I was hoping to "sneak" beets into my sons snack, but there is no hiding with this brand. In fact, the beet flavor is rather overwhelming, and rather on the "raw" side. I enjoy beets, pickled and roasted, but this flavor is just not appealing at all. If your kid loves beets (maybe even raw ones?) go for it.  Also, someone commented on it being a runny consistency but my recently ordered batch is on the thick side. 2
It's very nice that the company put 100 calories packages out--great marketing idea.  They taste okay to me.  A bit subtle on the chocolate IHMO.  Mostly they're lightly-flavored, chocolate, wheat crackers.  They have very little nutritional value but over 39% sugar.  The 100 calories is achieved by a very light product--it doesn't weigh much.  So, 100 calories sounds great--but only if you eat but one package.  Not easy to do if you're hungry.  Still, it's a convenient snack to put in a backpack, lunch box, carry-on (now that they don't feed you much when you fly), etc. with less calories than most alternatives.  Could also tide you over between meals.  Still, I'd personally prefer something a bit healthier.  But that's why there's chocolate & vanilla--oops, they left out the vanilla! 3
I usually buy my coffee from Tully's at around $15 for 25 cups. This package not only gives you a good variety but the coffee also tastes great and is a great value. 3
I want to be clear, I am not speaking of nor picking on just this one product, but like most dog foods out there that have these lovely names, "Holistic",'Natural','Healthy',etc,there is usually nothing to back up claims of being healthier nor of better quality than the less expensive brands. The ingredients often are the same as most other dog foods, comprised of substances of the poorest quality, including ingredients that are not even considered food.'Made with chicken' can mean as low as 3% chicken legally. Generally, only meats totally unable to be used for any other purpose at all are added to dog foods, and often includes feces, talons, feathers, hide, teeth, tumors and worse. Many of these poor grade and disgusting 'meats' are also then soaked in chemicals before being added to dog foods, the FDA's great idea to keep the meat  from actually being used in 'people' food--but I doubt you want your dog's food soaked in chemicals. People truly love their pets, and for some of us, it's all the family we have or certainly the ones that seem to understand us best. I'm working on a recipe that will work well for my dogs, human-grade. In days gone by, we raised our 'mutts' often on just left over table scraps and they flourished... because they were getting 'people grade' food. If you use canned dog food, smell the opened, refrigerated can on day 2,3 or 4--if it smells good, you will know. If not it's rancid--bad, spoiled, musty. We feed organic dog food now, not much more $$ but I don't 'trust' any of them,& try to make sure it's not from China or anywhere but the USA, and I keep an eye on ingredients and smell regularly, and I rotate. Even those with added supplements and vitamins may use those that are useless, poor quality that are not absorbed.<br />Manufacturers preserve with either synthetic or "natural" preservatives. Synthetic preservatives include butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), propyl gallate, propylene glycol (also used as a less-toxic version of automotive antifreeze), and ethoxyquin. There is little information documenting their toxicity, safety, interactions, or chronic use in pet foods that may be eaten every day for the life of the animal. Propylene glycol was banned in cat food because it causes anemia in cats, but it is still allowed in dog food.<br />Potentially cancer-causing agents such as BHT or BHA, and ethoxyquin is permitted at some levels. The use of these chemicals in pet foods has not been thoroughly studied, and long term build-up of these agents may ultimately be very harmful. July 1997 the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine requested that manufacturers voluntarily reduce in half the maximum level of ethoxyquin by half. Some pet food critics and veterinarians believe that ethoxyquin is a major cause of disease, skin problems, and infertility in dogs. Hey, who loves my pets more, me or these companies? Hmmm? 2
I have been looking for red popcorn for some time and when I found this I was pretty excited and ordered it even though I had to order so much. I used to buy red popcorn when I lived in the midwest but have never seen it in the northwest. I have only popped it once and there were a lot of unpopped kernels.  My cheap yellow popcorn from the grocery store is much better than this.  I am very disappointed and don't recommend buying it. 1
A hint of Pepper is an under-statement!  If you do not like Pepper, than these are are not for you!  For Pepper lovers this may be a perfect snack for you. The container has mostly whole cashews!!  If you love cashews like I do and pepper is what you put on your food (which I don't)than the taste of these will be a different taste experience.  I did like the taste of the sea salt. A good treat for your social gatherings. 4
Looking forward to receiving this product and when it arrived it was covered in walnuts.  Unfortunately, tree nuts are an issue and I wish that there was information about nuts on the items listing.  I will bring it to work for the staff to enjoy.<br /><br />Addendum:  Staff loved the babka.  Picture of product now shows nuts on top, prior listing did not.  5 stars for the babka and 3 stars for the lack of ingredient list. (At least major allergens). 5
I opened a bag of this treat (the "Made with Real DUCK" flavor) a week ago.  It was a part of the Christmas present I gave to my 5-month old miniature schnauzer.  My pet is crazy over this treat!  I would have given this product five stars because my puppy loves it and it's highly nutritious (as claimed by the manufacturer).  But I reduced my scoring to two-stars because it makes my puppy pass obnoxious-smelling gas.  It doesn't bother him but it does me!  When I reviewed the list of ingredients, I found a possible culprit: sweet potato. This is a root crop known to cause flatulence. 2
This GF cereal is decent.  Doesn't get soggy easily and is relatively good.<br /><br />I was a huge fan of Apple Cinnamon Cheerios before going gluten free, and these really don't compare well, but the cereal doesn't taste like cardboard and doesn't have the weird gluten free taste to it, and is actually pretty good. 4
I bought this tea with great anticipation....gunpowder tea and mint sounded wonderful.  WELL!!  Look at that photo carefully.  This tea is unsweetened.  Ugh!  No where is there a written description regarding this.  Also, the mint is peppermint.  I figured it was going to be spearmint.  Finally, i thought gunpowder tea was a black tea.  This product is made with a green tea....leaving it with very little tea flavor.  Very strong peppermint flavor instead.  Guess that was my error in assumption on many things.  To me, not worth the money.  Bottles are smaller than expected and not one of the better made Tao products. 2
I am a cookie lover so was really excited when I found a cookie I could eat! However, the prepared dough from this mix smelled really bad. I didn't even lick the bowl like I usually do. I hoped that the cookies would be good after being baked, but boy was I wrong. They were so bad I couldn't even eat a whole cookie, honestly! If you gluten-free folks haven't yet found the perfect gluten-free cookie, check out the line of cookie mixes from Colie's Cookies ([...]). It's a new business and the products are only available online. I tried the sample pack consisting of 6 different flavors.. and all 6 were super yummy! Even my non-gluten-free friends and family said they were EXCELLENT and couldn't taste the "gluten-free" aspect! If you haven't yet tried them, you are in for a real treat! 1
I can't believe how gross these bars are!  They sounded pretty good, and after reading the other reviews, I thought I'd give them a try.  I sure wish I hadn't!!!  Now I am stuck with a whole box, and I couldn't even gag one of them down.  They have the worst aftertaste.  It doesn't even taste like edible food.  They are greasy and taste like vomit.  Sorry to sound so dramatic, but I want to prevent you from making the same mistake I did and save you your money.  Don't buy them!!!<br /><br />ps- is there anybody out there who actually likes them and wants to buy a case minus 1 off of me?!  I'll sell them for cheap!!  :0) 1
Have never seen this in the stores, my favorite is Peppered but also ordered this at the same time.  Was glad I did.  Very good flavor, kind of spicy "after the fact".  Love the single serving packs so you don't eat too much and great source of protien! 4
Although some may like this drink, it will not be a repeat buy for me.  140 calories for an 8+ oz serving is too much when that amount of orange juice is 115.  Actually this drink isn't 100% orange/tangerine juice, but a mix of juices.  Secondly, if this were unaltered juice, seems you wouldn't have to add ascorbic acid to get 100% of your daily Vitamin C since that amount of orange juice naturally provides over 150%. Perhaps the processing requires it. But, alas, the biggest issue for me was taste.  It tasted to me like dishwashing liquid smells.<br /><br />On the good side, the carbonization is just right and the flavor is bold for those who seek that.  There is no sugar added and the non-traditional taste is not overly sweet.  The taste may appeal to some, but I'm not a fan. 2
My puppies go nuts for these things. They seem to really satisfy the urge to chew. I'd give them 5 stars, but I think they're a bit overpriced. Still, this is a much better deal than at Petsmart. 4
I really relied heavily on reviews on this one.  Unfortunately after receiving the bars I was sorely disappointed.  I like the RAWness of these bars but they don't taste like coconut, they don't taste like pecan pie.  They taste like a slightly tart pecan date nut log.  I LOVE pecans and dates but I like my dates sweet.  These aren't.  Too bad for me but hopefully I can help the next guy out. Great deal though for those of you that like these bars. 1
We use gluten free bisquick for many different things - biscuits, pancakes, etc.  Tastes good & lets us serve our kids that are gluten free the same thing as the whole family. 5
I love pav bhaji and regard ITC products with high regard. I got a whole box of these and not feel like i'm stuck with them. The curry has a weird not-fresh taste. I had to get really inventive and add extra spices and lemon to mask the taste. Not a fan... 2
These bars are huge! The price is phenomenal for the amount and quality of chocolate and nuts.<br />I'm glad that I went for the quantity to get the best deal. I can always put a couple bars in the freezer. 5
tried wellness webb bars, whitefish and sweetpotatoes and with crunchy peanuts and honey.  have three dogs two just push them away, the third who will eat dirt inhaled them.  Rate this products as a 0. 1
This was a good sample of different types of pods, although I am not sure I can tell them apart in a blind tasting.  There are definitely differences in the brands - I do like some better than others, but overall are all pretty good. 4
These were nasty, they were so greasy and too rich for my blood, plus they lacked major flavor, no spicy jalapeno flavor at all.  I was so dissapointed in these chips, I am always hearing great things about these chips but I am telling you, yuck yuck yuck.  Give me pain chips any day.  Maybe there is a better kettle chip brand out there but I am staying clear from these chips. I wish I could give these zero stars if I could. 1
I love lemons and hot drinks like tea and cocoa, so Gold Kili's Ginger & Lemon Beverage Mix seemed like something I'd really enjoy.  Instead it had a terrible medicinal taste with a bit of a burn going down, then there was an aftertaste.  I couldn't even make it through an entire cup of this beverage mix. 1
Thankfully this wasn't too sweet. I was afraid that it might be, but found it to have an ok cherry flavor. Not sure if it's something I would drink on a regular basis since I'm not a fan of fruit flavored sodas. 3
I was excited when I saw the picture of this plant and the price.  Even with shipping being a lot more than the cost of the plant itself, the overall price I thought was still a steal.  Then the plant showed up today.  Yes, it's the same kind of plant but it looks like a little baby version.  Nowhere near as big and full as the picture.  It's EXTREMELY misleading.  I would have given this one star for being so misleading instead of two, but if I hold onto the plant long enough and take care of it, someday it may look o.k.  It's a nice plant for $4.95, but I would not have paid this plus shipping to get a plant this small if I had known.<br /><br />Update - I reread the information in the plant description, and it does say the plant delivered is not pictured, so I apparantly missed that.  However, it is kind of buried and still slightly deceiving.  Very nice plant though and I found a great pot for it - just don't expect anything huge to start with. 2
Just did not like Pamela's Oat Blueberry Lemon bars that much.  They did not have much taste.  I think<br />they could have had more nuts.  Another reason was I do not care for blueberries that much. 1
Love the product.  Bought about 2 weeks ago, but the cost has gone up $12.00 very quickly.  Am buying from another source. 4
I absolutely love my Senseo, but the thing I had always been waiting for was options beyond Mild, Medium and Dark Roast coffee. Every now and then I need a different kick from my coffee and until now it wasn't a possibility.<br /><br />The Vanilla Bistro variety doesn't necessarily provide a kick, but its vanilla flavor does provide an occasional welcome switch from the monotony of black coffee. Of the three new varieties of flavored coffee for the Senseo this is my second favorite behind the Irish Cream. 4
Although this is a wonderful tasting tea, Bigelow confirmed via email today that this product is grown in China.  I think it is then packaged in the U.S. 2
I like the idea of the pouch baby food, but I was hoping that with a baby on the cover and a Stage 2 written on it, that it would be thicker. It was almost like water. It was a disaster. Maybe these are meant for older kids that get the concept of sucking them out of the pouch instead of being spoon fed to infants. 2
This is a very refreshing carbonated juice drink with no aftertaste.  I love the flavor and the fact that there is no added sugar.  It's more subtle than orange so really kills a thirst.  The size is perfect for times when you don't really want a 12 ounce drink. 5
The tree in the picture is full, colorful, and well healthy.  The tree you receive will likely be none of these things.  It will be alive, and may someday be like the one in your picture.  However, the one in the picture is a $40 dollar tree, the one you receive is a $15 garage sale tree. 2
My first package came damaged but the first rate customer service department replaced it quickly. The orzo are delicious and easy to cook. 5
I like some of the Snickers Marathon bar flavors, but not this one.  It doesn't taste bad, but it doesn't come close to tasting like the dark chocolate its name denotes.  Mostly this just tastes sweet.<br /><br />For many people, this might be a healthy snack substitution.  Each bar has only 150 calories yet has 11 grams of protein and 22 grams of carbs (9 grams of sugar).  It's also fortified with many vitamins (100% USRDA of many of them), but I take a multivitamin daily already so this doesn't mean much to me.  My main complaint about the nutritional profile of this bar is that it just has too much fiber for such a small amount of food.  If you're someone who doesn't eat fresh fruits and vegetables and prefers refined foods (white flour, white rice, white bread, etc) rather than whole grain foods, then the fiber in this bar would do you good.  For me, however, the 7 grams of fiber per bar (28% of the USRDA) causes me intestinal discomfort as it adds to an already high daily consumption of fiber from fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.  I assume that some of the fiber in this bar comes from its principal ingredient (soy), but I also see that chicory fiber is listed as an ingredient and chicory root has a high concentration of fiber.  If I were to reformulate this product, I'd remove the chicory fiber and do something to attempt to give it a bit more authentic of a chocolate flavor. 3
ive heard mixed reviews of this.. yeah it feels cheap... but so what?! just take care of it like you would anything like that! and it sounds perfect! i use it to record vocals on logic studio (i get others to sing, i cannot; but they sound amazing) ive had no problems with it and im super happy with the purchase. well worth the money! 5
I like berry flavors but this is just OK, not my fav. I will let friends and relatives try it; they may like it better. Guess green tea suits me more. Not a fan of the pyramid bag either but my first try at this kind. Smells good but just OK taste for me. 3
These seemed like a great idea. I would be able to load up 50 k-cups with any type of coffee I chose, and still maintain the speed of using the store bought cups in my rush to get ready every morning. After waiting a month for this product to reach me (20 days before they even shipped it!) I finally found it on my doorstep.<br /><br />Upon opening the box my hopes lifted even higher; these are solid little cups of a much higher quality than I expected. I filled one and snapped the lid down. I ensured it was sealed all the way around, placed it in my Kuerig, and hit the brew button. At first it seemed to be working splendidly then coffee began pouring out of places it isn't supposed to. By the time it was over I had quite a mess to clean up. Upon opening the Kuerig I found the DisposaKup completely in tact and the lid still secured properly. However the bit of overhanging filter was soaked, dripping, and HOT! I had discovered the source of the leak. I have tried again several times with the same reoccurring problem. I guess I should have bought the EcoBrew cup after all.<br /><br />If you like the appearance of convenience, and the reality of spending more time cleaning up a mess this is the product for you.<br /><br />(I went ahead and gave it two stars because I like the idea of the product so much.) 2
If you are looking for a cup of tea with no real flavor, please buy this. I am an avid tea drinker; Oolong tea has a pleasant aroma of oriental spices and good flavor that dosent require added sweeteners. If you enjoy a good cup of tea, this is not the product. This tea seems like a combination of cheap teas, none with a hint of oolong. The tea even gave me a headache! The price of Oolong tea usually ranges between $5.00 to $7.00 for 20 tea bags depending on geographical area of the country. I should have known that $4.95 was too good to be true. They wont go to waste; tea bags are great for soaking tired aching feet after a run or treating foot fungus.  Certainly not organic! 1
My husband said this wasn't bad, but I found it so acidic and unpleasant that I couldn't even finish my first cup. It brewed up nice and dark, and I could smell the florals and berries in the aroma as advertised on the packaging. Unfortunately, it tasted like a combination of Lipton tea and Folgers. I had been expecting good things from Fair Trade Organic coffee, but this didn't deliver. 2
We installed our pet door about 2 weeks ago and so far it works great! Our two dogs are taking awhile to get used to it. At first they were scared of it, now they both use it but one of the dogs doesn't realize yet that I don't have to be right there for him to go out. I'm sure he will figure it out as time goes on.<br /><br />My only advice would be to not necessarily follow the instructions on what height to put the door at (it says to put the bottom of the door an inch lower than your dog's chest height). We followed the directions on the height to install it at, and our 40 and 50 lb dogs practically have to leap out the door rather than calmly walking out. Other than that, I love it!<br /><br />We did go on the High Tech website and ask a question before we bought it and never got a response, so it seems like most people's reviews about bad customer service are true... 4
I don't know that much about lentils, but these do not taste like the ones I used to buy in India and Mauritius, so I'm disappointed. 2
I ordered what I thought was five "4" packs of Smartbones medium size. What arrived was five "single" packs of the Smartbones medium size. The price for a four pack was a little more than half the local store price for the same items.... But for a single bone it works out to more than double the cost. I don't know if the problem is with the web/computer system or if the packer simply grabbed the wrong items. As I couldn't find a way to contact Amazon my only choice was to return the items. I'm afraid to reorder as I can't be certain the same mistake will not reoccur. Too bad as the price would be good and my dog loves the product. 1
Looks like black tea is mixed in with this green tea.  Smells like Cherry Rose Green Tea but doesn't taste like it.  Looks and tastes more like black tea.  I will not buy again. 2
I paid twice as much for shipping as the cost of the product.  The product had too much gooey filler and only a slight amount of orange peel.  It wasn't all that bitter either. I won't do that again! 1
They inadvertently slit open packages opening boxes with a box cutter - this happens way too much (you get a box from amazon, and a package of granola has already been slit open). 3
The add on program makes this a great deal for a natural, very tasty sugar.<br /><br />You can add to any order over $25 or buy 8 (like I did) and have all 16# delivered free. Either way an outstanding value!<br /><br />There are lots of good reasons to eat natural sugar. I use in my coffee and making bread. Use 1 to 1 instead of "white" sugar for your needs. You may find that yeasts will proof faster and more bubbly with this type of organic sugar.<br /><br />The zip-loc bag does not seal all that well. So I store in a quart mason jar in the dark cupboard. Each bag is sightly more than one quart. The balance is added to the sugar bowl.<br /><br />Give this sugar a try. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do! 5
I once loved these chips and they were the only chips i would buy.  I discovered them when I was in England back in 2000 and quickly became a fan.  About a year ago I picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket.  I was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it.  After opening the bag I found the chips were not even close to the Kettle chips I was used to.  They were all uniform whitish yellow in color, flavor was way off, the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and I was very disappointed.  So I e-mailed Kettle with the following:  "What Happened? I bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste; It tastes "cheaper". I don't know how else to put it... I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor. I am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product. Did I just get a weird batch? I have been buying only Kettle Chips for about 10 years now so I am wondering."  I did receive a reply: "Thanks for letting us know about your experience with your Kettle Brand? Chips. It sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections, and we apologize.Our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color-but our chips should still taste great!Thanks for providing us with the "best before" code from the bag.  This really helps when passing on your comments to our staff.<br />We are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our Kettle Brand? flavors or nut butters, believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase! In case you buy this product again, we suggest avoiding the same best before date (if you still have it) in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same time.<br />Thanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within 3 weeks.  Please let me know if I can be of any more help."  Well the next bag was good.  Since that time I have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the "bad" bag so I am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost.  I did some research and found out that Kettle was bought out by a private equity company.  So the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at Kettle.  Acquire company with high quality brand recognition, sell product to mass merchants, lower quality/cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand.  increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors. Customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand.  Stay away from Kettle chips they are no longer the same... 1
I personally did not care for the coffee, too mild for me and a little "nutty" flavor in it.  I will stick with Tully's Kona and House blends, also Emeril's Big Easy bold. 2
These are nothing to write home about. There is not much peanut butter flavor and the chocolate is so-so. These are very chewy compared to most granola bars, so you won't get much crunch in your bite. The bars are small and do not compare with other granola bars in terms of consistency and flavor. If you like peanut butter and chocolate, I recommend the Oh Yeah! Good Grab bars instead. They have much more flavor and more protein. 2
I have a 45lb lab mix that loves his busy buddy, but that cheap rubber rope lasted all of 20 min with him. He chewed it down to a nub. A thicker rope or actual rope might be a better choice. Or maybe Kong like rubber!<br /><br />That said, he goes bonkers for this and clangs it noisily all around on the hardwood floors. It gets to be a bit much. But he sure has fun! 3
This 8.3 ounce can of carbonated beverage is tangy and tasty. And the slimmer size can means that you are drinking a smaller serving than an ordinary can of soda. But although it's 100% juice, it still packs quite the calorie punch. One can is 140 calories, which is almost exactly the same as in a 12 oz. can of regular Coca-Cola! So it may be slightly healthier than drinking Coke since it has no caffeine or high-fructose corn syrup and it has 100% of your requirement of Vitamin C. But it's not going to make you as slim and attractive as the packaging! 3
I have been a big fan of Amazon for a long time now, and I buy A LOT of stuff from them. One item I have purchased almost monthly over the past year is the "think Thin" Brownie Crunch protein bar. That all ended this month. When I attempted to place my order, I was not allowed to complete my purchase. The message I received read: " We are sorry. This item has limited purchase quantity. Because you have purchased the maximum allowable quantity in the past you cannot buy any more units of this item." Wow! It is hard to imagine a purchase limit on protein bars, but apparently there is one, although I have yet to find that information on the site. What makes this an even more ridiculous proposition is the fact that there is a subscription option that allows one to receive "think Thin" bars monthly on an auto-ship program for, I presume, perpetuity if one so chooses. I would be fine with signing up for a subscription, but Amazon won't let me do that either for the same reason. Apparently Amazon customer service does not share my sense of irony when I pointed out the subscription option, and they simply repeated: "It is a limited item. Sorry for the inconvenience."<br /><br />I have been very happy with Amazon's service up until today. Maybe it is because I have high expectations based on my many, many previous transactions, or maybe it is because my wholly unsatisfying interaction with Amazon customer service, but this episode leaves a very bitter taste in my mouth. Although I will likely continue to purchase from Amazon, I believe I will make it a point to patronize my local merchants whenever possible before I consider another Amazon purchase.<br /><br />I love this "think Thin" product, but buyers beware of Amazon's policy. 1
we love this pancake / waffle mix.  It's hard to please everyone but this item does the trick.  Crispy, light, tender, yummy! 5
This has a much saltier taste than table salt or even sea salt. I think I like sea salt better than this stuff, but that is quite probably just personal preference. I find that sea salt has more of a mouth watering quality, whereas this salt is more of a sharp saltiness.<br /><br />It would be excellent for desserts - like salt water taffy or a salty caramel. 4
In my area one cannot find Cinnamon Mentos.  I am so happy I was able to find this flavor.  I just love this product. 5
Could the sauce use a little help? Sure.  I added roasted onions.<br /><br />I roasted some chicken tenders on the George Foreman Grill , added some onion and grilled then...then served with a little of the Walden Farms Calorie free Thick N Spicy BBQ. tasty...and I licked the sauce with my fingers...(he he).<br /><br />This is not "thick". If you want THICK./..roast & then puree some onions, green pepper, garlic, and even lettuce in the blender...VOILA. That thickens "spagetti" sauce or whatever (if you are on the HCG diet).<br /><br />I bet a little of the sauce would make a nice marinade.<br /><br />IF you are NOT on the HCG diet..then try something with more calories.<br /><br />But if you want zero calories and like HOT Tangy & sweet..this Walden farms can't be beat.<br /><br />IT is fantastic for what it is...<br /><br />I downgraded to three stars due to their refund policy... and it is  just OK.<br /><br />UPDATE: KEEP YOUR RECEIPT.<br />The product is guaranteed...but the process to get a refund is onerous (in my opinion).<br /><br />"I am sorry that you were not satisfied with our Mayo.  Please send a proof of purchase, a note with the expiration date of the product and an explanation as to why you were not satisfied to the address below and we will gladly refund your money.  Thank you and again, my apologies.<br /><br />Walden Farms<br />1209 W St Georges Ave<br />Linden, NJ 07036" 3
I ordered this 3 pack - listed as 12-ounce jars.  Be warned, these are 8-ounce jars.  I have not tried them yet. 1
I love this seasoning for my chicken. So easy to make too! Great stuff!!! 5
I have placed two orders for the weber grill grinder roasted garlic herb in the past.  I was so disappointing the last time I picked up my order as it was not what I had ordered.  It was citrus twist with garlic.  I just love the garlic and herb grinder and have given my first order away to my family as Christmas gifts.  I now don't even have one bottle for myself.  You can see I have reordered the garlic herb and hope I will receive what I have ordered.  It would be so inconvenient to repackage and return.  If it was possible to buy it in my location I would but it's not available.<br /><br />Very Disappointed<br /><br />Leona<br /><br />The order that I received with the citus garlic was as follows.<br /><br />Transaction Date  11/03/2011<br />Location<br />Amount  $20.94<br />Reference Number  [...]<br />Description  Amazon.com AMZN.COM/BILLWA 1
Have been ordering this item for years and my dog loves. This order was different. It does not have the strong smell it usually does and my dog doesn't like them. 2
So okay, I don't do hot tea; BUT this is a perfect loose leaf tea for iced tea.  Am I an expert at Ice Tea?  No, but after moving to the South some 25 years ago, I have tasted lots of iced tea and this one makes as good as you can find anywhere.  I will say that most recipes I could find must have been for some cheap tea bags (weak, somewhat tasteless and bitter), so I experimented a little and found a great recipe for this loose leaf tea.  The recipe is 1/4 cup tea to 8 cups water.  Bring the water to a boil take it off the heat, put the tea in, let it steep for NO MORE THAN 5 minutes and strain into a container, let cool to room temperature and refrigerate.  If you are in a hurry, fill a glass with ice and pour the tea over the ice.  This works great for this particular loose leaf tea - not strong, not weak.  Oh yes, if you like sweet tea, add the sugar to the container while the tea is hot. 5
This storage drawer fits in perfectly on our countertop. We can either set the Keurig on top of it or beside it and still store a large amount of k-cups where people can get at them easily. Totally satisfied! 5
These are NOT true Cross-Pack sardines, and they are Scottish, not Norwegian.<br />These are very large sardines with the front 1/3 cut-off, so they'd fit in the tin cross-wise.<br />I have eaten hundreds of 2-layer tins from Season and King Oscar, and these are clearly inferior.<br />Cross-Pack is supposed to be the finest, rarest grade - these aren't that.<br />If you see these in a store, read the back label carefully!<br />Season used to be a good brand - what a shame. 1
as a tea, this stuff is terrible!<br /><br />However, you can use it to sweeten tea made from a tea bag & it is useful.<br />I wish I had not bought so much.  The Sucralose level is so high, that the artificial sweetning level is off the charts - in a bad way.  The tea flavor is not very good, but OK.  I tried diluting it more, but the tea becomes diluted & it just tast like weaker YUCK.  The lemon flavor is not mild either.  Needless to say, I'm not a fan of this product at all. 1
I rated this product 3 stars because the color was yellow.  That let me know it had been on the shelf for a while.  Even with the yellow color the favor was good but not as strong as I would have liked it to be.  I have order directly from Watkins aand the color was clear and the favor stronger.  Might order from Watkins the next time. 3
For Ramen noodles, this product was middle quality. The price was good, on the first shipment. There are minor QC issues with the packaging, soup base envelope, and other minor quibbles, but, once I was on the 'monthly' delivery, the price was jacked up $9 and then $14 or $16 depending on who did the subtraction...<br /><br />They called the money out of my account well before requested delivery date (and they say that they only 'hold' it, pending shipment... Had they waited 6 hours, it would still have been too damned early, But, I would not have known about it, Until I checked the bank...<br /><br />Well, that process could have caused checks to bounce, and my feeling is, if I say ship no sooner than one date, keep your hands off my account until that date... (You should have heard the stories and excuses for that one.)<br /><br />I have dealt with Amazon Customer Service before... The people in those instances were great!! And I praised them for their service and care...<br /><br />I hate besmirching them with this go round. In the many calls It took to resolve the issue, the group of 'reps' had a problem with the difference between day of week and date of month, did their best to keep me from talking to a supervisor, a supervisor started talking to someone in their room, one second after the 'hold' music stopped, with the sentence 'he hung up, huh?'...(ooops, forgot the 'click))...<br /><br />I have canceled delivery because a $16 price jump in 28 days, and the service trying to resolve the issue... sounded like the lies the media spreads about many other subjects. Actually, a supervisor canceled it, then a few minutes later I canceled it (twice); and I was asked to call them back... and the chap on the line that time queried me about if I wanted the order canceled... sigh....<br /><br />I was extremely disappointed...<br /><br />(watch this one get pulled)<br /><br />If you can get the product, at the original price I was quoted on February 3, 2011... It is an ok deal...<br /><br />The price they had it raised to by Feb 24, was borderline ok...<br /><br />The price on February 28th was past reasonable...<br /><br />The price for the next shipment (which I saw March 3rd) was crazy...<br /><br />Noodles have not gone up that much over the last 20 years...<br /><br />They did it in 28 days?? 3
This practically falls under the category of healthy snack - well, almost.  Single serving bags mean you won't be overeating and the fact that these aren't in anyway greasy because of the way they are made is a huge plus.  Nice crisp crunch.  The bags are filled with air, which for the most part do a good job of keeping the chips whole.  On the case that I got, though, two bags containted nothing but broken bits.  Of the rest most only had a couple of broken chips - some no broken ones at all.  I also noticed that you don't find nearly as much coating from flavoring on your fingers as I've experienced when eating other chips.<br /><br />Purchasing it by the case to try out all of the flavors is a good idea and a decent value.  Some of the flavors are incredibly strong, to the point that I don't like them, so I won't be ordering this mixed case again.  Salt and Pepper just tasted like pepper, making this a very hot tasting chip.  The Seasalt and Vinegar is really strong on the Vinegar, which is a taste I don't enjoy.  I love BBQ flavored chips, but again, this was kind of strong.  I probably wouldn't purchase the BBQ ones in the future, but wouldn't say no if someone offered them to me.  The Original is really bland compared to these others, but not bad.<br /><br />The ones I liked the most were the Sour Cream & Onion and the Cheddar, both with milder flavors.<br /><br />I'd give this 5 stars if I liked all of the flavors.  Definitely high marks for the type of chip and the size of the serving and the fact that you can try all of the flavors in one order. 4
My westie and yorkie eat this canned food and I thought I might find it slightly less expensive on Amazon.<br />I found this one and saw the picture of the large dog food which is normally what I buy at the pet store.  It appeared cheaper by a little after considering the shipping cost.<br />I was very disappointed in finding out after shipping cost I actually paid .54 cents more than my pet store!  But then it was worse!!! The cans were more than half the size of the picture!  I contacted customer service and told them I should have read the description, however, the picture was of the larger can.  They offered a return, I would have been stupid again to pay $16+ total in shipping to and from to get a $14 credit.<br />I told customer service the picture was misleading and she said she wasn't sure on this product, but in the past they've told Amazon they have wrong pictures on certain items and Amazon does nothing about it! I don't know if it was their fault or Amazon's fault, but I do know I paid DOUBLE!  I have purchased a lot of items on Amazonb and this is the first time I've felt CHEATED. 1
Our husky began teething, and we decided we needed to get her something to chew on apart from socks, underwear, and furniture as all of these were apparently more interesting than her toys. Embedded flavor seemed like it would be great to keep her interest, and it did. We supervised her carefully and she never broke off pieces larger than a grain of rice. Diarrhea was an almost immediate result and took her 3 days to recover. While the product itself seems great (she loved it, it kept her busy, and was fairly durable), it's definitely not something to give to a dog with a sensitive tummy. 3
The photo shows potato and carrot pieces in the butternut squash base but upon opening a can, there are no potato or carrot pieces to be found, unlike the cans I've bought from a local grocery store.  I guess this must be a change in Wolfgang Puck's recipe but the photo on the can does not represent the contents anymore.  Several cans out of the twelve pack were delivered dented, although none seriously.  Packing with better filling could have prevented dents in transit. 3
When I first got them he gulped them down, but the ziplock on them doesn't work that well and at a dosage of only one or two treats a day like the bag says they have gotten kind of dried out and he doesn't like them as much anymore.  I also have not noticed any real improvement in the stiffness of his gait. 3
These have a stronger caramel flavor although still a medium strength coffee.  The best caramel flavored K-cup I've tried!  I will reorder them. 4
This was my last attempt to try and increase my milk supply.It didn't work for me after using for 3 weeks. It also made my little one gassy- so it was not worth it to try it longer given the gas issues. 2
These little goodies are so full of flavor and so good.  I bought these for my granddaughter in Minnesota and sent them to her.  She was thrilled, shared them with her sisters and now they are wanting to get some.<br />Great gift idea!! 4
Cheerios are cheerios, so no review necessary there.  What I am reviewing is buying this item from Amazon.  I am a very loyal Amazon customer, with 165 orders last year.  I am very dissatisfied with Amazon on this one though.  The product they sent is only 2 months from expiring and it's a 96 pack.  If you go to the grocery store you'll see that the Cheerios there have about a year left on the shelf life so these have clearly been sitting around the warehouse for a while.  Food items are non returnable so if you're not happy with the old stuff that Amazon sends you then you are out of luck. 1
I swear, my dogs eat better than I do. And while my dogs are hardly picky, they definitely love these treats. I am a little curious about how there is stamp on the side of the bag that says it's not for human consumption. If it's all organic meat with no wheat or additives, why can only dogs eat them? More of joke than anything, just amused me. But there aren't a whole lot of treats in the bag and they're not cheap, so I guess it just boils down to the question of how healthy should a dog treat be, and honestly, how healthy are they anyway over the next brand? I don't know, but my dogs like them and that's a success for me. 4
The Brooklyn Bean Decaf Breakfast Blend is a fine-tasting, mellow cup of coffee.  My personal favorite decaf has always been Timothy's Colombian, but this is a nice, slightly milder alternative.  In fact, I couldn't tell you which of the two I like more.<br /><br />One strange issue - all the cups I've brewed up so far (we have a Keurig B70 Platinum) have brewed very slowly.  There might be an issue with the internal filter not allowing the water to move through quick enough.  No explosions or overflows, but not that great if you're in a hurry.<br /><br />UPDATE: Explosion time!  Don't you hate it when you get a cupful of grounds?  Don't think I'll be buying these again.  Oh well. 2
Undoubtedly this will be compared to Hamburger Helper right off the bat and I suppose it's fair because they both try to do the same thing. Create an easy to prepare meal with nothing but ingredients in the box and some hamburger.<br /><br />Does this taste like a Cheeseburger? Not to me. The cheese is almost overpowering and once you get paste the cheese there isn't to much flavor there.<br /><br />It's easy to prepare and it's quick. But if you are looking for a culinary experience that will rock your taste buds... well this isn't the way to go.<br /><br />On a side note - if you or anyone you know is on a low sodium diet, or are keeping track of your sodium intake read this label. The sodium content for one serving is off the charts. I was legitimately shocked at how high it was.<br /><br />While I may eat it again down the line it's not something I am going to run to the store to specifically get and bring back to share. 3
From the product description: "A brand new taste"- relative to an earlier version? To me it tasted an awful lot like sugar-free grapefruit juice. "Toughest can on the shelf"? I disproved that immediately, while trying to remove the bubble wrap form the single can Vine offered, the knife went a millimeter too deep and made a nice scratch in the can, which immediately burst. I slapped into a containment glass, but it is the Vine's way of rarely offering enough of a food or beverage for the reviewer to form an honest and well considered opinion.<br /><br />OK, ok, I know that's not what they meant by "toughest drink", but I was unaware that was a quality anyone would ever seek in an energy drink.<br /><br />As it stands, I am not very well acquainted with this style of beverage anyway, while I saw them mainly as hangover cures, I guess many regular users see them as an important part of their intake of vitamins and minerals. And Taurine and the other raft of fairly obscure supplements. And often caffeine, although my label was somewhat damaged and I couldn't quite make out the rather extensive list of ingredients. I suspect this is of little interest to the average user in any case.<br /><br />I happened to be pretty beat the day it arrived, and didn't even want to stop for a Five Hour Energy- my usually dependable source of a brief respite from fatigue- so it was a perfect time to try it out. Any "lift" or burst of energy was not readily apparent, although it did help chase away the blahs for a little while. I still went to bed early. 3
I've been buying this popcorn on the subscription program for the last 1.5 years. Overall, the kids absolutely love the popcorn - it tastes even better than the movies and for under $1.00 per bag, I figure I'm getting a good deal. However, one issue I have is the large number of "Old Maid" unpopped kernels. I haven't used other brands, so I'm not sure what is normal, but it seems that about 20% of the kernels do not pop. This is an average over 1.5 years of using the Great Northern brand in a Great Northern popcorn machine.<br /><br />If you have found a popcorn that makes a higher % of the kernels, you may want to avoid this brand, unless of course, it costs 25% more $. 3
I planted this grass and in 8 days I had 3-4 inches of grass!<br /><br />The price hurts since you're basically paying for shipping. The cost of the seeds themselves are $1.59 as shown on the package. I couldn't find oat grass seeds at Lowes or my local independent garden center. I'm hoping to find somewhere local to buy them so I can buy more seeds in the future without having to pay a premium and wait for them to ship. 4
This stuff tastes like cold medicine. I can't imagine how anyone can enjoy this as a beverage. It's probably really healthy for you, but I just can't stomach it. I guess living in the United States gets you used to drinking unhealthy drinks lol. I'm not much for lemon or hot drinks like tea anyway. I even prefer cold coffee to hot coffee so I should have know I wouldn't have liked this, but hey what the heck! 2
I was disappointed in this product. I had enjoyed truffle salt from another manufacturer, which had so much truffle that whenever I opened the lid, the delightful aroma filled the room. But it is no longer available, so I was hoping to find a similar product on Amazon. This ain't it; the truffle is barely detectible when sniffing the open bottle and not detectible on food at all. I'm debating whether to just throw it out so I can re-use the bottle to try a different brand. (The bottle is reusable, which is why I rated it more than one star.) 2
These peace signs looked great on my daughters birthday cupcakes.  My order arrived in broken pieces and the company promptly sent another order. It also had breakage but between the two shipments we had enough to cover all of our treats.  Order earlier then you need them. 3
This was horrible coffee! It tasted worse than instant coffee! I couldn't even get through one cup!<br />Worse coffee ever!! If I could rate this item a zero I would! 1
This is the biggest waste of money and scam I have seen in a long time. Raw, organic coconut oil is definitely one of the healthiest additions you can make to your diet. (Ignore the claims that because it has saturated fat it must be bad for your heart - WRONG! Not all saturated fats are bad and coconut oil has medium chain fatty acids which means the fat gets converted in your liver into energy and is not stored by the body nor will it clog your arteries.) Anyway, in order to reap the benefits of this wonderful oil you need to eat about 2 -3 tablespoons a day, starting with 1 and working your way up.  Guess how many of these pill you need to take in order to accomplish that feat? Something like 40!!  Have fun swallowing that many pills and just think about all the yucky gelatin you will be consuming that comprises the coating of these things!  You are much better off purchasing raw, organic coconut oil and mixing it your oatmeal or drinks.  Use it for cooking and throw away every other oil you have in your kitchen, except olive oil, and you will be on your way to better health.  Research the benefits of raw organic coconut oil online and you will see that I am right about this. 1
I thought these were going to be dried fruit. Turns out it is dried but full of sugar. Not what I needed. Taste is ok though. 2
It is a shame WHEN YOU ADD SUGAR AS A PRIMARY INGREDIENT IN THE FIRST 5 ITEMS! Being allergic to gluten, doesn't mean a person is NOT ADDICTED TO SUGAR! Sugar is the number one substance that manufacturers LOAD UP ON and place in the top ingredients when they omit so-called allergies, like gluten. I AM SICK AND TIRED OF NOT BEING ABLE TO HAVE WHEAT FREE GOODS and being forced to take in sugar. I AM ADDICTED TO SUGAR, AS WELL ARE MILLIONS OF US! stop replacing what could be valuable gluten free foods with sugar------ AND SUGAR IS KNOWN BY OTHER NAMES and is the same:; maltodextrin, sucrose, sucralose, dextrose, dextrin, ORGANIC SUGAR (that's a joke, sugar is sugar!) 1
Honestly, I can't understand the complaints that people have about this product. Food pops out easily (I never have to run it under hot water) and it doesn't make your hands cold. I've never noticed a chemical smell either. I always freeze up portions of what we had for dinner then bag the portions in freezer bags, which leaves the Beaba container available for the next use. And it's always being used...I love it!!! 5
Okay, I personally loved how these chips taste. They are super crunchy and flavorful. I chose to take away one star because the Sea Salt & Vinegar flavor was way too salty. BBQ was my favorite. Next time I order, I am getting just the BBQ. They taste just like the greasy unhealthier versions made by other brands. The Cheddar was good but you can tell it was a healthy version of this flavor chips. The rest of the flavors I would say taste as they normally do, nothing special or out of the typical range of those flavors. 4
I have only recently discovered a love for Chai Tea but it could be only a certain brand. I really enjoy the Celestial Seasonings brand Chai which has more body and well-blended flavor. This had such a strong cinnamon flavor and it was more the oil-type not the cinnamon stick type. None of the other flavors stood out at all to me. I really like cinnamon but it reminded me of the cinnamon toothpicks we made when I was a kid. I haven't had much experience with other types of Chai so I can't much of a comparison. 2
This is a pretty good product.  The brownies came out a little more crumbly than I am used to.  Flavor wise, I thought it was good, especially when paired with ice cream (I used chocolate cinnamon). I loved the bits of chocolate chips throughout, but, it never hurts to add more.  I think I will substitute the oil for something else - maybe yogurt or black beans to reduce overall calories.  The cooking time was spot on.  At the end of the day, I think Betty Crocker Fudge brownies are a bit better than these, but I would still make the Ghiradelli Dark Chocolate brownies if I were in a dark chocolate mood.  I purchased my box at Big Lots for two dollars.  I've seen the product in grocery stores as well for about the same price.<br /><br />Nutrition Facts<br />Serving Size 2" brownie<br />Servings per container: 16<br /><br />Amount Per Serving<br />Calories 210<br /><br />Total Fat 3.5g<br />Saturated Fat 1.5g<br />Trans Fat 0 mg<br />Cholesterol 0mg<br />Sodium 130mg<br />Total Carbohydrate 27g<br />Dietary Fiber 1g<br />Sugars 18g<br />Protein 1g<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Sugar, enriched bleached flour (wheat flour, niacin, reduced iron, thiamin mononitrate, riboflavin, folic acid), bittersweet chocolate chips (chocolate liquor, sugar, cocoa butter, milk fat, soy lecithin [emulsifier], vanilla), cocoa (processed with alkali), canola or soybean oil, salt, artificial flavor, sodium bicarbonate.<br /><br />Contains:<br />Wheat, milk and soy. 4
As product lines go, Newman's is tough to beat. Organic, all natural, and money goes to charity. What's not to like?<br /><br />For this product, however, it's a swing and a foul ball. It's not a miss. The 50+% cacao stands out, with rich dark chocolate flavor similar to other bars. However, the mouthfeel and texture of this bar is all wrong. It's not creamy in the way chocolate should be, instead it leaves a thick coating on the inside of the mouth that is both unpleasant and ruins the flavor. I'm not certain what it is, but perhaps the type of fat or the fat content they used doesn't mesh with the chocolate bar. I found it rather unenjoyable to eat the entire thing. 3
I keep buying these grape laces even though they are a little hard to chew.  They have a good grape flavor.  I just wish they were softer to chew. 4
Ok so I don't really like this product- which may be a me problem, and not a problem of the product itself.<br /><br />I love Metromint in Orange Mint, Spearment, Chocolatemint.  Peppermint isn't bad, but a little intense.  I do not like this flavor, it's too weird, minty with a slight cough syrup tang to it.  If you like cherry flavored cough syrups and mint, then maybe it works for you.<br /><br />If not, don't give up on Metromint, just go get one of the other ones.<br /><br />I wasn't a huge fan of the Lemon one either, and there is another berry one that others have reported tastes like minty fruit gum.  I'd skip those.<br /><br />This is a great product for diabetics.  My sister came down with gestational diabetes, and I bought her the chocolate mint.  She loved it, and it had no affect on blood sugar. 3
If you're going to get a sugar cereal it ought to at least taste great, so you're getting some pleasure in exchange for the unhealthiness. But this cereal doesn't taste very good. Can't see any reason to recommend it. 1
This stuff tastes great.  However, it is not really coffee.  It is a flavored drink on the order of hot cocoa.  It has a lot of calories (80 per cup) and sugar.  It also clogged up my Keurig big time. 2
I have never ordered sea salt before. i thought this was great. I was afraid it would have some additional flavor that I wouldnt like. Instead it was fresh tasting & natural. I like the pink color, but glad it doesnt come out pink. 5
I would try next time warming them up because it did not taste as good as i thought it would.  But it filled me up and i felt good eating it. 3
I prefer the taste of this over the alcohol-based vanilla extracts, particularly in uncooked items and beverages. It has a fairly thick/syrupy consistency. 5
I purchased one pound of Now brand stevia extract for $63.61. The overly large container is labeled "Better Stevia" "Certified Organic". Ingredient:Organic Stevia Extract Powder. I found I needed to use at least five times more stevia powder to get a similar sweetness as the Kal brand. I returned it for a refund.<br />Avoid this. Buy:[[ASIN:B000VRSR84 Pure Stevia Extract Powder - 3.5 oz - Powder] 1
I have the nespresso tassimo machine and I love it. I also love starbuck christmas blend and have missed it since I got my machine. I thought these little caps would do the trick. They kind of work. The resulting coffee is pretty watery- the capsule look like they are not sturdy enough to handle the pressure of the machine, they are shrunken after use- unlike the real nespresso capsules. The coffee that comes out (again I am talking starbuck christmas blend) tastes fine, but is weak in overall strength and looks really watery. PLUS after foaming up my milk and adding it to the coffee- the coffee instanly 'melts/pops' all of the foam. Nespresso must do something to their coffee to make it not do this. I find this a point none of the other reviews touch upon. 2
This kept my dog's attention for a couple minutes the first few times we used it, but now she has no interest.  I think my 2 year old enjoyed it more than my dog did.  It seems to slide around too easy and our dog has a tough time getting the yellow "cups" out.  She's not overly food driven, so that may be part of the problem.  Guess we'll try something else. 3
This juice bills itself as organic cranberry juice, but it is actually a cranberry - apple blend, and the bottles are labeled that they contain 95% juice.  If you know that is what you are getting, it is perfectly fine "cranapple" juice.  I used it in punches for a party, and it worked for what I needed.  I prefer my cranberry juices to be a little more tangy and vibrant; this is a little mild and bland for my taste. 2
can get this at the local liquor store for a quarter of the price. The ants are small and its kinda cool. tastes like a jolly rancher 2
The bag of dove chocolates that I order were left on my doorstep in the middle of the day.  Being summertime, it was quite hot outside and the chocolates melted partially. Unfortunate because they aren't edible. 1
I've tried a few different Hot Cocoa brands for my Keurig... And have been disappointed EVERY time, until now! Cocoa brews smooth and full flavored-on either the small cup size or the medium! I add a splash of almond milk and I'm ready to go :) Perfect! I'll definitely buy this again. 5
Fast and accurate delivery with a free sample as well.<br />The tea itself was terrific. 4
The thickness is just as described. They are not thin as straws like some other reviews had stated. My 2 pet chihuahuas love them very much. It usually takes them an hour or so to finish chewing so it's a great time passer for them. One negative thing I'd complain is the strong smell of the bag, though. I have to tuck it away in a corner in order not to smell it often when pass by. This might not apply to everyone, since my nose is a bit more sensitive than most normal people. Over all, I'd had given 5 star if it wasn't for the smell, I have to give 4 stars for now. 4
I have been purchasing this product for about 9 months.  The taste of the product is inconsistent from lot number to lot number. I have gotten 3 cases where the chips had no flavor at all.  Have contacted the manufacturer 2 times.  Have not received a response from my latest inquiry. I don't recommend purchasing. 1
Though I don't know if this particular one is recalled.<br />But I just thought I'd try to give a heads up.<br />So, this is not a true review about this products features per say.....but I feel that everyone needs to know that this company has recalled their products and it is going on right now.<br />To begin with, I want to say that I know that unfortunately there are plenty of human products that get recalled too and that is the most important thing. And yes, I know that every time we go eat out or buy any type of store bought food.... that it is a gamble too.<br />But, my family considers our dogs as part of the family and this is very important too.<br /><br />Many years ago I did research to find the best priced grain free. no dye or by product food.<br />I found that Diamond Pet Foods had the first ingredient as being the actual real meat.<br />Plus,the grain free food made my baby girl look so healthy and shiny.<br />Also,since it had no fillers and quality ingredients it actually made her stool smaller and less stinky.<br />She has less allergies and it stopped most of her constant itching/biting/licking at her paws and less tear stains.<br />She actually loved the product, by the same maker, named "Taste Of The Wild" in Bison the most.<br /><br />But,I am saddened now because Diamond Dog Food has now been RECALLED for "SALMONELLA CONTAMINATION"<br />This company makes various products that have been recalled.<br />Such as:<br />Diamond Naturals, Wellness, Natural Balance, Taste of The Wild, Apex, Chicken Soup Soul, Canidae, Country Value, 4Health, Natural Balance, Kirkland Signature, Natural Balance, Premium Edge, Professional and Solid Gold.<br /><br />I am saddened that we actually spend more money on these "better than store" dog food and they keep getting recalled!<br />So many families have unfortunately lost their fur babies babies and have spent thousands of dollars on Vet bills....when all we are trying to do is buying the "better" which are higher priced, dog food ingredients.<br />I am pretty thankful that I had signed up online,for emails about the latest dog food recalls last week.<br />My hubby and I was devastated to see that Diamond Dog Foods, Taste Of The Wild was on the list now.<br />I am sickened by these companies being so careless. When the reason we buy their higher priced food is cuz they are suppose to be healthier!<br />I just wanted to write this and try to stop another baby from getting sick or even worse dying 2
I am happy with my purchase. The mushrooms are mostly whole and have a quality shroomy smell to them (not old and dusty in other words). 5
I received the product overnight and it arrived completely defrosted and starting to rot, the smell was very bad. Unfortunately a waste of money. 2
Grew like a charm in the window; per reviews from others I only put about half the grass seed in there and it was still really thick / lush. Of the four cats, only one of them chowed down on it pretty regularly.<br /><br />While the packaging was pretty conveinent, the cats didn't like it very much: even cutting the edges back, the sharp edges of the package seemed to bother them.<br /><br />While this was a neat product and did everything it said it would, in the future I'm just going to get a pot and a package of grass seeds. 4
Buy it at your local grocery store, you will get it at least 10 days sooner, and with less stress. 1
This is one of four or five varieties of Wellness canned food my dog has tried.  At first she seemed to like it, and she ate it well.  After a couple of packs(12 cans) she refused to eat it at all.  This was not the only flavor she was given during this time, but she knew when it was part of her meal.  I don't know what happened, but it is not on our menu any longer. 3
My cat will eat it, and I'll use it in a pinch when I am out of Wellness canned cat food.  I wish it came in a fish only flavor.  Also I all the fruits and vegetables my cat gets when eating the Wellness brand. 3
our dog, biggie, loves these things.  and never seems to get tired of em.  these are the treats that make him do all his tricks with gusto cuz he wants them so bad!  i dunno if the glucosamine/chondroitin really helps their joints but we're hoping it does. 5
I've been buying this product for over 10 yrs.  It is a special<br />treat and reward for our dogs - I will continue buying this. 5
I am a total sucker for kitchen gadgets, but this just goes too far. The price is insane for what is essentially a glorified ice cube tray, which does not work as well as your basic ice cube tray. It's difficult to get the cubes out of this tray, it has an odd shape that wastes space in your freezer, and it makes 2 ounce servings, which are fine if you know you want 2 ounces, but I prefer to make 1 ounce sizes so that I can combine different flavors, or make just 1 (or 3) ounces if my baby is not as hungry and I don't want any waste. The only reason I gave it any stars at all is because of the lid - that IS handy, I must admit. But you can buy ice cube trays with lids too, that will actually fit in your freezer and stack well. TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY. Okay, it IS cute. I wish it wasn't so cute... 1
Let me start by saying that I love tea. I love Numi's teas the best as they are organic and also fair trade products. I have purchased many of Numi's other fine teas through both Amazon.Com & Numi in the past.<br /><br />However, the Dry Desert Lime tea is the first flavor of tea I couldn't stand the taste of at all! The Dry Desert Lime tea is tart, smells and tastes medicinal and looks like coffee when brewed. Let's just say the Dry Desert Lime flavor isn't my cup of tea! 1
The chips come in a large box with individually wrapped bags of chips. The bags are very strong - much thicker than, say, Lay's potato chip bags. Inside are very tasty kettle cooked chips, salted just right. Because these appear to be cooked in an actual kettle fashion, some are cooked more than others, which gives it a more authentic, non-manufactured feel. Some people may not like that.<br /><br />I reccomend them! 4
The product is YUMMY! and tasted even better since I got them from my local CVS store during Christmas time for $10 - so glad I bought more than one!  It seems to be strictly a seasonally stocked item, so normally I wouldn't mind paying a little more to be able to buy and enjoy them year round but a near 300% mark up...that's too big a bite even from a half pound reese's cup! 1
my papillon loves treats. I wanted to try something different than the usual mini bones I get him. I wasn't sure he'd be able to handle these because they looked kind of big, but he had no problem. He really loves the munchy stick center. 3
I was very excited about ordering these because I thought they'd be a healthy snack/dessert/breakfast alternative but unfortunately, they taste awful.  They taste like they're stale and they are very chewy (not in a good way).  My teeth feel sore from trying to bite pieces off and chew -- note, I am NOT an old person w/fake teeth or lots of teeth issues, just a normal person w/all my own teeth.<br />I don't recommend this product. 1
I was looking for a replacement for my Dunkin donuts Pumpkin Spice. This not only does the job but very well may replace it. Excellent coffee. It is also Organic & made in USA! 4
Good product for the price.  It could be a little smoother which is what Kona is noted for.  Would like to know just how much Kona is in the 'blend'.  I don't think it is as much as when you buy it on amazon in one pound packages. Overall I'm still happy to have 5 pounds on hand. 3
I purchased oil primarily for use in making popcorn. I was told that coconut oil was what the movie theaters used to make their popcorn so good. The oil is good, not movie theater great, but better that vegetable oil. My complaint and the reason I give it a three out of five is the packaging. It's cheap. Real cheap. The container was tipped over on the counter (did not fall, just tipped 90 degrees) and the plastic container popped the plastic top right off along with half the oil. A more sturdy container would have been make this a non-issue. Hope they make it stronger in the future. 3
My dogs liked these sticks but they were smaller in diameter than I am used to buying at target. I recommend them but do prefer the slightly larger ones. 4
This was a disappointment.  I use other products from this line/manufacturer on a regular basis.  I bought this item as a convenience to carry liquid Stevia in my purse.  The first time I went to use it, the liquid was a dark color...almost black..and I had to throw out the latte I was trying to sweeten.  All the manufacturer's other liquid products are clear, and, in fact, this is titled "clear liquid".  It must have been outdated/spoiled. I had already thrown the packing out, so don't know how it was dated.  I tried calling the Amazon supplier, but the call rolled into voice mail.  It's not enough money to spend time following-up, but it was disappointing. 1
The sugar content is more than I thought it would be, wow, are these sweet. I love sugar, but not that much, in my desserts. 3
Here's the straight talk from a foodie, not a Top Chef food critic, but a foodie:<br />-Name: Pop Chips. They are cooked in a kettle with pressure and heat. Fantastic. Not baked or fried. Made by the company POP CHIPS so it isn't frito lays or mars trying to forcefeed America in disguise.<br />-Packaging and Branding: Colorful and way too heavy-duty bags. This is why they are slightly expensive. Similar to kettle chips packaging. You will have fun opening the bags with a POP. Packaging was great. I've eaten about 6 of the small bags and not one was even slightly damaged.<br />-Taste and Texture: They are about the size of half-dollar coins, kind of puffy like a pork rind or rice cake, and they are not crunchy hard like potato chips but they do crunch. Definitely distinctive and they deserve a place on the market.<br />-Nutrition: 100 Calories! Unfortunately, you know what this means. It's not a big grab by any means. It's about 15-20 chips per .8 oz bag. Which, honestly, is great for portion control. It's probably all we need and popchips knows it. Definitely more filling than other 100 calorie snacks made by, say, SnackWell or the oreos/mini muffins type.<br />-Flavor: The 3 pack comes with Cheddar Potato, Sea Salt and Vinegar, and Barbecue Potato. As an English major I'm inclined to take the "potato" off the label. Just as salty and flavorful as normal chips, but not overpowering like some (cheap tortilla chips/some doritos). NATURAL taste.<br />I bought these on sale with a 15-20% discount I believe. I might purchase them again if I won a gift card or something, but I would rather look for these in a store or at a warehouse club and save some cash/trees on the gigantic box they come in. But if you are on the fence and worried about being disappointed, you won't be. This is definitely quality over quantity. 5
While the taste of this "carbonated juice", as the manufacturer puts it, is good, there isn't much else to say for this beverage.  One can has 8.3 ounces, which is a bit less than most Americans are used to for a canned drink, but would be a good serving size for kids.  It does have 135 calories, which is a lot, when I could just drink a diet cola for either no calories or one calorie.  Sure, there would be a lot more unnatural additives, but this drink isn't even organic, which many others on the market are.  If I were to spend more money on a healthy and tasty beverage, this would not be my choice. 2
My dog loves it and she doesn't scratch at her ears anymore (she used to scratch her ears all the time because she kept an ear infection!) 5
I was very let down with this product, I have purchased the Switch <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG945O">The Switch Sparkling Juice, Orange Tangerine, 8-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>brand soda and was very pleased with it's delicious flavor but this drink is totally different.<br /> First of all it is sweetened primarily with Erythritol which is an alcohol based sweetener and is bitter tasting like other diet sodas,<br />but that isn't all, it also causes stomach cramping (among other things) within 30 minutes of drinking it.<br />Needless to say I'll be cancelling my future orders and going back to the Switch brand. 1
I've had these before and loved them!  This time I only like them!  Don't know why this is - maybe manufacturer changed recipe.  If so I wish they would go back to the original recipe as I liked them a lot more! 4
I bought this one until I saw one exactly like it at a big box store (think red bullseye) for 24.99. This is going back! 5
I like sparkling water a lot.  Perrier is usually my first choice but sometimes I want something a little more then the fruit flavored seltzer water.  This drink fits the bill nicely.  It contains all natural fruit which is a big plus over the fruit flavored options.  It contains some calories but since it is from a natural source and not just plain sugar, I'm okay with it.  This beverage is in a slimmer can with only 8.3 oz versus the usual 12 ozs of say, a can of soda so you save a few calories but not much.  It hits the spot when I want something sweeter then plain mineral water and it's healthier then soda.<br /><br />I've tried other sparkling fruit drinks with lower satisfaction marks.  Most of them claim to be "all natural" but list funky ingredients such as "natural flavorings"  Huh?  This beverage lists ingredients that are easily defined.  Also, it avoids the overly sweet taste of other  similar produts.  This one stands out as a winner but less calories would make it perfect.  I guess you cannot have everything.... 4
I love hot chocolate and am always trying new ones, but this was the absolute worst cherry hot chocolate I have ever tasted!! I was hoping it would be good so I bought 2 cans. After 1 cup, I threw both cans away. If you want a really great cherry hot chocolate, add 3-4 teaspoons of the cherry juice from a jar of maraschino cherries to your favorite milk hot chocolate. YUM!!! Add more if you use dark hot chocolate. 1
Its a little bit darker than I had expected but the flavor is nice. Brews a perfectly flavored 12oz travel mug. I will be purchasing this one again. 4
Very dense formula - really have to break it up before feeding the dogs or they cough. Even subscribe and save prices are high compared to buying at local stores 3
These are very colorful but not the best tasting. I used them for my sons first bday as we were having a very large party and didn't want to buy 20 mini cans but taste wise the quality was not there....the look was great. I'm sure no one knew any better after all frosting fixes all. 2
I'm not sure if the four I purchased were from a bad batch or what, but the product had no effect on me whatsoever. I have tried the blue lotus 50:1 tablets and was very satisfied. I thought a liquid blue lotus would be absorbed better by the body, thus a better effect. It was quite the opposite. You live and you learn I guess, but I wouldnt try this product again unless it was free. 1
Bought this under the influence of many positive reviews.  I'm sorry to say that I found this produce upalatable, unacceptable.  It manages to be both insipid and bitter, leaves a nasty aftertaste, and has none of the mouthfeel of peanut butter. I'm returning it right away. 1
At first bite, these taste good, but the cloying smoke flavor lingers ... and lingers ... and lingers ... to the point that I felt sickened by it. I threw away the remainder of the one can I had opened, but since my disgust does not appear to be shared by other reviewers, I did not feel guilty about giving the rest of the cans to the local food bank. 2
I love snow balls and Hawaiian Shaved Ice sells good flavors...I've bought a few.  But the Pina Colada Snow Cone Syrup is a little too sweet.  Please understand that the taste is good but it needs to be watered down a bit.  So far, this is the only flavor that I found to be a bit too sweet.  I will definitely buy from this merchant again, however, I think I'll pass on the Pina Colada...for now. 3
The taste was great, but the berries had melted.  May order again in winter. If you order in cold weather you should enjoy flavor. 3
Perfect size can and a refreshing drink. I think it's proof that simple is best. This would be my first choice for a drink if I were out and about. 4
For a soft style cookie, these are a bit crumbly, or maybe they were that way being sent in the mail.  I enjoyed the taste of them.  I am used to oatmeal cookies though, my boyfriend loves them and took off with half the box.  I do feel slightly bad all the cookies are wrapped individually in a box.  Though I can recycle the box, it seems a lot of unnecessary packaging.  Overall, the cookies have a good soft yet crumble to them, they taste like oatmeal cookies with the tasty addition of chocolate chips and almonds. Both of those items tasted true for form.  Not something I would go out of my way for, but if they were on sale or someone offered me one, I wouldn't refuse it. 4
This mustard was too sweet for me. It tastes like it has pickle relish in it. 2
I Loooove peanut better and this ersatz butter tastes pretty good to me and has 0 cholesterol. Nevertheless, because of its high calorie count and high price, I can stretch the rating to only 3 stars. Yes, the taste is good but, in order to get a 2 tablespoon serving, you need at least 6 tablespoons of the powder mixed with 3 tablespoons of water. Otherwise, 2 tablespoons of the powder mixed with 1 of water will yield only about 1.5 teaspoons of spreadable "peanut butter"-- Barely enough to coat half a slice of bread. And so...one serving (2 tablespoonsful) of the mixture ends up being 135 calories--not 45 calories which is the count for 2 tablespoons of the powder. If you're counting calories and pennies, you might as well get the regular peanut butter for less than half the price of the dry stuff. 3
While I roast my own beans for my Jura automatic coffee maker, my mother-in-law uses her Tassimo for her one coffee a day.  She loves these Cappuccino's so I keep her stocked up.  When visiting, I use the machine also and can see the allure in using one if you can't understand the complexities of a real coffee machine.  The real down side is the cost of using the Tassimo or Keurig for coffee.  Crazy expensive!  But it's better than buying the crap served at $tarbucks, which is burned beyond recognition and then sweetened and flavored to the point where you can't taste the coffee.  Get an espresso there some time with no cream or sugar.  I dare you! 4
I wasn't sure what to expect as I had never tried Annie's ginger snaps before, but I do like the Annie's line of products, so was willing to try these.  They are very crunchy!, somewhat grainy (as I guess most gluten-free products are), and very light on ginger flavor.  I don't think my kids will eat them, but they should go nicely with a hot cup of tea. 3
If you like garlic this is a good buy.  We use it almost everyday on the griddle to carmarlize onions or to grill pork chops, burgers, chicken breast. You name it,  I will tell you there is a 32oz bottle that is a better bargain but it always seem to be out-of-stock. 4
Google "propylene glycol" to find out why.  I bought this product, along with several others, without running the ingredients by my wife first (a nurse of 30 years) she<br />was surprised when she noticed it.. we went a googling, and poured my $50 order down the drain afterwards.  There's "pure" and then there's "not so much".....<br /><br />from the website:  [...]<br /><br />Propylene Glycol<br /><br />A cosmetic form of mineral oil found in automatic brake and hydraulic fluid and industrial antifreeze. In the skin and hair, propylene glycol works as a humescent, which causes retention of moisture content of skin or cosmetic products by preventing the escape of moisture or water. The Material Safety Data Sheet warns users to avoid skin contact with propylene glycol as this strong skin irritant can cause liver abnormalities and kidney damage.<br />Also used in:<br /><br />  Tyre sealant<br />  Rubber cleaner<br />  De-icer<br />  Stain removers<br />  Fabric softener<br />  Degreaser<br />  Paint<br />  Adhesive<br />  Wallpaper stripper<br /><br />I wrote the company about this concern and they never responded.... 1
First of all, *I* LOVE that I live in Seattle, WA where Blue Dog Bakery's headquarters are located  :-) Nothing like "buying local"! Second, I REALLY like this company's products as their treats have limited ingredients - things that are healthy and not excessive sugars and fillers, which is great!<br /><br />CON: I test EVERY treat first before giving it to my dog and all three flavors were each pretty decent tasting (and they're all LOW FAT - great for me). However, I certainly couldn't taste the difference between the 3 flavors and I'm darn sure my dog can't either. The ingredients are also things I would likely find in my own pantry so if I *really* wanted to, I could make these treats myself and add my own flavoring to make them more realistic tasting based on their individual flavors.<br /><br />My dog LOVES these treats though and they are perfect size for training (in fact, I split each piece in half) and sometimes I'll crush 1-2 up in her food when I'm getting her used to a new kibble. Works every time!<br /><br />I recently found these at my local Grocery Outlet for $1.79/box (YAHOO!!!) so I bought 20 boxes since that's an even better price than here at Amazon for the 6-pk AND I don't have to pay for shipping  :-) Very wholesome goodness at a VERY good price! 4
We like the much harder to find "white" popcorn over the more common "yellow" popcorn and Amish Country Baby White is our absolute favorite.  We usually order 3 of the 6 lb bags 'cause we go thru it so quickly. 5
i must be doing something wrong, because i think this rice is awful.  i followed the instructions, but had to add more water and cook longer. 1
Not happy with the product.  Once they were cooked the potatoes were flat and didn't look any thing like the product picture that was seen.  The shipping cost as much as the potatoes did! 1
Like another reviewer here, I use this granulated honey for my tea and I use it for my coffee.  It is oh so much better than white sugar.  I had been in the habit of using the unprocessed sugar, which was good, but this is so much better.<br /><br />This product does indeed give backed goods a bit of a different, in a positive way, flavor and I use it with cookies.  I buy my granulate honey at a local health food shop and the price here, even if you consider the shipping, is quite competitive.  The other advantage is that this stuff is becoming more and more popular in my area and our local shops are forever running out of it.  It is nice to know I have a reliable source.<br /><br />Highly recommend this product. 5
The picture has peanut butter and I got strawberry which I am not a fan of, also they were smaller then the ones you normally get in the store. They were fresh for the most part. I did like I could write a cute note and stick it in my bf's lunch, thought with him being 27 he wasn't such a fan, ha! 2
the coffee was to strong and bitter we used the k cup twice trying to make it a little weaker but it was not good for people who  like strong coffee thats the one to buy 2
I am always a little cautious with beverage mixes so I used half a packet in the recommended 1 cup of hot water (50% recommended strength)<br /><br />It was so extremely ginger bitter that I couldn't take it.  So I added another cup of hot water.  I managed to keep drinking it but only about half way (this is at 25% strength).  I ended up just dumping it.<br /><br />I haven't drank any more - if you like chewing pickled ginger or something like that maybe you'll like this but it is NOT like ginger tea - it's not subtle and it's extremely bitter.  Could smell the lemon - could only taste ginger.<br /><br />Not at all for me.  I'll try to pawn off what I have left on someone else but my boyfriend won't take it either.  He tasted a sip of mine said "it's okay" and then refused to drink any more, so I'll assume that regardless of what he said, he doesn't like it either. 1
Since I started making Hodgson Wholesome Potato bread, my husband will not eat store bought bread anymore!  We make about two loaves a week, in different varieties of the Hodgson Mill brand.  The honey whole wheat and white bread mixes are also great.<br />I like using my old bread machine to make the dough, then shape into loaf and bake in the oven.  Makes perfect loaf every time, also makes delicious rolls.<br />Glad I discovered this brand of bread mixes on Amazon--they are wholesome, and I know what I'm putting into the bread I bake now.  Great product! 5
My 8 cats eat the Natural Balance canned food (and also Pro-Plan canned food) but disliked the Natural Balance dry blend. They eat Wellness dry, Canin Blend 27 and California Natural dry instead. 2
I have been using this brand of coffee in my Tassimo<br />Brewer now for a few months and am pleased with it.<br /><br />I own a business where I offer my clients a cup and<br />they are pleased to receive a fresh brewed cup. If they<br />want it a bit stronger, I just end the brewing cycle sooner. 4
I bought this product thinking I could use it to make chicken salad, not possible.  It was a can of jellied, mushy tiny pieces of chicken with only a few pieces large enough to use in chicken salad.  It might be okay to use to make chicken and noodles for the flavor, if you added several cans of Swanson canned chicken.  I will not buy it again. 2
I was very disappointed with this tea.  I love chai, and was excited to find a decaf version.  However, the tea only tastes of cloves. 2
I ordered this popcorn and in the past have loved it, but this time ordering it for the first time from amazon I was highly disatisfied!! We got it and it was so stale that even my 2 year old would not eat it and he will eat anything. A customer guarentee came with the popcorn so we called and were told that because we ordered through amazon we were not able to get a refund or a fresh product. Never again will I order anything of this nature through amazon. 1
I've bought other brands here but decided to save some money and chose Roland. I'm sorry to say they were not very good.  The best so far have been Byzantine, Peloponnese and Barnier. 2
It sounded like a great idea for a Halloween party, but I can't really say if these are any good or not. Poor packaging led to warm mushy product on arrival. Tried re-ship twice with same results. Don't bother unless you live in the frozen North. 1
My husband and my 8 year old loved this product, and couldn't get enough of it. However, I didn't find it suiting to my tastes because it had a bit of bitterness to it. In comparison to the countless other chocolate granola brands already on the shelf, I can't say I'd recommend this product as other brands tasted better. 3
I had purchased the Black licorice and thought it to be some of the best I'd ever had, and I do love licorice.  Ordered this only because the Black was not available, but found it tastes more like Grape, of which I am not fond. 2
This Love Crunch granola is delicious with vanilla yogurt. The granola itself is very crunchy as the name implies. The chocolate chunks have a nice, slightly dark taste. The only downside is that the berries have very little flavor. They might as well just skip them. 4
I love cereal and eat it for breakfast almost every day. I've tried just about everything in the breakfast aisle, but I've never found anything to rival my two stand-by favorites, plain yellow-box Cheerios and Honey Bunches of Oats. I figured these Kellogg's Crunchy Nut O's were worth a shot, however, as they had both honey and peanuts going for them.<br /><br />Boy, was I disappointed. I thought this cereal was much, much too sweet, and felt that it left a bad corn aftertaste in my mouth. My husband, a huge fan of Honey Nut Cheerios, didn't like this either. After a few bowls, the box sat untouched in my cupboard for months until I finally threw it out. Definitely not for us! 2
From reading reviews of all the stash green teas, I decided to get the organic pinhead version for better quality.  I think it is excellent though it is not cheap.  The leaves look in excellent shape and only a spoonful is needed in a teapot.  I made the mistake of using too much tea for my first pot but this is a tasty tea. 4
my shipment arrived with a lot of the plastic bottles dented up. customer service was so wonderful to deal with-a plus. i took a taste from one though and it's so strong of a flavor. i buy raw honey all the time and they're always firm to the touch, but this one is flowing, like regular store bought honey. my kids don't like this type of raw honey at all, the taste is too strong. maybe it's just our taste, but if you're into the normal flavor of honey, this brand is definitely going to throw your tastebuds off. if you're into different flavors, then this is the one for you. 2
I really liked this flavor!  As someone with many food sensitivities who also avoids sugar, this is the perfect treat for me when I crave chocolate or baked goods.  The raw nuts are crisp and fresh tasting.  However, the price was very high for the quantity of product.  With less than 20 brazil nuts in the package, I felt a little gipped.  In future, I'll try making my own chocolate nut mix from bulk raw nuts, berries, and coco powder rather than spend $9 per package!  For that price, I'd like a lot more product. 3
This food is not a good food and is not worth the money.  It contains by products and lots of corn.  It will make your cats fat and lazy.  My friend's cat was vomiting and had been to every vet and had every test but when she switched the food to Innova Evo, the cat stopped vomiting.  Do not buy this food because for the same price you can buy Evo which is grain free and made with table-grade meat. SCIENCE DIET IS GARBAGE! 1
The flavor is different,and a little 'earthy' for us, but we brew it together with another tea which works well.  This is a good value. 5
$41.00 for 12.6 ounces of water?  you have to be joking.  I have to admit it is a beautiful glass bottle (much better than those tacky plastic ones), how can you impress your friends drinking out of a plastic bottle? 1
Ordered OVEN ROASTED TURKEY NUGGETS*** for the first time. Meat is dry. Expiration date is too close; received today, SEPT 9, 2011, expiring NOV 21, 2011.<br /><br />In the past, have had very good experience with the Chicken Teriyaki nuggets. Jack Link's used to use dark meat. Jack Link's changed the recipe to white meat and the nuggets do not taste as rich any more.<br /><br />*** Very disappointed with Amazon's approach on linking ALL Jack Link's nuggets together. Meaning: If you post a review for the Chicken Teriyaki ones, you can NOT post one for the flaming chicken, turkey over roasted, etc.?! And the same review will show up under any and all of them. I contacted Amazon and customer service first tried to convince me I was doing something wrong. On the third e-mail, the senior CS guru indicated the nugget products are all linked together and nothing will be done about the issue. 2
not what i expected.. I tried vanilla version at my neighbour's - they were soft and nice.. but they were also in a bigger bag (8 oz or so). These cookies (oatmeal) come in small pouches (2 oz or so) and they are stone hard, too salty, no taste appeal whatsoever. The same I can say for the chocolate version. Nobody in our family wants a bite of them - waste of money. 1
When you think about paying $4.00 a 3 oz bottle for this... This is a REAL bargin.  If you like fish, bast it with butter, sprinkle Magic on it and grill it quickly...NEVER over cook fish.  You should be able to grill about any fish. 5
NOTE: This one is better for me at the smallest cup setting, which makes it stronger.<br /><br />This is my first time to try Wolfgang Puck coffee. I have mixed feelings about it so far. The Rodeo Drive Blend is a little more 'bland' than I'm used to, which is great for people who prefer that. It's just a different taste, which is good or not-so-good, depending on each person's preference. Personally, ever so often I take a sip of Rodeo Drive Blend and think that it almost tasted like dishwater. Then that goes away and I enjoy the rest of the cup of coffee. I think that reaction is because it isn't as strong and bold as I'm used to, but it's pretty good. I can see that some people might make this their favorite because it is different.<br /><br />Will I buy this again? No. It's good, but it's not my preference, and I might as well buy the ones that make me rave on and on about how good they are, usually Tully's French, Kona, Italian, and House. Those may be too strong for some people, and the Rodeo Drive Blend does have its own unique taste which may really appeal to some coffee drinkers. As with most things, actually a little more than in most things, with coffee, it's a matter of taste and probably a matter of what you are in the habit of drinking. You may want to try this one, especially if you can find it in a sample packet, or do like I do, keep the rest for guests to try. 4
I subscribed and saved to this kind of jerky in the past, then had the subscription canceled for a time. Since jerky is more expensive by the piece, I recently restarted the subscription... only to cancel it after the second shipment. It's nasty. I got two boxes of it and don't know what to do with it. It's old, moldy and disgusting. I am very disappointed with this product and recommend people avoid this until the company steps up and improves the quality. It may be a better deal to buy it in quantity, but it's not when you can't even eat it. 2
Instant Coffee. I am appalled Kuereg allows this stuff to be sold! It is disgusting. Amazon should remove this from their site. 1
It is so great to have a low-fat, low-calorie, yet delicious brand of cookies available! I don't feel guilty after eating a few, and trust me, you will eat a few!!! I have a friend with a gluten allergy and its great to have something to offer her when she comes over that I can enjoy as well.  Definitely worth trying! 5
I had the impression that this was going to be more of a carbonated drink experience, similar to a soda.  It's more like sparkling fruit juice.  It was way too sweet for what I typically like and actually tastes a bit like cherry cough syrup.  Not something I would ever have again. 3
These bars are just Ok.<br /><br />They are smaller than the photo on the box. If you just need a little something to tide you over until your next meal, these could help maintain or lose weight. They're just not the tastiest things I've had. 3
We tried one packet of each of the assortment. Each one was virtually tasteless. The peppermint felt like grit. The marshmellows might as well have been missing. Could barely taste any salt in the salted caramel. 1
I bought these seeing that other feedback said they were good for cake pops but in my opinion they are not. the black part of the eyeball is so small it makes it look funny, they are not thick and round like in the pic. 2
A+ for concept, ingredients, flavor, fun, snack-worthiness. C for function.<br /><br />This product is a great little snack idea and is great to add fruit servings in to your kiddos day. It's a tad tart for my preference but both my 1 yr old and 4 yr old love these. They're these little plasticized foil pouches that have a sort of bottle-like nipple'ish mouthpiece - but free flow - that the kids can suck the product out while squeezing the pouch flat. The mouthpiece itself is under the twist-off cap and is about 1/3 of an inch diameter. They have a permanent home in my go-bag as they do not require refrigeration.<br /><br />BUT they do require a clean-up crew until your child figures out how to use em. WARNING: DO NOT USE FOR FIRST TIME IN A CAR. They're so cute and you're thinking "oh this is a perfect car snack!" But they're not until AFTER your child learns how hard they can squeeze em. My 4 yr old was coachable and likely could have been fine unsupervized in a carseat while I drive along. But my 1 yr old? Haha, she grabbed that thing up and WOOP! Up shoots a 3 inch geyser of applesauce-like-product. It was super cute and definitely a home-movie-moment but I'm glad we usually have wipes within reach. Unless you trust your kids to eat super neatly be cautious with this product: no dressy outfits, no papers, no artwork, nothing that can't be wiped down with a moist cloth. This apple cinnamon product in particular I'm not concerned about color stains, but it is sticky and... well, it's fruit.<br /><br />Once my girls got the hang of em it's been great. I even trust my 1 yr old in the car with em - but only when I'm not alone and another passenger can clean up possible 'geyser damage.'<br /><br />I bought this during a special and signed up for Subscribe & Save and the price was far better than in stores (Amazon was ~61% of my stores price). I'm definitely going to keep purchasing this product and try out other pure blended fruit flavors - I'm a little wary of the 'touch of milk' products that require no refrigeration. 4
It has been over three weeks and I still have not received this product.  And, they have charged me for it already... 1
At nearly ten dollars for a four ounce package, that works out to almost forty dollars a pound.  I bought the cinnamon ones and they taste pretty bad.  They might be tolerable with a strong-tasting topping, but as a snack cracker they fail miserably. 2
I really like these chips.  They have a different texture than regular potato chips but I still find it really tasty.  Even my boyfriend, who is often averse to all things "healthy" and "low fat" will gobble these up rather quickly.  The variety packs are great because they allow you to have a little bit of everything, but of course the downside is that you may not like some flavors as much.  I find the original version to be a little bland by itself, and the sea salt and vinegar flavor might be too strong for some people. 4
While I admit that the oversalted chip is addictive, I really think this one has gone too far. Skin literally peeled off my lips and inside my mouth after eating these. I am surprised that they are still on the market. 1
Dogs love 'em!!  I mix the treats in their dog food and they wolf it down within a minute. 5
Okay, I should not eat potato chips, nor should anyone.<br />But these are so spicy, I would find it hard to eat<br />very many. That makes them an indulgence that<br />rescues some people from overindulgence. 4
Prompt shipping. But at $20 a jar? Are you kidding me? I used to buy multiple jars to reduce overall shipping cost, but they have changed the product listing by raising the price to include the cost of shipping now. Ridiculous. This stuff makes a pretty good pie, but not worth it. I tried the Amish brand to save money, but all it is is colored corn starch. I threw the other jars away. Yuk. Barry Farms is still the better of the 2 product choices on Amazon. If you want a $20 too-sweet, mediocre pie. I wish I didn't love hard-to-get black raspberries so much. 3
Have no idea what the dude is talking aboout concerning plastic taste. Maybe they cooked it too long (though that would be kind of absent minded), but they taste great. I just wish it was a tad cheaper. 4
This is much different than the water packed tofu I'm used to but I like it a lot. I've only made pudding with it so far (chocolate, chocolate peanut butter banana, and next, pumpkin!) but I can see the potential uses. And reading other reviews and doing various searches for ideas (mayo! sauces! dips! smoothies!) really help too. I'd love to be able to replace mayo with tofu and create a creamy cheesy tofu sauce for mac & cheese. Imagine the calorie savings!<br /><br />The best thing about this tofu is that it's shelf stable. I read on their website (morinu.com/) that each pack is dated on its creation date and is good for one year from that date. That's useful info. Also check their website for recipes and suggested uses. Each pack has a recipe on it but it's the same for all 12. 5
A fabulous variety of hot sauces with a range of flavors and heat. I bought it for a gift for my brother so I ended up sampling, using them myself. Truly flavorful! And hot! I use it in my omelets. Burritos. Nachos. Beans. 5
Well the creme caramel was on sale so I decided to give it a shot. Plus the fact that each K Cup is individually prepared by Mr. Puck himself. Anyway I quite enjoy these. I never buy flavored ones so overall I'm happy with these but they are definitely not my favorite as I usually buy the bolder ones and these are fairly mild. 3
I have been told by my veternarian that Glucosomin treats with chicken cause urinary problems in dogs and so I wanted to return 3 unopened packages (of 3 each)and the company will not accept returns.  Ridiculous.  They must know how bad they are for animals. 1
Tried the BBQ Popchips for the first time and loved them so got the value pack to try more flavors. Loved them all except the salt and pepper chips which weren't that great. Good healthy snack without giving up the taste. So glad I discovered these! Salt and vinegar are my favorite! 100 cal/bag, 3.5g fat/bag 5
howdy y'all,<br /><br />other such products have tended to be rather dry - or sometimes dried to a hard lump. this is soft, moist, chewy, and tasty. the slices are just the right size - convenient bites that are good on their own and better on a sandwich.<br /><br />the packages are also a very handy size. i always use the pack up long before the contents start to go bad.<br /><br />rated a FOUR cuz it is better than expected.<br /><br />take care,<br />lee 4
I will no longer consider buying product from Kelloggs for the following reason:<br />Kelloggs continues to include GMO (genetically modified organism) ingredients in their products but refuses to include that information on their product labels.  There are no long term studied to prove that GMOs are safe for either human or animal consumption.  Kelloggs/ position is that GMOs are deemed safe by the FDA so they are not required to be identified to consumers.  However, Michael Taylor, head of the FDA, is a former attorney for Monsanto, the chemical company responsible for the development and wide spread use of GMOs in the American food supply, illustrating a conflict of interest that prevents the FDA from acting responsibly.  It's interesting to note that 50 other countries around the world have banned GMOs from their food supply all together but consumers here in the United States do not even have the right to be informed when GMOs are present in the products we buy.  Kelloggs is an unacceptable choice as long as they refuse to fully disclose the true nature of their ingredients to consumers. 1
I should preface this review by noting that I am not a Starbuck's coffee drinker since I have not found it enjoyable in the past, and also that I always drink coffee black.  So, it was with hesitation that I tried the vanilla ground coffee. I did not expect much, but I also really went into it with a hopeful attitude that this time it would taste delicious.  Unfortunately, my previous experiences held up to be true once again.  The taste was bitter and sharp, not smooth and had a yucky "fake" taste.  I will say that the vanilla flavoring tasted more natural than some flavored coffees that I have tried, but it still wasn't great.  I'm really not a coffee snob and will drink just about anything else (!), so I hate to sound so negative, but this was my opinion of the product. 2
Dark roast coffee is too mild, capuccino is lausiest thing I tested in years. On the plus side the machine works great! 2
My 5 month old lab goes nuts over these liver treats.  Our vet recommended these as a healthy treat.  Our pup acts like a cat with catnip over these. A big hit. The price and size are excellent and should last a good while. 5
This is a coffee that I look forward to drinking as soon as I wake up! Very nice...... 4
After going on an anti-inflammation diet, I was forced to find substitutes for almost everything I was used to eating.  I've had lots of success with Glutino products, but this is not one I would recommend.  The bar itself isn't too bad, but the filling is pretty awful.  It disintegrates into a nasty, almost grainy paste.  The apple taste is ok, but the texture of the filling was very hard to swallow.  I tried this for the first time on my morning commute, and had I not been on a crowded bus I would have likely spit it out. I definitely will not by these again and am not sure that I can bring myself to finish the box.  However, definitely check out Glutino pretzels, wafer cookies, and other products! 2
I made 6 oz cup of this and it tasted awful.  It lacked milk chocolate flavor and was very watered down.  I was very disappointed because hot cocoa was the main beverage I wanted to brew since I do not drink coffee.  This was very bad. 2
I love Twinings Lady Grey but the most recent batch was pretty bad. Regardless of how I brew it I get an odd odor that masks the characteristic Lady Grey aroma. I used some older tea under exactly the same conditions and got a perfect cup. I've got 6 tins of this stuff and it is a lost cause. 1
I bought a case of these because I had liked the Oat Cranberry Almond Whenever Bars.  To me these bars taste almost exactly like an Almond Joy candy bar, which is one of my favorite candy bars.  The texture is similar in mouth feel to that of the candy bar as well.  I am extremely pleased with these Oat Chocolate Chip Coconut Whenever Bars and have put in an order to have them delivered to me on a regular basis.  They are healthy, wheat and gluten free, and non-dairy.  If you need to have wheat, gluten or dairy free products these are a fantastic find. 5
I was super excited about receiving my gluten free communion crackers. Let me tell you. These do not taste like Jesus at all!! Not only that, but I ate these after molesting some alter boys this morning and I did not feel any better. I think when removing the gluten, they accidentally removed the Christ! 1/10 - would not buy again :( 1
Our cat absolutely loves these "green" treats.  Esp since she's indoors and unable to eat plants/grass they give her the greens she needs as part of her diet.  We've been giving them to her for years and have had no issue - We actually toss them down the hall to her to give her some exercise which she loves.  Just give them time to chew etc.  HIGHLY recommend! 5
The Ak-mak crackers are excellent. I really like them. The only problem That I encountered was poor shipping. Out of 180 pks of crackers, 100 of them were broken into multpile small pieces. I needed them whole not broken. I will not buy these again for this reason. 3
The Quaker Soft Baked Cereal Bar was okay at first, but once I microwaved it for a few seconds it was delicious. Almost like having my moms fresh bakes banana nut bread. These are perfect since I don't have much time to eat in the morning an to take with me. This is a product I will continue to purchase in the future. 4
I really was excited to learn from Dr. Oz about these Shirataki noodles since I am a diabetic who just happens to adore pasta.  Sorry Dr. Oz but this is absolutely NOT a good substitute for Pasta or anything that I would consider edible.  May as well eat rubber bands with some sort of sauce on them.  I would not recommend this to even my most hated enemy.  I believe I have said enough! 1
I am not a coffee snob but craved coffee when I am pregnant, so I ordered some decaf.  I have to say i never touched again and its not worth the trouble ( not much of course) of making it 2
I like it as a straight espresso shot - great aroma, not bitter with subtle sweetness, but not as much for cappuccino. Supercrema in my opinion holds up better for those who like to add milk to their espresso drink. I don't think these beans will work at all for those who like latte. I wish all these would come in smaller size because I normally go through 1 Lb of coffee every month and this bag will last me two months. 4
I had read the reviews and thought this was a good buy but beware, this product tastes like vinegar thickened with corn starch.  I regret buying this product. 2
Fondarific usually has glowing reviews... everyone on the cake forums seems to love it.  My batch was either old or just crap.  Very disappointing.  Will go back to making marshmallow fondant.... cheaper and WAY easier to work with.  Also bought the black but didn't open it because the white was such crap.  Had to use it because I ran out of time to make MMF for the cake I was making... DUE TO THE FACT THAT I PRE-PURCHASED fondant to use.<br /><br />I love working with Fondant, and thought that maybe I'd use something easier this time, but it wasn't.  Good luck with this.<br /><br />Taste however, was quite good. 1
I was not sent the correct product as advertised.  Therefore, I am not pleased with it.  However, I was reimbursed for my purchase, so I am not out any money.  As a matter of fact, the picture and description that accompanies this survey request is still incorrect.<br /><br />That said, all-in-all, I am very pleased with the most of my experiences with Amazon.com.<br /><br />Thanks for asking. 2
The blend is not as great as I thought it would be.  It's too sweet or artificial tasting.  I'm got these in the larger size because during the hot weather I wanted to down one of these while on the go.  Luckily, I did also purchase the plain coconut water so hopefully I'll be able to cut the taste. 2
I eat a cookie every morning for breakfast, different kinds. I don't get hungry until later in the afternoon. I have lost 7 pounds in the last month because I'm not overeating trash all day. I'm not saying it's the cookies that are all-responsible, but I eat the cookie and I'm full, then can think about what I'd like for lunch instead of just eating. 5
Beware!  I methodically check ingredient lists for everything purchased in the store for hidden gluten.  I went to buy my regular Soy-On-the-Go boxes but Amazom is out of them so I quickly changed and ordered this one.  Imagine my dismay when receiving the $30 pack of milk boxes and finding they contain both Wheat and Barley!  Yes, they are listed (I went and checked today after receiving the shipment) but ... who on earth would think soy milk would have gluten?!  Now I have 27 milk boxes that my casein and gluten intolerant daughter can't drink. 3
I'm sorely disappointed, I'll give it two stars because the flavor was pretty good but the turkey chunks are gross. I couldn't even get through half a can after cutting it with my own fresh chunks of pork. Would not recommend this. 2
If it lasted, it would be a good chew.  It's a little smelly but compared to a chew-hoof it's Chanel.  Puppy took it from my hand and went straight to work, and it lasted about 20 minutes.  He's a bigger chewer now but at the time he was not the most ferocious, and it would last maybe 8 minutes now.  No mess on the floor - little nibbled bits that stick to your socks - like you get with real bones.  No loose stool either, but there were some FUNKY smells going on in his vicinity a few hours after each bone.<br /><br />For a more durable chew without the stinkies, try an antler.  I'll post a review on those if I can find them in my order history.<br /><br />Based on the dogs I've owned, this would be great for a Sheltie, spaniel, bichon or other small- to midsize- puppy that isn't a serious chewer but needs a job to do to keep him out of trouble. 3
...so I drink mine diluted.  These sticks are meant for 16 ounce water bottles, but I empty a stick into a one (1) liter empty bottle which I fill with water from my Mavea water pitcher.  It still tastes heavy on the pineapple; in fact, I don't notice any mango or tea flavors at all. There is a "too sweet" aftertaste, also. 2
Our ten year old doxie...Annie NEVER, that's right, NEVER would eat ANY dry food UNTIL....Harmony Farms Healthy & Holistic Chicken & Brown Rice Adult Dog Food that we bought from you! Every day we are in shock when she finishes each and every nugget of this dry dog food! Amazon...you are truly amazing and we are so grateful that we bought this 17.5 pound bag of Harmony Farms Dog food from you...we'll be ordering again and again from you as soon as we head towards the end of the current bag.  Wow! So happy about this... 5
It didn't cause any stomach upset, but was pretty good. It's not as robust as one might like, and the aroma was not very strong either, but I would not go so far as to call it bland or anything. If you have a need for a low acid coffee I would say it might be a viable coffee option. I used the whole package to make one pot-- that quantity was about right for me. 4
These things are HORRIBLE!  They are very salty, have very little flavor and are just plain nasty.  Don't waste your money on these.... go buy some real cheese and have that instead! 1
We like these almonds and were unable to get them at our local store anymore so found them on Amazon and ordered them. 5
Who knows if it actually detoxed me, but it tasted HORRIBLE! No matter what you mix it with. 3
regular CFL bulbs tend to be more yellow than natural lights. full spectrum bulbs tend to be more pale blue. My eyes are very sensitive to lights and yellow lights tend to make me feel a little 'winter gloom'. So I mixed full spectrum bulbs with regular ones to achieve a warm (yellow) but still up-lifting (white) lighting effects.<br /><br />I was not able to find full spectrum CFL at my local stores, so I was very happy when I found them at amazon and at such a great price.<br /><br />Earthmate uses recycled papers for packagings instead of those hard to cut plastic shells, which is great.<br />The only reason I gave it 4 star was because they are so green-conscious that they use very little glue on the box. when I tried to open the box from the acutal box openings, the side where it was glued together would break open and the box cannot hold a bulb any more. 4
Fabulous gift.  The blooming teas were lovely and unique.  Packaging was beautiful and perfect for a gift. 5
I like a lot of the Gloria Jeans flavored k-cups, and I typically love french vanilla coffee, but this one is not so good to me.  The vanilla taste is almost like a chemical, as if they made a cup of coffee and shot some cheap vanilla syrup flavoring into it.  As far as vanilla k-cups go, I'd stick with the Van Houtte or Timothy's. 2
I opened a bag of these and poured them into a bowl. One of the chips on top had something black on it. It looked like black tar or melted black crayon. I assumed it was a contaminant of some sort, since it didn't resemble any kind of food ingredient. I wish I had not bought these chips. I am now wary of all Kettle products. 1
(Purchased this product at a local store) Tried this after recently learning I have a wheat allergy. The texture is comparable to "normal" package gravy, easy to make, and is flavorful, but honesty is sort of yucky and overly 'herby'. Some people might like it but simply not for me. 3
I bought this on a whim because I was craving strawberry shortcake... wow! The biscuits can be a bit crumbly, but the texture is not objectionable. The taste was great! I use this for sweet and regular biscuits.<br /><br />We also use this for pancakes, and they are almost indistinguishable from regular pancakes. I add vanilla, a touch of brown sugar and cinnamon for a treat. Yum!<br /><br />Tip - I've found that most gluten free "bread" products work better if you let the batter sit for about 15 minutes after mixing the dry and wet ingredients. It seems to activate the batter, which makes the resulting stuff lighter and more moist. 5
I buy this for my cat.  I add vitamins & vegies and make my own wet cat food for Sadie the cat.  I tried it once to make a tuna salad sandwich but it was tuna paste by the time I added onion & mayo.  Really not enjoyable for me but my cat ate it all. 2
Be aware - this listing is for only ONE box of crackers.  The description states "Save On Kinnikinnick 6X 8 Oz S'Moreable Graham Cracker They'Re Back And Ready For S'Mores!", which makes it sound like you are getting SIX boxes.  When you add in shipping they are pretty pricey for just one box, but they are delicious.  My 1.5 year old son has multiple food allergies and a very limited diet, and loves these.  Just wish we could find a good deal on buying them in bulk. 3
Curious about what your drinking? The second ingredient should be enough to scare you away. After HFCS began to be widely introduced into the food supply 30-odd years ago, obesity rates skyrocketed. And because the sweetener is so ubiquitous, many blame HFCS for playing a major role in our national obesity epidemic. As a result, some shoppers equate HFCS with "toxic waste.<br /><br />It would be helpful if Amazon was responsible and posted Ingredients just like every shopper can look at when your shopping in a grocery store!<br /><br />Carbonated Water, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Citric Acid, Taurine, Natural Flavor, Sodium Citrate, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Inositol, Caffeine, Monopotassium Phosphate, Gum Arabic, Grape Seed Extract, L-Carnitine, Glycerol Ester of Wood Rosin, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, L-Arginine Hydrochloride, Zinc Methionine Sulfite, Guarana (Paullinia Capurian) Seed Extract, Caramel Color, Selenium Complexed with Amino Acids and Polypeptides, Beta Carotene (Color), Folic Acid, Cyanocobalamin. 1
Great for risotto.  Creates creamy finished product, while maintaining a good 'al dente' bite, better than any other rice I have used. 5
I ordered the new Zealand Ranch Style Dog treats because they looked intriguing and I can always use treats for my dogs. I have to Papillion spaniels.  Unfortunately, after the package arrived, it disappeared. I was frantic and looked everywhere. Later in the evening, my family had found the package. It appears that the smaller dog had managed to climb up on the chest where the package had been set and carried it off. She had spent the entire afternoon gnawing at the mailer, until she'd managed to free the treat bag. Unfortunately for her, the re-sealable zip lock bag the treats came in was impervious to her small teeth, so she ended up simply `nesting' with the package which is what she does with items she likes.<br /><br />So, I opened the package. They are about domino sized and a bit large for my small dog, but they come with a dent in the middle so the treat can be broken.  We gave her one, and she eagerly ate the treat. She then stalked me watching me pleading for more until my sister came and took her away.  I can see the treats are going to be something she really goes for.<br /><br />The verdict: My dog really likes these. Enough to steal the mailer and try to open the package they came in- something she never does.  I like them, because I like Newman's Own because they contain organic ingredients, and I trust the brand. I like the fact that the package is re-sealable, and also that the treats do not smell unpleasant. This is a good item, and one I would recommend without reservation. 5
Due to the low price and good reviews, we thought we'd give this 'balsamic' vinegar a try.  Don't waste your money.  Our standards are pretty low as far as vinegar goes, I mean how much can 'balsamic' vary, right?  We were wrong.  It is red wine vinegar at best.  Very thin, and does not have that savory sweetness like most balsamic vinegars have.  Look elsewhere unless you are looking for red wine vinegar. 1
Merrick is great food -- and it's sometimes hard to find except in specialty stores so being able to order and have delivered to the door is an advantage. The order was well packed and delivered in a timely manner.  But the food is very expensive -- and this was no deal even for a 3 case order -- and the shipping was pricey. 4
I love the bagged BoM Nutty Cranberry Maple Granola, and was expecting this to be the same flavor in a bar. It was softer and chewier, which is good for a bar, but it lacked the rich maple flavor that made me fall in love with the bagged granola. We did still like it, so I'll probably keep them on hand, but they lack the addictive quality I loved in the other (which may not be all bad...). 4
My rating is based on the condition of the product when I recieved it.  Of the case of 12 cans I had ordered, 4 of them had serious dents.  I sent an email about the packaging but received no response.  I would give the product itself at least a 4 rating. 3
Like it,but it was not impressive in any way,will stick with the 9 grain bread we also use from the same company. 3
I have used NSA Nesquik in my coffee for YEARS. It dissolves completely in the hot fluid and tastes great. I can't tell the difference from the fully sugared product.<br /><br />I was looking to buy it in bulk, since it is a staple in my house. None that I found qualifies for Super Saver Shipping.<br /><br />When considering the cost of shipping it is about two dollars MORE per container than even the local Albertson's. Anything under $5/unit would be worth it. Walmart sells it for about $4.75.<br /><br />Bottom line...Keep an eye out, but watch those shipping costs! 3
Chips are not as tangy as I hoped or expected. Poore Brothers is a better choice for the "hard-core" Salt N Vinegar fans. 4
No need to review the product because I'm sure most people in the U.S. who are able to eat peanuts have had these.  These arrived fresh and in good condition.  I can't give even peanut M&Ms more than 4 stars since I think the chocolate used in these products keeps getting worse and worse over time; but they are still a fun, enjoyable snack.<br /><br />I ordered this along with a box of Snickers with Almonds, and Amazon included, as part of my Prime membership, a free "cold pack".<br /><br />This consisted of a very thick and sturdy Styrofoam lidded box, in which the candies were packed, along with four large cold-pack freezable units.<br /><br />The item was in shipping transit for approximately 3 days, and delivered to a hot, humid region.<br /><br />Upon opening the container, I found that the candies were still cold and in good condition, although the cold-packs were no longer frozen or really cold.<br /><br />Amazon did a great job on packing this.  Thought I would share that, in case others are concerned about ordering such products from this company.  I'm even keeping the Styrofoam chest and cold-packs for re-use, since they are of pretty nice quality. 4
This is an extremely high quality cat food that tastes (according to the cats) as good as it looks. I have seven (yes, seven) cats, all rescues who have become spoiled brats and who enjoy being difficult to please. They didn't care for all of the Fussie Cat flavors, but the tuna with shrimp and the tuna with salmon were both big hits and we stocked up.<br /><br />I'm thrilled to have a food of this quality to feed them! 5
I have used Spike as a seasoning for many years, and when I moved to NY, started using cheaper brands that were convenient.  However, I have never like them, and decided to go back to Spike simply because the flavors it brings to my food are so much better> 5
I bought this after having the fortune of a chance encounter with white truffle oil which I found quite tasty. Also I've had black truffles on french dishes in restaurants of which I also was quite fond. So I looked up various truffle options and decided to give this salt a try. The reviews were lauding this product as being the best thing to the fresh truffle itself .. But alas I was disappointed and really kind of frustrated. Maybe it's 'cause I've had the real thing, but no because the truffle oil is still not an issue. The problem is the strong and distinctive quality of this product which doesn't always enhance but rather changes the flavor of foods I've put it on directly. Unfortunately I haven't always found this change for the better. But it has been OK in soups or stews where the flavor is blended in. Maybe I just got a bad batch or something? I don't know if this sort of thing is like wine where storage conditions can damage it? Anyways I give it 3/5 stars. 3
I ordered this with tongue in cheek.  I really expected it to taste powdery and be a poor substitute for "real" PB.  My goal was to try it in smoothies.<br /><br />Sometimes it's good to be wrong.  I use it for PB and banana smoothies every morning.  Wow!  I cannot believe how good it is!  Not powdery or chalky tasting, yummy enough to eat right out of the jar. . . almost.<br /><br />I looked at the website for other ways to use it and found more recipes than I expected and they cover all meals and types of foods.  One day soon I'll try using it to make phad thai or PB cookies...maybe both.<br /><br />[...] 4
The Tea & Honey iced green tea with mango/pineapple flavor, with 5 calories, has an interesting taste, with a slight after taste that means artificial sweetener. The flavor itself tastes more pineapple than mango, both fruits that I like fresh, but nothing like the real fruit flavor, and frankly I prefer plain tea with lemon. I do like the ease of adding the packets to 16.9 fl. oz. of bottled water (cold from the fridge) and drinking the flavored bottle water later. Btw, be sure to shake it well so it all dissolves. 3
I couldn't take two sips of this. Tastes like chewing on a plastic bag. I used to LOVE Zico in Tetrapak - what happened?? Now I have a case of this and don't know what to do with it! 1
These bags never close well, so if you are a compulsive bag-closer, forget about it. Ah, the taste you ask? Dry, and dusted with its own carnation in powderized form. Snack creators branching out by offering traditional products in slightly different forms results in me expressing negative comments via reviews. And why, oh, why does everything have to be miniaturized in order to appeal to rugrats and the type of people who have to proclaim their brood with stick figure-ish stickers on the back of their vehicle? Please, just go straight for the original "Chips Ahoy!" in standard size, pig out, and forget about the kids for six minutes. 2
This seems to work for so many people. It didn't do a thing for me. People talk of their heart racing... I even had soda an hour or so within taking this so-called energy shot, I felt no different. It tasted nasty too. I just took this about an hour ago, I feel like I could just go to sleep. I have 0 energy. Of course I've taken ephedra and it did nothing for me... man I'm just unlucky. I wonder what it's like to feel rested and energetic! I wouldn't know and I guess I never will. 1
My order was on time and packaged correctly.  Bought this for my daughter who is a pastry chef and loves fondarific.  Price is great for a 5lb tub. 5
MY wife is definitely not a chocohalic and is not fond of most sweets. In fact Werther's is the only candy she really likes. So instead of chocolates or flowers I bought this monster box of Werther's for Valentines day. It was a big hit. 5
Very bad taste, like rotten/stale drink. I had read pretty good reviews about ZICO coconut water, but on trying it totally disapointed. VITA COCO is way better than this. 1
Honestly the first time I tried Jamaica me crazy I had to double check to make sure that I didn't leave the pod irom my last cup n the coffee maker. Weak coffee, flavor didn't appeal to me either. Might appeal to someone who likes their coffee on the weaker side. Wolfgang's vienna roast was pleasant though. 2
If I could give this product a minus 10 stars, I would.  There is now very strong evidence that chlothianidin which is in this product is one of the pesticides that is affecting honeybees and contributing to colony collapse disorder.  This US has yet to ban this pesticide, but it has already been banned in other countries. Avoid this product and any others containing clothianidin. 1
I have tried a few of this brand of bread mix in my bread machine and while all have been good I must say to my family and I that this is the best! I have made potato bread from scratch in my bread machine and this is right up there with that. Nice flavor, great texture, well worth the price! I have bought this a few times on Amazon and will continue to do so! 5
I don't understand all these reviews that say there is no aftertaste to this.  Even in small amounts in baking, the first thing I notice is the terrible aftertaste and I've thrown out what I've made with it.  It's just THAT noticeable.  I was using Ideal until I found out it actually had a lot of carbs, but it was really good for baking.  I wish I could find a good no carb sweetener product.  This is NOT it. 2
I don't like to fly in the face of so many positive reviews; clearly there are many people who like this product.<br /><br />While I get absolutely zero aftertaste from so many artificially sweetened products (Dr Pepper 10 and Coke Zero being my favorites), MiO leaves an aftertaste that reminds me of the sweeteners of many years ago.<br /><br />The fruit flavors are very good, but the aftertaste ruins it.  Your mileage may vary...<br /><br />I give this two stars instead of one because I really appreciate the idea of a liquid flavor-to-taste product. 2
Is this the rich man's Peanut Butter Cap'n Crunch? Or the poor man's Honey Nut Cheerios? It tastes like the former, but looks like the latter. My wife and I dug into this one evening and, 24 hours later, have demolished it. It's not very "peanut-y," except for the artificial peanut flavor (despite, strangely, the flecks of peanut glued onto each "o"). If you're looking for sugar and aren't discriminatory in your brand names, it should satisfy your craving. Om nom nom! 4
I first tasted Sassafras tea in a local restaurant and really liked it.  So I started looking in grocery stores and online for it in a teabag form.  After several weeks of investigation I called the restaurant and asked what they used to make the tea.  I was told is was Pappy's Sassafras Concentrate.  I looked online and found it at Amazon.com.  As I was ordering it I also saw the Sassafras Teabags.  I thought I'd order a box to try.  I was very dissapointed.  It didn't taste like the flat rootbeer I was expecting.  It was more like black licorice, which I hate, with a very mild rootbeer undertone.  It also didn't have the distinctive red color that you get by steeping the sassafras root.<br /><br />I've never had real Sassafras tea made with the root so I don't know if the teabags are more like the real thing or not.  Bottom line:  I won't buy the teabags again. 1
The first test for a new canned cat food is the ingredient list.  The ingredients in Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (chicken flavors) passed this test with flying colors: Chicken, Chicken Broth, Carrots are listed first and there is no wheat gluten. Unfortntately, the 2nd test is whether my cat will eat the food and this ended up with a big thumbs down. Not sure if it was the significant amount of broth in a serving or the fact that it is chicken (he usually has fish-based canned food), but after a 1st bite, he just walked away.<br /><br />If a cat is accustomed to eating chicken canned food, I would still recommend giving this a try because of the quality ingredients. 3
I eat lots of Kashi products and love them, but this oatmeal tastes awful. I've never eaten paste, but that's the first thing that comes to mind when I am eating this oatmeal. It's like paste with flaxseed in it. Even if you give your oatmeal a more watery consistency, the flavor of this is just not good. I am forcing myself to get through the one box I bought and then I will never buy this again! In fact, I am eating my last few bites right now as I write this. It's so awful that I felt the need to write a review about it! 1
Lipton To Go Stix Iced Green Tea Mix is convenient and refreshing. One "stick" makes 16 oz of iced tea when mixed with water. (Note, the nutrition information shown on the package is for 8 oz, so you need to double the nutritional values if you consume the whole beverage.)<br />The tea crystals do not dissolve easily, it will take some time to do it right. The flavor is variable, from sweet to sour to bitter at times.<br />The sweeteners include honey, sugar and suclarose (Splenda.) Blackberry and pomegranate is an odd combination,  but is not too bad. The packets are small and easy to carry around with you. If you like, you can just dissolve a packet into a 16 oz container of bottled water on the go. It is an ok drink, but I wouldn't go out of my way to find it. 3
Never got a delivery as fast as we did this time.  We were running low on our special coffee. We have sampled many K-cup coffees, some in assorted packs and decided this is the best.  It is mellow, never bitter and always totally enjoyable. 5
I have friends who are raving fans of the Mallomars. I figured they'd be a big hit with me too. After all, there aren't very many junk foods that I don't like. If anything, I have impulse controls issues and have trouble stopping at just one of anything.<br /><br />So I was really surprised when I tried my first Mallomar yesterday. I expected to really have to restrain myself and avoid scarfing down a bunch of them. But no. One was enough. I had no desire to try another. I guess that's lucky for me, because at 60 calories each, these pack quite a payload.<br /><br />Hmmm. Maybe I was in a bad mood or there was a sampling issue. I can't honestly form an opinion on just one, so I tried another one a few hours later and then one more again today.<br /><br />I had the same feeling after every one of them: too much dark chocolate flavor. I like dark chocolate a lot, but these have a surprisingly long lasting dark chocolate aftertaste. The marshmallow inside is really first rate. Marshmallows can get stale and funky pretty easily (except for rock hard Easter peeps!). So yes, they really succeeded with the filling. The cookie was OK, but it didn't hold together very well. It tried to split vertically, which I expected, but it also delaminated horizontally and made a big mess. The cookie taste wasn't as good as I expected. It was fresh and buttery, but there was no sweet flavor or even any graham flavor. It was just a buttery shortbread taste (and messy).<br /><br />And besides the dark chocolate aftertaste, my other lasting impression was that the three tastes (chocolate, marshmallow, and cookie) really didn't marry very well in this treat. They don't combine into a distinct taste like a s'more or a moon pie. They're just three individual tastes. Or actually the marshmallow and the cookie are just delivery systems for the dark chocolate flavor.<br /><br />I've probably really made you mad by now if you're a Mallomar fan. It's fine with me if you like them: different strokes. I wish I could share the rest of my box with you.<br /><br />But if you DO like them, is Amazon the right place to buy them? My box of Mallomars had a pretty rough ride. The chocolate was marred pretty badly and at least one of them was damaged. I don't think the packaging from Nabisco is sufficient for shipping these by UPS or FedEx. I'm sure they do just fine on the regular truck to the grocery store, but freight shipping is a different experience. I'll post a link to a photo so you can see the condition of the contents.<br /><br />It's the cool autumn in Southern California right now, so the contents weren't melted. They would have been badly damaged during the hotter months.<br /><br />So there you have it. It's a treat that a junk food junkie like me can turn his back on. And it's a shopping experience that will probably be disappointing to real fans of this treat. I recommend you pass this item up.<br /><br />Check out the product photo that I posted.  It shows the condition of the cookies when they arrived. 2
Switch Kiwi Berry Soda:<br /><br />First thing you notice is the light pink color of the soda. It is very lightly carbonated as there are almost no bubbles, yet it is carbonated. It has a pleasant aroma, light yet fruity.  Its taste is also light but sweet. Fruity with definite berry overtones.  There is though, a slight metallic aftertaste. It's not overwhelming but I notice it. The can has just over 8 ounces and may not be a large enough serving for those used to 12 ounce cans. I on the other  hand find myself often spilling out a few ounces of soda so there may be less waste overall, for me.  As in the other flavor I sampled (Watermelon Strawberry) Kiwi , Raspberry and Strawberry are mighty low in the list of juices in the soda. Still I find this flavor far more palatable than the other. I give it 4 stars and find it an acceptable fruit soda. 4
Unfortunatly my cat would not eat it, and he is not that picky. I gave almost all the cans to a friends of mine who has 3 cats, she said they would not eat it either. Bad batch? I do not know.... Would not buy it again.... 3
Thought this was grav lox but its really just smoked fish. Tastes awesome but just not what I was expecting. 4
The first box I got of these were great with very fresh tasting nuts; however, the second box was not so fresh and some of the bars had a stale taste.  Nothing worse than a stale nut--can't get that taste out of your mouth.  I guess I'll give it one more try before I cancel my Subscribe & Save for this product. 3
I've tried other tripaks for my 4 oz popper but keep coming back to great northern. I don't mind spending more to get better popcorn but as of yet I haven't found anything that was worth the higher price. The premeasured tri-paks are simple to use and insure a consistent quality. 4
This is real good peanut butter dont get me wrong but dont expect it to taste like the peanut butter you get out of a Reeses cup thats all I'm sayin. I am a "Reese cup freak" people (especially the holiday cups because the peanut butter to chocolate ratio is increased) The Big Cups are awesome too but the chocolate is too thick for me in spots(i know..just how I am)and I love "jar" peanut butter and Reeses in a jar is good but if Reeses was to make the same peanut butter that they make in their cups they would slit their own throat. They sell it because of the name... Resees peanut butter cups are the #1 candybar sold in the world by "almost double" over all other candybars. Their peanut butter filling is a highly guarded secret but it can be duplicated pretty damn close by adding powdered sugar and salt..you gotta experiment with it, give it a few good tries..there ya go people!! 3
These are nutty delicious, and well packaged.  I put a couple tbls in a fruit shake every morning and I get to enjoy the flavor, clean energy and satisfaction of hunger with them.  Thanks hemp. 5
As the title says I'm not a fan of fizzy water and that taste definitely comes through in this drink. The 'tang' of this product assaults your mouth right from the first sip.  It smelled nice. But really it was just so sweet and carbonated that the experience was not enjoyable.  There no discernable taste of kiwi or strawberry, just a blast of sugar and bubbles. The 3 people under 11 in our familiy loved it but - as we knew they would.<br /><br />No thanks. 2
I don't get all the hype over this coffee. Not much of a head on it. Doesn't taste that great. What's the big whoop? 1
This tea has a very fruity taste, with a strong green-tea aftertaste.  It took me a few cups to get used to it -- the taste isn't what I'd imagined.  I like it as a change from my usual teas, though.<br /><br />I find it very good iced. 4
I find this Balsamic vinegar to be great in cooking, salad dressings, and drizzled over fruits, cheeses, and veggies. It has a very good flavor that compliments many dishes. 5
Bought this product from our local Publix where it's often buy 1 get 1 free.<br />We ate it a couple of times and I must saw we did like the taste.<br /><br />One day I tore open the packaging when my son started crying. I went to him and left the packaging on the counter. I came back a minute later and my countertop was crawling with tiny little bugs that could have been mistaken for spices if they weren't moving! I emptied the back in a zip-loc and it was full of these little bugs crawling around. If I would of put the packaging directly in the water i'm sure the bugs would have died instantly in the water.<br /><br />I was completely disgusted and called the company. The woman on the line was completely unfazed saying it seemed that my product was contaminated and that these things happen! Happen to who?!!<br />She continued to say she could send me free boxes or some coupons if I would provide my address.<br />I informed her that the last thing I want is an other box of this stuff in my house and hung up.<br />DO NOT BUY! 1
Got this brand as a gift and it tastes like it's sold door to door by elementary school children. It's cheap and gross. Great packaging--but don't be tricked. This is nasty low quality. 1
These should be called chocolate chocolate covered raisins because there's so much chocolate!  Aside from issues with the seller's shipping policy (they only ship on Mondays and Tuesdays and ONLY after you reply to their e-mail warning of melted product), I am satisfied with my order.  Nothing spectacular beyond the amount of chocolate - they taste just as you would expect.  Would I pay $45 again for chocolate covered raisins?  Perhaps not, but it was an interesting experiment.  See my submitted photos for packaging/product details. 4
Ugh! I really wanted to like these as I love Fruit Roll-Ups, yet wanted something healthy. Well, unfortunately ity wasn't meant to be; these straps are just awful, they have such a bizarre off-putting texture that it makes it possible to enjoy the taste. (Not that the taste is great either.) The name "Leather" is so apropos; this snack is seriously like chewing a belt, although I'm sure some belts have a better taste than these "fruit" bars. 2
Not enough flavor, murky brown color, lacking in aroma. I enjoy other varieties from this line but prefer a different brand of rose hip tea. I'd drink it over regular black tea though. 3
Purchased these for a nice snack while sitting at work. Most office snack-bars and vending machines have candy and chips - which taste great, but aren't exactly great for you.  These little crackers are just as tasty and are healthier than what the vending machine has to offer.  Also, great at parties with meats and cheeses.  And for those that are worried - the garlic flavor is not overpowering, but you definitely know it is there.  Overall a great buy and in the 5-pack option, not a bad deal either. 4
i've never met a dog who didn't devour this food with tail-wagging, tunnel-visioned gusto. it looks like tiny pieces of beef jerky and if you have a picky eater they'll probably be delighted with this food.  it's grain free and super expensive but worth it -- it has helped curb the awful gas of our 13 lb chihuahua/min-pin. as a bonus, his coat is shinier too. (now if we could just make his breath & body odor better).... the only reason i gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the price. 4
This is a very flavorful cookie with a nice texture. It is also low in Carb. I have used the crumbs from these cookes to replace a grahmcracker crust and was extreemly pleased with the results. It is my only "must have in stock" cookee! 5
Your guess is as good as mine regarding what Festival means when they claim that their canned shiitake slices are "Fresh Pack."  On a separate subject:  Unlike MW Polar brand of canned sliced shiitake, Festival brand does not add sesame oil, which would make the mushrooms taste better but at the expense of adding unwanted calories from the "bad" polyunsaturated fatty acid, linoleic acid (omega-6), which is the only kind of polyunsaturated fat contained in sesame oil. 4
I ordered a whole box of 6 cans of the cereal. When I opened the first  one,  only a little more than half of the can is filled with the cereal. Well, I thought I got a lemon. I opened another can, surprise, the similar half full amount. It turned out all 6 cans were just like that. Why would they use such a big can when they only fill half of it?  Although I like the ingredient, I will never buy the brand again. It's not the way to do a honest business. So I am not going to trust its listed nutrition. 1
I was attempting to fill a family member's Christmas request for "Gourmet brand of dark chocolate covered raisins".  I agreed to pay a standard shipping charge of almost 50%.  The product arrived in 6 days in a USPS standard envelope that was badly torn by our postal service.  The raisins, however, were sealed in a clear plastic bag that had not been torn so I concluded they were sanitary.  They looked like large, juicy raisins covered by a smooth coating of very dark chocolate.  There was no documentation whatsoever except the Amazon shipping label. Since I couldn't just wrap a flimsy plastic bag that was supposed to pass as a gourmet product, I went out and got a fancy container that cost almost as much as the raisins.  Unfortunately the container was too small to hold the entire 2 lbs of raisin.  My solution was to open the plastic and fill the container using about 90% of the raisins.  I wrapped the gift and it now sits under the tree.<br /><br />Now, what do you do with the left over raisins?  At least my trouble was to be rewarded by getting to taste the product. The chocolate was delicious.... so was the caramel on the inside.  The problem was that they weren't any raisins at all.  I was all chocolate and caramel.  Anyway, it makes for a good story.  I'm just not sure that I would buy from Marich again. 1
Just got this shake mix and tried it out this morning...Yummy!  Blended with frozen banana, a few strawberries and water it is filling and not too heavy.  It feels healthy even though it is chocolate it is perfect.  Can't wait to try the berry too. 5
My cats love the food, and it's referenced on the list of "Companies that Don't Test on Animals" through the PETA web site. 5
It terms of being a healthy snack these cranberry flax oatmeal squares are great. Each bar has 6g of fiber, 13g of whole grain, no trans fat, 6g of protein, low sodium, all natural and packed with a bunch of vitamins. Plus it says on the package it's proven to help lower cholesterol. But there's one problem - it doesn't taste too good. It tastes like health food. It's like eating chewy and nutritious cardboard. I didn't really like it and probably won't be buying them again. 3
Did not care much for it, it left a gritty coat in my throat and the taste left an aftertaste that was not very pleasant. Cold or hot either way I don't care for it. 2
My daughter who is type 1 diabetic and has Celiac loves these cookies. Have had a hard time finding them in the local health food stores so was so happy to discover them on Amazon so bought 2 cases of them so now there is enough for the whole family. 5
We love these cookies, but not in crumbs.  Unfortunately, the pack of 3 came in crushed.  It would seem we are better off just buying them directly from a local store, instead of through Amazon. 2
I gave this product as a gift to some clients as a change from Dean and DeLuca...not a good idea..<br /><br />My clients loved the gift box, the crackers etc. were very good...BUT, the smoked salmon was not high quality.<br /><br />I would not suggest this item for the food, but the box is nice. 3
This coffee is bold, dark and tasty. unlike many other types that are too watery and weak this one brews nice and strong cup of coffee. 5
I love salted cashew nuts spiced up with cayenne pepper, but this product is way too salty and hot. Cayenne pepper powder and salt lumps were found at the bottom of the canister. The product description says, it has "a hint of pepper," but this is an understatement. I have to say this is not one of the best Emerald products.<br /><br />1. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A137LI">Cashew Party Bag - 5 lbs.</a><br />2. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001689VA">Whole Cashews, Rstd/Salted 8 oz.</a><br />3. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZJOUEI">Snacking Sensations-Almond Brothers Gourmet Nut Tray</a><br />4. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZJN2EW">Pecan Paradise-Almond Brothers Gourmet Pecan Tray</a><br />5.

These chips are nasty.  I thought someone had spilled a drink in the bag, no the chips were just soaked with grease.  Nasty!! 1
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KOUM68">Pioneer Brand Gravy Mix, Country, 2.75-Ounce Packets (Pack of 24)</a><br /><br />I had this gravy  at the Breakfast Buffet in the motel in Branson, MO.<br />Very Good!!! The waitress told me the name, so I looked it up on the Internet and found it at Amazon.  I give it the Excellent Rating 5
First, I do have to say that this juice does NOT look like the picture: it's grayer and more translucent, even after shaking to redistribute the pulp. It won't make pretty mixed drinks. But it is - HANDS DOWN - the *best* tasting pineapple juice I have ever had. And the fact that it's organic and ALL juice, no concentrate or water hijinks, makes me even happier! I will be drinking this juice as long as they keep making it. 5
I Love this brand....and please tell EVERYONE you know...Hemp oil is sooooo beneficial for you...do your research...you will understand that getting 3 Omegas and some 5
A well-balanced taste - not too sweet, not too strong. A very pleasant addition to the light, carbonated fruit drinks but nothing to particularly set it apart. 2
I purchased this product over a year ago, and the best I can say is this is an ok product for me, but could be perfect for you.<br /><br />I used to always reach up to the top shelf, grab my box of k-cups, sift through them to find what I wanted, and then make my coffee. I tried to use the wooden box, but when you can only hold 20, and you use multiple k-cups per day, I just felt like I was always filling it, and didnt have enough room for variety.<br /><br />I bought this thinking it was perfect, holding 36 cups should last me a few weeks minimum. The Keurig would sit right on top and take up less room. What more could I ask for? Then when I brought it home though the truth came out.<br /><br />The draw is very well made and works perfect. However you are adding about 3 inches to the size of the keurig. Due to the height of my cabinets, it raised the machine just enough to not longer be able to open enough because the handle hits the cabinet. For a few days I was pulling it out and using it like that, but that got too annoying. Instead I now use the draw, but not with my coffee maker on it. It now holds my knife block instead, since those can still come out just fine.<br /><br />If your keurig is set up with no cabinet above it, this option is beyond perfect. However for me, I feel like it just added a bit of clutter, but I am willing to deal with it for the convience of the drawer. 3
Nothing wrong with the product, but I sure had to mix it with *lots* of other ingredients to make it edible to me. (In Texas I was called a "baby-mouth" - not into very spicy-hot foods.)<br /><br />For comparison, I'm comfortable with Tostitos medium chunky salsa. 1 can of this milder Rotel, mixed with 2 slightly larger cans of diced tomatoes, was still way too hot for me to use as salsa for chips. I used some of this to make a sort of southwestern cornbread that was good though. 3
The description did not indicate the size of the beans.  I was hoping they were small but they turned out to be very very large.  Not sure how to use these. 2
These taste okay, but have a really ridiculous amount of sugar. I guess they are meant to appeal to the masses who care not of things like weight gain and diabetes. Eat 1.5 bars and it'll have your head spinning. 1
These bars are a perfect, healthy snack for satisying a sweet tooth. They're moisty, chewy, and just sweet enough. They don't contain corn syrup and you won't miss the wheat or dairy. 5
Easy to use and saves money. Gives you control on the strength of your coffee. I will purchase them again. 5
I have small dogs and one of these treats is far too large for them.  Plus the one smaller dog doesn't have the jaws to even break through these since they are too hard.  We broke some apart by banging on it with a the end of scissors and they seemed to really like the taste.  But they are too much work to purchase again. I am happy that they seemed to love a low fat treat - but if you have small dogs - you may want to get these instead:  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004B9CH4S">Old Mother Hubbard Mother's Solutions Snacks for Dogs Soft and Chewy 5 Calorie, 6-Ounce Pouch</a> 3
When I received this, I wanted to look at the ingredients.  They're not listed on the packet, so I went to the company's website.  The ingredients are ginger, glucose, sucrose, honey, fructose, and natural lemon flavor.<br /><br />I was crestfallen.  With the exception of hot chocolate or a chai latte, I don't like sweetened drinks at all.  I love sweet foods, but not sweet beverages.  Once, in a restaurant, I was served sweetened ice tea.  I didn't know it had sugar in it, and I nearly spit it out on the table.  In a word, yuck!  So I wasn't looking forward to trying this.<br /><br />But I did, after dinner.  I heated some water and stirred in the mix.  It was fabulous!  Despite all the sugar it wasn't cloyingly sweet, and the ginger left a warm, tingly aftertaste.  It was so delectable, I barely restrained myself from drinking it all up.  I wanted to see what it tasted like cold, so I grudgingly put the remainder in the fridge.  Cold, I still got the gingery-ness, but the beverage tasted flat.  I don't recommend it cold.<br /><br />It's hard to believe I enjoyed a sweetened, instant hot drink, but I surely did.  If you enjoy sweet and spicy hot beverages, you'll like it too. 4
I'm not sure I like pepperoni in the bites size.  My dogs love them!!! They sure smell better than the pupperoni dog treats!!  I think I prefer slices of pepperoni. 4
I'm a sucker for caramel anything.........love the flavor, the aroma, and most important the taste.  I honestly do not like flavored coffees in the morning, but I have made an exception for this one! 5
I like to make this when I make chicken fajitas or dirty rice, it is a nice compliment and does not dry out as much as Jiffy's corn muffin mix (which I used to use). This packet, water, half a stick of butter and a can of creamed corn is all it takes, then bake for 45 minutes. It is moist and sweet, it does not last long in my house! 5
This is the best tasting cereal I have ever had in my entire life!  We eat it nearly every day for breakfast, usually adding a half a banana and some chopped up walnuts.  Some of my family even put blueberries on it!  I would never do that!  I occasionally buy it at Sam's or Costco (usually while traveling) but it ends up cheaper here at Amazon, especially with the wonderful Subscribe and Save option.  My shipments magically arrive!  One thing to note - you must keep your granola refrigerated to make it last - especially if you buy this 6 pack!  The oils will go rancid if you store it in a warm location.  This goes for nuts and seeds too! 5
This gizmo is HUGE!  If it weren't so much trouble I'd send it back.  Looks like a great product for a St. Bernard, but for my 13-pound Shih Tzu it's overkill.  There may be a smaller version, but I can only imagine what the hard plastic would sound like on my tile floors! 2
I liked it but I didn't love it. It didn't have a strong flavor and it didn't seem rich. I usually drink Starbucks decaf French Roast and compared to this it seemed somewhat bland. But it wasn't bitter, and I could definitely tell it was low-acid, which is a great idea. I hope this company will keep trying to make some improvements to the formula, to give it more flavor. I very much appreciate their efforts. Mary Lee Moser, author, There and Back: A Journal Companion for Special Needs Parents. 3
This espresso was broken when we received it. This machine is Not worth the money. It is plastic and cheap. 1
I wanted something that was healthy, low in sugars, and high in fiber. I think these bars fit the bill. They are a little dry and some people may not find them sweet enough, but I am totally fine with that because I'm more concerned about added sugars and over-processed grains in other granola bars. I was happy with my purchase and I was surprised how compact the packaging was too! It made storing these bars easier in my tiny kitchen. 4
Having grown up on Oreos I found that I love the taste of these, but the filling is lacking.<br />Whereas Oreos filling comes close to the sides of the cookie, these don't. 3
This cereal reminded me a lot of Quaker's Oh's.  It's a lot lighter and less substantial than Oh's, however, and has a weird aftertaste (a bad aftertaste).  The cereal is made with rice and corn instead of wheat, so it doesn't really make you feel full.  The roasted nut and honey taste is somehow adulterated so that it simply does not taste good in your mouth.  Calorically speaking, the folks at Kellogg's did a good job, and the cereal makes a better study snack than breakfast cereal, if not for the horrible aftertaste.<br /><br />Steer clear of this product.  Check out Quaker's Oh's instead.<br /><br />Even if you're on a diet, there is no need to torture yourself with unfilling food that tastes bad.<br /><br />One star. 1
I'm on a low sodium diet and this still has plenty of taste without salt 5
we bought this based on what Amazon mentioned in its product description which says 100 calorie pack but this is not 100 cal pack they are infact 250 calorie pack.Nothing wrong with the item as such and not that I'm going to return it but I would prefer a 100 cal pack over a 250 cal pack. Amazon please correct the prod description. 4
This Honey Granules is tasty and a welcome alternative to Cane Sugar. I use it in my morning oats (steel cut oats), Bird's custard and Tea. One or two teaspoonfuls go a long way. It is better stored in the refrigerator. Consider it in place of over-processed store bought cane sugar. 5
Illy Caffe is a lot like the premade iced tea, it's okay but not special.<br />The taste is fine, it's coffee and sugar, pour it over ice and you have iced coffee.  I get coffee drinks, the cappuccino by Illy is really good, or the starbucks, but this is very plain and at roughly two dollars a can it's not any cheaper than a small coffee out somewhere. The can is small, the calorie count is 50, the taste really standard. Anyone with some instant coffee, sugar, and ice could make this easily. I don't even see it as being a matter of giving up taste for convenience, as it's not a "fancy" drink. 3
This product wad very weak! I couldn't even make out that it was supposed to be hot chocolate. Will never buy again a waste of money! 3
I am doing the Atkins program for weight loss, and I was missing crunchy, crispy things. Celery just doesn't get it. Our local stores don't regularly carry pork rinds, so I was feeling a little bit left out.<br /><br />But, the Lowry's brand is one I am familiar with and so, I was pretty confident I would like them. They don't pop like popcorn; in fact, they don't make much noise at all when they are cooking. I've found that one minute forty eight seconds seems to be the best time to get the most edible rinds. BUT....one can also reheat the unpopped rinds and a lot of them will then puff up.<br /><br />Enjoy...they are worth it. 4
I love sourdough bread and wanted to make my own.  I followed the directions exactly for a number of weeks and ended up with basically nothing.<br />I would not recommend this product. 2
It's difficult to fairly evaluate when the product arrives in bad condition. The celophane bag seemed intact, but the cookies inside were crushed. The chocolate coating was discolored and the cookies were broken and tasted stale. 1
I wanted to use this as an alternative to a Kong, to fill with lunch for my dog on days when she would be alone all day while I was at work, and my husband was out of town. The product arrived with a rubber "rope" with a ball-like bulge on the outside, and a cone-shaped plug on the inside, rather than the actual rope pictured on the page. For the first 3 days, it was wonderful. She was very excited and interested in how it worked, and it seemed to keep her occupied. On the fourth day, when I got home, I saw her chewing on the little ball-like bulge, which she had handily chewed off of the rubber "rope". I worry that she would be able to chew off other pieces, and that she could choke on a lump of rubber that size, so I haven't used the product since then. Too bad, because it seemed neat. I would only recommend this product if your dog is a VERY weak chewer. 2
I thought this would be a great decaf option, but the flavor is a lot milder than expected. I use a bit more than the recommended amount to coax more intense flavor. A bit better than instant for late night sippers like me. 3
I have tried many different protein powders over the years, and while it is hard to write a review based on taste alone (since everyone's taste is different), I'm going to go ahead and say this is the most rancid tasting gunk I have ever had the displeasure of putting in my mouth.<br /><br />I mix my protein shakes with a hand blender, so I rarely have any mixing problems - and even this protein mixed well.  The fun really began when I tasted it.  It tastes sour and acrid at the same time, absolutely horrendous.  I could not finish the shake I had mixed up, and had to wash my mouth out with apple juice to get that sick taste out before I could actually eat or drink anything else.<br /><br />This is a terrible protein powder from the standpoint of taste, in my opinion.  Of all the types I have tried, which is many, this has taken seat as the new "worst" one.<br /><br />FYI, I had ordered this with another brand because I am testing egg protein powders due to casein sensitivity.  If anyone has an egg protein powder recommendation, PM me. 1
Are these people crazy or can I not multiple properly? This is $43 for 24 small cups of peaches.  That works out to $7 for the 4 pack.  This 4 pack cost about $3.50 in a grocery store in the states but because I'm deployed I'm suppose to pay $7 for it?! Not happening. Netgrocer.com is $4.00; higher than a grocercy store, but cheaper than this! 1
If you are looking for proper nutrition cereal. This one is the best, period.  Low sugar and calorie. High fiber and protein.  What more can one ask for.  Add low fat milk and some frozen fruit and you have a perfect breakfast.  I wish I could buy it in bulk. 5
I bought this product based off reviews saying it tastes great and I was extremely disappointed. As soon as I started steeping it this smell filled my kitchen (my daughter even asked what the horrible smell was). Sadly, it was this tea. I tried it and it tastes like sweaty socks also. It is so gross. I have tried adding honey, drinking it cold, drinking it hot, etc and they all taste horrible. As far as a diet aid, I don't think so. I guess if you had a lot of excrement in you, possibly. I even doubled the suggested amount and I still did not anything happen (and no, I was not on the toilet a lot either). All in all, this product was a big thumbs down to me. 1
I decided to try this because our grocery store was having a decent sale, but I am skeptical of Ready to Eat meals and doubly so of this brand because of my experience with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V1AWBK">Kitchens Of India Curry Paste For Vegetable Biryani, 3.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>. Although this wasn't as spicy as the Curry paste, it still had a bit too much heat for me. I think I may be getting more sensitive to hot, spicy foods in my old age.<br />There was only about 3 pieces of cashews and of paneer. Both were soggy and the paneer was tiny and had a spongy texture that was pleasant. The flavor wasn't too bad but it certainly paled in comparison to many restaurants I have experienced. 3
I've tried several brands of these and these are probably my favorite in terms of crispiness and salt content, but I'd hesitate to call them spicy and the price is just outrageous.  The packets are each very small and difficult to separate unless you want to cut them apart with scissors. But still, very tasty. 3
This product is east to prepare, but it's very bland and flavorless. It doesn't taste like any Indian food that I have had, it's missing the spices and the "kick". I tried adding my own ingredients to it (chicken, vegetables, spices) but it just diluted the flavor even more. 2
My puppy just preferred to eat the toy than the treats. My older dogs were curious but did not do any thing. However the red plastic is pretty stong. My dog has been chewing on it for a few days. So if anything it gives your dog something to chew on other than your shoes. 1
This is the second, and last, time I will buy coffee from amazon.com.  The first time, I received a bag of coffee that had been out of date for months.  This time, it's still stale, but without a use-by date on the bag.  So much for trying to save some money and time.  I'll go back to making the trek to Whole Foods. 2
These cook up a little fast and so you have to be careful not to over cook them.  Other than that, they taste great and are very good for you.  Win-win! 4
When I saw all those chocolate chunks in Back To Natures Granola I got a little too excited.  I love me some chocolate and when it is in granola I can only imagine the orgasmic experience in my mouth.  I am sad to report that no orgasmic experience was to be had.  Upon first bite I noticed a great crunch but the flavor of the granola by itself almost had a raw taste to it, like a raw flour/oat taste and it was very off putting. Not at all sweet and that could be a plus for someone who is trying to not eat too much sugar but I need my granola to have some sort of sweetness to it which this granola did not have.  I had some of the chocolate in the mix and that by itself was very delicious but not worth the cost of the granola, will just get a chocolate bar.  I much prefer the Love Crunch Granola By Natures Path, that is absolutly scrumptious and has the perfect amount of chocolate flavor and pieces along with freeze dried berries, plus it is all organic.  So if you are looking for a nice flavorful granola that has nice chocolate goodness look elsewhere because you will not get that with this granola. 2
i am constantly adding baby food to regular food [pumpkin, sweet potato into pancake mix; carrot, tomato, greens into spaghetti sauce; etc..].  so when i saw these i thought it would be a cool mix in without changing the consistency.<br /><br />tried the sweet potato into our pancake mix.  i couldn't taste them, nor did it change the color of the mix.  which for most older kids probably would be great.  however, my toddler calls them "orange pancakes," so we ended up dumping in a jar of sweet potatoes anyway to make them orange.<br /><br />also added the carrots to a 4 cheese noodles i made.  it colored them great and you couldn't taste the carrots.  so if you are trying to be sneaky, then these will work, it's a very, very small amount of powder, so it'll boost the nutrition without being detected.  with that said...<br /><br />in wegmans where i live, they were 1.10 a pouch.  i didn't think that was bad considering the organic packets  [plum/happybaby] are anywhere from 1.00-1.50.  EXCEPT, that nurturme is equivalent to a 2.5 ounce jar, NOT the typical FOUR oz!  this is equal to those 1st stage baby food jars that are tiny.  their picture seems a little deceptive, because i think when most people see a pic of a baby food jar they think of the normal size ones- not the tiny ones.<br /><br />so in the end, you are paying more and getting less.<br /><br />like i said, i didn't buy these to mix up and feed my baby, i just wanted to try as a mix in.  in all, i think it's a cool concept, but as for paying double for the same product, ehh dunno.  might buy a pack and use it here and there as a mix in. 3
Be careful buying falafel, i made the mistake of buying a different brand that required you to let the mix soak in water for an hour.  This stuff only takes like 5 min and tastes great! 4
I didn't know quite what to think about this dog treat & neither did our Bichon, Biscuit, or our golden Retriever, DJ.  It is exactly like a roller ball on a deodorant bottle.  The dogs have to lick and roll the ball to get the flavor or treat.  DJ finally caught on though it took several licks to get the flavor flowing.  Biscuit still hasn't gotten the hang of licking to roll the ball.  Instead of licking the ball he tries to chew it.  He would get very frustrated when he would get a taste of the gravy, but couldn't lick hard enough to turn the ball.  He finally gave up on it & asked for another kind of treat.  DJ loves it but thought only 20 or so licks wasn't enough & also asked for something more substantial.  I guess it would be good as a treat when training a dog to do tricks or potty train.  It would be a nice reinforcement.  I also like giving the dogs a treat to keep them busy for a while, but this treat takes up my time, as I have to hold it.  I will stick to buying biscuits or other type treats. 3
These little gems are only 20 calories each and almost fat free, and taste way better than a rice cake, IMHO.  I'm glad they come in packs of 10 boxes because otherwise the husband and kids would eat them all and there'd be none left for me! 5
I love Kettle Brand Chips!<br />I've been in love with the Honey Dijon for years and decided to try out their other flavors.<br /><br />Sea Salt & Vinegar Chips are TANGY, SOUR, and make my lips pucker when I eat too many at a time.  I got 12 big bags for a steal from amazon ($11 WHAT?!?).<br /><br />Personally, the flavor is too much for me, but my mom & aunt LOVE them and they hate potato chips. 4
The best thing that I look foreward to every morning . It makes my day ,the best tasting coffee ever 5
I like Rice Dream. This, however, is too high a price for too small a container. Smaller containers waste more packaging materials per ounce of product too! 1
I've tried three varieties of this tea and love it.  I can't say I've noticed extreme or convincing results of it improving my skin (I haven't finished the tin yet), but every type I've tried is delicious.  Very flavorful teas, which is perfect for me, someone who loves tea but get bored easily with standard types. 4
This product is not a soda but a carbonated juice. This soda has a nice taste- its not as sweet and as pure orange-tasting as typical orange soda-like drinks. It's not pure orange juice- but made up of a mixture of several different juices including apple, orange, grape and tangerine.  That juice blend gives it a slightly tangy taste that is actually at first slightly surprising and mostly refreshing.  The carbonation also seems lighter to me than soda but it is definitely there.<br /><br />The things I like about this product are the smaller can size (8.3oz)which makes it a more appropriate serving that a regular soda.  I also like the bright packaging and the pleasant taste.  After reading the ingredients of SWITCH carefully- I see that it is all juice just as it claims- so its probably a better choice than a regular soda.<br /><br />This product has no added sugars just as advertised on the can- but buyer beware- its still kind of high in sugar because fruit juices are naturally high in sugar. As always be sure to read the label if you are concerned about sugar levels.<br /><br />Overall I think this product is a good size and has a pleasant taste- especially if you are looking for something that tastes like an orange juice blend.  Traditional orange soda fans might be slightly disappointed in the taste. 3
I ordered this for my 15-lb Jack Russell. We got the stegosaurus toy and so far, it's held up. She's a ferocious chewer--we can't buy her anything but Nylabone-type toys or they immediately get torn to bits. The only problem I foresee is that the stegosaurus has four legs sticking off of the body, and I know those are going to get worn down very quickly as she can fit that whole part in her mouth at once, meaning she can't play with this unless we're there to see her least she chew off a leg and choke on it. It would've been nice to be able to have seen this variety and choose which one we wanted prior to ordering. I was thinking we would get the T-Rex pictured, which only has two feet that seem to be attached to the tail. The good news is, steggie doesn't have a small projectile head or tail, but rather it curves to give the impression of head and tail, so no worries about small pieces coming off there. The toy itself I would probably give 3.5 or 4 stars, but I am only giving it an overall 3 because the ordering process is inflexible.<br /><br />UPDATE: I have lowered my rating to 2 stars. She has had this less than 5 months and I had to take it away from her after she managed to chew away the legs, tail, head, and half the body. I don't mind if she ingests tiny shreds of a Nylabone on occasion, but I can't imagine eating 4 ounces of plastic is doing anyone's digestive tract any favors. 2
Bisquick GF is easy to use. Pancakes and muffins are very<br />tasty. The product is quick and easy to use. It makes my day.  Gram 1
I recently bought a 50 pack of the Tully's Italian Roast K-cups and could not be more pleased w/ my purchased...all of the cups were intact, none were damaged and I have yet to experience any of them exploding in the Keurig machine.<br /><br />Shipping was rather quick and yes, they did come in a box, they were not in any type of holder inside the box but that was not an issue.<br /><br />For the $$$ I paid I found this purchase to be a very good value.<br /><br />My recommendation, buy this and enjoy great tasting coffee from your Keurig. 4
I am only drinking it, so it won't be wasted, and I have to rotate it with a Coffee People product, so I remember why I like coffee.  It is really wan. The strongest flavor profile is tin.  I love creme caramel and am a huge WP fan, but the flavor strenth and consistancy of this coffee does not impress. Choose another - you won't be sorry you did. 1
If you are a Kona drinker you know there's a shortage now and has been since 2010.  Many of us have switched to blends and save our loved and expensive 100% Kona for special occasions.  This year even the 10% Kona blend I've been drinking for everyday coffee ran out, so I'm trying to find a substitute.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good Kona blend, this is not it.<br /><br />Not to say that's it is bad coffee.  It is fine as a light tasting cup of joe.  I actually enjoy it as an afternoon coffee.  It is mild with a small hint of sweetness, but no floral tones.  Although a nice, mild cup of coffee, it simply does not taste like Kona.  It tastes like a light roast of quality Colombian or maybe R&eacute;union - ie, good quality, but inexpensive and common.<br /><br />If any Kona beans really are blended in, they're so watered down as to be non-existent. 2
These cute little donuts are tempting.  You see the brown chocolate frosting and think, These have got to be GREAT!  However, prepare for at least some disappointment.  They are waxy, dry, not very chocolatey.  However, they are donuts.  And for that, they get two stars... 2
My dog adores these chews.  They are long lasting, don't splinter, don't stain carpeting or furniture, etc.<br /><br />The price here is much better than at my local high-end dog boutique, but I ordered 4 of the medium-dog-sized chews and they substituted 4 large-dog-sized chews instead.  They are too big for my pup :( 2
I'm not the hugest fan of the original fig Newtons so I was surprised to find that I actually liked these a little better. The texture is nice, and the little fig bits are tasty. But overall these cookies are sort of bland and not very interesting, and they leave a bit of a chemical aftertaste that is really annoying. I'd eat them if I was stuck somewhere and they were the best choice, but I would not buy them for myself. 3
You know when you see Velveeta that your getting a thick and cheesy flavor.  Velveeta appears to be branching out from the mac & cheese business for a stab at, well, Hamburger Helper.  The price point is great.  The preparation is easy and quick, but the final product falls short of expectations.  The hamburger flavoring dominated the meal.  The thick gooey Velveeta cheese gets quickly eaten up by any excess water in the pan making it thin and runny.  The taste was good, but not the thick, cheesy goodness that I expected. 2
A month ago I paid $9.88 with discount, and now it's almost doubled. I don't know what<br />game Amazon is playing, but the new price make no sense.<br />If you are using "subscribe & ship" like I was, you better cancel your subscription.<br />You can't just rely on a great price with maybe incremental increases.<br />I never thought I would say this about Amazon, but "buyer beware!" 1
I bought this for my 6 month old lab puppy. He figured out how to get the treats and it was his favorite entertainment. However, he swung it around from the rope (it's made to do that) and within weeks had broken the plastic top by hitting it against the floor so it could no longer be used. For a $20 item, I expect longer use, and to have plastic shards around a puppy is just dangerous! Great toy/food dspenser in thoery, but just too fragile! 2
I'm happy to hear that others are having good luck with this product.  Unfortunately, our experience has not been quite as positive.<br /><br />First, I was a bit disappointed at the construction.  For this price point I would have expected something other than flimsy plastic.<br /><br />Second, within a month of buying the door the retractable plastic piece started randomly going up and down.  I called their customer service department to inquire.  The rep described it as a known issue.  The solution was to disable the auto-retract safety feature.  I asked when a permanent fix was forthcoming and she told me that disabling the safety feature WAS the fix.  Baffled, I asked if she thought that was a good solution.  She told me I could return the product for a refund if I wanted to (after having cut a hole in the side of my house) in that pseudo-polite, passive-aggressive manner that makes me want to rub broken glass in my eyes.  I hope that she was simply someone who needs to be fired rather than a typical representation of the company.<br /><br />Third, as others have noted,the collar and "fob" are extraordinarily flimsy.  My standard poodle destroyed hers within a few weeks.  Compared to other dogs, she is very gentle so I was surprised when it just fell apart.  I was able to click it back together a few times and get it working, but this last time I saw some sort of yellow-ish corrosive looking goo inside it.  My wife called their customer service and they are sending a replacement.  Meanwhile,the poor dog is very confused.  :)<br /><br />Fourth, the fob is NOT directional.  We have fought with sensitivity settings until we are cross-eyed and whenever the dog is close to the door, it opens.<br /><br />Had we paid $50 or $75 for this product I wouldn't have even bothered with this review.  But, at ~$400.00 (including wall extension, extra batteries, shipping, etc) I am fairly disappointed.<br /><br />I hope others find this helpful. 1
This product was so misrepresented that I no longer use Amazon as my first choice when I'm looking for a product.  I ended up spending my gift certificate and was totally ripped off for 3 packs of nuts that I can purchase in a store for $5.  Don't be fooled by this product no matter how they try to dress it up. 1
I love this coffee! Like the other reviewers, I took a trip to Costa Rica and was immediately addicted to this bold, flavorful coffee. I am a cover lover and have tried many different brands only to find that Britt is hands-down the best I've ever had. I brought back one bag from Costa Rica and have started ordering my supply because I can't go back to other bland store-bought coffees. Definitely worth a try! You won't be disappointed. 5
You get what you pay for with these. We ordered them for our wedding but it was too late to order anything else once we saw the quality.  These are not nice like the ones you normally see in stores like Cracker Barrel.  They're a little smaller and not all are a uniform thickness or length.  I didn't taste any, but they did smell fruity.  I would not buy these again. 2
this black licorice has great flavor and texture. Some are too soft and too sweet for me. Personal preference I'm sure, but I like this because it's slightly firm (not hard but not soft) and the sweetness is just right. Love that it's only 4 ingredients: molasses, wheat flour, licorice extract and aniseed oil. Price is good too. Compares to Tire Tread Licorice which is my first choice but I can't find it. 5
It's very difficult to review a food item, because taste is so tremendously subjective.  I liked the combination of sea salt and pepper; the nuts were salty without being too salty, and the pepper was just enough to be noticeable without being overpowering.  My wife thought that the sea salt and pepper would be better on a chip or something crunchier, and that the texture of the nut was jarring in combination with the seasoning.  In general, I think these are tasty nuts, and while I don't think I'd be inclined to eat these regularly, I enjoyed them.  Cashew purists who are looking for a pure expression of cashew flavor (which I love myself) are advised to stick with good old regular roasted cashews, however. 4
As I said in a recent review for the larger Celebrate with a Crowd offering from ig4U, you start with a deep and attractive basket, then fill it (above a buffer) with a variety of tasty and unusual treats ranging from hard pretzels, to delicate truffles, imported sandwich cookies, unusual grain mustard, and number of other welcome surprises, and you have this well-stocked gift basket.  "Celebrate with a Friends" is a good size for a small(ish) family or modest group of friends.<br /><br />The contents are attractively arranged, in many cases they've got their own printed boxes as a presentation/organizational layer with the original wrapping underneath (which is to say that you may open a box that indicates pretzels to find a bag of pretzels within).  The basket is no Longaberger, but the one I received was of a relatively high quality construction level and was genuinely handsome.  The whole package is wrapped in plastic and then a rich brown ribbon with a card -- all in all you're left with a gift that is likely to give the impression that you spent more than you may have.<br /><br />I was pleased with the basket, delighted to discover some new treats with which I was previously unfamiliar, and in general found myself very happy with what I received.  It's worth noting that some of the exceptionally poor reviews below are entirely accurate and not at odds with my own experience -- indeed, even the harshest echo my own feelings about the product as it was represented in prototype in late October.  Without speaking for the company, my understanding is that many of us received prototype packages that saw the aforementioned original packaging represented by things like empty individual serving cereal boxes wrapped in inkjet printer paper.  The end result was, as one reviewer put it, sort of creepy.  The company replaced these prototypes with their final version, and I have gone from seeing this as a 1-star product worth (as others have) warning prospective buyers away, to feeling like they really represent a fine value.  I would have no problem whatsoever buying one of these as a gift for a group of friends.  So my review is based on the 'final' version of the product as it was received in late Nov/early Dec 2011, and not upon the late Oct prototype received.  I only make this distinction for the sake of browsers being able to consider the totality of the currently available reviews, putting the product change timeline into perspective. 4
We purchased an assorted package of K-Cups (by various makers) and of all the coffees THIS is my FAVE!  I really can't see any reason to ever taste-test another flavor!  It smells delicious and TASTES DELICIOUS too!! 5
My husband (who, being Mexican, is very picky about his tortilla chips) and I absolutely love these!  The texture is light and crispy, rather than thick and crunchy. He actually usually prefers a very hearty, cruncy chip (Like El Ranchero), but the flavor of these is so fantastic that we're both thilled with them. The bean, rice and corn base makes them incredibly flavorful, and they have a touch of onion and garlic in addition to that. We go through an embarrassing amount of them.  I never, ever like plain chips, but these I can eat without anything else, although they're particularly amazing with a fresh salsa.  I highly recommend these! 5
I love chips and can easily go through an entire bag in one sitting. With Popchips single serve pouches, I can now feel good about snacking as each bag is only 100 calories. The single serve pouches also help in portion control. The larger bags are a slightly better value, but unless you have astounding self control, I would recommend the single serving option. They are that good! They easily stand up to any of the traditional fried chips I've ever had, and at half the fat and calories, how could you ask for anything more?<br /><br />The variety pack comes in 6 flavors: Original, Sour Cream and Onion, Salt and Pepper, Cheddar, Salt and Vinegar, and BBQ. My favorite flavors are Salt and Pepper and Cheddar. My least favorite is Salt and Vinegar, but I don't like ANY salt and vinegar flavored chip. My only wish is that this variety pack contained the Parmesan Garlic flavor which is VERY good, but extremely hard to find in local stores. I have ordered the Parmesan Garlic flavor in a 24 pack here on Amazon, but prefer the assortment that comes in the variety pack.<br /><br />At ~$17 after the subscribe and save discount, each bag costs only 70 cents. This is a bargain for these great tasting, healthy chips and I highly recommend you try them! 5
This vinegar is too sweet.<br />It tastes and smells more like wine than vinegar.<br />Maybe this is how all merlot vinegar is like, but personally I am disappointed. 2
This is a great product, we have made custard with it for years and it always makes great custard. We will purchase this product again. Amazon does a great job of getting us our purchases fast and without damage. 5
taste is not like other pork rinds.  but does not taste bad.  when you microwave them, the bag only pops up about half way.  when its done popping and you eat them immediately, they are pretty hot and seem to melt in your mouth.  needing much water and a brushing to get the rinds and the taste out of your mouth afterwards.  I think the idea is pretty good, but the product did not turn out how they expected in my opinion. 3
I chose this product because of the great reviews but is not as good as I tought, it's just OK. 3
my kids prefer the banana to the blueberry variety which is fine by me since these are usually a dollar or 2 cheaper. Perfect for snacks, car trips, and just about anything else you can think of. Extremely convenient lid keeps them fresh. Cannot say enough good things about these! 5
I thought these were going to be sliced sweet potato's, but they are not part of the ingredients. It's actually sweet potato flour. In addition, there is rice flour and corn flour mixed in. I think the taste of the corn flour overpowers the sweet potato flavor. Overall, the chips taste like salty corn flakes with a hint of sweet potato.  Overall, probably fairly healthy for what they are (low in fat), but short on taste. If you are not expecting a strong sweet potato flavor, then these may be a good choice for you. 3
I like Shin noodle better. it's more delicious than this one. You don't really see kimchi and the flavor is plain, not hot for me 3
I've order the Seasame Blues before and thought they were great. The 7.5 ounce bags are round compared to the triangles. When you open the bag you get a strong odor of bad oil. The taste also has the bad oil to it. Unfortunately I sent a box to my sister after bragging about them. I called company but no word yet. 1
I wish I could give the same review as previous reviewers, but my cat refuses to eat this food, which is strange because she eats just about anything. I was also disappointed by the way Amazon packed this products. When I received the box, the bag with the food was opened and about half of it was spilled inside the box where I also had books. Maybe that's why my cat won't eat it? 2
i own a bar and this product, along with the regular rinds, is a very good seller. keeps customer at the bar for snacks plus puts something in their stomach for the liquor. 5
This product is bad. I ordered 3 cases of this without knowing about it and it turned out to be the worst coconut water I ever tasted. The water was sour and every single person i know who tasted this didnt like it. Amazon gave me an amazing customer service by refunding me the entire purchase price. Except for amazon's customer service do not get this. 1
My dog LOVES these, but he throws up a few hours after eating them.  I thought his system just needed a little time to get used to them, so I kept giving them to him every couple of days.  I was so excited about these because they're veggie, but I don't think I'll be buying them again.  :o( 3
I ordered this not completely paying attention so I was a little caught off guard by the heavy citrus overtones.  It was not the traditional earl grey I had anticipated.  With that said, it is different but good.  I don't think that I will be buying it again as I feel the citrus takes over a bit more than I would like and I am a bit of a purist when it comes to my earl grey. 4
I recently tried this flavor/brand and was surprised at how delicious these chips are.  The best thing was that there were a lot of "brown" chips in the bsg (my favorite), so I bought some more through amazon and shared with family and friends.  I am a little disappointed that there are not, so far, very many brown chips in these bags, but the flavor is still very good.  I like them better than the yogurt and green onion flavor because they do not seem to be as salty, and the onion flavor is better.  If you haven't eaten Kettle chips before, I recommend that you try a bag before buying bulk.  They are thicker and crunchier than Lays but just as fresh out of the bag. 4
Normally, I have no qualms about ordering from AMAZON ... but, not this time.  I specifically wanted Fancy Feast with the Liver flavored food; because, I'm unable to find it in my area. I also had ordered the brown box of food, which again, was the type that I am unable to buy in my area.  Instead, they sent me what they wanted me to have - WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!! What they sent, I could have easily bought at Sam's for a much cheaper price and more cans in the box; i.e., 36 cans for $16.00 ... but, I wanted to try these new flavors for my 3 wonderful children who love their Fancy Feast ... I'll keep what I have but will NOT consider ordering cat food again from AMAZON ... 2
The tea is Ok but if you like your tea strong or with a dash of milk, this is not the best! 3
I love dark chocolate but sometimes the bitterness is a bit much. Newman's Own had a nice balance and flavor. I love the Newman's Own brand and their commitment to raising money for charity and using Organic ingredients. I'll happily be buying this product again. Highly recommended! 4
The Healthy 'n Fit egg protein is a very good product. It's almost all protein, the taste is good, you can cook with it (my favorites are oatmeal and Russian-style cottage cheese pancakes). And the price *used* to be great, even cheaper per ounce than the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GIST86">Optimum Nutrition 100% Egg Protein, Rich Chocolate, 2 Pound</a>. However, since I bought my first tub earlier this year, the price jumped significantly to more than the Optimum Nutrition chocolate-flavored egg protein, so I bought a 2-lb. tub of that. I found that while the ON protein has a little fat and more carbs in it, it was much easier to mix into liquids with fewer or no clumps, unlike the Healthy 'n Fit product. I also like the taste just fine. So I found that I enjoy my shakes with the ON more, and it's faster and easier to mix my oatmeal in the morning with the ON.<br /><br />Please don't get me wrong -- this is a great product. But I just don't think it warrants a higher price than the Optimum Nutrition protein.<br /><br />So, to recap, as compared to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GIST86">Optimum Nutrition 100% Egg Protein, Rich Chocolate, 2 Pound</a>:<br />Pros:<br />Lower in carbs<br />Lower in fat<br /><br />Cons:<br />More expensive<br />Clumpier/harder to mix 4
I WAS VERY EXCITED TO GET THIS THEN I HAD A CUP, I NEVER MADE IT THRU THE CUP...<br />IT IS SO SWEET IT IS SICKENING REALLY, NOW I HAVE TO FIND FAMILY TO PAWN THIS STUFF ONTO<br />AND CHRISTMAS IS A LONG WAY OFF...LOL 3
Twinings blend of Ceylon and Indian tea produces that more traditional hearty aroma and pungent flavor. In non tea terms that means that it has the ideal combination of briskness, brightness, strength and flavor. Normally I wouldn't attribute these things to a canned tea that has been processed and sat in warehouses, trucks, and stores for long periods of time. Yet Twinings seems to hold up well. I love tea, would drink 24/7 if possible, and more often than not there are only three brands that sit on my shelf in any consistent manner and Twinings is definetly one of them. 4
I did like you probably did: read all the healthiness (gluten free, etc) and translated it to be 'tasteless yuck'. And then I opened one bar and looked at how...small it seemed and felt robbed.<br /><br />I have never been quite so happy to be wrong!<br /><br />These things are small because they are rich, dense and amazing and the taste is absolutely decadent.  This is a fantastic midafternoon snack that really feels like an indulgence! 5
This is definitely a downgrade from the standard chewy chocolate chip cookie.<br /><br />These cookies are supposed to be just like chewy chips ahoy cookies filled with a "gooey fudgey" center.  There are three problems: first, the cookies appear a little burned when you open the pack.  Second, there are many more broken cookies than usual.  Finally, the center is not gooey, even at 80 degrees F.<br /><br />In fact, I microwaved a couple of cookies to see what I could do.  Even after just five seconds, the outside disintegrated, but the inside failed to get gooey.  I think there's just too little cookie and the center is too solid - it's about the consistency of the "stuff" in the middle of an oreo.<br /><br />Ok, so it can't all be bad, right?  Well, the cookie isn't even as good as regular ones because it's a bit burnt and greasy, and the fudgey bit in the middle is tasty but not really good enough.  The main issue is that the cookie isn't structurally sound enough to stay intact around that "gooey fudgey" center, and the middle part isn't better than the cookie it replaces.<br /><br />So I did what anyone would do and took them into work to get rid of them.  They lasted a shade under 4 hours on a floor of 30 people, and there were a lot of small pieces left behind.  I got comments ranging from "that hit the spot" through to "even as free cookies go, I've had much better."<br /><br />I won't be getting them again. 2
I have tried many brands of coconut water, including some flavored ones, but this one does not merit even one star.  It does not taste at all like coconut water --- WAY too much sugar and flavorings added --- sickeningly sweet. Very disappointing and truly a waste of my money.  Same was true of the passionfruit flavor. Yuck. 1
This isn't the one I had ten years ago (brand forgotten). It is nearly OK.<br />Strong after taste , flavor is  fake.<br /><br />If anyone reading this knows what brand is great, please post so I can try out. The original one I tried was incredible, thus my fruitless search for perfection. 2
This is probably good organic coffee in whole bean form.  It seems pretty fresh, even for ground coffee, and it's roasted the way I like it, which is medium-light.  The flavor (once you get some, more on that to follow) is mild.  It does have a weird aftertaste, which may be from the pods themselves or from the packaging.<br /><br />Mostly, though, this is a wasteful, expensive way to brew a cup of coffee, and it undoes all the good of using organic, fair trade beans.  It's a packaged coffee inside a package that's inside a package of packages.  This wouldn't be the worst thing in the world if the amount of coffee inside the pod were enough to brew a decent cup, but it isn't.  One pod brewed as recommended doesn't hold your cream and tastes like what you'd get at your great-grandma's house in outstate Minnesota.  You can read the date on a penny at the bottom of your cup.  Brewed according to the directions, this is worse than no coffee at all.<br /><br />Two pods in ten ounces of near-boiling water for 4-5 minutes makes an okay mug of coffee, but you use twice as much packaging and spend twice as much money.  Two stars for the fair trade.  No stars for anything else. 2
I know nettle tea has a pretty distinct taste, but this particular brand was just unbearable. The smell reminded me of fish food pellets, and it had a fishy taste, too. I bought a pound of loose nettles from somewhere else for a lot cheaper, and the taste is so much better. 1
I'm a big hot tea drinker and am always looking for new kinds to try. I had high hopes for this tea, but just couldn't stomach it. Of course, I have no other Hibiscus tea to compare it to.<br /><br />I guess it just wasn't my cup of tea :-) 1
We purchased after reading reviews expected tea to taste possibly like a peppermint patty, no such luck very mild hint of the mint and chocolate.  Dissappointed, considering sending remaining quantity back. 2
I didn't realize this until after drinking my first cup and some googling but apparently Twinnings altered their Earl Grey formula in April 2011 and has added more citrus flavor.  I agree with the mob of Brits upset with this change, the lemon taste now is overpowering.  Try some other brand if you really want Earl Grey.  If you have a really strong lemon tea then go ahead and buy this stuff. 2
I wasn't very pleased with this product.  It's nothing like what the description said.  The pieces were smashed and torn, and they tasted like they were heavily syruped.  I could barely taste the actual longan.  I think I would've been better off buying the canned ones. 1
Although I do not believe this helps with weight loss, it has a great flavor.  My husband, who does not normally drink hot tea, loves this. 4
it is what is is... and it did the job that it was made for. lasts long if u take care of it but is easily out grown when just starting ur own studion 3
I liked the fact that this product has a simple ingredient list and I could find gluten and dairy free protein bars.  So after hearing much about these, I decided to try them.  I tried various flavors, but still I just don't like them.  The texture is probably the worst part, I just find it gross and gummy.  As for taste, they're rather bland.  I think there are better tasting healthy options out there.  As for me, I won't be purchasing these again. 2
The quality of this dill weed, (as well as Frontier's bulk Dill Weed, and its off-shoot company-- Simply Organic<br />Dill Weed), is OK for a dried spice. But you pay for it's transportation all the way from Israel. I find that environmentally and morally problematic, with Israel's ongoing snubbing of international law and UN resolutions.<br />You'd never know this origin from the label, which only prints Frontier's home base in Iowa. Maybe even Frontier<br />isn't proud of buying from Israel.<br />For my Kosher dill pickles, I'd suggest either fresh dill weed, or the California-made dill weed from Spice Hunter.<br /><br />VM Feldman 1
Cute, inexpensive litter mat.  However, the side curled up and will not flatten down, plus it will not stay in place on our Linoleum floor. 2
The Breakfast In Bed coffee from Wolfgang Puck is  a good medium roast coffee.  My husband, the regular coffee drinker of our house, likes it, but feels he would like the coffee more if it were a bit stronger.  The product arrived quite soon after ordering. 4
I like Kettle chips but was really disappointed with this order because they were over cooked.  I bought a bigger sized bag from Costco and the chips were all cooked perfectly. So I don't know why these were different.<br />Will never buy these chips from here again. 2
While I love their soups, this is a crazy high price for these soups.  Every grocery store around us is selling these soups for 2.99 each and we live in a rural area of northern Minnesota and have access to about 4 grocery stores, both large and small.  When you do the math on this product, it comes out to $4.78 each.  That is way higher than what I can pay for at a store.  Very disappointed in Amazon's pricing for this product! 2
Satisfyingly sweet with lots of protien. I eat it as dessert or quick pick me up. 4
I usually love Kettle Chips, and love salt & vinegar, but these chips were way too vinegary for me! They do have the typical kettle chip crunch, but are too aggressively flavored for my taste. 3
