My baby hasn't died yet.<br /><br />If your baby has food allergies and your doctor prescribes this stuff... and you love your baby, it's certainly worth every penny. As expected, my daughter is still alive and she's doing well. 5
It gives it good shine but i do not recommend it for daily use....the smell is too strong ...i do like the fact that you only need a tiny drop. i use it for my ends or as a hair treatment before shampooing. 3
BOUGHT ITEM FOR SON FOR ONE WAS HARD TO FIND IN REGULAR GROCERIE BUT ANYWAY WHEN DID BUY WASNT HAPPY AT ALL HAS VERY STRONG SMELL TO IT AND IT LINGERS CANT PUT NEXT ANOTHER FOOD 2
i ordered this november 17 it is now dec 19, im still waiting for it. dont know if i will get it or not 2
I was expecting a lot more from a tea that is named "Double Bergamot". Some other Earl Grey's I have used have more Bergamot flavoring in 1 tea bag then this little tea in 4. Thus I am rather disappointed! Although for a regular Earl Grey fan this tea might be good, for the Bergamot enthusiast it is not recommendable. 2
Tried these on our two Schnauzers----they were impressed!  These are rather large biscuits that are made to break in half which makes them a perfect size for a snack or reward.  They have a good crunch which I think is good for dental health.  Anyway, I have a box of Alpo Variety Snacks and a box of Milk Bone Flavor Snacks to which I compared ingredients.  They both have artificial color, Alpo lists animal digest, whatever that is, while Milk Bone won the contest with all of those ingredients that no one can pronounce.  I would list what makes up all three but think it would not be too interesting and you probably have at least one of the listed brands if you give your pet treats.<br />What sets the Newman's Own apart is the simple list of Organic ingredients including lamb, carrots, apples, molasses, barley and tocopherols for Vitamin E.  It is made in New Zealand where they raise a lot of lamb, so this seems just the perfect place. The bottom line is our dogs think Pa and Nell Newman have a great product and would highly recommend it to their four legged friends.  Life could not be better than living with happy dogs.  So, on their input I must give this product a five star rating. 5
I have fine, medium length hair and normally use a very mild shampoo that cleans well without drying my hair out, followed by a good Rinse-Out conditioner. My favorite shampoos are Paul Mitchell's Shampoo One and Pantene Pro-V for Fine Hair Volume Shampoo. They wash really clean and leave my hair nice and bouncy. I couldn't wait to try this New CLEAR Scalp and Hair Therapy Volumizing Root Boost Shampoo. What everyone wants, who has fine hair, is body at the roots. They list a lot of vitamins in this shampoo for your scalp that sound great too.<br /><br />When this New CLEAR Scalp and Hair Therapy Volumizing Root Boost Shampoo arrived it was sealed in a plastic bag inside of a bubble wrap envelope. The bag was soaked through in both the bubble envelope and the inner plastic sealed bag. When I opened it up to see what was the problem- the cap is so poorly designed that it leaks at the seal. The flip top was not opened, it literally leaks at the seal, where the bottle connects to the cap. I can't even begin to tell you about the strong smell of this shampoo. It is overwhelming and so perfumey, it's really hard to take. I ignored this poorly designed bottle and the strong perfume smell and went on to try the product, as sometimes shampoo smells are milder when you rinse them out of your hair.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed is that the shampoo is a really thick pink cream- not like my see through completely clear Shampoo One or completely clear see through Pantene for Fine hair. This should have been a dead give away that this shampoo is not good for fine hair, as my hairdresser said if you can't see through the shampoo- it's NOT for Fine hair. I tried the shampoo and it hardly foams up, but lays on your hair, coating it really thick. It doesn't rinse out well, leaving my hair greasy, yet my hair dried frizzy and felt dried out at the scalp. This is without a doubt the strangest shampoo I've ever used- how can a cream leave your hair and scalp dry and frizzy? The smell was not as overwhelming when the shampoo was rinsed out- but still not a pleasant smell. I couldn't wait to wash my hair again with my Pantene and get this strange drying cream out of my hair. If you have Fine hair- I would not recommend this shampoo- it was one of the worst shampoos I've ever tried. 1
Regardless of how this tastes (I like it), why would anyone pay these prices plus shipping when it is much cheaper at a local store like Shoppers Food Warehouse? 1
This product is very healthy for your body, it is cost effective because is not mixed with other things, it comes with a little spoon with the right measurement for your drinks. I bought it in Peru, and I want to find it in the US.  Is better than other stevia products I have bought in the past. 5
These chips are my family's favorite.  They are absolutely fabulous with guacamole because they are not too salty.  They pick up salsa well too, especially fresh salsa because of their shape.  You get just the right amount of salsa.  These chips don't take over the dip, they compliment whatever you dip them in.  They're fine without dip also, but if you are used to a salty chip, you might find them a bit plain. Tortilla chips are a staple at our house and these are the best you can get except in an authentic Mexican restaurant.<br /><br />Hope you enjoy them as much as we do. 5
So I bought this thing and my cockapoo wouldn't touch it, I played with her with it and tried to show her how it worked and even rubbed cheese on it, but she never figured it out.  So I got the idea that I could take a empty 20 oz coke bottle and fill it half way with kibble and maybe she would graduate to the tug a jug eventually.  Well, she loves the plastic soda bottles, but still ignores this toy.  I think maybe it is because they replaced the rope with a rubber faux rope.  She loves her rope toys, but doesn't like this rubber rope.  I recommend starting with a soda bottle and only moving to this if they regularly destroy the soda bottle. 2
This is a great buy for the price.  I can't get this kind of deal anywhere local.  I will buy my cream this way as long as I can get it here. 5
The product is a good value for the amount you get, however it is way too salty.  The product is very dry and firm.  I think this would be good if they cut the salt content in half. 2
A number of us earnestly tried this product but after trying another brand, found this to be wanting very much.<br /><br />  With that said, there is a company making soy jerky that has better flavor, texture and quality. They even make jerky that is unsweetened. Most importantly, this company tasty eats does not have any garlic or onion powder in any of their products.<br /><br />  This was the biggest, we felt, downfall of this product. Except this company, every jerky company; except tasty eats which uses no garlic or onion powder in any of their product line, all would list garlic or onion if an ingredient. The primal strips company has "vegetarian spices" so one is not clear what this is. Even the company, after phoning them, are rather reticent about saying if their is granulated garlic or onion. But there is. In these primals strips, all are having some form of garlic, possibly onion.<br /><br />  We found tasty eats soy jerky to be Perfect. Really, in quality, texture and also the fact that they use no onion or garlic whatsoever. 1
I did not realize that this actually had the bones in it. Not something that I would give to any dog let alone a Yorkie and a Poodle. The bones take up a lot of room in the can. The rest of the can contains little cubes of meat, a few vegetables and lots and lots of gravy. I usually split half a can between the two dogs. The only way I am able to get another meal out of the can is to add more cooked vegetables. The dogs really like it but I will not buy this flavor again. You are getting less for your money since it contains bones and so much gravy. I would recommend the Turducken. They absolutely love that one. 2
The belgian dark chocolate is the best hot cocoa I've ever had so far and my 4 year daughter agrees.  She pinicky about her chocolates preferring only to eat dark chocolate and this dark choco. hot cocoa sure passed the test with her.  She prefers to drink it with just warm water instead of milk as using milk makes it taste like "milk chocolate".  I do, too! 5
This is a great product, I call tasty and clever...so often do you see mints covered in chocolate, but this is a reverse design, the mint surrounds the chocolate...BRILLIANT!!! no melting or mess.<br /><br />A refreshing mint delivers a crisp cool taste, but eventually the chocolate is released and the blend is surprisingly delicious and tasty.<br /><br />I just started to work for a Finnish company this year and on my first business trip to Helsinki, these became my daily treat.<br /><br />I brought some back for my friends and family and they did not last long.<br /><br />I am a routine AMAZON customer and proudly enjoy my PRIME SERVICE weekly...<br /><br />but I don't understand the price of $18.95 a bag that is more than 3x the cost.<br /><br />I found them here at less cost than the airport in Helsinki.<br /><br />[...] 5
I made Chai tea - as well as a home made chai ice cream and just a chai milk without the tea + cloves, star anise and a few other spices.  But you have to have the cardamom pods and these were wonderful. 5
The dog loves these treats. But why is this particular package size not sealed? All other size packages of this product are strongly sealed, so that a plastic rib must be torn off to remove the lid. At least some tape could be used around the lid on this size. Please consider doing something to provide assurance against tampering. 4
Good. Exactly as advertised. I was surprised that not a single one broke open during shipping, so A+ on the durability of each individual packet.<br /><br />Be warned though, that these creamers are not very sweet. 5
After doing a lot of research on single grain oatmeal cereal, it's clear HappyBellies has the best ingredients (DHA from algea as opposed to fish oil and a better blend of probiotics as opposed to just one type). However, there definitely is some sort of production problem with the cans of oatmeal with a July 2012 expiration date.<br /><br />First, there is a distinct smell with this oatmeal. This oatmeal has a strong stale smell and looks grey in color. All other oatmeals have almost no smell at all and have a consistent light-khaki color.<br /><br />Second, the HappyBellies oatmeal does not thicken formula as other oatmeals do. Our son has acid reflux and we were told to add one tablespoon of oatmeal per ounce of formula. When I use Gerber oatmeal with DHA and probiotics, this makes the formula very thick - sludgelike. With the HappyBellies, no matter how much I add it doesn't thicken the formula at all. It remains watery and not suitable for a baby who spits up excessively.<br /><br />Third, I think our son has an allergic reaction to this oatmeal. He has no issue using the non-organic Gerber oatmeal with DHA and probiotics, but with the HappyBellies he has thrown up the formula/oatmeal immediately after eating it as if his stomach was upset. He also seemed to break out in a rash after putting him on HappyBellies after a couple of days.<br /><br />I agree with the other reviews that there definitely seems to be something wrong with this batch of oatmeal. I suspect that moisture somehow go into the oatmeal before it was sealed and as a result it rotted in the can, thus causing a bad smell, a grey color, and unable to absorb the moisture from the formula to thicken the solution. The grey color has even made me wonder if it's mold that has grown on the oatmeal.<br /><br />It's very clear to me that HappyBellies should issue a voluntary recall of this product! 1
I came across these treats months ago in Target when I was looking for things  to make my dogs first vet experience a more pleasant one.<br /><br />They were the healthiest things in the store, believe you me!<br />My dog really liked these.<br /><br />I did go on the site and everything looked kosher but I was eventually scared away from them b/c of the whole 'Made in China' issue. She is eating other treats right now but...I'm willing to give Dogswell another try.<br />H*ll, look at all of the recalls occurring within OUR borders....and the bulk of us are still eating beef. 4
I absolutely LOVE the BBQ popchips.  They are my favorite but when I saw they had Chili Lime I thought that would be even better. Not so much. I purchased an entire box of 12 of the 3oz bags and wish I would have just stuck to my BBQ. 3
I bought a 2-pack of the orange flavor 5 hour energy drink at Wal-Mart.  I tried one bottle in the afternoon, the other 2 days later in the morning.  I drank the whole bottle, but saw no real change.  I don't drink coffee, so I can't imagine I have made myself insensitive to caffeine.<br /><br />The orange flavor tasted fine though.  Kind of like orange drink in elementary school.  It sounds like other reviewers don't like the berry or lemon-lime. 1
I picked up a can of these after the glowing reviews I read for it. To keep it short, it has a very authentic wasabi taste. It literally tastes like an almond dipped in wasabi sauce. And that, to me, doesn't make the most appealing snack. I find the wasabi flavor overwhelming, and none of the soy flavor coming through. I thought it'd come through as a more balanced flavor, but that's not the case. I won't be eating anymore, personally. I gave it two stars since it is wasabi flavor, and it certainly tastes like that. 2
It is now 110 degrees here, so I am leery of ordering the cheese.  But it is excellent, and I will be ordering it as soon as it hits the 80's. 5
This is suppose to be a "healthy" snack. Then they shouldn't sneak artificial sweeteners in. I do like the taste, but I'm going to have to go with another flavor. I got the applewood also and it looks like it doesn't have sucralose. So just be aware that different flavors will have different ingredients. 1
This is an excellent product for curbing the appetite without the abundance of carbs.  They are crisp, fresh and great tasting.  Since I started eating these pork rinds, I dropped some unnecessary pounds. 5
I tried this illy issimo Caff&egrave; Italian Espresso Style coffee drink for a quick energy lift after lunch. The drink is made in Denmark (not Italy) and distributed by the Coca-Cola Co.<br /><br />Likes:<br />>The AL can chilled quickly (1.5 hrs) in the fridge OR pour in a glass and heat it up in the microwave.<br />>Richer taste of Arabica coffee than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEVJRY">illy issimo Coffee Drink, Cappuccino, 8.45-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> without the fat and cholesterol (from lowfat milk).<br />>Per 6.8oz. can: 10g sugar, 0mg cholesterol & fat, and only 50 calories.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />>Each 6.8oz. can contains: 155mg caffeine and 20mg sodium.  Not bad but for those who are very sensitive to caffeine, even 155mg could cause an extra hour or two of insomnia (happened to me, drank it around 2PM, stayed up until 2AM).<br />>Easy to exceed the maximum daily intake of 500mg caffeine (as recommended by physicians) with just three to four cans.<br />>Competitively priced at $2.01 per 6.8oz can (12-pack) but costs can add up quickly for heavy coffee drinkers.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br />Tasty drink for an occasional energy boost but not recommended for people sensitive to or trying to minimize caffeine intake.  Give it a try, some may enjoy the flavor and couldn't care less about the 155mg caffeine; make your own informed decision! 3
I bought a bunch of the Kitchens of India items during a promotional sale and the only one I'd recommend is the butter chicken sauce. If they were tasty I could overlook the salt content for the occasional enjoyment but I'm not loving the taste. I ofter buy similar products from Trader Joes and those, in my opinion, are much better and cost far less. 1
My dog is a finicky eater when it comes to canned food.  After trying MANY varieties from both the pet store and the grocery store, the Alpo Chicken in Gravy is all he will eat (I can sometimes feed him the T-Bone steak flavor).  I guess it looks and tastes more like "people food" than the other varieties.  My only complaint is that when I received the shipment (pack of 24), almost all of the cans were dented, and a couple had dried gravy on the outside of the can.  One can leaked out - the dent was at the seal on the top.  Normally, I'm not someone who is picky about dented cans, but this was a little much.  A couple of the cans actually had a funny smell when I opened them.  So, I guess I'll go back to buying at the grocery store.  Just thought having them shipped to the house would be easier than lugging them home from the store.  Oh well..... 3
What's to say - Pop Chips are great!!!  Kudos to the PoP Chip makers. 5
Love this coffee - tastes great, and the aroma while brewing is simply wonderful...I would definitely purchase more. Good price too. 5
Kellogg's Special Potassium Oxide Protein Water does a good job in taking the edge off hunger.  I drink it about 5 times a week.  It is not a weight loss program by itself, but does help.<br /><br />I buy it from Amazon because few local stores carry it. 4
Decided to purchase the 35 pound bag for my 12 year old dog who have skin allergy base on the positive reviews I've read on line.  Very happy with shipping & Packaging service from Amazon.  But very dissapointed in Premium Edge.  Not only did the food not help him, it seemed to made him worst the first couple of days! Also, the product says for adult dogs but on the package it also says from age 1 to 10 years of age???? My dog is 12.  I don't understand all the positive feed back for this product?  and I so regret for buying such a large bag or the product for that matter. 1
Well, it's definitely chewy with a good texture. One bar is very filling. The taste is good but not great. I expected to taste more chocolate. Doesn't compare to the chocolate PureBar when it comes to taste. 3
I know these are super trendy right now, and I totally wanted to love this product (or, to be more exact, I wanted my toddler to love this product). He took one taste, handed it back to me, and said, "Why you gave me baby food, mom?" I tasted it, and he is right. It tastes just like jarred baby food. Same consistency (not any thicker), too. If your kid likes the packaging, great. If your kid doesn't, then it is just really, really expensive baby food. I'm going to give the rest to my baby, as the toddler is not the least bit interested. 3
I've ordered these maybe 4 times now. I see a lot of comments talking about how they burst open during shipping. The most recent shipment I got had maybe 1 or two burst open, not hard to clean.<br /><br />This is a great price, shelf stable and tastes just like the dairy french vanilla creamer. I would highly recommend it- I'm addicted. This is great to take to work and it makes others jealous! 5
The Cherry Pie flavor is, for me, far too tart. I really prefer the pecan Pie bar out of all the "Pie" flavors. 2
This item is better then the other coconut waers I have tried but is my least favorite flavor of the three REVA items I tried.  Again the convenience is great! 4
This little can (6.8 oz.)of coffee drink has the flavor of espresso with a not-too-sweet note.  There is nothing artificial-tasting about it, as is often found in other energy boost drinks.  With 155 mg. of caffeine, it contains almost double the jolt in a 7 oz. brewed cup of coffee.  This one's not for sissies.<br /><br />Please note that, with 10 grams of sugar and 12 grams of carbohydrate, it may not be for those on sugar/carbohydrate restricted intake. Other than that, it contains nothing to deem it unhealthy.  It even has no preservatives. (I wonder what this drink might taste like if it were artificially sweetened and have no carbohydrates.)<br /><br />I enjoyed it ice cold straight from the can.  This tastes every bit as good as the Starbucks bottled coffee drinks.  I would not hesitate to choose the Illy brand over the other one.<br /><br />Coca Cola produces it in Atlanta, Georgia under a licensing agreement and it is a product of Denmark. 4
I love Lady Finger popcorn.  It has so much flavor. It's a million times better than microwave popcorn and a thousand times better than the popcorn in the super-market.<br /><br />Warning....Once you have the good stuff, you'll never want to eat regular popcorn again. 4
The coffee is good but I think that the creme brulee flavor is lacking.... 3
This product is tastey but it is not "Crunchy" so I'm not sure where they got the name.  If you are looking for a freeze-dried crunchy strawberry you will have to get Cereal Toppers which I don't think are offered on Amazon.  These Crunchies are good on cereal with milk.  My four year old likes them but I'm not crazy about the soft texture.  Just Tomatoes brand has dried stawberries on this website that are better. 2
My wife lived in London for three years and developed a variety of British tastes. One such item was for rice pudding or creamed rice. Not too long ago I spotted Ambrosia Creamed rice (in 15-ounce cans) on the shelves of my local Fresh and Easy Store (a British company). Well, I just had to try it.<br /><br />Creamed rice is not bad. It's rather bland for my tastes and perhaps it's meant to go with certain types of food.. It's low in fat and sodium and not particularly high in calories, so I don't feel guilty at all.I prefer it chilled. It's smooth and creamy and I'd judge it to be a good product. But, it might take me a while to develop a taste for it. Right for the moment, I find it overly bland.<br /><br />Gary Peterson 4
shipping was really good,and i got what i ordered on time. will buy from again,alittle pricy but my little dog likes them. 4
+Really really tasty<br />+Much healthier than almost every other potato chip<br />+A variety of flavors, consider this a huge sampler<br /><br />-Sea Salt & Vinegar is crazy sour. Personally, I think they overdid it on the vinegar.<br />-It's hard to stop at one serving, but I take this as a sign of a good snack :P 5
Beef might be listed as the first ingredient but that hardly makes it the main ingredient.  After reading the ingredients list this "food" seems to be mostly made up of various forms of soy.  I am not a fan of soy & with all the GMO crap being pushed on us, I like it even less.<br /><br />Upon presenting this artificially flavored & dyed product to my fur babies, they started to eat up.  But then one by one they stopped & looked at me as if to say, "What is this crap?  We don't want this.  Where's the stuff you normally give us?"  I left the food for them.  Several hours later, the food was still in the bowl & a disgusting explosion of black runny vomit was all over everything.  Jerk that I am, I continued to try to get them to eat it.  After all, I have a review to do - that's how I ended up with the food in the first place.  After several days I gave up.  One of my babies simply stopped eating.  That was the final straw.  I am not torturing my pets any longer.  They are back on their usual grub. No more black vomit.  Everyone is once again eating until the bowls are empty & my furbabies are back to their joyful behavior. 1
Definitely not a generic box of chocolate that you buy from your grocery, but I wasn't too impressed otherwise.  Many pieces, the chocolate covering was just too thin.  The other problem, I feel their chews are just too hard/tough.  Quite a few pieces had a waxy, dry hue to them--like they were old.  I sampled two assorted (one mix, one dark).  Felt the cremes in the bunch were the best of the lot--some nice flavors and thick texture.  I know I will probably sound like a shill but Loweryscandies out of indiana are my favorite, but hey, look at my other product reviews--I'm no shill! 3
i love these pop.  these are rather small pops about 1/2 the size of a tootsie pop.  they come in many flavors.  i think this bag is great in the long run.  300 just think Halloween. 5
If you love mayo and a touch of black pepper then this is not for you. You are better off with just your regular mayo and adding your own sprinkle of pepper. This stuff is downright hot. There is so much pepper that you can not taste the mayo. The mayo flavor is lost even if you only use a little bit of it. However some like it hot, so they may fall in love with it. It was too strong for me. 1
I wouldn't say my twins are picky eater, but they wouldn't eat this one.  They eat just about every Gerber's organics. 2
My husband had purchased this product, as a single bottle, at our local supermarket for $5.99. I love pepper on my foods. The flavor of the three different peppercorns in one grinder adds a nice and tasty "ping" to your foods, meats, poultry, seafood, salads. Buying it here was so much more economical. 4
I finally found my most favorite cookies through a dealer on Amazon.  After waiting nearly 4 weeks for them to arrive I finally contacted Amazon to let them know that I still had not received the cookies I ordered.  Two days later the cookies arrived - where they went before reaching me is still a mystery.  But I was happy to finally have them as I can't get them in Southern California.  The minimum order was 4 packages and that was okay, I would freeze some for later.  Much to my dismay the supplier just put the four bags of cookies and a box with NO packing to protect them.  So you guessed it....almost all of the cookies were broken into crumbs:  And to top it off the cookies "best if eaten by date" was only 2 days after I received them!  Needless to say these must have been sitting in a warehouse for quite some time.  After contacting Amazon I was able to get a refund for my crushed cookies.  Oh well, maybe I will try again by ordering with Amazon through a different vendor. Thank you Amazon - you were great. 1
I bought this product soley bcuz it said it had 11 of polyunsaturated fat!<br />Received it today and the label says it only has 2.  I'm really ticked off that<br />I wasted my money on this.  Amazon should automatically have to refund anyone that bought this;<br />Even if they don't send it back - RIP OFF! 1
I've never had Sunchy Malta before (I drank a lot of Goya when it was available locally). Tastes similar to Goya, though with less of a sour taste and slightly less carbonation.<br /><br />I ordered 50 bottles in order to get free shipping. Said bottles arrived in 4 large boxes, with each bottle individually packed. None broke. At the time of purchase, this was the best deal going for Malta either locally or in stores (I've never paid less than fifty cents anywhere).<br /><br />Now, though, the free shipping is gone. Unless  Sunchy seriously expects me to drop $7.50 for shipping per bottle, it's unlikely I'll be buying anymore. They should consider selling by the pack or case if they wish to pursue the online business model.<br /><br />So, 5 stars for value and the quality of packing, with the caveat that I won't be buying any more until Sunchy figures out how to sell it. 5
I love annie chun but this particular soup just does not do it for me personally, however you may love it. The soup has a very unusual taste. I really wanted to like this soup but I will stick to the other flavors that I love. 1
I thought this toy would be great for my dog.  He was in desperate need of mental stimulation and I thought if he could figure out a puzzle while he was eating his dinner that would be great.  However, within the first 20-30 minutes he had it, the rubber "tug" rope was broken in half.  I think he chewed on it some, but I think the actual cause of it breaking was being bent since it was a smooth break instead of jagged.  He still uses it though, even without the rope.  Instead of tugging it now he'll stand it upright, knock it over, and eat the spilled contents or sometimes he'll turn it upsidedown.  Even though he isn't using it the way it was meant to be he still likes it and gets a lot of use out of it. 3
I love SnackMasters' turkey jerky, so I naturally decided to try natural turkey jerky.  This turkey jerky is the same (or better) quality as the regular variety, but too dry.  I would recomend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EZMRRA">SnackMasters Turkey Jerky, Teriyaki</a>, instead 2
These chips taste great. I use them mostly as a topping on my garden salads I make at home. They give it a great crunch and sweet taste that makes the salad so much better. They also make a great and healthier snack. 4
I was looking forward to getting this product. I loved the classic brulee, however the chocolate tasted like chocolate pudding with sugar on top. It had no special taste and it was expensive. I gave this a three star only because the classic is still very good for a boxed dessert. If you are looking for a bargain do not order from this store there is better pricing out there. 3
We love this product. We've also got our little grandbaby hooked on it, when she comes to visit. She's now 2. We feel more comfortable with her drinking goat milk than cow's milk - much easier to digest. Love that Meyenberg.  Sometimes, though, we find better prices elsewhere on the Internet. 5
As a young guy im concerned with taste and also fiber content. This is high in sugar/carbs but it's entirely justified for the great taste and the high fiber. No other cereal taste this good and is moderately good for you. Other fiber one cereals maybe healthier, but they taste like pinecones and sticks. 5
My son wouldn't eat it either! I tasted it... I would not eat it, also. Tasteless, unappetizing in texture and  flavor.<br />It says "minimal processing"... does that mean it is not even cooked? No wonder our babies and toddlers hate it!!! I would NEVER knowingly feed my child or myself RAW meat. 2
If you are looking for something that tastes like peanut butter, this is not it.  If you are looking for a lower calorie, lower fat substitute to put on a sandwich, etc. then it will do.  Be prepared for a whole new flavor - it is an acquired taste. 2
I was thinking this was a nice low calorie snack, but I'm sorry - 38% of your sodium in one little packet is obscene!  Not to mention that it TASTES too salty.  It overpowers any other flavor that this soup might have...  Very disappointing...  They should offer a low sodium option that might be more palatable... 2
Now I can save a trip to the local beachfront and smell the seaweed soaked sand, and maybe even eat a little, each time I open a can of these really beachy smelling and tasting oysters from the good people in Mainland China, where all workers are happy all the time, just like their English radio broadcasts say.  Well, whether it's sand or shell bits that my teeth are grinding on, I'm sure to get some extra minerals that I didn't pay for each time I'm hungry enough to wolf down a can of these little mollusks.<br /><br />Oh, and they come packed in Cottonseed oil.  You know, the oil squeezed right from the seeds of the plant your T-Shirt is made of, and we know how great T-shirts taste!<br /><br />Seriously, what was I thinking?  I suppose I'll finish the package I bought because I abhor wasting food, and there are many in the world who don't even get to eat stuff like this, but I'll never buy this product again. 2
There were literally no more than 30 cashew pieces per box, and that might be a generous number. The actual brittle tastes good enough, but the lack of main ingredient means this product should not be purchased. 2
Unfortunately, all of Road's End's vegan mac & cheese is really disgusting.  Not a good taste and the texture of the sauce is really strange.<br /><br />I am REALLY glad that I found Leahey's Vegan cheese sauce.  It's AMAZING and 100 times better than this stuff. 1
I must echo many others' criticisms distinguishing between Thailand and Sri Lanka cans. Thailand cans are smooth and creamy; Sri Lanka cans are thin and watery. Unfortunately, Amazon cannot guarantee which you will receive, so I'll have to drop this from my Subscribe & Saves. 3
Marley Coffee comes with no directions on the package, only the statement that it's single serving. It doesn't state what system of coffee brewing this was manufactured for.  The aroma is wonderful, however, I'd describe the coffee as mild not medium roast.  I was, therefore, disappointed in the flavor. Perhaps if it was brewed in a cone system or similar, I might have had a stronger result. 2
Delicious and easy to make. I make mine with milk and it comes out extra creamy and rich. You can pour boiling water or hot milk onto the cereal to cook it, or you can heat it in the microwave (be careful about if boiling over. I like the Maple Brown sugar just as much as the Cinnamon. 4
I would give these 3 and 1/2 stars if I could. Now that I have tried these I see why there are so many "mixed" reviews. To start: they are NOT "healthy". Yes, they are low in carbs, but for the total calories from fat (60 out of 75) - the percentage is WAY too high. That means the calories are 80% from fat. Yes, I realize they are made of cheese, which is mostly fat, but they are not something I want to be eating all day every day. (Kind of like the 100-calorie pack treats that are portion controlled, but not so "healthy" either.) Plus, they are high in sodium like most other people have pointed out. However, they are very low in carbs (1 gram) and high in protein (5 grams). I got the "Classic White Cheddar Cheese". Keep in mind that white cheddar is one of my all-time favorite cheeses. The texture is crunchy - similar to a rice cake (a little denser). The one thing that I strongly DON'T like, is the weird, greasy, oily feeling it leaves on my teeth. But maybe that is just me. But the flavor is fine. The packaging states the following:<br /><br />1 bag (0.5 oz.) - 14 grams:<br /><br />Calories: 75<br />Calories from fat: 60<br />Total fat - 6.5g (10% Daily Value [DV])<br />Cholesterol - 25mg (8% DV)<br />Sodium - 275mg (12% DV)<br />Total carbs - 1g (0% DV)<br />Protein - 5 g<br />Vitamin A - 5% DV<br />Calcium - 16% DV<br /><br />The size of the bag reminds me of those little pouches of fruit gummies that they make for kids lunches.<br /><br />So, all in all, a decent tasting, low carb, high fat snack. Not something I will eat every day, but a nice "treat" when I am in the mood for something salty and crunchy. 3
The seasoning was very difficult to shake out of container as it appeared to be stuck together. I suspect this product was outdated, although wasn't able to find a an expiration date on the container. Not very happy with this purchase. 2
One of my longtime favorite drinks is a half-and-half combination of club soda and fruit juice. Most fruit juices by themselves are a bit too sweet for me (even the ones without added sugar), and the addition of carbonation just makes the whole thing more agreeable to me. This drink does this for me, and amazingly, they do not add a boatload of sugar. Too many off-the-shelf beverages--even those claiming to be healthful--have way too much sugar (or worse, the cheap corn syrup sugar substitute). These guys give it none of that. It's both tasty and refreshing. This is a product I would actually buy. 5
This tea really is just an apple cinnamon tea (with no "spice" flavor included).  It is pretty mild and tasty enough but I wish it was a bit stronger (if it were I would have given it 5 stars).  Typically I drink green tea or chai tea so this herbal tea is something new to throw into the mix.  Shipping was fast and the boxes were well packed. 4
I bought this coffee at a local store.  It is truly the worst coffee I have ever had.  I first noticed the flavor was almost like burned plastic.  When I poured it out it looked pale, not dark. There were big pieces of what looked like pieces of grass or wood.  It had almost no aroma, but the bag was not broken. 1
I love the mild and ordered it but received WILD. I ate it anyway but it's not as good. 3
I thought I finally found a toy that would last for hours with my doberman and pit bull.  The first time I gave them the everlasting treat ball it did take a few hours for them to figure it out which was fantastic, but now they know how to pop the treat out within 5 to 10 minutes!!  They also love the bouncy ball with the rawhide rings, but again they get those out in one minute.  These toys are to expensive to go that fast.  I'm sure these work great for smaller breeds. 3
Nasty, gross, and terrible. I could end it there, but I won't. They should be ashamed to sell this product. I love prime rib. It's my favorite meal. Even bad prime rib is usually good. You can't even tell what kind of meat this is. Also, it does not come with any type of Au jus. Au jus it kinda what makes it prime rib and not a ribeye. There is none. There seem to be no seasoning on it either to make up for the lack of Au jus. If I was out to eat and was served this, I'd send it back to the kitchen in a heartbeat. 1
these are good :) taste almost like the real thing has vanilla inside tastes awesome  you gotta love the poptarts :D i love poptarts :D 4
If Amazon offered this on PRIME I would get it all the time.This coupled with the Whole Wheat pizza dough makes an excellent quick pizza and a healthy one too. 4
Received order within 7 business days.  The product received did not have the same label as pictured though the wording was the same.  Also the product did not have the same flavor as the product pictured (which we had bought previously locally).  I suppose the manufacturer has not only changed the label for this product, but also the recipe.  The distributor provided excellent service and we have decided to keep the sauce we received, just have to make our own modifications for our grilled vegetable recipe we have used in the past.  Thanks for another great distributor for the products we like.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5ZFQ">World Harbors Jamican Style Jerk Sauce, 16-Ounce Bottle, (Pack of 6)</a> 4
Have bought this from the folks who prepare it and I must say, this is the absolute best item I have ever tasted. They make this at a farm in Benson, AZ and it tastes like heaven. Highly recommend it for everything...I tend to slice up apples and dip them. Have tried it on toast as well. 5
I ordered regular shipments for the cacao powder and drink cacao daily; the most recent batch was terribly bitter and had a burnt woody flavor and texture.  Clearly there was a change in the quality; I sent an email to the company (they;'re based in Novato, so not far away) and heard nothing back.<br /><br />Not impressed, am looking for a new brand. 2
After reading the listing I thought it would be similar to the old French bottle brand that is no longer made, but it is not. I needed this to make my Ramous Gin Fizz. It is not as strong and is not even close to the fromer French brand. 2
These chips are pretty good.  They taste just good enough for me to want to eat some, and just bad enough for me to only want one or two.  Great for a diet. 3
I was out of town when I purchased this item. I can purchase the 4-pak at Wal Mart for $1.48 but it's never in stock. That is all my cats will eat so I just purchased it on Amazon cause I've always saved, especially for free shipping. I paid $30.11 for the 12 4-paks. This is the one time I didn't save, in fact it was outrageous what I paid on Amazon. I will continue to shop Amazon but I need to be more careful. 4
I unpacked the box of Old Wisconsin turkey snack bite sausage pieces and put the separate packages on my pantry shelf and kept one out to open and my mouth was watering.  After the first package was consumed I took another package of them out of the pantry and started in on it.  Wasn't too much later in the following week I noticed a pretty unpleasant smell in the pantry.  I thought for sure a rodent had got trapped somehow and probably died and was slowly rotting somewhere I could not see nor could I find anything of the sort.  The smell lasted and I scratched my head and wondered if the dead thing would eventually just dry up. Pretty soon my whole place smelled like the county landfill on a busy day. Well, it wasn't too long I went to grab another bag of the turkey sausage and gosh I found out the hard way where the small was emanating from all this time.  The bag of sausage I had just picked up was all rotted inside and it was totally putrid.  It was totally disgusting and it made my stomach feel a tad queasy.  I took the bag out and placed it in my garbage can and now I just can't wait till the City of Oswego KS comes and empties that can at the landfill. I have had my fill of this stuff! I doubt I will ever buy sausages from this company again! 1
There were more hulls in this popcorn than in any other that I've ever used.  We found it to be very tough and after a couple of bites I ended up throwing it out.  Amazon gave me a full refund.  I would give them five stars for service. 1
The price was as fantastic as the taste. So convenient to make and no messy powder  that is hard to dissolve. No major cleanup to deal with either. Highly recommended! 5
We like these crackers but the last two times we ordered them all the<br /><br />crackers were smashed. 3
The coffee is very finely processed and the flavor is just alright.  Nescafe and Mount Hagen are better - I bought this to try something other than these two, but I probably won't get this again.  There is just a slight "vitaminy" taste, but it's not overwhelming.  It's also a bit pricey for what you get. 3
way too sweet by itself.<br /><br />however this and a bold coffee makes a pretty good mix.  just do 5oz of this then replace, and do a 5oz of a bold coffee of your choice in the same cup.  then stir. 2
Behind the 12 packets of Via instant coffee, Starbucks placed a brief message, "Never be without." That's a better marketing strategy than, say, "You could do worse." Instant coffee is still instant coffee and no one who starts his or her day with a cup of Joe is about to trade fresh brew or French press for instant.<br /><br />In a pinch, Via is a portable and affordable option.<br /><br />However, I don't recommend Via as a strategy to save money on your coffee bill. A quality coffee press and a thermos will do much better. The 12-packet order currently sells for $8.95 on Amazon, without special offers or subscribe-and-save discounts. That works out to $0.75 per cup, which is about what you'd expect to pay in a standard vending machine. Hands down, Starbucks Via tastes better than anything pouring out of a vending machine. However, each Via stick produces an 8-ounce cup of coffee so, depending which size you normally order, you might spend $1.50 (for 16 ounces) or $2.25 (for 24 ounces).<br /><br />At $0.75 per 8-ounce cup, Starbucks' Via sticks are the same price as SoloBrew's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QTJ70M">French Press To-Go SoloPress</a>, which I also reviewed on Amazon.com. I still recommend both brands as tasty and portable options over the ubiquitous, freeze-dried coffee sold in glass jars.<br /><br />Rating: Four stars. 4
This product worked really well and I am happy with my purchase. I used them for cake pops and they wrote vibrant and easy, unlike the Wilton ones I purchased before these. DO NOT buy Wilton if you are using them for cake pops. I didn't try them on other things, like fondant or gumpaste, but using the Wilton ones on cake pops was like writing on wax. The only thing I would suggest, would be to have a finer point tip on the Americolor pens. This would have made the lines cleaner and better looking. 4
I purchased these tonight, the package says best by (Dec 2009) approximately 3 months from now...these are horrible! The aroma is offensive and the taste is even more offensive. I didn't even finish one piece of the dried peaches. I have tasted other brands that were better, I'm looking for those! Don't waste your money! Honest! 1
I don't really know what to make of these treats.  I was first drawn to them because of the claim they were for both cats and dogs and since it is something of an extra special treat it's nice to have something the whole family can enjoy.  But I was not impressed on any level.  Lets be honest, we all by these over priced pet treats for ourselves and not the pets.  If you honestly wanted to make your pet ecstatic you would go to the butcher shop, get tub of chicken livers or giblets, cook them up and have very happy pets.  For me this product is outrageously expensive, has an offensive smell and a texture of sawdust.<br /><br />The makers are trying to draw you in with this idea of it being "Raw" but do you want to feed a pet, or better yet even handle a product where the main ingredient is chicken if it actually is raw?  Though it doesn't say so on the package I don't think this item is actually freeze dried raw meat, but instead is supposed to appeal to the human's desire to feed their pet something that's healthy, i.e. raw diet for dogs.  But I see nothing in this item to make it any healthier than many other pet treats that are much cheaper in price.  I was also a little shocked at some of the health claims made on the package too.  Apparently, "Freedom from allergies, improved skin & coat, weight loss, reduced incidents of ear infections and healthier teeth & gums are just a handful of the amazing pet transformations that Nature's Variety customers experienced."  I have to call B.S. on that claim.<br /><br />The only real positive thing I can say about this product is that on one cat loved it.  My dog and other cat ate it, but weren't crazy about it.<br /><br />2 stars. 2
I'm just going to say it: These CHIPS Taste like DETERGENT.<br /><br />Given that Garden of Eatin' blue corn, and red hots chips are my favorite of all time, it's puzzling how they can produce such an unfortunate product as "Chili & Lime".<br /><br />First of all, where's the chili? I don't even taste it. Even tho I'm an advanced chili pepper user, I have a very keen palate. I detect less than 1 part per billion of chili in these here unfortunate chips.<br /><br />Also, I detect fraudulent lime flavors and *that* my friends is an egregious error from such a reknowned company. The red herring that it's NOT natural is "NATURAL FLAVORS WITH LIME". The translation here is that these natural flavors could be really anything, could be any combination of terpene extracts from 'natural sources'. For example, fake lemon flavor in candies and wood detergent is often an extract from lemongrass because it's cheaper than from lemons. But it's a different chemical also. Fake lime is immediately a mistake, and anyone-not just supertasters-can tell.<br /><br />This fakeLime taste, or 'floor detergent flavor', is reminiscent of a childhood fragrance- the strong chemical citrus waft of mopwater that a theater employee was using to mask the rotting popcorn-soda-slurry smell by the dumpster.<br /><br />In other words, it seems as if Garden of Eatin found the cheapest, strongest floor stripping chemicals from Big Lots, extracted the lime scent component and littered it lightly onto these chips.<br /><br />So if you want to mop floor with a tea of these, or you are considering a colon cleanse, accept no substitute.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------<br />Ok so along the lines of constructive criticism:<br /><br />ATTN: Garden of EATIN'<br /><br />Please contact Tostitos sensory labs scientists. It is imperative that you find out how Tostitos makes their hint of lime chips because they got it right. Use at least 500 ppm nanolimeparticles and same same for chili. Coat those suckers with maybe 1/2 to 100% of the rate used for redhotblues. 1
I HAVE BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT BEFORE. THESE SNACKS ARE CRISP AND GREAT TASTING. ALSO LOW IN CALORIES. I RECOMMEND THEM HIGHLY. THEY ARE SHIPPED ALMOST INSTANTLY AND ARRIVE WITHIN A FEW DAYS. 5
I can not tell you how good the chocolate covere cashews were, as I received instead chocolate covered cherries.  But I can state that they shipped each bag of chocolate with a cold pack to ensure the contents didn't melt while in shipment.  Nice jester on their part. 3
I'm a total ZICO loyalist and buy at least 6 liters a week. I decided to purchase from Amazon since they deliver and those bottles are heavy to shelp up my stairs. I would give this 5 stars but 3 out of my 6 bottles had cap defects. The caps were starting to separate from the bottle which resulted in leakage and possible contamination.<br /><br />I've seen this in grocery stores as well, so I know it's not an "Amazon" issue. :(<br /><br />I notified Zico online- I guess we will see what happens.<br /><br />On a unrelated note.. Amazon you should have a spell check option within the review section... 3
I really like this product. I have been trying to loose the "last ten pounds" for a few months now. The problem is I am hooked on chocolate. Rather than completely give up on my goal, I have switched to these as a meal replacement. Definitely wish Amazon would get these (and at a reasonable price). They are excellent! 4
Our cats thrive extremely well on this dry cat food.  They definitely have much less hair ball throw ups and their fur is great.  They are fit and not over weight.  This vendor ships extremely fast.  Is one of the top Amazon suppliers in our book! 5
I have ordered this several times and like the fairly rich taste without any bitterness. It is also very smooth and is one of the better K-cups that I have found so far. 5
I use this as my morning coffee wake up call.  I continue to re-order it because I like the medium roast flavor. 4
I bought this based on my experience in europe. I figured it was Italian and would taste as much of the coffees did when last I visited Europe, Bold and stout. Also, I was drawn in by the words "La Crema"...meant strong and with much head like a beer I thought.Unfortunately, the coffee was much like a regular, everyday folgers blend, kinda bland and fairly regular. Buy it if you like regular coffee but pass otherwise. 2
Firstly, these chips look better than how they are depicted on on the bag. With that being said, it's a corn chip that has olive flavor. There are specks of olive in the chip, but being it's a corn chip to start with, it's hard to recognize them. The taste is distinctly "olive" and the salt content is just about right for my taste. I tend to like my chips a bit on the salty side. They have a good amount of "crunch".<br /><br />I can't say whether I'd purchase them again. I suppose if the price was right I would. However, I have issues paying a premium for junk food. You can dress it up in a nice bag, put a great name on it, but it's still junk food- it's a corn chip. I'm much more likely to purchase the better known simple brands carried by my local grocery store. 3
My four mixed breed dogs (40lbs-100lbs)gobble up Newman's Own dog treats.  But, these terrific dogs gobble up just about anything (except fresh green leafy vegetables), so perhaps their standards shouldn't be the mark of "goodness".<br /><br />I'm an ingredient list reader for all foods (human & animal), so that is what I did when I received the Newman's pet treats.  The ingredient list is short & consists of the following:<br /><br />Organic Barley, Organic Lamb, Organic Carrots, Organic Apples, Organic Palm Oil (Preserved with Mixed Tocopherois, a Source of Vitamin E), Organic Molasses<br /><br />The treats themselves are rectangular & scored in the middle.  They are 2" x 1-/4" for the full size & 1" x 1-1/4" for the 1/2 size.  They do not have a strong smell, but a hint of apple is noticeable (& a grain smell, which I presume is the barley).  My 10oz bag came with 18 full size treats.<br /><br />I like the rectangular shape of the treat.  Sometimes my large dogs get excited about treats & forget about "nicely".  With the rectangular shape, my hands won't fall victim to an enthusiastic chomp.  Since the treats are scored down the middle, I can break them down, so my older, smaller dogs can easily eat the treat.<br /><br />Overall, I think the ingredients are excellent for a dog treat, and it is nice that they are adaptable for different sized dogs. 5
This was a new product to me.  They were very tasty, crisp, and surprisingly delicious.  I was very pleased with this product. 5
What is it really?  I'm not going to purchase it unless there is clarification.  Plastic bottle?  Black Walnut extract is too precious to waste in a plastic container. 1
My husband enjoyed this coffee. We usually use Newman's Extra Bold but thought we<br />would try something different. It was a bit too strong for me; I prefer Newman's. But it was<br />still good. 4
I have a Melitta One:One machine and have been using Juan Valdez pods in it.  When I ran out I searched for pods for it & only came up with these Melitta-brand ones. I figured (incorrectly) that the others weren't available & purchased these. VERY disappointing.  My coffee had been nice, strong & tasty, but coffee made with these is weak & tasteless.  I bought a 4-box package of three different types & am now stuck with them. Forget these & head to Juan Valdez (same price range) unless you like weak coffee. 2
These are not particularly flavorful and the texture on your tongue is like chalk. There isn't any nutritional information for calorie and sugar content. So bad that I won't even try to give them away. I wouldn't want to ruin a child's Halloween! 1
Original review: You would think the difference would be negligible, but there is a huge taste and texture difference between these nuts and your run of the mill Planters or Fisher nuts. Too expensive to buy all the time (I am on low carb and snack on nuts a lot), but definitely worth getting for a lovely little gnosh now and then!<br /><br />Update second purchase 6/1/2011 Dropped from a 5 star rating to a run of the mill 2 star rating. They were on sale so I ordered two bags - big mistake. These are nowhere near as good as the first bag I bought. The nuts are less fresh and 1 pound 10.9 oz of these nuts were almonds and cashews, probably more than that because I ate a few of them, so probably about 6oz of these nuts were something besides almond/blanched almonds/cashews - too bad because the last bag I bought seemed to have more of the "goodies" and less of the filler nuts and a lot of the pecans were flat and hard, as are some of the almonds. Given a choice between these and the Planters deluxe w/macadamia, I'd have to go with Planters...too bad, they were awesome. Guess I'll return that second bag. :(  (I don't really like almonds and cashews all that much)<br /><br />I can no longer enthusiastically recommend them...what a shame. I was really looking forward to this delivery. :( 2
I almost didn't buy this from my local high-end grocery store because the price was so outrageous, but I'm glad I decided to go for it.  This is one of the better gluten-free cereals I've had.  It is not just like Cheerios, of course, but it has a pleasant taste of its own with just the right amount of sweetness added to make it flavorful.  It doesn't get soggy immediately like some gluten-free cereals, nor does it have that familiar "cardboard" texture those of us with celiac know all too well.  This product seems to have avoided the usual gluten-free problems, and I give the makers credit for that.<br /><br />I think it could have a little more cinnamon taste to it -- of course, I can always just add some myself -- and the price is still high compared to similar gluten-free cereals, regardless of where you buy it, but I think it's definitely worth trying if you're on a gluten-free diet and need something palatable.  I'll buy this again. 4
This is a great product, but at a price that is ridiculous.  Costco was offering this product at 6.99 for a box of 4.  That is $1.75 a packet.  Why is this vendor selling this same product at over twice the cost, when they probably have half the overhead as Costco.  I love the product, but refuse to buy at this price. 3
This stuff is really gross - I tried the lemon-lime and the berry. Neither were good, but the berry was a little better. I have also tried chilling them and transfering to a glass. Nothing seems to help. Add that to the fact, that I got nothing from these. Nothing at all. Not worth the money to me. By reading the label, I can see why - they contain vitamins, enzymes, and a little caffeine - products I ingest daily anyway....maybe if you don't take vitamins or drink caffeine, these can help you. 1
I tried this because you could not get any more of mrs. leepers and I found that in my opinion, mrs. leepers is a better rice pasta. 3
LOVE THEM !<br />It took me forever to find these.<br />Everyone who I have given them to to try has loved them & want MORE!<br />Shipping is on the high side though. 4
This is the perfect dipping chocolate.  Makes excellent chocolate covered Oreos, fruit, etc.  Comes in a large bar. 4
If all I wanted was a date flavored bar I'd have bought a date bar.  As a date bar they're ok, just relabel them as such. 2
I'm a tea drinker now even though I used to drink lots of coffee.  Most coffee is too strong and bitter for my taste.  But I dragged out my little Mr. Coffee machine and was pleasantly surprised with the taste.  It smells nice and is ground pretty fine.  I'm incorporating it into my daily intake of caffeine now and will definitely finish the bag. 4
This rosehip tea is surprisingly good, reminds me slightly of rhubarb with a subtle regular black tea undertone. The package did take 9 days to arrive & it was all crushed up inside the jiffy-bag so it's a good job it wasn't ordered as a gift. I also think the price is a bit steep for teabags. I just couldn't find this flavor in supermarkets, so I had to get it online. 4
I've been looking over some alternatives to dairy drinks to go with my meals. Plus, I might add the meals of my little boy (3.5 years). So, I was looking around in a nearby Trader Joe's  and found this interesting Pacific Natural Foods Organic Almond non-dairy beverage. It has a good, if somewhat bland, flavor and goes down easily very much like a low-fat milk. The calories per serving are moderate but the fat is a little high. I should add that the fat is non-saturated and non-trans and there is no cholesterol. The 50-50 sodium to potassium ratio is about ideal. I think the drink is a little low in protein that I should substitute it for milk in my boy's diet. All in all, I'm favorably impressed and this was my first experience with an almond beverage. I'd have to rate it good, but not great.<br /><br />Gary Peterson 3
This is a heavy kettle style chip that is not as "heavy" as kettle brand chips, but bas good flavor.  I will reorder. 5
I do not like this product at all.  It is expensive and especially if you give it away.  It has a very nasty taste that I cannot describe.  The more you use the worse it gets.  I am going back to other things.  Perhaps AGAVE or I may go back to Nevella, which I think is as good as Splenda and Equal.  Only I dont know what Nevella is made from.  At least I can bare the taste. 1
Not good at all. Didnt like the candies. And you cant even return them. Total waste of money. Candies are so hard that you cant even get the taste of liquor. The liquor filled chocolates from Anthony Berg is way much better. 1
I will say upfront that there are very few dark chocolates that I like. I'm a fan of Ghiradelli, and Lindt, but not most of the others I've tried. The Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate was tasty, but the texture wasn't as smooth as some of the others I've tried. I'd say it's better than most (say, Hershey's Dark) but still needs tweaking to be as good as Lindt. 3
This is a really good product. I had a little trouble the first couple times because I didnt tighten the lid down but besides that it is a good item. 4
The nuts were stale and tastless. I tried to get a refund but you said it could not be refunded. I threw them out. 1
Until I tried Vienna Coffee House, Donut Shop was the one I had on automatic monthly delivery.  Vienna Coffee House is a tad bolder than Donut Shop but very smooth without any bitterness.  From the first cup, I knew I had to switch. 5
It was very dry, and a lot of Grissel, Looks like they left the string on the roast when they served it. 3
These little cans, especially when very cold, are very refreshing.  It tastes great! I liked their blend of kiwi and berry because you can actually taste the kiwi in this drink. The carbonation is just right as well, it adds tanginess without coming back up my nose or giving me gas.  Which I think, is a big plus because it is a common problem many other carbonated drinks have.<br /><br />So they got the flavor and the carbonation right.  However....<br /><br />Personally, I like more than eight 1/2 ounces in a beverage.  I'm a 210 pound guy and when I'm thirsty 8 1/2 isn't going to do it.  But then I looked at the calories --- 134!<br /><br />Holy smokes!  There is only 100 calories in a regular Coke. So I looked at the ingredients expecting the manufacture added a ton of sugar.<br /><br />Nope! All natural ingredients including the lightly carbonated water in Switch drinks. This is also a big plus but at some point I would think they would scale back the fruit juice to water ratio to keep the natural sugar level lower.<br /><br />I think they make a tasty, natural product but it's not for me because its too small and has too many calories. 4
The beverage has a really delicious spiced smell.  However, just a sip made my entire mouth feel stung.  The sensation faded to a tingle and finally passed, but for me, this drink is too strong.  The taste was fine, just not the sensation.  A second sip was all to similar to the first and so I passed on the rest of the cup. 4
Now keep in mind that I'm kind of a coffee snob, but I rarely have time to grind and press my own coffee.  I use the Senseo pods simply for convenience sake.  And since they have different flavors, I figured I'd give them a try.<br /><br />Now Senseo coffee in general tends to be better than most any store pre-ground, canned, or mass produced brand, like Folgers or Maxwell House.  But that's not saying a whole lot.  I find these to be kind of bitter, but the one saving grace is that I like the frothy finish.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is the inconsistency.  When I initially wrote this review, I was drinking my first package that came in a four-pack.  It actually tasted kind of fresh, and I liked it.  However, the next two packages were quite stale.  I have now tried a different brand of coffee pod which really blows this one out of the water.<br /><br />One to help make better coffee with your Senseo coffee maker:  Don't brew as soon as the red light stops flashing.  Let it warm up a few more minutes before you hit the brew button.<br /><br />Also, there are some pretty good pods out there, and they are not expensive.  You can even get fair trade and organic blends along with single origin coffees.  Shop around.  The Senseo brand pods are about the worst pods I've tried, but since they are better than Folgiers, I give them two stars. 2
I had high hopes for these. I mean, crunchy cheese, what's not to love?  But they have more of a "processed" taste than I would have liked.  I found myself having trouble finishing the tiny half ounce bag.  I gave them a fair chance, kept an open mind, but after three bags I'm going to have to find someone to give the rest to.  The flavor is definitely more salt than cheese.  Perhaps the other flavors would be better but since it was a pure love of cheese that lead to the purchase, I'm really not interested in trying any of the other flavors.  Oh well, it was worth a try. 2
This coffee's main advantage is its size!<br /><br />The coffee itself is nothing special and it certainly does not deserved to be labelled as a "medium" roast coffee.  In fact I wonder, how weak must Gevalia's mild brews must be.<br /><br />I was excited about the variety of coffees when I purchased my Tassimo but so far I have been disappointed by all except the Starbuck's blends (which are pricier).  I made a special trip to the US to purchase a few packages of these since many comments pointed towards a comparable alternative to the Starbucks.<br /><br />Having gone through a few now, I'd argue that it's the same as the Nabob Morning Roast sold in Canada.<br /><br />Now back to the size argument, if you had an extra 3oz to the Starbuck's house blend, you will have much richer tasting 12 oz cup of medium roast coffee. 2
The cups came in a brown paper bag that was crumbled like it had been used several times.  The receipt I got said 24 K-cups and this site said 22 K-cups.  Disappointed.  I purchased this for a gift and it looks horrible to get as a gift. 1
These satiate my need for either a quick breakfast or something to eat in the afternoon for a snack when I need something I can carry in my purse. I've tried the lemon and the apple pie. I've very please with them both, but I didn't have unrealistic expectations for them. We, socially, have his idea that for example if we're unwrapping the lemon bar it's going to be bright yellow, vibrant, and very lemony. Not the case. They come out brown and nutty with a light, fragrant lemon flavor. The apple pie is the same. Unwrapped it is a brownie sized cut of brown apple pulp with ample nuts mixed in; very simple, tasty, and meets my need for a quick boost of fruit that won't immediate spoil like buying the freshest of produce might. 4
The ease of preparation for BARILLA's fusilli w/veggy marinara is more than offset by aroma and taste.<br /><br />To prepare, a corner of the top seal is lifted to vent a sauce tray. Nuked for a minute, everything's hot.<br /><br />When you peel back the rest of the cover you're hit with an unsavory odor, can't call it an aroma, that doesn't stimulate the appetite.<br /><br />Lift the sauce tray out, spoon the gravy over the pasta, and there isn't enough to cover all. eh<br /><br />The first bite reveals that the smell you immediately noticed is part of the food's taste. This stuff's edible, but only if there isn't something else available.<br /><br />NUTRITION FACTS: 50 of the 9 oz. serving's 320 calories derive from fat, mostly saturated. It's a good source of fiber (44% RDA) has 57 grams of carbs, a zero cholesterol rating (despite saturated fats), and is high in sodium (710 mg, or 30% of RDA). One serving provides 25% of your Vitamin A needs, 15% of iron, 6% of calcium.<br /><br />And yet, after my free Vine serving, I would never buy BARILLA's nukeable pasta and wouldn't eat it again if comped in advance. 2
NEAT LITTLE PRODUCT. SEEMS TO SHIP ONLY IN THE FALL, WINTER AND SPRING. HOWEVER, I PREFER OTHER BRANDS WHICH HAVE LARGER BOTTLES. THESE ARE DINKY. 3
I consider this in the category of what should be quick, easy, edible food. However, the instructions are a bit more complicated than I like for food in this category. If I open this box, it is because I am short on time and need something quick and easy. However, here are the instructions:<br />1. Brown 1 pound of chicken (cut into 1 inch pieces) in a large skillet<br />2. Add 2 1/2 cps of water, seasoning and pasta. Bring to a boil<br />3. Cover and stir often for 7 minutes. Add broccoli; cover and cook until most of the water is gone, about 2 - 4 minutes. Remove from heat.<br />4. Add cheese with Velveeta cheese sauce pouch. Stir in cheese sauce<br /><br />Since some of those steps actually have multiple steps embedded inside them, this goes from and easy dump and heat meal to a more complicated recipe. For the same amount of work I can this same meal - just with fresh broccoli and ingredients I can actually pronounce.<br /><br />Now, I am no food snob - I actually enjoy the microwave version of the Velveeta broccoli and cheese pasta. Its just that the instructions for that meal is simply open the cup, dump in the broccoli dust, fill to line with water, microwave and stir in cheese sauce. For this amount of effort, the pretty much a similar product - I will pass in the future.<br /><br />Now, if you just really like the taste of Velveeta over other brands of "cheese sauce" and want a meal where all you have to do is add chicken - this is for you. However, this doesn't fit the bill for "quick and easy" and the flavor doesn't compare to fixing the same meal, in the same amount of time - with fresh or frozen broccoli and your own spices. Don't get me wrong, it isn't terrible; just not the ease I would be looking for in a box. 3
The plant in the picture looks so much greener and healthier than what I received in the mail today.  The pot is a very inexpensive 'growers' pot, and does not add at all to the over-all look and appeal of this half-dead plant.  My plant contains two braided brown trunks with no foliage, and three yellowish stalks with yellowed leafs.  The 'braid' is held together at the top with a green bread twist-tie.  Over all, I wish I had spent a little more money and ordered a better plant from a different supplier, and I should have made sure the pot was nice enough to keep the plant in for some time while adding to the decor of my home.  With the ill-health of this plant, I am afraid to upgrade the planter/pot as I might further stress this suffering little thing.  Maybe this one should have been called the "waste of money tree'.  If you really want one of these, look elsewhere - this one is just not worth it. 2
This tastes bitter and sort of...fishy? The Jesper mate I got from Argentina was VASTLY superior. I'm not sure what they do to this Eco Tea brand, but I tell you, something ain't right. I went in without expectations, I'm not really a mate snob or anything -- this just really isn't very good. I'd steer clear and spring for something more authentic, unless you really just don't know any better. 2
I bought the vanilla, orange, mango, lemon and peach flavors of these.  They are OKAY in hot foods - I used them in herbal teas and to punch up my orange chicken.  However, these were only good in hot foods and in very small quantities.  They were extremely bitter and were completely useless in cold foods because even a couple drops made the item so bitter the food was inedible.  Even in hot foods the bitterness came out after a couple drops.  Save your money and use a better brand like truvia and just flavor your food with pure extracts from the baking aisle.  No bitterness and you get to control the level of flavor. 2
love my Taffy<br />She's so laffy<br />Her name is Bit O' Honey<br />She gives me a kiss<br />Oh what, "A Bliss" 5
Ive been craving some deer jerky for a while so i gave this one and some others on amazon a try. This one was very sinue and a little too sweet for my taste. Not going to buy again. Im still on my search for the salty dry version im after 2
I switched to Decaf and was looking for a decent cup on the Keurig machine.  I was only interested in Subscribe and Save options.<br /><br />This is a fairly light roast, which I like.  I brew on the middle setting and I think if it was brewed any larger I would think it was too light. 4
Won't eat 'em! Hence the three stars as I wanted to keep it neutral. As always your mileage may vary. Some cats probably really like these things.<br /><br />She's not totally wild about Cosequin either, even though I think that's probably the best formula for kitty arthritis. If you your cat is fussy but they like stuff like Laxatone, give them Feline Joint Gel. She practically does a happy dance when I get the tube out. And I can really see a difference in her ability to jump up on furniture when I give her the glucosamine supplements. Just not this one. 3
Ok, I can't speak for when the last review was written, which looks like 2009, but I'm looking at the back of a bag of Almond Crunch and it clearly says that the product is made in California, not China. So if that was the main deterent back then, it's no longer an issue. I just discovered this snack and as a person who can't eat either gluten, soy, or dairy, I am thrilled to find a snack I can eat first of all, and a snack I can eat that is actually tasty, even better! I've been eating these for a few days now and no adverse reactions (and I have an extremely sensitive stomach). I plan on trying out all the flavors to figure out which ones I like the best but yeah, I'd highly recommend this product to those on restricted diets and even to those who aren't. 5
I bought this device and use a brand new sure 52 with it.<br /><br />The noise and feedback I received with this device was horrible - I might have a bad unit.<br /><br />When I called customer service, a real person answered right away and offered to expedite getting me a new unit. (Very cool and is why I gave them 3 stars for now)<br /><br />I'll see how that process goes and update my review. 3
These are the worst gluten free cookies I have ever tasted.  They were hard, dry and tasted like tapioca flour.  Avoid these at all cost. 1
This is a high-quality food, but I think it's best for young, active dogs.  I bought it for my 11 year old mixed breed because he needs grain-free food for his itching.  It worked for that, and he loved the taste.  However, he's had some problems recently, and blood tests showed liver inflammation, as well as elevated cholesterol and very high triglycerides.  NONE of the problems were caused by TOTW, but it's extremely high in fat and protein, so it's exactly wrong as a maintenance diet for a dog like him.  Many older dogs have similar problems, so unless your older dog has had recent, comprehensive blood-testing, you may not want to put him/her on such a rich food.  My dog is improving on a low fat, moderate protein diet.  If I had a young dog getting plenty of exercise, a food with a minimum of 18% fat and 32% protein would probably be just fine. 3
Seeing the word "tangy" on the front of the box, I had high hopes of a refreshingly tart, vibrant raspberry herbal tea.  Instead I found it less like tea and more like a weakly flavored cup of liquid raspberry J-ello!  Leaving the bag in longer doesn't help either.  The first cup I made, I got distracted and the bag was left to steep 30 minutes before I took a sip.  I'll be switching back to Tazo Passion as soon as I finish the box. 2
What can i say, I love iced tea. I drink a lot of it, and love the convenience of these new individual serving size packets. I am also a big fan of Stash products, or rather of all the other stash products I have tried.<br />I purchased a case of all 4 varieties,  (when i say i drink iced tea, i am not kidding) and these were all way too weak when i mixed them in my 16 ounces water bottle.<br />I finally found that i needed to dissolve 2 packets in a small bit of hot water first (if not the tea clumped on me), and than add a packet of sweetener before adding the rest of the water just to make these palatable.<br />unfortunately by doing that to this flavor, the ginger was out of control, and not in a good ginger tea sort of way.<br />Over all I am very dissatisfied with the product and will stick with the other brands that are out on the market. 2
After using French Vanilla creamer in other coffees, I made the jump to French Vanilla coffee.  What a mistake.  Definitely not the same.  Not even close.  This coffee is weak and the french vanilla flavor is barely noticeable to me.  Ended up pitching the rest and going with that amazing Italian Blend, also by Timothy's. 2
Tase is good, not as bold as I prefer. But I love strong coffee.  But the reason I cannot give 5 stars is THREE times now I have had a brewing problem that I have not had with other brands.  TWO TIMES, the coffee went all over the brewing part and not a straight shot into the cup.  Today, I noticed several grains in my cup, so rathr than waste a cup, I strained it through a filter and enjoyed my cup.  I have bought Tully's before, but nt from this seller. Wonder why the problems so many of us are reporting? 2
I ordered this box of caramellos in June, thinking they would somehow keep them cool. There was a packet of some kind of cooling gel in the package, but they are all melted. Probably best not to order them in the warmer months. 2
I received a sample of this product for a "try and tell" program. This is a pre-made food, so of course it does not taste like homemade. That said, it is ok. It does have 5 grams of fiber in it, which is nice. So it is a nice and convenient snack if you are trying to watch your weight and boost your fiber. Banana nut isn't really my favorite flavor. I think I would like it better if it came in cinnamon apple. 3
Good texture.  Not too sweet.  But the walmartt version of these I believe is a lot cheaper and tastes about the same. 4
This item was received promptly. I purchased it as a substitute for honey, and it is a little thinner than I expected. It's also not as sweet as I expected. I had to add additional artificial sweetener to my recipe to get the same sweetness as honey. It's vegan, so I will continue to use it. 4
I like this coffee. It smells good while brewing and tastes as good as it smells. for a decaf coffee it is very good<br />will definitely buy this at my local store. 5
I do not expect miracles from Taco Bell and this certainly is not a miracle.<br /><br />it is bland, with a hint of spice.  Might be better titles "Chipotle Sauce For People Who Do Not Like Spicy Food".<br /><br />The closest I can come is to say it tastes like generic ranch dressing with a hint of Chipotle flavor.  I think you could safely give this to a five year old without fear of burning anything.<br /><br />it's not bad, makes a decent dipping sauce for chicken nuggets but don't expect any real "zing" to your cooking with this<br /><br />I'll admit my wife took one sniff and declined but she hates *anything* even vaguely hot and while this is not very hot at all, you do get a hint of spice in it.<br /><br />With green peppers a "1" and Habaneros a "10", this is about a "1.1" on the heat sscale.  It's not bad but it's not great and if you expect real spice and heat, try elsewhere on Amazon.<br /><br />(May I suggest <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00061EPZO">TABASCO brand Chipotle Pepper Sauce 5oz.</a> for a real Chipotle experience?)<br /><br />Or if you want to go full gonzo: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M0ETJ6">HOT SAUCE FROM HELL, DEVIL'S REVENGE, HABANERO, from Ass Kickin'</a> 3
I was somewhat disappointed with this coffee purchased thru Amazon, as I had got previously the Starbucks VIA ready brew coffee, decaf Colombia Roast which I enjoyed very much. 3
This is a very strong tasting bar.  It is not very sweet tasting. It is close to imposible to eat this with out a large drink. Does not seem to be very satisfying as an afternoon snack. 4
I bought this because I felt I wasn't getting enough vegetable in my diet at college, and I'm sure that it has done a terrific job stuffing my system full of nutrients, but I am always hesitant to take it because of a few reasons.  First of all, as I'm sure must be expected, this powder (when mixed with water, of course) has a god awful taste. Thankfully, the drink doesn't taste all too bad in the moment, but the aftertaste leaves you looking remarkably like a cat wheezing out a hairball. This might be due to the fact that the powder doesn't dissolve fully into the water, and instead all sifts down to the bottom of the glass, such that when you reach the end of the drink you're literally drinking a gritty green sludge (even if you stir vigorously and then drink it immediately). The only other reason that I have any qualms with this product, is because you're forced to use so much water to mix it into, that you overload your stomach with liquid and it sloshes about for a surprisingly long time. This always leaves me feeling nauseated, and I always end up burping excessively and having the fight the urge to vomit.<br /><br />All in all, I'm happy this product exists, but I wish there was some way to make it dissolve more effectively, or simply taste ever so slightly better. I've heard that mixing in a packet of Emergen-C does wonders for the taste, and I've also considered mixing the powder into something like apple juice to help the taste.  In any case, I'd still consider it a worthwhile product with just a few understandable drawbacks. 3
The low acidity of this coffee is probably a good thing for folks that have trouble with that sort of thing. I found the taste to be lacking and a bit bitter. I brewed it weak and strong and prefered it on the weak side.  It's not a bad tasting coffee just not my cup of...coffee. 2
We have an Australian Shephard puppy and she's been working on this antler for a few days now and she's given up.  It's just too hard for her to enjoy.  Perhaps she will enjoy it when she's a little older. 2
I was so excited to try a new BOLD coffee.....needless to say, I am disappointed. I would rate this coffee as a MEDIUM. If it would have been listed as a MEDIUM, I would have given it a higher rating because this is truly a MEDIUM strength coffee in taste and flavor. I will still drink it from time to time- flavor is smooth, not bitter. Overall, I wish that I would have ordered some more Jet Fuel or Black Tiger. 3
They were $2.50 at the grocery store when I flew back home over Christmas. I bought four and brought them back with me, still paying less than these distributors.<br /><br />Buy the powder, but not on amazon. 2
My four kids LOVE these, it's great that there's zero nasty stuff in it like grocery store 'fruit' (ie total chemical junk) snacks. A 'safe' kid snack! 5
If you use these raw, then be aware each bag had pieces of broken shells. I use them in hot cereal and salads and have had the less than joyful experience of biting down on a hard shell piece.<br /><br />If you care about your teeth, you may want to buy them whole and break them up yourself. I've never found a shell in the whole ones. 1
This product is so light weight. It is easily tipped over. The plastic is not very heavy and if the dog is very rough with it at all, the doors can snap off, even break off which was the experience that I had with the first one I owned.<br />I would not recomment this product. 3
Ok, yes, this particular whey protein doesn't contain artificial sweeteners or other stuff you don't want in your diet but it really tastes awful and I haven't found a satisfactory way to dress it up.  I tried putting it in my coffee...it just ruined my normally delicious cup of coffee.  I tried putting it in juice but I had to make the juice (from frozen) really concentrated to make it taste ok..and then it still smells awful.  Jarrows whey may be better than 30 others out there but it's still not good enough to make me happy to take it.  I always like it when other reviewers tell me what's a better option so here's my advice.  Buy a jug of Optimum Nutrition Solid Gold.  It has fake sweeteners which I don't like but it tastes really good in a glass of skim milk! I'll probably throw the rest of this Jarrows whey in the garbage (unless I figure out how to cook with it or something). 2
What is pictured and what you recieve is not the same!  The picture when I ordered had 6 or 7 different flavors pictured, one being banana, which is the main reason I ordered and I recieved only original flavors.  I will not recommend this seller and will never order from them again! 2
I use this product daily, and it provides a steady stream of energy.  I do not get jittery or crash.  It also helps me practice portion control because it acts as a slight appetite suppressant. 5
I was a bit disappointed when I received these.  I'm only glad I paid the subscription price and not the regular price!  The individual bags themselves are pretty small.  I had never had this mix before.  It is difficult to eat since the pieces are so small!  Especially the blueberries and sunflower seeds.  And this mix definitely has A LOT of sunflower seeds.  Will probably not buy again as there are other nut/berry mixes I like much better. 3
I usually am not a big fan  of iced coffee drinks, but this one was not bad. It was not sickly sweet, and had a decent flavor.<br /><br />My only complaint was the size of the can/amount of product. In my opinion, it was too small. 4
For the price, I was expecting better. I used this in my air popper. Quite a few unpopped kernals. Did not pop up as big and fluffy as my usual cheapo (1.28 for 2 lbs.)Great Value brand popcorn. I'm going to stick with the Wal-Mart brand and save money. 2
I received a single serving packet of this item for review. Frankly, it was nasty. I prepared it according to the instructions on the product (add 1 cup of hot water, stir and serve instantly). Yuck. Considering that it was supposed to taste like ginger, honey and perhaps a little lemon flavor - I was not pleased. Then I tried putting it over ice and yes, adding a little sugar. No improvement. I can't see recommending the beverage, buying this or encouraging others to use it despite the medicinal qualities of ginger for motion sickness or the nausea of pregnancy, etc. It did absolutely nothing for my digestion, either.<br /><br />I am sure whether or not you like this will be wholly a matter of personal taste. It was not for me! 2
It's a bit odd that this particular flavor of Salada green tea is even titled decaffeinated, but NO where on the actual box does it state that it is decaffeinated. Salada's website says their green teas are decaffeinated - but if so, why not state it on the box itself? Some of their flavored teas (eg, purple antioxidants) DO come with a decaffeinated label on the box. This one does not, whether purchased at Amazon or in my local supermarket. 3
I purchased this coffee because I tend to like Kona blends, but this is far from the best of the bunch.  I rate it average because that's how it tastes. Nothing there to make me want to purchase it again when I have tasted other brands that were better. Unfortunately a five pound bag will last a long time. 3
This pump seems to work well. My only problem is that it loses prime and must be pumped a couple of times to get the syrup into the nozzel. Not a big deal though. It sure makes metering the syrup easier than pouring it out of the bottle. 4
There is no question that Progresso has made some excellent and tasty soups for all to enjoy. That has been the case with their chicken soups over the years. But this one isn't bad, but could have been better. The Progresso Chicken & Orzo with Lemon tastes good, with a lot of orzo pasta in it, and tasty pieces of chicken. Yet, my only gripe with the soup is that I honestly wish that there could have been a bit more lemon zest right into each and every bite I could taste from the soup. Still, it is a nice twist for a longtime favorite lover of soups. I do hope though that Progresso can improve the taste of this one though for anyone who loves a bit of a twist into the classic Chicken Soup.<br /><br />Price: B-<br /><br />Taste: B<br /><br />Overall: B- 4
not what I expected, but not bad. The taste is fine, just very cloudy in appearance. I was hoping to find a "clear" green tea....maybe it just isn't out there. 3
One of six pieces of rind would pop.  The one that puffed up was great but not worth time or money. 2
I am having to throw this piece of junk out after having it for just over a year because they won't service it because the warranty is up and there is nobody in my area who can. This is the second time it breaks. The first time they fixed it and made me pay the shipping charges... which ended up to be expensive because I had to buy a box and all the packaging materials too! But now it broke and there is nothing they will do! Terrible product and even worse customer service! 1
While the taste of the gum was about average, the fun of reading the insult more than made up for it. 3
Yes, they are good. However, they are absolutely inundated with the flavoring stuff, which is initially satisfying then becomes "too much". And certainly isn't good for the waistline or general nutritional issues.<br /><br />AND the package can't be opened without a sharp implement. I couldn't pull it apart at the top as I am used to doing. I don't normally carry a knife or scissors and don't have rodent teeth. Well, I was hungry and was able to rip the bag using my car key. Even then, the bag was *wow* thick and tough.<br /><br />On the package it says these are "Krinkle Cut" chips. Turns out that means the corrugated kind, not what I wanted. I don't eat ripple/ridged style chips any more because they take the skin off the roof of my mouth. So this information is important.<br /><br />These are good but so are other brands with which I don't have these problems. 3
I have tried other brands of French Vanilla coffee and this is the best.  Highly recommend it. 5
The candy company that provided the Zagnuts is #1 in our book, because when we had an issue with the "heat," they took care of it in a timely manner. We strongly recommend doing business with them!!! You need to always promote a company that puts service and customer satisfaction as their priority. :) 4
These may be good for you, but they taste absolutely terrible.  I'm a huge fan of healthy food that is good for you, but these taste HORRIBLE.  They taste very little like fruit and very much like sulfates and preservatives.  I would return them if I could, they aren't even palatable.  I tried to give them away for free and failed, the only way I might be able to choke these down would be in sugared oatmeal.  Not even space food, just definitely not food. 1
Well, what they said.  Been drinking Keemun for years and love it, but this is just bland, and now I've got a pound of it.  Find something else. 2
I LOVE Merrick's products. I bought the Ranger Rib and was disappointed when I made my 6 month old German Shepherd mix spit out a small and very sharp shard he chewed off. It would have been easy for that piece to cut through his intestines if he were to swallow it. Hopefully he didn't swallow any pieces while I wasn't looking; I only had my eyes off him for maybe 8 minutes before he chewed through it.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this unless you watch your dog like a hawk while he/she chews it or if it's bought for a small dog that can't break off pieces easily -- there are other Merrick's bones that are much better; I bought "The Sarge" and my dog loves it! 3
Our cabinets are filled with every salt-free seasoning there is. We rely heavily on Mrs. Dash, and really love it. However, I saw this listed on Amazon.com, and it was the first time I had ever seen it. Based on good reviews, I not only purchased it for my house, but sent a package to family members with heart issues. Now that we have all used it, the reviews are in -- all of them great. So far, we've used Cavender's on chicken cutlets, whole roast chicken, talapia and cold pasta salad with chopped vegetables. We love it and will make it a definite part of our spice rotation.<br /><br />If you are looking for something new to zest up the flavor of salt-free food, Cavender's All Purpose Greek Seasoning is really quite good! 5
I don't know what to say that others have not covered. If you like potato chips you will like these. Get em on sale when you can and limit your intake...if you can... 4
To start, I'm a big fan of Blue Diamond brand Almonds. I really like the bold flavors, Habanero BBQ and Lime & Chili. I had never seen the Blazin' Buffalo Wing flavor at the local grocery store so I ordered them here on Amazon.<br /><br />When you first put an almond in your mouth you get the initial hint of buffalo wing flavor but it quickly goes away and then just tastes kind of strange.<br /><br />They aren't bad but they aren't my favorite. Every bodies taste buds are different so you might like them but I don't think I'll buy this flavor again. 3
people need to know from the seller how thin these sticks are because you think when you order your getting a good deal on price then you get them and they are thin and<br />you feel ripped off. They stink really bad. Bully sticks are a bulls penis. I looked that up on the internet. Yes dogs love them, but please supervise your pet as they get down to a nub quickly and could cause choking. 2
My dog loved the taste. They are perfect for a treat, but once a pill of ANY size was inserted, he would find it, spit it out and eat the treat. Maybe for some dogs, but did not work for mine. 2
WILD RIDE WAS A LOT BETTER WHEN I STARTED EATING IT A FEW YEARS BACK. THE NEW PURCHASE OF SEVERAL BAGS (ATE TWO SO FAR) HAS BEEN DISAPPOINTING. FLAVOR PROFILE HAS CHANGED AND PRODUCT IS TOUGH AND DRY. GOING TO LOOK FOR A NEW REPLACEMENT BRAND. TOO BAD. PROBABLY GOT TOOK FOR A WILD RIDE (CRASHING) WITH THIS PURCHASE. 2
I guess you could sum it up by saying, "you get what you pay for."  While it was a good price for the product and it was shipped and received in a timely manner, the product itself tasted less than fresh.  So far, the  cookie/candy bars that we've had have had an after-taste of an unfresh product. 2
You can get it cheaper at stores, around $3.00 each.<br />I'm not sure why would I buy 4 boxes at a time and pay more than $3.00 each. 3
These are absolutely awful. I like Stonewall's Jerkee, and Tofurky Jerky, and even normal Primal Sticks aren't bad... so I thought these would be right up my alley. They taste terrible and have an awful texture. It's like eating spiced crumbly rubber -- I couldn't get a whole one down but even if I could, I wouldn't feel safe eating it because it feels like it would take forever to be digested. I'm embarrassed that my desire for vegan jerky was so gluttonous that I spent so much on things that ended up so terrible! 2
I purchased this product as an alternative to a rawhide. Our 5 month old German Shorthair Pointer puppy ate it in a matter of 6 minutes or less. She loved it, but it was more of an expensive treat.<br /><br />With a puppy, I needed something to satisfy her chewing urge. The treat fractured into small bits all over the floor but our dog was willing to pick those up. The pieces looked rather sharp and that was a concern. Others mentioned it was made in China and I would like to add the first ingredient is corn.  It might last longer for very small dogs. 2
I love coconut but this bar is a disappointment.  The first bite had an odd flavor but after a couple more it got a bit better.  The problem is that it's very oily, they put way too much rice syrup and it's literally juicy with oil when you bite into it.  At 246 calories, 14g fat 33g carbs and 29g sugar, this bar is not worth it at all. 2
these almost disappeared before i had a chance to get a taste! Everyone loved, even teens visiting who don't eat a gluten free diet...teen age son asked "are these really gluten free, they're good!" 4
The bar is a sticky mess inside a wrapper that can't be pulled away from the "bar".  The flavor is good, but much of the contents remain stuck to the wrapper.  If you do manage to pull the wrapping away, the contents sag and fall apart.  I have had other Kind bars and liked them, but will not buy this variety again. 2
this was my first time buying the hextra chews for my two dogs. they like them but i had no idea that it would leave stains on my rugs, carpet and furniture since the product description had no warning of this. i read some reviews where others didn't have this staining problem so maybe i just got a bad batch? even so, i wouldn't recommend the hextra chews just incase and would suggest getting the other version, C.E.T. Enzymatic Oral Hygiene Chews. they are just as good for the dogs teeth without the chance of staining plus are less costly. also my dogs do tend to gag on them once they've chewed the large size piece down small enough to where they think they can just swallow it whole. eventually they do spit it up and realize they need to chew it a bit more. the product and my dogs vet mentions that the C.E.T. chews are easier on digestion than other rawhide chews so i don't feel as concerned with my dogs swallowing the small pieces. 2
If you like the sour taste almost as if there is a lemon additive in your coffee... go for it! Not for me. 1
Cadbury chocolate uses a different formula in each country it is manufactured.  New Zealand is uses more cream than Australia, etc.  This version by Hershey is not what you expect from England, Australia or New Zealand Cadbury.  It does not melt on your tongue like those countries so it tastes differently.<br /><br />If you are looking for the silky smooth easy melting chocolate find the non Hershey version.<br /><br />Hershey has missed an opportunity to introduce high quality Cadbury chocolate to USA. 1
Good value and features for the price.<br /><br />Quickly warms up and has an auto turn off option after 2 hours.<br /><br />Tank is big enough that you can brew several cups of coffee before refilling.<br /><br />Only gives 2 brew sizes, but you can add water to your cup if you want to make larger brews.  Water is very hot, so some room temp water does not make a difference in the taste.<br /><br />Quiet when brewing and the removable tray makes it easy to use tall cups with their ice brew teas.<br /><br />Would be five stars if had more brew size options...which you can get if you spend more $$$$.<br /><br />..and...the K Cup patent runs out this September, so the cost of coffee per cup should drop this year! 4
This drink is spicy! It's surprising how much of a kick that ginger has, and the honey and lemon are nearly drowned out in the ginger flavor. I drank it warm, and it was a nice and soothing beverage on a cold day. I use ginger a lot for its anti-nausea effects, and I could see trying this to help combat motion sickness. That said, even watered down slightly, the kick was still a lot for me and it was rather hard to drink the entire cup in one sitting. 3
While the sugar count is slightly higher than a can of coca-cola, this soda gets it sugar from 100% Fruit Juice, not from High Fructose Corn Syrup.  I wouldn't give this to my daughter every day but as an alternative to soda once in awhile I think it is a good choice!  Plus it tastes great! 3
Check the first 4 ingredients: Brewers Rice, Chicken By-Product Meal, Corn Gluten Meal, Powdered Cellulose. Rice is ok but not as a first ingredient in a cat food; meat by-product is sketchy in general in a food this expensive; corn meal I have no great opinion of, but whatever; but the 4th ingredient - powdered cellulose - is sawdust. SAWDUST is not what I want to feed my cat, even to help her lose weight.<br /><br />No wonder this food feels so "light" physically.  The color is lighter, and it is less dense than normal food because it's truly just fillers.<br /><br />I give it a second extra star because my cat would willingly eat this food and didn't seem to mind a whole lot, but I switched her (50/50 at first) to Blue Buffalo, which has real food ingredients and which she actually does prefer. 2
This is a fantastic decaf coffee. My parents love decaf but there aren't many out there they enjoy. We've been drinking Timothy's decaf Colombian and we bought this to try it. Fantastic! I would definitely buy this again and again. It's smooth and not bitter. It's not super strong so don't expect it to be like a cappacino. This is a really great Colombian cup of coffee. You won't miss the caffiene. 5
I like keeping non-perishable snacks in my desk for work, so I bought several of these.  The nut snack is good (albeit a bit spicy), the chocolate was chalky and white (inedible), the crackers are ok and the hummus is ok.  I never eat the edamame because I don't like the roasted ones.  The main reason for my negative review is that the last 6 pack I bought had an expiration date of 10 days after the date it was delivered -- totally unacceptable.  Also, one of the 6 boxes was missing the crackers.  I'll figure something else out for my at work snacks. 2
Tastes good, but barely any protein. If you want protein, get Nutiva's unflavored 50% protein powder. You can flavor it yourself. It's cheaper and has more protein. 3
My puppy, Megabyte, is a very picky puppy.  After spending hundreds of dollars on finding treats that she will eat.  These are one of only two. 5
If you have ever had real Cajun style gumbo, you know this Campbells version does not compare at all. There is no flavor to this soup at all! I don't know what everyone else is thinking, but I will not buy this soup ever again. Very let down. 1
I was very happen with my purchase from Amazon.  It was easy, and I received by coffee even<br />quicker that expected.  The price was right, and the coffee is good.  I don't usually like flavored<br />coffee and I am new to the Kerig K-cup world, but this is a good one. 4
These are like eating cardboard I am sorry to be negative but they are not as good not even as the reviews have said.Wasted my money by believing in the reviews. 1
Very refreshing as an iced tea.  Mint is subtle and not overpowering.  Also nice hot.  Had enjoyed it at one of the coffee shops where I live, but was unable to find it in any local stores, so was glad to find it on Amazon.  Worth a try - highly recommended. 4
Do you know those Tootsie Pop commercials where they'd see how many times the Tootsie Pop could be licked before they'd chew right into it?  That's how this Likety Stik worked with my dog.  He licked it three or four times, then immediately wanted to chew on the roller.  I repeatedly pulled it out each time he'd try, but it kept repeating.  Lick, lick, lick, chew.  Lick, lick, lick chew.  Within one minute, no exaggerating, he had chewed off the end and I was scared to death that he'd swallow the roll ball. Fortunately he spit it out, but if he had swallowed it, he easily could have choked to death on it with it blocking his windpipe.  I would never buy this product again, and highly recommend others not to.  Seriously, it was completely chewed through in one minute of opening the package. 1
These crackers are terrific, and they are priced right.  However, i ordered them on 10/29/06, and the expiration date on the box was 12/31/06.  We have only eaten four boxes.  They still taste fine after the expiration date, but... am i really expected to consume 12 boxes in 2 months? 3
A flavored, light ground coffee which is still full of flavor with a nice aftertaste.  It's probably my second favorite flavored coffee with their Madagascar Vanilla Nut my favorite. 4
I'd previously reviewed another <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D3LUMU">Extra flavor</a> that was so rubbery to chew, it was like trying to masticate a tire. Luckily this one is plenty soft & remains soft, so perhaps it is just that flavor that is such a hard chew.<br /><br />The flavor of this gum (sweet watermelon) isn't a bad flavor & lasts a long time, but there's just something about the flavor that tastes a little strange. It's got this definite chemical-ish aftertaste to it & a bit of a mint-esque taste. It isn't a nasty flavor, but it is something that I've noticed each time I've chewed a piece.<br /><br />I don't know that I prefer this over my normal chewing gum (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IZCL8U">Orbit Bubblemint</a>), but it is something that I will probably buy again at some point in the future & is definitely better than some of the other sugar-laden watermelon gum out there. 3
The first time I tried these, I thought, "WOW!" but I quickly found they were just too darn spicy and tart... Hard to enjoy the potato-chippiness of them when your mouth is under seige. 3
The Good: The Marley Coffee One Love coffee pods are simple to use and even simpler to clean up.  Just remove the pod from the basket and throw away.  At $10 a box, the price per cup is not bad, either.<br /><br />The Bad:  The coffee is weak tasting.  I tried several pods with differing amounts of water and the coffee still tasted weak.  My pods were "Exotic Floral and Berry" flavored and this flavoring gave the coffee a strong, unpleasant aftertaste.  It didn't seem too bad the first few sips, but the aftertaste became more and more unpleasant as I drank the coffee.  I could not finish a full cup.  My daughter and my sister also tried the coffee and they thought it had an unpleasant taste.  Part of the problem could be that I am not fond of flavored coffees.  I believe that Marley Coffee comes in an espresso flavor and that might be better.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this coffee. 2
We love our Keurig coffeemaker and have tried many coffees.  Recently discovered Wolfgang Puck's new line of coffees and are pleased with all of his we have tried.  This one is smooth with a great flavor, no bite.  We would purchase this again. 5
After years of being unable to eat butter due to dairy sensitivities, we were delighted to discover Pure Indian Foods Organic Ghee. Not only is it packed with nutrition, it gives us the opportunity to enjoy the taste of a much missed staple. Apparently, according to Nourishing Traditions proponents,  it aids in digestion, as well. Although ghee is often compared to theater popcorn butter, we have found the taste of this ghee in particular to be much milder and natural tasting. We will definitely keep this stocked! 5
The whole point of a cookie is for it to taste good!  This product tastes little better than wood.  Sorry I wasted my money.  Do NOT buy.  Save your money -- they are not worth the calories! 1
I don't want to comment on how this protein shake affected my body.  I will only say that I worked out like usual and drank this powder mixed with milk and neither gained nor lost weight.  I like that there was no funny aftertaste (unlike some protein powders containing artificial sweeteners).<br /><br />I am giving this product three stars because I like that it is of organic and fair trade origin.<br /><br />I would have rated it higher, but I find that if I mix this with milk, the resulting shake feels gritty and has a weird and almost unpalatable taste.  If you mix too much powder with not enough milk the shake needs to be consumed quickly!  If not, you will have a jello-like substance that is best eaten with a spoon or mixed with more milk.<br /><br />The two containers I received were probably not well mixed.  I found that as I got closer to finishing the product the shakes I was making started to taste sweeter, so I wonder if the sugar was just not evenly distributed.  Given that this product is a powder, I don't think settling during shipment was a problem.<br /><br />At this point, I will probably not order this product again simply because I find it too hard to drink given the flavor and texture. 3
My two lhasa apso's absolutely love this food! For the last 3 years, I've been feeding this to them exclusively, full time as their main meal. They are pretty finicky eaters but not with this food! The only thing that has worried me is the amount of water they drink after eating their 4" slice (2" each daily) I've read some comments where this has been cautioned against as a full time meal replacement but so far other than the extra water intake & subsequent occasional in house potty accidents, I've experienced no adverse reactions! It helps them stay at a healthy weight & they look forward to feeding time each night as if I am giving them prime steak! So far it has been affordable & I usually buy 6-8 rolls a month & then give them cans of Iams for the in-between times when I run out. Lately it's been averaging for the beef rolls about eleven ninety nine.<br /><br />I just went to order a new batch & was shocked to see the new price of over sixteen dollars, which is much more than even buying it at petco (in-store) I recently was at my local petsmart @ was looking for Natural Balance food rolls & they did not carry it:( but what they did carry was something very comparable a product called Pet Botanics Dog Food Rolls! I went ahead & bought four 4.5 lb rolls (2 of the lamb & brown rice & 2 of the beef) My dogs loved it just as much as this! So if anyone else is concerned as I am about the Amazon price increase I would definitely recommend Pet Botanicals Food Rolls! I just ordered my monthly 6 rolls for $9.99 EACH which are 4.5lbs or 1/2 a pound more than the Natural Balance 4lb  rolls & they were even less than the $11.99 I paid BEFORE the price increase! I have shoprunner so shipping was free & I had a $4.00 offf a $15 purchase coupon code for Petco! So I placed 3 separate orders of 2 rolls each & saved $12.00 which more than offset the tax I had to pay! Good luck! 4
Unfortunately its hard to estimate size with these toys but I went by a ladies comment on how her labs loved it.  Thinking that labs made this toy last I thought my two pit mixes would do the same.  It was half chewed in just a couple of days.  Nylabone toys are great all around but if you have big chewers I would look for a jumbo size. 3
The can looks just like the pic and it really helped my son with his constipation. I love it and he started drinking it with no problem at 2-3months old!!! Love it 5
I have tried about 25 different K-Cup flavors, and this is my favorite.  It has a wonderful aroma, and just the right amount of Hazelnut.  Use the subscribe option, and this is a deal that can't be beat. 5
We loved these at first.  While we thought the salt and pepper was very powerful, the cashews themselves were large and flavorful, and the whole thing really worked.  We still love them, but it's a hit-or-miss proposition.  You never quite know how your taste buds are going to react when you open the container and toss a few in your mouth.  Sometimes, without a doubt, it's just a little too overpowering.<br /><br />The quality of the cashews is fantastic, the salt and pepper adhere to the nuts surprisingly well considering how coarse it all is.  There are times when I'd rate these a 4 or even 5, others where I'd want to go as low as 2.  3 it is.<br /><br />Would we buy them again?  I don't think so, but I had to stop and really think about that.  Emerald has a great product here, and we loved their Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds, 11oz Canister (Pack of 4), but the moments where these are too much, are enough to keep us from going back for more when this can is gone. 3
Put simply this is a brilliant piece of kit... does exactly what it says on the tin... converts any XLR mic to USB  - including phantom power supply.<br /><br />We have an Neuman professional condenser mic here at Blockhouse tv and I kid you not  - it sounds amazing with this piece of kit.  Have plugged into our mac and thrown the signal into Audacity and/or Final Cut pro and it sounds the business - no hum, noise, clicks or pop. We use it to voice the children's animation DVD series; Jack and Holly.  Both the actors and the tech staff find it a really easy and portable set-up to use. OK - looks aren't great - and it's plastic - but I don't really give a monkey's about that - all I care about is the signal to noise ratio, the sound quality and can it power our very expensive mics?  The answer is - yes it can.  We say buy!<br /><br /> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004AM5PZ4">Jack and Holly's Christmas Countdown (US Format)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00439GWTM">Jack and Holly's Christmas Countdown (European format)DVD </a> 5
Looks brown with a little bit of green and I do not want to drink it so what's there to do I already opened it and I doubt it's just my bag or if I could even get a return 1
Just a word of warning...This product is made in China where they may add a substance that can cause serious kidney problems in dogs. Read the blog on the topic of chicken dog treats made in China - [...]. After reading the many comments posted by dog owners who fed they dogs chicken treats made in China, I am discarding all of these treats and will seek an alternative product that is made in the USA. 1
I'll admit, I am reviewing a product I have not used.  The reason is that wheat gluten is about the #1 cause of allergies in dogs.  When wheat gluten is broken down it gets very sticky, so it coats the cilia of the digestive tract.  This can cause irritation, and cause the immune system to actually destroy the lining of the intestines.  This means that your pup might not be able to absorb all the nutrients he is eating.<br /><br />Often allergies show up as 'hot spots' where the dog gets itchy and possibly scratches fur off.  The problem with food allergies is it's possible that they won't be obvious because all the damage will be internal.<br /><br />So, I have not seen a problem with this product, but I have known dogs who have had terrible reactions to wheat.  It's the same things as "gluten intolerance"in humans, but it's much more common in dogs who are not quite as good at digesting grains.  Wheat flour can be bad enough, but including concentrated wheat protein is much worse - because that is what causes the allergies. 1
I have no complains about the nutritional benefits of Kashi Go Lean cereal. It's got the lowest fat content of any brand cereal on the market. It only has 130 calories per 45g serving.<br /><br />However, it is the worst tasting cereal that I've ever had (and I've had quite few in my lifetime). Combine this with Skim Milk and it's akin to eating cardboard pieces soaked in water. It is absolutely revolting, with a weird chemical after-taste that refuses to go away. The least Kashi could have done is throw in some raisins or dried strawberry pieces in there. Sure, the fat content goes up a gram or two but at least, you won't feel like throwing up each time you take a mouthful.<br /><br />I tried it for three weeks (one serving every day) to see if it was an acquired taste but I will tell you, it was as revolting on Day 21 as it was on Day 1. I've since then switched to Special K Protien Plus. It's got 2 extra grams of fat (that's 30 calories per 45g for the calorie counters out there), but hey, you can eat it and not feel like throwing up. That, I guess is reason enough for me to switch. I can walk the extra 20 calories off by parking the car at the far end of the lot. 1
My grandkids and I love the mints in the tin and thought we would try these to cut down on packaging. They taste terrible. They have a funny after taste and really don't taste like cinnamon. We won't buy them again. We buy many Newman's Own products, but are disappointed this time. If they aren't the same mints, they should have a different name. 2
Might look tasty but lacks even a touch of white chocolate flavor. Maybe the other flavors are better, but definitely steer clear of this - not worth anything near $1+ a bar. 2
This isn't a bad candy, if you like a real strong molasses taste, but I can barely taste the licorice for the molasses.  I wouldn't call it a good licorice candy. 4
First Impression: The friendly folks over at "Exclusively Dog" heard about my website and sent me 5 of their products to test.<br />Let me just start off by saying that I Love how sweet all of these treats taste. Dad was/is considering trying one because they look and smell so much like human cookies. Plus the ingredients are very straight forward, they are probably healthier than most the stuff Mom eats... But there in lies the problem. Dad thinks that they are too sweet for a puppy of any age. The second ingredient in almost all of them is sugar. As we all know puppies have a hard time processing sugar, and just like humans can develop diabetes.<br /><br />Conclusion: Your puppy is nearly guaranteed to LOVE the taste. However these should only be used as an occasional treat! If you were to feed your puppies these sugary sweet morsels every day, they would soon plump up. If you puppy is already overweight or does not exercise regularly, you may want to think twice. On the PRO side they are all natural, with no animal bi-products! 3 out of 4 paws, because Dad made me! If we were judging on taste alone they would be a 4. 4
My daughter loves this Spring Vegi Pasta. So I ordered a dozen Earth's Best Junior Baby Food Organic Spring Vegetable and Pasta, 6-Ounce Jars (Pack of 12) - very disappointed to have a package arrived broken leaving me a huge mass and short food supply! I ordered previously the stage 1 and stage 2 with the same brand ( forgot the seller) which arrived in perfect condition with a tight box wrapped with plastic. Another disappointment is that it's not eligible for return! A huge mass and waste of money!! 2
I was thoroughly disappointed in the condition of the cookies after they arrived. I receieved the Chocolate Chunk,Choc. Chip and Pecan Choc. Chip. They arrived in two shipments and all were broken. Only a few of the Choc. Chip cookies survived.<br /><br />Hey Amazon, I think that the packing wasn't sufficient and it might have helped to mark the outer boxes "fragile". 2
First package was lost in the mail, but JR shipped a backup at no charge with 24 hour shipment!!!! 5
I would caution anyone ordering this to realize that the chocolate melts in warm temperatures.  Mine arrived in a chocolate coated bag.  I put it in the fridge to try to solidify it a bit, but it wasn't a big improvement.  Makes it hard to eat out of the bag.  I really didn't want a chocolate flavored cereal, so I was planning on enjoying this as an eat out of the bag snack, but the melted chocolate makes it messy.  The chunks are an okay size for that, but it would probably work better as a cereal since the chocolate melted.<br /><br />When I purchase granola, I usually look for ones with either almonds or pecans.  This has neither. The only solids listed in the ingredients are whole grain rolled oats and chocolate chunks (first 2 ingredients). The rest of the ingredients are predominately sweeteners.  A serving is 1/2 cup and that has 220 calories, 50 of which are from fat.  There are 4g of fiber, 13g of sugar, 20g of other carbohydrates, and 5g of protein.  Just because something is "natural" doesn't mean it is good for you. 3
This was my baby's first food (or at least I tried it) at 6 months. When I opened the can, a musty smell welcomed me. It had not gone bad from what I could see and it was well before the expiration date, it was just not terribly appetizing. Several times I went through the hassle of expressing breastmilk and mixing it with this stuff. There is no way I could get my baby to take this cereal, regardless of the milk to cereal ratio. I threw the stuff out and we went straight to real solids (non-pureed or mashed) after a few weeks. My baby has some preferences for which I do not want to rate this product poorly, however the musty smell was a turnoff for me too. 2
I love loose leaf tea - the large leaves brew slowly, giving flavor but not bitterness. It has a subtle quality about it that sets is apart from the grounds found in tea bags. This tea does not have that quality. Rather than whole leaves, the tea is ground-up bits like in English breakfast tea. Even after brewing the leaves are tiny chunks. Rather than a long, slow brew, I found that this tea takes on a bitter edge after as little as two and a half minutes. I usually brew tea bags longer! If you keep the brewing short and use a lot of leaf to compensate it can be drinkable, but why bother when you can do better with a bag? I won't be buying this again. 2
Have to say that I dont get much effect out of this product.  Has a nice berry flavor.<br /><br />Was shipped in a timely manner so that, with the fact that I dont much effect out of it, earned it 2 stars. 2
Cant find this flavor in the stores, so bought them here online.. Like them so much better than the Peppermint ones... I also like the Cinnamon Ones... Yum-O(as Rachel Ray states)... 5
Yes, you should order this drink because it does taste great.  (As long as price is no object)<br />Tastes like orange juice with seltzer water.<br />But dont feel guilty about drinking it because it is 100% juice ! 5
What can I say?  It's herbal tea, it tastes a bit grassy, but I like it.  I'd say try some before you buy a bunch of it because people either seem to love it or hate it. 4
I ordered this cake and was very excited and anticipating its arrival. But then it came and I opened the box and I noticed on the side there was white power on the side (while it was still in its plastic wrapper) like a rotten fruit but I thought maybe it was just the plastic but then I opened it and took a bite and it was horrible. IT WAS ROTTEN. I was very upset because I bought it in Jamaica b4 n it was good so I called Amazon and they refunded my money. Don't think I will be trying this one again. All the other onces are good including: Chocolate, & Original w/ Walnuts. 2
There's this recent move to create animal crackers that have the consistency of a butter cookie, with artificial flavor and colors. This version is exactly that; mealy, grainy and a faint hint of fake vanilla. Bought them once but will not NEVER purchase them again. Barnum's, which were the gold standard of animal crackers, have changed their recipe to this as well and suck just as bad. At least these are organic! 1
These chicharrones are delicious, and the packaging is very convenient.  Just like microwave popcorn, the pork rinds come in a bag with cellophane around it.  You shake the bag to distribute the pork rinds, pop it in the microwave, and set the cooking time.<br /><br />The optimal time for my microwave is one minute 45 seconds, but the time will likely differ from one microwave to another.<br /><br />The only reason I'm not giving this product five starts is due to the MSG listed as an ingredient.  While I don't react badly to MSG it still makes me a little nervous.<br /><br />If you're on a low-carb diet this is a great choice for snacking or even meal replacement. 4
The ryvita was still within the "best enjoyed before" date of 12.2010 but is not crisp. I am having to put it in the oven to crisp it up. However it was purchased at a reduced price so for future purchases I shall be wary of "sale" items.<br />I do love ryvita though and love the order coming to my door so quickly. 3
This spread is just right but costs only about six dollars locally.<br />price with shipping here is ridiculous! 4
I am not a diehard tea drinker and am a diet coke junkie.  That said - I liked the idea of trying the health benefits of green tea and, lately, have found a hot cup of tea a great way to start/end the day.<br /><br />This tea is fruity and not bitter.  I add a packet of sweetner in the AM and it is perfect.  I highly recommend this one!! 4
This coffee is not what I expected.  I thought it would be a bold coffee similiar to Starbucks, but it is not, and it leaves a sediment in my cup, which other don't .  very disappointed and will not re order this brand again. 2
These by far are the BEST gluten free cookies there are.  I even like  them better than any non gluten free cookie also.  I would give them a five star rating for that but the problem is when they are shipped they come broken and crumbled every time. You need a spoon to eat the tiny crumbled pieces!  I have ordered a few times and even tried another company and they came shipped the same way.  The store I could buy them from is very far for me so I tried Amazon.  I would love to buy them again and again from Amazon but it's not fun to need a spoon to eat a cookie!  Taste is AWESOME though. 3
The rainbow chip is okay. Everyone one in the family felt the Pillsbury Funfetti tasted better. I had high hopes for this product, because it looks delicious unfortunately looks can be deceiving. It is not disgusting, just not tasty enough to justify purchasing it again. 3
We ordered the roasted garlic, but they sent us the wrong order so we got plain cheddar.  My husband did not care for it.  Perhaps the roasted garlic is better, but in general we have tasted better cheddar cheese curds. 2
I have been giving my dog this treat for a long time,I found it here on Amazon and it is much cheaper! Now I learned that ALL chicken treats for dogs (and also cats I believe) that are MADE IN CHINA are being investigated  by the FDA because some dogs have died after consuming them. These treats and all Dogswell treats are made in China,I researched all over the web about this matter and bottom line is: why take the risk? A few sites say it is OK, most say to be cautious and others say don't buy.I threw out all the ones I bought and got new ones made in USA.I wish Amazon gave us the choice of "made in USA", for now I recommend everyone that has a pet to read the labels of the treats and food. Sorry this product, I don't recommend. 1
I LOVE PopChips.  They have a great crunch without the greasy feel and taste.  They are very similar to munchos--very light and fluffy.  If you are looking for something to satisfy your salty craving, these are a great way without having to feel so guilty about consuming an enormous amount of calories. 5
This one is an excellent beverage if you're feeling sick due to the flu, car sickness or pregnancy. The ginger is an ingredient which is known by natural health workers to settle stomachs and the honey and lemon are a good flavor mix. It's also soothing for indigestion and is good for children's tummies since it's caffeine free. 4
No harsh after taste, no tangible negatives.  It just doesn't have the "bite" that I crave from other carbonated beverages like ginger ale or root beer.  It's a good option for a healthful drink with some fizz. 4
I read in the descriptions of this product that it would help with fruit flys, but so far I have had no luck.  It may work great for other flying bugs, but if you have fruit flys I would recommend looking at other products.  It seems like it would work to contain bugs that are attracted to it but I can't say for sure. 3
The product image is misleading. The image has the tomatoes as D.O.P. certified, but the tomatoes I received are not.... 1
Just a tad expensive, but neater than heck!!  It really does what it says!  Awesome!! 5
Kombu is a wonderful energizer, especially during the summer and in the cold and flu season.<br /><br />Drop one strip into boiling water for 2 to 3 minutes, remove and cut into smaller pieces.  Add to 6 cups of water, then add 12 teaspoons of shiro Miso (mild white miso), heat and stir until miso dissolves.  Avoid boiling the ingredients. Add cubed tofu (soft is best), spinach or swiss chard cut into thin strips, shiitake mushrooms cut in thin strips and scallions thinly cut including the green part (reserve half for soup garnish). Heat, but do not boil, for about 10 minutes.  Servie with a splash of soy sauce for a little extra flavor.<br /><br />The Kombu has a very mild flavor and best if not overcooked or over softened.  Great for vegans and better than chicken soup!<br /><br />Enjoy ! 5
i love this sparkling water and usually have had it in the glass bottles...  but hard to find, so when i saw it was available in the plastic bottles i figured i would try it....  i was very disappointed...  half the bottles had no fizz left when they were opened...  virtually flat!.... the ones that were still carbonated were good but the others were not drinkable...  i would not order this product again.... 2
Great natural treat for my cat, whose health I want to keep strong for many years. And he loves them!!! 5
These noodles are indeed gluten and soy free.  Please note that the label says that they are processed in a factory that also processes soy products, however. Wish I had known that before I bought them, since soy is a no-no in our family. 2
The crystalized ginger drink tastes much the same as other such drinks readily available at many Asian markets at half the price. I see other reviewers complained about after taste and it being too strong. I haven't run across a ginger drink that is too strong, so maybe it is just me but this one is relatively mild. At first, I didn't taste anything bad in the after taste but I wrote the review before finishing the drink... then went back to revise. Yes, not as good as I thought after the flavor lingers. It is a mediocre product at an premium price. 2
I received this gift basket Monday which was an unseasonably warm late October day here in Colorado.  My family and I tried the chocolate covered peanuts that same evening and though delicious they were melted together in one lump!  Same experience with the chocolate coated pretzels.  The chocolate covered raisins also tasted great and fortunately had stayed intact with no ill effects from being too warm.  There's a variety of truffles, covered marshmallows, graham crackers etc included I have not yet opened or tasted.  All the  treats appear to be of very high quality though the quantities are quite small which may be a good thing for those of us watching our waistlines.  The actual basket the treats come in is a little cheap looking but I did decide to keep it to make up my own gift basket for someone in the future.  At a cost of around $40 I don't consider this item to be an exceptional value.<br />PS  I took a star off this gift basket since the more I look at it the less impressed I am.  For some strange reasons a rice krispie type bar with a bit of chocolate was placed in a box for flan, some truffles were placed in one of those single serve size cereal boxes for sugar pops and some dark chocolate pieces were in a Royal Jello box.  I don't really think I would want to give as a gift something with this odd packaging.<br />UPDATE:  ig4U contacted me and sent me another basket to review.  This second basket did NOT contain melted chocolates or strange recycled packages.  Based on the second basket I received this item would make an attractive, respectable gift for a chocolate lover. 4
I enjoy Bigelow Teas and was looking for a stronger cinnamon influence.  It is very good, hot or cold. I will use it all, but perhaps stir with a cinnamon stick for deeper flavor. 3
These bars really hit the spot: they have a good consistency, like a very thick brownie or fudge, without being overly or cloyingly sweet. The texture is just right, and rich enough to feel like a treat. The chocolate taste is pronounced (and really more of a 'dark chocolate' than any kind of milk chocolate), and the almonds - while not particularly numerous - are present, and add an extra crunch and flavour to the bar. If you're a die-hard, need-a-chocolate-bar kind of person, it's likely these won't satisfy your sweet-tooth cravings; for the rest of us, it's the right amount of sweetness.<br /><br />It's important to keep in mind that the bars aren't really 'health food,' though: they're not nutrient-dense enough to be a meal replacement, and likely won't fit easily into a stringent diet regimen. They're calorically dense, at 190 calories/bar: not very big, either. They'd be great to bring on a hike, long bicycle ride, or run, though, as they're compact, portable, and taste good. I wish they had more fiber (because really, these aren't very filling), but am glad they don't contain a laundry list of random chemicals/fillers, nor do the bars have any soy. The protein count is fairly good (7g), considering the Pure Natural bars aren't being sold as as a protein supplement. 3
Not my favorite bread mix as it has a little bit of a "gluten free" taste to it, but better than most.  Also, very easy to make as you can prepare it on the one-hour gluten free setting of a bread maker.  It's a pretty good option. 3
I expected to receive the smaller Trollis that are standard in 5 and 8 oz packages, but these are large worms that are chewier and far less sour. 2
10 pellets of gum for 18.99 is a joke. I must have been in stupid ville to order this. I received the gum, 1 pack with 10 pieces of gum. Honestly the gum is bad tasting and it last about as long, 1 min. Don't buy this product. This is a rip off!!!!!!!!! 1
We LOVE the new gluten free Bisquick! I used to for cheddar biscuits mostly until we found out that we had a milk protein intolerance. Now, we are using this to make so many more recipes because it is dairy free and from what I can tell allergen free. The only thing I would like better (General Mills-if you are listening-I know I am not the only one that wants this) is if it came in bulk packaging. Just put the GF Bisquick in a larger box like the regular Bisquick and then sell in a 3 or 6 pack. Just mark that this review was helpful if you agree and maybe GM will listen! LOVE THIS-ORDER NOW!! 5
I bought all different flavors of jerky from this brand and it is sooo gross. I had to spit it out. Never again. 1
We buy this type of product because of a health condition. We ordered these cookies fully expecting them to arrive in a some what good condition. Instead all we received was crumbs and partial cookies, there were very few whole cookies. I suspect the lack of care in the packaging was one of the main problems. 1
I enjoy a good cup of Hot Cocoa on occasion, and this is "good stuff"!!  Not only that but in a time where prices are out of control on K-cups, this product is very reasonable in price. 5
My puppy is a big time chewer. We give him his dinner in this a few times a week and it keeps him (and us) entertained. We do take it away from him as soon as he's done with all the food though, because I can tell the rubber end wont stand up if we let him go to town on it. Still other toys don't last a day and we're getting good use out of this. 4
I've been a fan of dried ginger with crystallized sugar for years, so I thought I would give this brand a try.  If you're a ginger lover you will probably like this product, however I like my ginger to be more dehydrated and sliced into smaller pieces.  In fairness it does say "chunk" on the description of the product, and true to that the ginger comes in bite sized chunks that are chewy and kind of gummy. 3
The product was wet in the tube as if the tube was not seiled correctly. 1
taste not bad. I added cinnamon and nutmeg for pancakes. They were flat and not fluffy. 3
I used to have this syrup at my grandmothers house all the time.  The product is the same as I always remember it.  It is a very thick syrup.  The only complaint I have is that the bottles I used to use it out of were glass and these bottles are plastic.  No big deal though it doesn't change the syrup. 5
The status quo worked great. I'm on the road a lot and like to have some snacks that are not too fattening. I was addicted to the old style not only for the taste but the texture. They were GREAT! The new stinks! Whoever brewed up this junk must have been on drugs, or at least does not care for the American people. I mean really, would you let your children eat this??? I rarely eat these because I care about my taste buds, but when I do, I wear a blind fold ,pinch my nose and hope that the company repents of this abomination and soon. 2
I saw that someone else had posted that these k-cups tasted different from other Gloria Jean's k-cups they had.  I should have believed them; it is true. Not nearly as good.  My only guess is that they are seconds..... 2
Most reviewers seem to find this coffee to be the best ever or just horrid. I thought it was just ok. A bit of a bitter aftertaste if you ask me. It's pretty much the same as Coffee People's Jet Fuel and Wake Up Call, I can't tell the three apart. Interestingly, their Donut Shop is fantastic -- if you like Coffee People (and you can't beat the prices here on Amazon), I'd go for that one. 3
THESE ARE ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL COOKIES AND WE WERE LOOKING FORWARD TO RECEIVING OUR ORDER. HOWEVER, WHEN THEY ARRIVED, MOST OF THE COOKIES WERE BROKEN INTO CRUMBS. I THINK THESE COOKIES ARE TOO THIN TO ORDER BY MAIL; BUT I WAS REIMBURSED, THANKS TO AMAZON. 3
Let's face it: Americans are fat. Europeans tend not to be. Plus they live longer, more fulfilling lives. So who cares about hydrogenated oils (as in palm kernel and coconut)? Seriously, people. Go outside for a change and get off your computer, get some exercise, and stop being stressed out over the little things in life, such as banning so-called "deadly" oils. Some oils make things taste better, as the case with these fine cookies  :) 4
I will no longer consider buying product from Kelloggs for the following reason:<br />Kelloggs continues to include GMO (genetically modified organism) ingredients in their products but refuses to include that information on their product labels.  There are no long term studied to prove that GMOs are safe for either human or animal consumption.  Kelloggs/ position is that GMOs are deemed safe by the FDA so they are not required to be identified to consumers.  However, Michael Taylor, head of the FDA, is a former attorney for Monsanto, the chemical company responsible for the development and wide spread use of GMOs in the American food supply, illustrating a conflict of interest that prevents the FDA from acting responsibly.  It's interesting to note that 50 other countries around the world have banned GMOs from their food supply all together but consumers here in the United States do not even have the right to be informed when GMOs are present in the products we buy.  Kelloggs is an unacceptable choice as long as they refuse to fully disclose the true nature of their ingredients to consumers. 1
I was looking forward to this product, as my wife and I both like Earl Grey tea, and decaf lets us drink it at night.  We drink a variety of tea, so we don't go through individual tea very quickly, so I was looking forward to the resealable packets.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this tea just doesn't taste good initially and has a particularly unpleasant aftertaste.  I definitely would not recommend buying this tea. 1
I cannot detect any vanilla flavor at all in this tea, instead it tastes like cloves. 2
I purchased the six pack of 12 ounce bottles.  Amazon was amazing-as always, and delivered my order in a very timely fashion.  However, the caps were loose on all the bottles.  I didn't think much of it until I realized every single time I served it (as dip, with salmon, with chicken), it ran straight through my family.  I hate to waste so I really tried to see if it was just a coincidence.  Nope.  It does taste great, just like the Trader Joes product, but I wouldn't suggest using it to cook a romantic dinner for two.  lol 1
I am interested in these but was wondering if someone that has them could post some nutrition info on them? Mainly, fat, fiber, sugars, and then any vitamins? Thanks so much!! 3
These are tasty but not nearly as good as the "Original Wild" flavor. They were also quite stale when they got to me. 3
I like em but nothing unique about the flavor.  basically saves you from having to make them at home... a little pricey but for a treat what the heck 4
...I'd give this five stars. I very much like coffee but I don't typically consume espresso drinks because I find many of them too strong or overly bitter. However, I immensely enjoyed illy issimo Caffe Coffee Drink. It is smooth with just a mildly strong and flavorable after-taste. It's the sort of drink you can sit, sip on and savor. The only downside is the terrible metallic taste that comes from pressing your lips against the can, but that's easily solvable by pouring the drink into another cup. Also, the drink gives a powerful caffeine kick if you're looking for a pick me up.<br /><br />If you love coffee and enjoy espresso drinks I highly recommend that you give illy issimo Caffe Coffee drink a try! 4
Given that Salt & Pepper is my favorite potato chip flavor (specifically Kettle Brand Krinkle Cut for those who might be interested) and I love cashews, I was looking forward to trying these. Alas, once again, Emerald has managed to just miss the mark.<br />I like only enough salt in my food to enhance the taste, and the fact of the matter is that cashews are flavorful enough that not a whole lot is necessary. These nuts--which are nice and crisp and unbroken, no problem there--could easily lose 75% of their added salt and they'd be great, especially given that the black pepper used is of pretty good quality and kinda kicks in after everything has been eaten...if you can refrain from gulping your beverage of choice to slake the salt-induced thirst, that is. There's also some onion powder added, which would be a good thing if it were only discernible. But it's not because of the salt.<br />The lion's share of the nutritional data peeled off when I opened the canister, so I'm not able to provide them (I think I can be forgiven for not rifling through the garbage). Cashews are relatively low in fat for nuts, but they're not a low-cal food by any stretch of the imagination, plus these are roasted in peanut oil as well. I personally think nuts, plain or flavored, are a great source of nutrition but only if I can actually taste them.<br />In my experience, the single ingredient most common to mass-produced foods is salt, which seems a shame to me, especially since its misuse is so unhealthful. It's a lot easier to add salt to a dish than remove it, so if you're interested in actually tasting your food (and I think even simple, inexpensive food should and can be wonderful), let the manufacturers know. This product could easily be delicious if whoever formulated it would put a bit more finesse into it. 3
Miss Vickies are better but unfortunately less widely available.  I'm not sure tough is the right word but there is a noticeable difference between the two brands and Miss Vickie's are better IMHO. 3
These 100 calorie Cakesters are delicious!  Both the vanilla<br />and the chocolate are great, they satisfy those little "sweet"<br />cravings and its only 100 calories for three little cakes! 5
French Roast coffee is naturally lower acid as a function of the roasting process. This coffee is lower acid still.  Unfortunately, the taste was well beyond atrocious.  I made the sad mistake of musing this in a French press the way I make my normal cup of coffee and the resulting cup was completely unpalatable.  Maybe in a drip, with sugar and cream it could be drinkable, but with all those additions what's the point of low acid? 1
The turkey bites' ingredients list explicitly states "Gluten Free". While they may not be considered a "health" food exactly, I'm sure they're better for you than the beef or pepperoni bites. Excellent taste and only a tiny bit greasy. Nutrition Facts: Serving Size-6 pcs.

I recently tried this flavor/brand and was surprised at how delicious these chips are.  The best thing was that there were a lot of "brown" chips in the bsg (my favorite), so I bought some more through amazon and shared with family and friends.  I am a little disappointed that there are not, so far, very many brown chips in these bags, but the flavor is still very good.  I like them better than the yogurt and green onion flavor because they do not seem to be as salty, and the onion flavor is better.  If you haven't eaten Kettle chips before, I recommend that you try a bag before buying bulk.  They are thicker and crunchier than Lays but just as fresh out of the bag. 4
This product converted me, I kid you not. Before: I did not think I liked instant coffee. Now: I think I do! :-)<br /><br />I've tried <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E50TSS">International Coffee</a> type products, which are powdered drink mixes and not truly instant coffee, and I was never very impressed. Eventually, I learned (and you'll laugh at me for not knowing this) that instant coffee is not a "mix" like hot chocolate but actually coffee beans treated differently in their production from coffee beans intended to be brewed. The bean is roasted as usual, then crushed (rather than cut as for brewing beans) in preparation for creating a coffee "concentrate" that will then be either freeze dried or spray dried. This product (as explained on the Nescafe website) is Robusta and Arabica beans, freeze dried, a method which may or may not be the top choice for connoisseurs of instant coffee, but being new to instant coffee I don't yet appreciate the difference.<br /><br />I do know that the product in these single-serving sticks is the same product that was sold in canisters, before. This is just a new format for their current product, not a new product. And wow, for the sheer pleasure and convenience, it's a decent cup of coffee! It can't be mistaken for richly brewed coffee from a restaurant or from your home coffee machine, not even if you douse it with cream, but instead I compare it to "office" coffee, or 'cafe au cube farm', which it definitely matches in taste and quality. Easy, quick, mellow. Great idea when I'm the only soul who wants a cup of coffee and can't bear to brew just one or two lonely cups.<br /><br />The big disadvantage of instant coffee, as far as I'm concerned, is that a serving of this product has only abut 65mg of caffeine compared to 45-180mg of caffeine in a brewed cup of coffee (we're talking in the upper end the way I brew mine!). I want my caffeine! The flavored versions of this product have even less caffeine per serving (at 25-30mg) although I couldn't tell you why. (This information, by the way, comes from the Nescafe website FAQ.) The other disadvantage, I suppose, is that the whole house doesn't fill with the sound and fragrance of brewing coffee when I choose to go instant. Alas.<br /><br />Still, given the convenience and the decency of the beverage itself, I'm now buying these little "single sticks" pretty regularly! Recommended. :-) 4
Got these for our two large (50 and 100 lb) dogs, who love them.  The biscuits seem hard, they do snap in half easily for sharing with the dogs (one for each) and the smell of the biscuits, we agree smells to me like "ginger snaps".  Maybe there is ginger in them, don't know.  Our two big dogs love them, and they are given only as treats maybe once or twice a day. Recommended!  Minus one star for being really hard. 4
Ordered 3 bags of the Highlander Grogg in WHOLE bean.  Received 3 bags already opened, ground and then labeled "drip" with little handwritten garage sale stickers.  Gross.  No thank you!  Daughter unpacked my order and didn't notice until 2 weeks later when I went to brew some coffee at 6am.  Threw out the whole batch.  Very disappointed. 3
My dog loved this food and he was a very picky eater.  I felt I was giving him healthy food with no fillers.  I also loved the convinence of having it sent to the house monthly.  Not having to shop and drag a big weightly item home was great. 5
K-cups are marginally better than good coffee that I can buy at the store for 1/2 the price or less. This product was offered at $19.95 and I was willing to purchase it but it immediately went up to $26.95. It is not really worth $19.95 and is certainly not worth any increase. Additionally, what's the deal on offering INSTANT COFFEE in K-cups for $15.99 leaving us to think it's a good deal on REAL coffee. Do you want to lose our trust (business)???? That's a good way to do it!!!!!!!!!!<br />jb 3
I thought this dog toy would perfectly fit my 11 month Samoyed and provide the durable playful time. Unfortunately, my Samoyed was not just rolling the bottle, her chewing on the knots caused the bottle to fly around and when it hits my fragile ceramic floor, it broke (both the lid cover and my newly set floor).. *sigh*<br />Maybe this product should be used in a carpeted environment only. 2
We love these chips. They can be eaten alone, since they are so crisp and tasty or with a dip. Every one that we have introduced the chips to, loves them. And the expiration date is for 8 months from now, so ordering 12 bags didn't come near to them going stale. 5
These chips are a great kettle chip with good crunch and excellent taste. The after burn isn't for everyone ( watch the reaction from people that don't like a little heat!!! ), but it isn't unbearable. Great with sandwiches or by themselves. I buy them by the case and give a bag to friends. 4
Earth's Best makes good baby food that my child likes. However, I am rating their product here as it is available through Amazon. I'm very disappointed, like the other reviewer said, about the very short expiration date.<br /><br />A few days before I ordered this, the page said it wasn't in stock and that it would be available Sept. 15th. I ordered on the 15th, and it arrived on the 17th as promised with the free 2-day shipping. My case was supposedly the restocked pears, but the expiration date is Nov 09. New stock shouldn't have an expiration date that is only 2 months away, even if it is on sale! In the grocery store, the expiration date usually is 1 or 2 years away. 2
I'm a user of liquid stevia and i was looking for something i could use for baking.  The sweetener never dissolves with the wet ingredients, and, when your baking cools off, you have crunchy crystals of this sweetener in your baking. I even tried dissolving it first by warming up the wet ingredients, it appeared to dissolve, but after cooling i got the same results.  The other reviewers say that you tune into the taste in order to taste it.  I agree, if you use too little, it does not sweeten (you can't taste it), and if you use enough to taste it, you've ruined what you are trying to sweeten with it's nasty tin foil taste.  Dont bother using it for coffee or tea, because it sinks to the bottom of the cup because it does not completely dissolve even in hot water.  I should also mention that its not sweet in the slightest bit.  And i've been off sugar for years, so it's not because i'm used to real sugar.<br /><br />Bleh. 1
I'm one of those fussy dog owners that read labels and annoy others and so I really like the ingredients in this and think this would be a 5 star product for a lot of owners. My dogs certainly liked the flavor, but they aren't a fussy crew -- still, I feel good about this biscuits. The reason I'm holding back a star is because two out of three of my dogs -- my greyhound and my sheltie -- are seniors and this is a harder treat than is really comfortable for them and the treats are hard to break into pieces. (Soaking in water for a couple minutes seems to help.) Some dogs genetically have really made tartar prone teeth and that's these two and there have been extractions over the years. My dachshund also has to work to crunch through it due to the size -- remember, couldn't break it -- and the hardness, but she managed.<br /><br />If you have a medium and up dog with good teeth, them this is quite highly recommended. If you're constantly looking for a softer treat, they're less ideal and might at least need a little soak. 4
This product works great for me.  I hate spending money on herbs just to use a little and have the rest go bad shortly after.  I put some herbs (mostly basil) in here and they were fresh for a few weeks!  No leakage probs either, the bottom is clearly labeled to twist to lock and the plug stays flush.<br />This thing has already paid for itself in money saved and looks pretty cool in my fridge and on the counter when I'm ready to cook. 5
You can't beat this deal! 3 Boxes of 16 K-Cups for little more then $20. No other store can even match that price for Hot Chocolate K-Cups. Your normally going to be paying around $12-$16 for 16 K-cups alone. This package give you 48 K-Cups for a great price.<br /><br />The Hot Chocolate itself is great tasting and can be used on mostly all settings for the B70 except for the travel mug. Low in calories and great tasting. Defiantly a must have if you own a Keurig brewing system! 5
I bought this canned crab meat for the first time and just used it in a soup. I bought "Pacific Organic red pepper creamy tomoto soup" (comes in cartons) and added a can of strained "mixed vegetables" and a can of this "crab meat", added some old bay seasoning and to tell you the truth, it was pretty good and it only took a couple minutes to make! The crab meat itself doesn't have much flavor at all and living in Maryland, it certainly isn't the crab meat I'm used to but to make a quick inexpensive crab soup it's pretty convenient. I wouldn't just eat this out of the can or make crab cakes with it because it's not high enough quality to do that. I also buy lots of canned goods for "emergency" back up my sister convinced me to always have so this along with the cases of tuna fish and canned chicken breast we should be in good shape in the "meat dept.". 4
I've been noticing recently that this and all their chunky soups are becoming more and more watered down.<br /><br />That and the incremental downsizing of their products(as with just about everything else in the grocery store) means I'll be passing their section of the soup aisle. Time to make my own I guess. 1
If you have nothing else this is acceptable, but it definitely lacks that special something my two local restaurants seem to have in the korma. I was disappointed. Possibly it was too mild. I could tell from the aroma it was different from what I had on my recent Lamb Korma dishes while dining out. 2
Bought 6lbs of this popcorn based on reviews that the hulls are softer on this Baby White than on regular popcorn.  Not only are the hulls just as tough as regular popcorn, the corn pops up so tiny that it's about 1/3 hull, 2/3 popped corn per kernel! I was hoping to use this as a healthy snack for my kids who love popcorn but not the hulls.<br />I popped this using every tip I could find on the internet; all experiments still resulted in a tough hull. 2
I almost hate to say it, but I really love this product. But Nestl&eacute; doesn't seem to care about what its customers want.  They care more about the higher profit margin that is generated by the new 20-pack box.  (Today's 20 cup of packets - $3.39, yesterday's canister used to get about 100 cups for $5.29 in my area.  I guess this is the way of the corporate world these days - just look at AIG and other lending agencies.<br /><br />Nestl&eacute; - please bring back the canisters... 2
This plant type is easily stressed and it was stressed when I received it. After a few weeks, It is doing fine.  The plant came in bloom; this was different then the other desert roses I have purchased from other sellers.  It is making itself at home in the bright Florida sunshine.  Doesn't need much water and love sunshine what a good plant. 3
I'm looking for a really good chai to make at home. This had good reviews and my local grocery store actually carried it. I brought it home, made a cup and literally couldn't drink it. I had to put 3 tsp the sugar in it and extra cream to even be able to take a few sips. And thats reslly saying domething because i usually take little to no sugar in my tea. I actually like bitter black tea. This chai by stash isn't bitter so much as just plsin bad. I love chai and used to order loose leaf ( at a high price) from a place online that doesn't have it anymore. I guess you get what you pay for. This tea has a terrible after taste i can't begin to describe. Like dirt or sour cinnamon. I like both cinnamon and cloves so i'm not sure my complaint is the same as other reviewers. It really tastes like old bitter, sour, cheap spices to me! Glad i got this on sale at the store rather than wasted money ordering here. This box willbe going to work, annonously so no one knows it's from me! Or perhaps i should just throw it out. Don't like to be wasteful but I can't bear the thought of drinking a whole box of this! 1
This little packet makes a whole pan full of sweet corn goodness.  Is it a side dish or a dessert or both?  You decide.  Easy to prepare and delicious on the table. 5
The choclate used is not very complex or flavorful, making the bars a bit bland.  I was so excited to find this product but it was a disappointment--definitely not chocolate for chocolate lovers. 3
I eat crystallized ginger because I have a finicky stomach. I've tried several brands. This brand just doesn't cut it.<br /><br />Each package has ginger, coated very liberally with sugar, and then about another teaspoon of sugar added to the bag for no particular reason. The extra sugar just adds weight to the bag. If you buy this, shake the bag up, then remove the ginger. At the bottom of the bag, you'll have a nice teaspoon of sugar for your coffee or tea.<br /><br />If you like super-sweet candy and  plan on filling your sugar jar with the extra sugar, then you'll like this. If you're looking for something that tastes like ginger, look elsewhere. 1
This was hands down the worst coffee I've ever had.  I bought it because Amazon had it on sale for a fantastic price...little did I know that it was going to be so bad that no one in my office could drink it.  This coffee is a waste of money and I would not recommend it to anyone. 1
Compared to the Numi Oolong loose leaf teas, this one is about half the price.  The loose tea is comprised of almost all leaves, with just a sprinkle of sprigs.  In the mouth, the tea is mild with slight roasted quality, quite harmonious but not very distinctive.  It is a pleasant but definitely lacking character, especially when you compared it to the Numi Iron Goddess or Bao Hai Oolong varietals.  Nice for the money, but I think I would rather pay twice as much for a better Oolong. 3
This is a quality tea that requires you to follow the directions.  My first attempt was by using my old method that works well with a different brand of tea.  In my opinion, when I did the job my old way the result was powerful (too strong).  After two more failed attempts I finally decided to read and follow the brief directions on the package. What have been enjoying for a few years is a strong tea with milk.  Now I have discovered a tea that can be enjoyed straight. 4
I haven't tried these yet; they have just arrived, but I wanted to warn fellow customers that you will be receiving 56 TOTAL ounces (four packages of 14 ounces each):  that adds up to 72 cents per ounce! Amazon has given me an appropriate refund, so props to them.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Flavor-wise I enjoyed these pumpkin raviolis:  Are they worth the specialty 40.00 dollar price?  -I would say not because the pumpkin flavor gets overwhelmed by the sauce and even by the ravioli pasta itself.  Another issue is that the raviolis are covered in powder and thus make a mess, especially when recycling.  I would pay 20-30 dollars for this product for a gift, but probably not 40. 2
We were buying thses from our vet, but they are so expensive. So glad we found them online.  Our dog loves these! Thanks! 5
These chips are pretty delicious.. Even the original flavor with nothing on it is good. It's not as delicious as Doritos, but it's also not fried either, which definitely balances it out. A good snack for all times of day! 5
I've had some of the other Pacific Natural brand products, and enjoyed them.  This one however, I just didn't care for.  It wasn't as good as some of their other chowders, and even though it was a lot of food, it wasn't satisfying.<br /><br />Since the flavor was potato rosemary I expected those to be the predominant flavors.  And they were to an extent, especially the rosemary.  There definitely was that piney flavor that permeated the soup.  The potatoes took a back seat though and while they represented most of the texture, they didn't really have that potato-like taste.  I also thought it was somewhat watery and nothing like the texture of a chowder at all.  There were other vegetables included, but you really couldn't taste them.  Another note on the texture, I encountered some rosemary sprigs that were tough to chew.  It didn't bother me, but I know it bothers a lot of people.<br /><br />The ingredients were pretty good.  Only a few things are in this including water, potatoes, cream, onion, celery, carrot, cornstarch, sea salt, garlic, rosemary, and natural flavor.  So really, not that much at all.  Which is good, I hate when they add fillers and at least with sea salt it's a healthier salt than normal.  Calorie wise its about 230 per serving, and there are two servings in the box.  I of course ate both servings since I had nowhere to store the rest at work, but even so it made up a pretty large portion that I almost couldn't finish.  It just wasn't satisfying as said before.  Fat is 8 grams per serving and sodium 730 mg per serving.  There are some vitamins, but I don't think they were added in intentionally, just a product of the food contained within.<br /><br />I wouldn't buy this flavor again.  Too watery and the taste wasn't that fantastic.  I'll stick to the other flavors from the brand.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012 2
This product should be described clearly at the front of the package (not the inside after it is revealed)that it contains partially hydrogenated oil. Also, I feel that it should not be in the "organic & natural" section of Amazon's grocery. 1
Even on the small cup setting of the elite, these are a little weak for me.  Make sure you shake the cups before putting them in your machine or they will be way too weak.  I also run a cup of hot water thru the maker before using these so there is no coffe taste to them. 3
I prepare these baked potatoes in a toaster oven. They are the perfect compliment to a hamburger, steak or chicken entree. Try them. You'll like them! 5
I was very excited when I received a Keurig coffee maker as a Christmas present, & couldn't wait to put it to use.  However, in the three months since I've had it, I have struggled to find what I think is a good cup of coffee.  Most of the brands I've tried have either been too weak or too strong.<br /><br />I am not a "Starbucks" kind of coffee drinker, or fan of fancy flavored coffees.  I just like a regular cup of coffee that smells good when it's brewing, & tastes smooth when I drink it.  Finally, just like Goldilocks said, this one is "just right". 5
These were nasty, they were so greasy and too rich for my blood, plus they lacked major flavor, no spicy jalapeno flavor at all.  I was so dissapointed in these chips, I am always hearing great things about these chips but I am telling you, yuck yuck yuck.  Give me pain chips any day.  Maybe there is a better kettle chip brand out there but I am staying clear from these chips. I wish I could give these zero stars if I could. 1
This was easy to dissolve in either cold or hot water.  It's a pretty strong ginger taste, which I like.  If you are a fan of ginger ale or love ginger you will probably enjoy this.  I also get car sick easily and bringing a long water bottle with some of this is a great way to ease my upset stomach.<br /><br />I would recommend to people who enjoy the taste of ginger.  I would also recommend as a great cure for upset stomachs, especially those caused by motion sickness. 4
I really appreciate the ingredients in this gum, and the fact that it is more natural, but the flavor is only so-so. My kids haven't complained, but they are not picky when it comes to things like gum. I have had problems with it sticking to my teeth or fillings. That is not pleasant. But in spite of the down-sides, I will probably purchase this gum again because I don't like giving my kids artificial sweeteners, which are in most other kinds of gum. 3
This is our favorite K-cup at home. Mellow and flavorful.<br /><br />Also, I wanted to clear-up the question of whether or not this is decaf - it is not. See the response I received from WP Coffee:<br /><br />"Is Breakfast in Bed K-cup actually a decaf coffee?"<br /><br />"Thanks for reaching out to Wolfgang Puck Coffee. The Breakfast in Bed is not a decaf blend...."<br /><br />Thanks.<br />Mandy M<br />Customer Service<br />Wolfgang Puck Coffee 5
I think this is one of those types of food products where you will either really like it or not care for it.<br /><br />I am a chocolate fan and I love chocolate and almonds, so I figured this was a natural fit for me.<br /><br />Upon opening the first bar it seems like any other bar of it's type. However, once that first bite was in my mouth it's evident it was not. The chocolate in these bards over powers the taste of anything else. Like I said, I'm a chocolate fan but this was just too potent of chocolate for my tastes.<br /><br />Since there were a dozen in the box I decided to let a few others try them. It was a mixed bag of results there too. One person took one bite and would have no more. One said they were okay with coffee. One person ate an entire bar before deeming it "not very good". The last person really liked them and said he would buy them in a store. So, basically 1 out of 5 people in my highly unscientific research liked them.<br /><br />I guess if you are a dark chocolate person these may be something you'll like. But if you're not stay clear of these. 2
The product came at the end of August with expiration date of 01/07. As a result I could not eat it. Just waist of money 1
Great value for the money spent, actually too much... The bottle is plastic. They look like glass in the picture though. 4
I was hoping the Timothy French Roast K-cups would be as good as the Tully's French Roast K-cups; but, in my opinion it is not.  The Tully's FR is much bolder and more flavorful.  I have a standing order for the Timothy FR that I am going to cancel. 3
This tea is the best tea i've ever had. i first tasted it in norway, and had to find it in the states. i have it every morning. 4
Perhaps I ordered at the wrong time, but I found this product to be very average.  Certainly it wasn't anything like the other glowing review above.  The fruit was OK, but certainly didn't seem very fresh.  The apricots were tough and didn't have much flavor. The date rolls with coconut were pretty tasty, but were kind of sloppily made.<br />They talked about the lovely wooden box which was just cheaply made stuff.  I would have rather have had a simple paper box with a lid.  This had no lid of any kind.  Maybe I'll try again in season, whenever that is. 3
I am from the Philippines, a country where there is an abundance of coconuts. I miss drinking coconut water which is something that you can easily get in my country by buying fresh coconut. So, I decided to try this product hoping to get the same satisfying taste that one would get from fresh coconut water. It turned out to be a disappointment. I do not doubt that this is indeed pure coconut water but it does have a sort of artificial flavor and smell to it. It might be just due to the plastic bottle itself. 3
I love this product! I make all my own baby food and this makes the perfect portion size.  A bit pricy but worth it. 5
This is a wonderful product, I was happy to see I could buy it on Amazon because our local stores quit carrying it!  We use it mostly to sprinkle over chicken wings to make a cajun wing..yummy!  It can be used on almost everything. Love It! 5
When I opened the package, the salt did not look right. I compared it to some of the Himalayan salt I had from Whole foods and it was a lighter pink. Opened the bag and tasted it. It sure tasted like regular salt was added. Great price but you get what you pay for. Nice trick. 1
This product is portrayed as healthy and natural, but I was shocked and dismayed to see that it's shipped from halfway across the world. I understand buying electronics, shoes, etc. from China, but my FOOD? I doubt the safety of this food product, and don't see how they can guarantee that  it's vegan, non-GMO, dairy free, wheat-free, gluten-free, etc. Plus I don't see the point in purchasing something that has obviously left such a hefty carbon footprint. But beyond that, how hard is it to make a delicious snack like this in the USA, from USA-grown ingredients? Seriously? 1
Taste good but are nothing special, a coffee bean covered in mediocre chocolate.  They don't last long once opened though, I should have put them in a tupperware in the fridge.  That's not the product's fault though... 4
This really is the only choice when it comes to soy and dairy free baking (unless you want to use lard).  The Spectrum shortening uses palm kernel oil and has the consistancy of regular Crisco (perhaps a little stiffer).  It seems to bake just fine and if you need to be soy and dairy free I highly recommend it. 5
These Lowrey's Bacon Curls are wonderful.  They are so fresh, great tasting.  Have found however that cooking them in the bag doesn't work very well, so we spread them out in a single layer and heat for 5:30 minutes in a 1000 watt microwave.  Will be ordering them again. 5
I have used  various sports supplements over the years in biking, skiing and hockey. None created any problems. I decided to try the Sports Beans and use them when I do my 4 hour road bike rides. They would have been more convient and bulky then food or other products. I comsumed three bags. I noticed no energy benefit and in fact road only three hours instead of four. The worst was yet to come. At 2 am in the morning I awoke with severe teeth acres. This product had caused my teeth to become infected and I ended up going an Urgent Care for pain meds and amoxicillin. Looking closely at the ingredients the top two are EVAPORATED CANE JUICE and TAPIOCA SYRUP. Jelly Belly is a candy company not into sports nutrition and that's what this product is. Candy misrepresented as a sports supplement. BEWARE. Avoid unless you have bullet proof teeth. Many better and safer products on the market. 1
This organic Keurig coffee, tastes pretty good and the price is pretty good too. The bulk purchase is necessary to get a better price. So be sure you have room to store this many k cups before you buy. 4
I love coffee with no bitterness and lots of good coffee taste and this one fits the bill. Holds up well to milk & sugar-I love it in the morning for the first cup and in the evening just as much. Definitely would buy it again. 5
It took me a decade of yo-yo dieting on various plans, four short-term successes, and now, hopefully, a long-term success is on the way. I have lost 35 lbs in 6 months, and going strong. I lost it gradually and within recommended weight loss recommendations (1-2 lbs a week). I didn't starve myself, stop my social life for any diet's decrees, and I definitely wasn't under the tutelage of any one diet. I have done that already and realize a few things: 1) you must exercise daily, 2) you must mind calories, 3) you must eat 3 meals and 2 snacks every day, and 4) the types of nutrients matter (omega 3, 6, and 9 fats, thermogenic herbs, antioxidants, etc.)<br /><br />The greatest myth I busted was any form of perfectionism. If you have a candy bar once in a while, that doesn't mean you are a big failure, you have to start all over, and you might as well do that next week (so you can binge in the meantime).<br /><br />All diets are perfectionistic. They focus on one aspect of healthy eating and run with it to fit the lose-weight-overnight / Can-I-also-have-a-pizza-with-all-the-fixings? mentality of the typical deluded American. That's why we have the Atkins diet, illustrating the worst of this concept. However, these diets aren't bad, because you can extract a jewel of knowledge from each of these regimens. Atkins taught us to watch carbs and not to fear protein (although that doesn't mean you can eat bacon); Fat Flush teaches you the difference between good and bad fats, thermogenic herbs (that raise the metabolism), and a very basic understanding of the Glycemic Index, and Thurmond teaches you what combinations of foods work to lose weight and the power of eating many small meals throughout the day.<br /><br />Larabar is another great example of the focused diet. The jewel is the omega fats 3 and 6, gluten-free, no dietary sweeteners (which increase your appetite and studies have correlated artificial sweeteners to weight gain because of its high glycemic index count), and it being all natural, organic, and kosher. That's great, when you focus on only this aspect. But still, however popular diets have become, Weight Watchers, Jenny Craig, and the like can never be ignored. The one irrefutable truth is the calories you take in determine what your weight will be in the immediate future. If there is a high fat percentage, which are calories still, you have to consider that.<br /><br />LARABARS HAVE 45 - 55 % FAT! 200 + CALORIES! These health bars are healthy, but I would only have them as a reward before or after a good workout. This is the first review that I am rating this low because of the padding I suspect going on. One reviewer talks about the low calories, which is totally false. Two reviewers talk about how healthy it is, sounding very close to an infomercial as he focuses on only one aspect but ignores another. The suspicion arises when these two reviewers rate this bar 5 STARS 3-4 FREAKIN' TIMES WITH THE SAME WORDS! They must mention the excessive calories and fat in these bars, or else someone's going to go off of insufficient information and eat one every day with a sedentary lifestyle. Compare this bar to a Snickers, and you may have a different perspective. What is labeled "healthy" can be very bias.<br /><br />MY POINT BEYOND LARABARS: You can't focus on one system of ideas, because health and nutrition and weight loss are much larger and much more demanding concepts of nature's effect on the body. It's how you sustain and develop habits and balance in life, and it's about the knowledge you keep in your head, so you can deftly cut corners through increasing your metabolism or burning the maximum calories. It's about myth busting. It's about making smart choices. It's about knowing what choices are in the first place; if you choose one path, you can't choose another. Sacrifices may be what your particular body requires to be healthy and lose weight. You won't find a real chili-dog diet. You won't find a sugar that tastes exactly like sugar. One path leads to one place, while the other path leads to another. Note the difference, and be realistic.<br /><br />Lastly, the only health change you can make overnight happens in your head, not in your body. 1
I love using fresh ginger and lemon when I cook, so when I saw that there was a ginger and lemon drink I had to try it.  While the flavor was good, it did leave a slight after taste, but not enough to deter me from trying it again.  My only complaint is that I received a sample pack of the Gold Kili drink and it did not have any directions as to how much water to use.  I tend to like most of my foods and drinks very flavorful, so I opted for a regular coffee mug, but found it too strong and ended up pouring it into my largest one.  All in all, I thought this provided a nice change of pace for the basic varieties of teas, coffee and other warm drinks that are on the market today. 4
Bought these to give me a different taste with my Paleo Diet. Flavor just too strong for me and long term aftertaste. But then I don't like ranch dressing etc. so it may just be me. 3
This product is so sturdy and great. The rope only lasted a day, but I still use the jug constantly. My Lab loves it and it has held up to her power chewing. Once she figured it out I've had to use larger treats to keep her busier longer. Great product. 4
Refreshing taste love the decaf, because I can have some before bed, still resting well, quick delivery. Twining's is a good brand, it doesn't taste like your drinking tea dust in the bags 5
I used to buy these delicious crackers at my health food market, but they stopped carrying them. I was happy to find them at Amazon, but when my order arrived, they were all broken up, many in very small pieces. I asked for a replacement, and it came quickly, but again, many of the crackers were broken up. It doesn't look like the packaging is going to improve any time soon, if ever, and it's a shame. When I bought them at my health food store, they were all in one piece, so obviously, it's possible. 4
I like my espresso drinks. I wouldn't say I am an expert but I have at least one mocha (whole milk, half choc) daily from Kaldis, Starbucks or my new thing is making it on my office DeLonghi 32Bar Pump Espresso machine.<br />I wanted to like the Dolce Gusto Cappuccino, I really did. I wanted the no mess option for my home kitchen. It would save me money, it would save me time. So I read the reviews and I purchased it after serious consideration.<br />I am disappointed. All I could taste when I drank it, was a sort of powdered milk taste - it reminded me of coffee creamer which I never drink (the last time was stuck waiting for a car service at Midas three or four years ago). So if you really like your espresso and froth, this will not cut it. If you were having a party and your guests were not foodies, or wanted coffee in the morning in a rush, or if you don't mind the taste of coffee creamer, then this is not the worst espresso drink I have ever had. It compares to an average restuarant that serves this type of drink BUT does [not] compare to a coffee house despite the claims on the box.<br />See my review on the Cafe Lungo option if you want to know what it tastes like when you remove the milk capsule as a factor... 1
This bread is very dry and crumbly compared to the other major brand. Will definitely not be switching from my usual brand (without the 'R'). 2
Order was done well and without a problem. Employees like all of the 5 hour energy. 4
Chips Ahoy cookies were not very tasty.  My children and husband would not eat them.  I tried to give them away and everyone refused. 2
I don't know about you but there is nothing like a warm poo in your hand first thing in the morning.<br /><br />I don't think I'd even be interested in having a dog anymore if there wasn't the thought of being able to scoop up the warm poo after intently watching him give waste to his kibble every morning. How would I know I was still alive if not for the warm embrace?<br /><br />This product is absolutely brilliant but what about the fecal freaks... Where is our product? 3
After the purchase I found the same brand & size at a lesser price at the local Grocery store, My fault for not checking the price prior to purchase. 3
This has been a good product for me.  It seems to be increasing my milk production, but not by a lot.  If you forget to take it once or twice, your milk production will decrease again almost immediately.  I'm glad I got this to help me get a little further with breast milk for my child, but if your milk is pretty good and your not good at remembering to take pills, I wouldn't bother. 3
I love iced coffee so was eager to try this. I appreciated that it was lightly sweetened and that it didn't have any added dairy.  The portion was just the right size and I liked the strong espresso flavor.  It did have a bit of a bitter, over roasted flavor to it -- not entirely unpleasant but not a "great" cup of coffee.  I would consider buying this again but wouldn't go out of my way to look for it. 4
The Lickety Stick is truly a unique product. It's basically a rollerball bottle (like some deodorants) with different flavored syrups (like chicken, beef, or bacon). I've never seen anything like it. The promo video says dogs love the taste and it's very low cal (oddly, the video also warns of an epidemic of pet obesity, which while probably is true, I had never heard it described in such catastrophic and somber tones). The treat is on the high price end of what dog treats usaully cost, but the maker boasts each bottle contains over 500 licks. I've been trying to figure out if that's a good deal. Normal-sized treat bags don't usually have 500 treats, but on the other hand, you would never just give your dog 1 lick off this thing.<br /><br />If your dog likes the Lickety Stick (there are review testimonies here going both ways), then it's left up to you how long puppy gets to lick, so the touted cost-effectiveness could quickly evaporate (there is no recommended serving size on the bottle). All in all, the Lickety Stick reminds me of a sugar free lollipop. They can have a decent flavor, but not everyone will like them; they don't have calories, so they're "healthier;" and because they're calorie free, they don't fill you up at all, which leaves me with a final thought.<br /><br />Regular dog treats do at least have a substance factor; they are a solid food. The Lickety Stick is a calorie free liquid, so the filling factor is missing. And so while Charlie did enjoy the Lickety Stick, she probably won't be getting another one. She is already in great physical condition, eats an organic dog food regimented according to the bag-recommended diet, and is taking C9 vitamin supplements. Basically, she gets enough health stuff is what I'm saying; so when she does get a treat, I want her to enjoy it like the treat that it is. I'm not convinced the Lickety Stick does that. Now, if you are trying to wean your pet off table food or lower their weight, this product could probably help you do that. 2
My kids like a peanut butter sandwich for a snack, but their school is "nut free". At the beginning of the year, they were willing to eat this Wowbutter, but by the middle of the school year, they were saying it tastes bad. It doesn't really taste like peanut butter; it's kind of a smokey taste. I think the smokiness was overpowering for the kids. It's not bad, so it still gets 3 stars, but I think adults would enjoy this more than kids. Try Sunbutter instead for kids. 3
Sprayed Animal Repellant with a slightly heavier concentration than instructions indicated. Although noxious to human scent, doesn't seem to work on whatever is attacking my tomatoes. 2
The cherry kool-aid I got sucks. It is tart with very little cherry flavor. I have had much better cherry flavored water INCLUDING much more flavorful cherry kool-aid. Very disappointed because I think the manufacturer left their own product review just to off load carppy lot/batch of kool aid. 1
I do not recommend this food for your pet. I ordered this as a replacement food for my two adult boxers. About a week after transitioning to this food my two year old female started having head tremors. I did some research and found that this is benign and can happen with foods with certain ingredients. I changed the food and the head tremors stopped. I now feed my dogs Taste of the Wild and love it. 1
My lab chewed up the rope in a couple hours. This alone is not a huge deal as the instructions with the toy say that a ball can be placed inside the container and have a similar effect as the rope. However, before I could even place a ball in it, the plastic developed a large crack from the dog just carrying his toy around the house and dropping it on our carpetted floors. He has other plasic toys that he has had for months with absolutely no signs of damage. 1
This was a very disappointing coffee.  It is very weak, I had to set my brew to a medium just to get any flavor from it and  large is very watered down. I would find something different before buying this again. 2
Sorry but I do not like bitter food but know I now. I love olives but not these dried ones. 2
I don't trust dog treats (or much else) from China.<br />WISH AMAZON WOULD StART A MADE IN AMERICA CATEGORY!!<br />I love my Amazon prime account. I would be willing to pay a few dollars for a "PRIME USA" account 2
Over the past year my wife has been pushing me (kicking & screaming) into a somewhat more healthy diet with the purpose of helping me lose weight and gain control of my cholesterol. Having me try a number of these fiber bar type things is one of the ways. For the most part I am not a big fan of them but am always on the lookout for one that will appeal to my fat/sugar-loving taste buds. Pamela's Whenever Bars is the latest of a long list of hopefuls.<br /><br />On the plus side; wheat-free, glutton-free, and non-dairy. They include Omega 3 fatty acids and no Trans fats. It's also low in sugar, low in sodium, and low in saturated fats. This is probably a good and quick snack for those with special dietary needs.<br /><br />On the negative site; the taste will be an acquired one, at least for me. It's not a bad taste by any stretch of the imagination but in my opinion it's not one I look forward to either. Maybe it's the lack of sweetness to the bar, or at least not enough sweetness that makes it more of a necessary snack instead of an attractive one. We'll see if it eventually grows on me.<br /><br />Overall, a decent and healthy snack that is not terrible tasting. Could be better but based on other bars I've tried, could be a lot worse. 3
I used to eat these all the time when I was in Japan. They didn't cost nearly that much though. In Japan they're about $4. You can get them for about $5 at [...]<br /><br />They're a lot of fun, I sent a few to my niece and nephews. Definitely fun for kids. Asian food grocer also discounts if you buy more. I'd check them out before buying these. 1
Most dogs love these but our dog was less than pleased.  He is a tad persnickety.  It is a good product with few calories. Great for training purposes. 5
We got the salmon and the peanut butter flavors for our puppies, and they go crazy for them. They were really hard to potty train, but these were small and healthy enough that we were able to give them to our dogs every time they pottied outside. They worked great for that, and our dogs finally got the message! But they really don't smell appetizing, and even one of the salmon ones will make their breath smell terrible for a whole day!<br /><br />I'm giving it 4 stars for that reason. If your dogs like them as much as ours do, I think it's well worth the stinky breath. 4
There are only a few candies in this tiny box, not worth spending over $20. 4
Based in part on the helpful reviews I found here, I tried a jar. I mixed it with jelly and came up with the perfect filling for pb&j sandwiches. Next up, Pad Thai with shirataki fettucini noodles. I find the flavor is good, and the powder a little gritty until mixed with something wet. When I travel on long road trips, I often carry pb&j makings and fruit for a quick, inexpensive and easy lunch. This will be a nice, lightweight addition to my travel food stores. 4
I like these.  Like the packaging too.  These are not chocolate dipped, but cocoa powdered.  And the flavor is cocoa, not chocolate.  Very sweet.  Probably good because a few go along way.  Very flavorful. 4
I felt that the product was outstanding. Its addition to my breakfasts was a welcome boost of energy 5
the grand children love them.  It's a great way to keep them entertained and behaved cuz they know they will get a treat from grandma. 5
I am shocked that anyone would pay a whopping 2.50 a bottle for this stuff.  It tastes horrible and I cannot imagine ever reaching for it to rehydrate myself for any reason.  I know the benefits of coconut water but there must be one that tastes better than this! 1
I have to admit upfront I am lazy and not a good cook. I bought this rice in attempt to get a easy solution for anti oxidants but I could not really dehusks these with out it becoming a pain. I understand most of you probably have no problem. If your cooking challenged like my self these were just not worth it. 2
I have ordered numerous teas, potions, lotions and other remedies...BUT have never had a lack of product in an order that was sealed.  The tea bag wrapping in question was sealed without a tea bag inside.  I would have said something sooner, however...I only tried these when I had a sinus infection and the last 3 times I tried to use one...the sealed pouch was EMPTY.  BEWARE! 1
Was very happy to find this at such a resonable price and I am sure it will a very good product.  The unfortunate part is they seem to charge shipping according to the price of an item, not the weight.  By the time you add up shipping and price of the xanthan gum you will pay the same anywhere.  Not a savings! 2
This is great especially if you are kosher and live in an area like me where it is hard to get kosher food. It come right to my door and easy to make. Tastes great with some coconut milk and chile peppers. 4
I have now tried both the Ocean Fish and Tuna and the Duck and Chicken variety of this food.  My cat seems to prefer the taste of the duck and chicken a little better, but I will probably rotate them both because of the health benefits he's gotten (especially from the ocean fish and tuna) that have included a softer coat and less scratching and biting of himself and shedding.  Also, with this food, he doesn't drink much water, but still goes potty alot, so I feel good that he's getting plenty of fluids in his diet.  My only complaint with this brand, and why I only give it 4 stars, is that it has little pieces of potato? and whole peas in it, which my cat eats around and ends up being wasteful, which I don't like given the price.  Not that big of a deal, but it is a minor inconvenience that I have to clean leftover bits out after each feeding as opposed to just washing his empty bowl daily.  (In case you are wondering, it is approximately 4 to 6 whole pea/1.5 pea size potato? bits per 1/4 to 1/2 can.) 4
I bought these because I am on a low carb diet. They are way way too salty...salt is bad for you to begin with but they really overdid it here...also there are a few ingredients that I can't pronounce...I thought they were more natural...Overall I would not buy again.... 3
By initial appearances, this looks like it could be very good.  Sweetened by honey - good, natural - good, but then take a look at the actual ingredients.  Not much natural about this.  Sure honey is one of the ingredients, but so is sucralose.  I know plenty of people are fine with this or use it as a substitute for sugar for dietary reasons, but I can't stand the stuff.  The mix of different tastes (tea, pomegranate, sucralose) is very unpleasant to me.  Of course tastes vary between any two people and you may enjoy this, but be aware that it does contain artificial sweeteners if that is not what you are looking for.  I have also tried the Mango version and although it also contains sucralose, it is a bit more tolerable. 1
I couldn't get past the acidic taste of this coffee. I know French roasts are strong, but this one was overpowering. 2
So I'm not going to taste these myself so I'll just have to rely on the enthusiastic reception by my wheaten terrier. Obviously the big draw here is the quality ingredients and assurance of the brand. I probably am more willing to spend on quality brand food for my dog than I am for me. I try to avoid Chinese food products since they have regulatory issues. No need to rehash the whole pet food scandal. That said it's easy to but junk American pet food too so I try to shop carefully. This seems to be a quality dog snack that the dog enjoys... 5
Dieting since mid-May using whole grains in pastas, rice, etc, and this orzo in whole wheat is just not able to be found anywhere but here--so happy to find it. (Now if I could also find whole grain orecchiette too, hint). With 9 grams of fiber per 2oz serving, this orzo delivers high fiber, just what I wanted.  Use it in rice dishes like pilafs and stuffed peppers, add to soups, or just serve as a side dish on its own w/butter and sage, etc..no need to go back to white orzo anymore. 5
Crackers looked fine but I didn't try them because the ingredient list on the package listed soy, which I can't have.  I went back and checked the Amazon description and the ingredient list did NOT list soy.  Makes me hesitate to order grocery items if I can not trust the information on the description. 2
It was everything that I expected it to be. Very quick service as I recieved the shipment 2 days early. 4
These are decent, but if you want a realllly good salt and vinegar chip, try Boulder's Salt and Malt Vinegar chips.  THOSE are awesome. 3
While you would expect Ghiradelli to make good chocolate, the flavor of this mocha cocoa is precisely that of great darker chocolate flavor, using just enough coffee flavor to accent the cocoa without overtaking it.  A smooth, delicious start or finish to your day - even a warm afternoon pick me up on those chilly days! 5
We tried this a couple times, but we have a SUBSTANTIAL preference for the Kraft Bacon Ranch Pasta Salad.  It's the same idea as this, but for some reason the Betty Crocker Suddenly Salad gave our family upset stomachs both times we tried it.  In fact, my kids started calling it "Suddenly something down your leg", which is what it is known as to this day in our house.  The sad part is the Kraft version is MUCH harder to find, but definitely superior.  Check out the Kraft one - more delicious and less crampy results. 2
This orchid arrived in good shape.  I was a little skeptical as to the "blooming size," but they were right...it bloomed 9 months after arriving, with 3 big, beautiful blooms...not bad for a first-time bloomer.  And the colors are outstanding! 5
I got this for Father's day and my dad loved it and did not mention one thing about it being small or anything. This really made his day so I am pleased with the idea to order the gift for him. I would recommend it! 3
I recieved this Ghee right away and came safely packaged. I love that it is grass-fed and organic, very important to my family. We use this with stir fry and saut&eacute;ing and can't wait to try on our popcorn! Delicious Ghee! 4
I was actually pretty disappointed with these, which really is inconvenient now that I have an entire case of them! A bunch of them were all but broken when I opened the boxes, and my kids aren't big fans of them either. They are picky, but pizza or anything even remotely pizza usually never fails... no such luck here. That and plan on having to bake them to warm them (which takes 25 plus minutes), otherwise they come out a bit soggy from the microwave... 2
My twins love this!! BUT Walmart sells them for $1/ for a 2pack!  Worth going there to save the extra $! 3
Of my two cats, just one will "eat" TOTW canned food and even she only goes for it once or twice per month. I notice, like others, that she's into the gravy more than the meat so I'll probably stop buying it. The dry food is so damn good, it's a shame TOTW can't bring that same excellence to canned food.<br /><br />I give two stars because atleast the one cat doesn't back away from it. She takes a couple slurps and then leaves. Fair enough for a 2 star rating IMO. 2
I love the other Donut House coffees but this one is aweful. It tastes like watered down coffee with a hint of chocolate. 1
This is not regular coffee as the description would lead you to believe... it's artificially flavored, and it appears from the other ratings that you either love the flavor or hate it. My household hated it. Of course, that would be my problem if the description was accurate, but it's not. Amazon refunded my money and said someone would check the information on the product page. 1
I read the last few reviews indicating no dented cans and hoped for the best.  My box arrived today and I too received badly damaged, dented and unusable cans.  I'm not terribly picky but most cans are dented at the rims/seams and all are badly smashed all over.  This was my last hope for canned pumpkin for my dog.  I do not believe the Amazon packaging is the problem. The cans were already dented prior to being shrink-wrapped.  I do not believe stores would put these cans on their shelves and I would never buys cans with this much damage. I have never been unhappy with an Amazon purchase, but this product was a waste of my time. 1
I ordered these to use for marathon training. I have a sensitive stomach,but have had no problems with these. They do give me energy during those long runs! 5
I like most varieties of Primal Strips. They are a fantastic snack for active vegetarians (11g protein, 3g unsaturated fat, 7g carbs.). The Teriyaki variety is a little bland in comparison to some of the other flavors. This may be exactly what some people are looking for. I prefer a little more kick. 4
These were gross. It was like chomping down on a chunk of salt. I regret wasting my money and will not purchase in the future 1
Since being gluten free I've tried all types of GF breads and they are all very expensive. Who knew that the brazilians had the bread game on lock with this inexpensive tapioca version of cheese bread! It's custom which is probably why they are all so skinny! lol But I loved it and will be ordering a whole lot more! 5
When I first saw the website for this i thought it was a joke, especially growing up listening to the Offspring, Pennywise, the Vandals et al... anyways, decided to see who carried it and they have it at my podunk, hillbilly a$$ food 4 less here... $3 bucks a bottle, kinda pricey, I thought, till i saw how much it is here on amazon... I suggest checking your local Albertson's or Food 4 less and seeing if they have it, you'll never want tapatillo or chalula again... this is the real deal and tastes amazing!! I guess if it's one thing us Southern Californian's have in common it's our love of mexican food, and as any good So Cal resident knows, the salsa makes the burrito (or at least can make it go down easier in some cases)... Seriously good hot sauce!!! 5
I really like Bob's Red Mill products. This item came promptly and is perfect for my baking needs. I totally recommend it! 5
After making several batches using different techniques I can only get 50% of the kernels to pop.  I used a different brand of kernels with much better results.  The only conclusion I can come to is that these packages are stale.  It doesn't help that there is no expiration or manufacture date listed anywhere on the packages.  I would recommend to not buy this product. 1
I can't find caviar anywhere in a two hour radius so when I found this caviar on amazon... I figured why not. When it got to the house I was apprehensive to open it- I've had bad experiences with mail-order foods... but this was PERFECT!  Not too salty, and makes a special dinner even more-so. If you're looking for something special for these holiday meals... order this and prepare to blow your taste buds off for the price.  This earns the Fifi seal of approval! 4
My dogs enjoy any type of "puppy cookie", they're not picky at all. But I noticed that in feeding them this product they started to prefer this brand over all others! I am happy knowing they enjoy it, but I'm even happier knowing that it is filled with all sorts of good "real" food - not by-products and what not. I would highly recommend these! 5
Our dogs do NOT like this and won't eat it. Yes, they have no problem with the Libby's real canned pumpkin, but not this brand. 1
I have tried a couple of the other Switch flavors, and I found them to be very disappointing.  This variety, on the other hand, had excellent Kiwi and Strawberry flavors.  However, I emphasize FLAVORS because that is where the Switch drinks get gimmicky.  They are all marketed under the flavors/juices that appear WAY DOWN on the ingredient listing.  The several varieties that I have tried all have apple and white grape juice as the top ingredients.  This seems like false advertising to me, since those juices are clearly not as appealing.  Anyway, this drink is all about the marketing.  The price you are paying for 8 ounces of carbonated juice is clearly an extravagance, and I wouldn't do it again.  Save yourself some money and visit the juice aisle at the grocery store. 2
I'd eagerly awaited for delivery of this vanilla candy that I vividly remembered from childhood and was disappointed with this ersatz version of Bonomo's Turkish Taffy.  It's not as rich and creamy in the mouth and doesn't have the real vanilla flavor that I recall in the original.  I would bet that the ingredients are not the same; for one thing soy is now used. 3
Switch is a tangy drink that's more reminiscent of Sprite than Orange Juice. It's carbonated all the way and you will even burp after it as you would've after consuming any soft drink. The drink doesn't feel sugary, but a quick glance at the nutritional facts reveals that each can contains 34 grams of sugar. The claim on the can is that there are no additional sugars added, so I'm assuming that's the sugar from the orange and tangerine. The can 2
I am not too sure why it is the case, but the coffee seemed not fresh and having been roasted quite awhile ago. I am not sure if it is adistribution issue or the roaster's fault, but I was not really satisfied. It is the first time I try ordering coffee from Amazon. 3
I have long been a fan of mixing juice, such as orange joice, with a carbonated soda like 7Up - it provided the best of both worlds, fresh juice and carbonation. The down side over the last number of years is the high fructose corn syrup that has replaced sugar in the carbonated sodas.<br /><br />But, of late there have been alternatives. First there was Orangina, which mixed 12% orange juice with carbonated soda - still had the sugar, but far better than mainstream sodas. Then a number of drinks have become available that mix the carbonation with a high percentage of real fruit juices. Some of these have been underwhelming to say the least. The best so far is IZZE with its 70% fruit juice and 30% carbonated water - no added sugars.<br /><br />Now comes along The Switch. The Switch is 100% fruit juice with carbonation added. And, like IZZE, I really like this drink. It is different than IZZE drinks; The Switch blends their juices different to achieve a little more subtle flavor where IZZE has more tang and punch. I can't say one is better than the other only that they each deliver a different refreshing experience.<br /><br />I have tried The Switch in Orange Tangerine and Black Cherry. The Orange Tangerine is very good! I highly recommend it. The Black Cherry is good, better than some other cherry drinks of this sort I have had, but it could be a bit better; it doesn't quite deliver the same flavor experience of a really good Black Cherry soda. 5
After finding out that my girlfriend needed to eat gluten free we went on a search for a good chocolate chip mix. At first they have a good taste but moments later they leave a weird after taste. This is the first Bobs product I can't recommend.  I guess I will just make them from scratch unless I can or someone recommend a brand to me... 2
I have been eating the 100 Calorie Chip Ahoy for sometime. I really find that it is a filling, guilt-free snack. It has a unique taste of its own - not a `diet' food-type taste either, it taste like a `real' snack. 5
I used to have no problem with these, until one day on an impulse I decided to give Target's Archer Farms brand coffee pods a try (breakfast blend aka medium roast).  They cost less, are bigger, individually wrapped and produce a much smoother coffee.  Now I can't drink Douwe Egberts anymore and am hooked on Archer Farms. 2
I was expecting more nuts but this is mostly gel, in fact some pieces have no nuts at all--also a bit on the too-sweet side for me but if that is what you like then go for it. 3
After my doctors told me that I needed to supplement with formula and stop breastfeeding as much because my daughter did not gain enough weight, i knew I did not want to use fomula. I found this goats milk and it not only helped her gain the weight she needed but it did not give her any GI upset. This was a god send and my 11 month old is still just as happy as when she was breasfteeding. She does not mind the taste and loves her bottles!!! 5
I expect salt in a salmon jerky, but this is fully twice the salt level as a similar item I also purchased. Worse, it permiated the flavor. It was like salmon jerky texture with salmon-salt flavor.  The package is 1.25 oz and in what seems stilly, claim 1.25 servings. Gee thanks. So of course we will eat the whole thing and the 38% of salt for a day is really about 46%.  I might as well eat Campbell soup if I wanted salt poisoning at that level - it'd be a lot cheaper.<br /><br />I did find one bone. I would not count that as a problem.  I did not like that the pieces were chopped into fairly small chips. 2
Not bad, but be warned that it tastes like a cocktail sauce. If you have anything else tomato flavored in your chili this will put it over the top and cause your chili to taste like it should be eaten with defrosted shrimp. 2
Adopted my cat from the ASPCA in the City. They had her on this Instinct Diet. My cat does not like this food sorry, plus when received it was more dust in the bag then nibblets. very disppointed 2
This was purchased as a gift.  My sister said they tasted very good and were really cute.  However, for the $$ you pay, she only got 8 cookies. 3
I find this product to be too sweet and syrupy and consequently does not quench my thirst. The size is nice but that's the only thing I liked about it. This is a subjective review of course and other's may love this product, just not me. 1
My husband and I went Gluten Free earlier this year due to a health condition.  We stumbled across this product at Whole Foods and decided to try it.  These were incredible...  so cheesy and spicy!!!  So much so, we decided to buy a case on Amazon.  Once our original case was depleted, we re-ordered, and though the product looks identical, the new case contained cheese curls with little to no seasoning.  They were so bland that we had no desire to eat them.  We opened each bag in the case hoping some of them would be good like the first case we purchased, but to our dismay, we ended up tossing the entire case.  We will not be buying these again.  What a letdown... 2
1000 island dressing...strawberry shakes...tofu faux omelet...!Convenient..fast..long shelf life..delish and organic,I order several 12pks at a time.I will also use this product for baking. 5
I have to say my golden and cocker love these treats and they are great for dogs, like my cocker, that have allergy issues and need higher quality food. I bought these at a specialty dog store for 3.00 more and the treats seem to be more solid than the ones I got from Amazon. The delivered treats were not consistent and many were hollow inside. This isn't even mentioning the fact that half the bag many of the treats were badly broken up but I can look past that versus the quality. Great treats and the dogs don't complain about my complaints :). 3
I was disappointed because I didn't pay attention to the quantity of the coffee.  I feel it's way overpriced for the very little coffee you get.  Two ounces of coffee for $8 is not a fair price. 2
I don't have many vices or bad habits, but when I first tasted the Kona Coffee Glazed Macadamia Nut I was not only hooked but I found myself thinking about them when my stash ran out. This is something that makes me salivate, and once I start eating them I don't want to stop. These should be on every shelf in every grocery store, but sadly, the only way I can find them outside of Hawaii is via mail order. 5
I was so excited to see gluten-free Bisquick. My grandmother and mother both used it. I fondly remember their strawberry shortcake, so that was the first thing I made. I almost cried, it was so good. I have since made the pancakes (yum yum) and baked chicken. I'm a regular at their web site, liveglutenfreely.com for its great recipes. Thank you, Bisquick! 5
We received the product in a timely manner after placing the order but it was expired when it arrived based on the date stamped on the neck of the bottles. 3
If you want a really good snack bar try these, they are healthy and taste as good as any granola bar, but without the gluten!! I buy these regularly. 5
I had heard quite a bit about the PB2, and being a lover of peanut butter, I thought I would try it. But, it just didn't do the trick. Taste was not what I like, though the consistency was OK. I prefer Better'n Peanut Butter. 2
The packaging was okay on the Easter eggs but they were all melted and the chocolate was white, very grose! We couldn't even eat them we had to throw them away. It would have been the same as throwing the money in the trash. 1
I've heard this is a good food, but was shocked to see after chicken meal so many grains. I did not feed this to my dog. I'd rather pay more money for better quality food. All those fillers are unneeded. I expect such a highly regarded company to have better ingredients. I always look for by products but didn't think to even bother to check the next 4 ingredients. Highly disappointed. 2
Salt tastes fine, cant say about the health claims. 3 stars is because of the packaging. The grinder top is too large for a comfortable grind. I have fairly large/strong hands and have a hard time turning the grinder. For me, when the grinder is mostly vertical to 45deg, it is difficult/impossible to grind directly onto food. Works fine if cap is left on & held in a horizontal position & them remove cap & use. The grind gives a nice fine grind (better than my OXO I also got at Amazon). 3
Besides the obvious convenience and portability of the individual creamers, I liked this item specifically because of packaging. I couldn't believe how many reviews I read about coffee creamer cups; but many of the Amazon creamer options (both Coffeemate and International Delight) had multiple negative reviews due to the shipment arriving with broken cups thanks to sloppy packaging.<br /><br />That was not an issue here. The shipment arrived in four dispensing boxes of 50 each (as shown in the photo); those boxes were tightly packed in a thick cardboard box which could take a good beating before damaging the inner boxes. Thus, none of my cups were broken, no waste and no sloppy drippy mess. Plus the four boxes means I could put one in the kitchen, one in the bathroom (we moved our mini Keurig there when we upgraded the kitchen Keurig - best idea my husband ever had), and one at work, with a reserve for whichever runs out first.<br /><br />If you are looking for these mini creamers but deterred like I was by the negative packaging reviews on other options, this is your best bet. As a bonus, the auto delivery price is very reasonable. 5
After confirming that the receipt of ONE BAG was not an error, I was able to get a partial credit. 1
A previous reviewer from August '10 noted that the description and picture states these cans are 11 ounces when in fact what you receive are 10 ounce sized cans.<br /><br />Well, it's half a year later and Amazon has still not updated this product.  I guess even Italian espresso is utilizing the underhanded business practice of lowering the quantity of the goods you receive, but not changing the price at all, similar to what so many other food companies are doing, canned tuna among them.  The coffee is still a great product, just be aware you are getting about 7% less of it for the same price.<br /><br />(UPDATE: Well, I just checked back today--last day of June 2011--and FINALLY the product size of this item has been updated. Too funny though--if you look close at the picture for it it still shows an 11 oz. can! Haha! Also, someone commented that this is not technically really "Italian Espresso" because it's not produced in Italy...well, whatever, the name is Italian so it's a valid mistake and pardon me all to hell.) 2
Work well and made solidly.  For whatever reason the Keurig takes longer to complete the brewing cycle when using these cups and the liquid bleeds through the filter on the outside of the cup making a small mess.  They do the job as intended but could use a different type of filter to make the experience less messy. 3
The first thing you notice when you open up your package is the intensely delicious smell of vanilla.  The package is vacuum sealed, but the smell still leaks out.  These beans are a great deal!  I think I got about 28-32 pods in my bag and was able to make good use of them.  They (as previously mentioned) have a wonderful smell and great flavor.  It is really hard to find a better deal out there. 5
My kids love macaroni and cheese with dinner. They even like broccoli. I thought that this would be right up our alley.<br /><br />The broccoli: The broccoli is more of a seasoning that a real part of the dinner. I know, I should have expected this. But when I poured the little, dry broccoli pieces out, I had a bad feeling. Sure enough, I ended up making some real broccoli to eat along with the cheesy skillet.<br /><br />The noodles: Nothing to really complain about here. If you follow the directions, you pretty much get what you see on the box. Only smaller. I wish they'd stuck with regular macaroni or with shells, but these weren't bad, just not great. The picture on the box really magnifies the noodles too.<br /><br />Chicken: Well, you add your own. So go for it! If you like your food all mixed up, then the cheese coated chicken will be yummy at least.<br /><br />Cheese: The high point of the meal right here! It comes creamy already, no need to mess with the powdery stuff you get in some "meal" boxes. Flavorful, cheesy, and creamy. It's just about all you can ask for in a pre-made "Mac and Cheese" box.<br /><br />Overall: I might buy it again as part of a larger meal. Definitely make your own vegetable to go along. Not horrible, not great, just a quick easy dinner if you are runny late. 3
I deserved to get a nasty product when I selected a product flavored with Wasabi and Soy Sauce.  If you really like Wasabi and Soy Sauce, buy this product.  The nuts are of a high quality. 2
I was expecting something akin to cheese-flavored rice cakes. These were much tastier! Crunchier too. However, I was also expecting each bag to be the size of a small bag of potato chips. Wrong. The bags are just a little larger than those of gummy fruit snacks. Each mini round is about the size of a nickel and there aren't all that many in a bag. I bought the Classic White Cheddar ones, which I found to be very yummy. I just wish there were more to enjoy for the price. 4
The cups were great but at least a dozen of them were melted during shipping and unusable. 3
I was very disappointed in this coffee pod. The first few that I tried broke open during the brewing process and got grounds all over. The coffee is not a very bold or strong flavored coffee. Won't purchase this item again. 2
because i enjoy this manufacturer's dried apricots and plums so much, i thought i would give the peaches a try; however, i was disappointed.  they were not all sweet, and some of them were so dry they were hard to chew. 3
It's been a month, and this still has not arrived. I ship several packages a week to my son's APO address in Afghanistan, and this is the only company that has not delivered. 3
What I received today in shipment is a joke! I have the product on the desk in front of me. I see 4 packages of Green Mountain Coffee..Breakfast Blend. The 4 packages arrived NOT in an outer box! The packages are held together with yellow strapping tape. ALL 4 packages are ripped open in one way or another. One package has the bottom ripped off almost entirely and several coffee pods are missing. This disaster of shipping  was sitting out on my front porch in 95+ heat on a very humid Texas day. Mice, giant tree cockroaches, or kitties could have been prowling around inside the boxes. I can't believe UPS even accepted such a crappy packaging attempt. PLUS...I tried to find this Mike's Grocer online. The address on the return slip is 7 Prospect ST APT #4....an APARTMENT???? How do I even know where in the heck these pods originated? I LOVE Amazon and buy almost everything from them. This is my first REALLY horrible experience. Amazon....please get rid of this retailer!!!!!! Brenda Spurlin 1
I really like to mix things up with k-cups and rarely buy 50-ct boxes of a single flavor.  Exception to the rule would be for dark, bold coffees such as French roasts, which I really enjoy.  So when Wolfgang Puck's French roast turned up on Amazon's deal of the week, even though I have never tried before, now I have 48 units.<br /><br />It's fairly non-descript for a French roast.  Decent aroma, but taste is muted compared to, for example, a Diedrich French roast.  I don't hate or even dislike it, it's 'okay', and for the price I paid, is acceptable without complaint.  It may make an acceptable guest coffee for those wanting something a little bolder without being over the top rich.<br /><br />I'd call it mildly bold, average, and I won't be going out of my way to keep it on hand. 3
These were a sore disappointment to the Nana's brand. I love the Chocolate Chip and Peanut Butter but these were way to dry and powdery. The flavor was good but the texture made my stomach turn. 1
This coffee lacks the richness I am used to in coffee beans that are french roasted. Although it doesn't make a bad cup of coffee in my book it is not frech roasted. 3
First quality, dogs like it and it does not have grain as an ingredient, therefore a reduction in ear infections due to yeast infections. 5
I found these to have a good Mozzarella taste but they still retained that distinctive cheese-it cracker taste underneath which I liked. Everyone is going to have a different opinion on them so why not get a box and see for yourself? I did notice that MSG is listed in the ingredients. I don't believe that original cheese-its have it so that is something to keep in mind. Overall a good product that I like and will purchase in the future.<br /><br />I'd also like to note that mine were shipped smart post and I wouldn't recommend picking the cheapest shipping option when ordering. By the time the cheese-its got to me I'd say that only 1/3 of the box was whole crackers. The rest were broken down into a fine crumb mess. The box didn't look badly beat up, so I don't know what the post office does but it is definitely detrimental to the cheese-its. 4
This is a perfect quick meal for those cold blustery days. If you like clam chowder like I do, then you can't go wrong with this one. It's a big can with a pull top (nice, no can opener needed) add a dab of butter and some fresh ground pepper and enjoy this thick soup with lots of goodies in it.<br /><br />I would of given it five stars but I think the price should be a litter lower. I will order again. 4
I started drinking the power slim tea when I was on the HCG diet to help curb cravings. Since I liked it so well, I tried some of the others and I am now hooked!  They are so satisfying that I drink them all the time.  The Energy gives you that extra pick-me-up in the afternoons that helps keep me going all day, no matter how long. 5
Now I know this formulation is not the most natural or high grade one on the market right now. Believe me, I have tried to get her interested in just about every brand with the word "natural" in the title, and she is not having it. She won't get the benefit of the food if she won't eat it. So when I noticed she was eating all of her food when I put this in front of her, I decided to stick with what is apparently working. This is still premium food, formulated for my twelve year-old's needs, and she really, really likes it. 'Nuff said. 5
According to the manufacturer's website, this (and many of their other products) contains menadione sodium bisulfite complex.<br /><br />Menadione is a synthetic precursor for Vitamin K and has been reported to have toxic effects. The use of menadione over the natural alternatives (such as leafy greens and kelp) is only for cost-saving reasons, hence usually only found in cheaper and lower quality animal food. It's surprising that pet food at this high of a price actually contains this substance.<br /><br />Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity. It's also banned in Europe for human consumption.<br /><br />A study in rats showed that exposure to menadione "produced lesions in the kidney, heart, liver and lung." Chiou et al. Toxicology 1997.<br /><br />Menadione's toxicity seems to be due to its ability to induce oxidative stress in cells.<br /><br />Do an online search for menadione and you'll find more info from a pet food watchdog trying to stop the inclusion of this substance.<br /><br />In light of recent episodes of toxic pet food and the questionable behaviors of manufacturers and our regulatory agencies, I would advise you to avoid feeding this to your cats. 1
This is the better coffee I have found in a K Cup. Deep, rich, smooth flavor. No bitterness. Worth the few extra cents per cup. 5
I normally like glutino but their honey nut flavor is so boring and the texture is wierd. Apple cinnamon flavor is significantly better so if you are buying one of the two definately go with the apple cinnamon. However, the best gluten free cheerio is PerkyO's Frosted Cheerio. Amazon......WHY is it not for sale on your site??? PerkyO's is excellent in size of the "O" as well as taste. In my opinion the frosted PerkyO is better, more flavorful than the original brand but amazon needs to sell both. Especially for the young toddler that needs just the right size for their little fingers, the original is a good choice for them as well as for those of you who don't like sugar much. 2
To make this simple the tea is perfect!  It's the same refreshing taste I'm used to during my stays in Japan.<br />My previous delivery arrived in near impeccable condition with only one bottle slightly dented.  I have never had problems with products shipped directly from amazon, with the exception of the one I have just received.<br /><br />The wrapping on the bottles was very dirty and deteriorated.  Most bottles remained intact but a couple were dented badly and on the verge of bursting.  The cardboard packaging has obviously been exposed to a lot of moisture and other elements.  I'm not sure what happened.<br /><br />Unfortunately Amazon wont allow these items to be replaced.  I gave it 4 stars because of the tea and at least they are still drinkable.  I might consider canceling my subscription if they arrive like this again.<br /><br />Great product and true to the Japanese original. Just may not arrive 'AS' great. 4
This stuff really works, makes lemons taste sweet.  Gave to a friend, she loved it and ordered 3 to give to her friends.  Great party idea, try mberry with all sorts of foods, will change their flavor, fun to experiment. 5
My dog likes the Canidae, and he's very fussy.  The fish product is a little, well, fishy, but the other varieties are solid. 4
These bars are huge, with good texture and very filling. The taste is mediocre (a bit fake). Overall, they'd be fine if it weren't for all the sugar alcohols.... all ELEVEN grams of them. That much maltitol tends to mess with digestion. I'd go with a different bar, if it's going to be a regular in your diet. 2
Chocolate, marshmallow, graham crackers.. there's nothing really more nostalgic than a combination of those three ingredients (s'mores anyone?) bringing back so many young memories. The true beauty of the combination is its simplicity and that it spans so many different countries and cultures.<br /><br />I actually grew up more with moon pies (or choco pies as it is called in Asia) that more closely resembles a s'more by having two graham crackers sandwiching instead of the mallomars single cracker on the bottom. The thing I really like about this version is that it is smaller and much easier to have a small snack or nibble as opposed to the larger alternatives. Sinking my teeth into the fluff first made me enjoy and taste the marshmallow sweetness first which I've come to realize I prefer.<br /><br />The only problem I had was that my package (of 18 cookies) came smushed in the mail so many of my cookies had their layers separated letting me not enjoy the full experience as intended. 4
I was reminded of my mother's cat when I read the comments about vomiting. Mom's cat gulps the Whiskas Temptations WHOLE and resembles a Kirby vaccuum! If you inhaled your food, you would vomit too! With my kitties, it is an entirely different story - they love them, they chew them, they purr. These are not a dietary supplement, they are a TREAT. I even managed to train my eldest kitty to "shake hands" using Temptations. I will definately buy them, again and again. 5
Since there seem to be no more Sunmaid Honey Bran Muffin mixes out there, I bought this brand but it doesn't compare. I won't purchase again. 2
The Banana Bread was quite delicious. It even tasted great when you warmed it for 30 seconds in the microwave. I thought it was going to be dry and bland. But it was the quite opposite. 4
I'm sitting down to a fresh cup of this coffee on a Saturday morning, with a day of good work ahead of me ... drinking it straight-up, nothing added ... I have to say, it's pretty rich and flavorful. I am the kind of coffee drinker who doesn't have a "pot a day" or anything like that (and some days I don't have any coffee at all), but I can be considered a "Starbucks snob." I don't really like the plain cheapie supermarket coffee, and I can't bring myself to choke down instant. I like flavorful coffee. And this Puroast Dark Roast definitely has a lot of flavor. I cannot tell that it's low-acid. The typical coffee bitterness (I tend to like it strong) is nice here. Good stuff. 4
I loved the way it absorbed & soaked up the cat urine, leaving a piney scent. but the cats loathed both the smell of pine & the hard goatfood-pellate shape on their dainty feet. Perhaps if they would grind it into something finer. Some of the pieces even get lodged between their little toes.<br /><br />The other problem is the tiny amount you get & how much it costs. I have a lot of kittens & a lot of litter boxes to clean several times a day. 3
Most Americans have little experience with canned coffee products, but I lived in Japan for over two decades and cold canned coffee pre-dates the Starbucks we see in the refrigerator sections in the U.S. Canned coffee that is not liberally diluted with milk is often an acquired taste, especially for those who are used to something less intense or only hot coffee.Canned coffee can be ruined by the passage of time or too much acidity. Illy issimo seems to have combated possible unpleasant flavors that might emerge by adding a fair amount of sugar. This is a fairly sweet espresso, though it's not cloying. It's pretty robust and has a pretty strong coffee aftertaste which reminds me of robusta blends rather than arabica (which tend to be mellower).<br /><br />It's hard to recommend food items to others because tastes are very individualized, but I did enjoy this and feel it is better than average for a cold canned coffee. It's not going to beat a freshly made espresso, but then it's not supposed to rival the real deal. If I were in a hurry and wanted an espresso jolt, especially in the summer, I'd buy this. 4
I love the 100 calorie packs. They limit my intake so I don't eat a huge bag. Bring them to lunch with me to get a good amount of protein. I like how they are smaller bite size pieces of jerky. It makes it easier to eat and not so gamey. They are delicious too! A little pricey though. 5
I bought this for $45,000 or thereabouts.  It was definitely delicious, but after finishing it in 15 minutes I wanted a little more bang for my buck.  $20K would have been a better price point. 4
This cat food was not appealing in texture or smell to my cats.Ended up giving it to our outdoor cats! would not recommend 2
Update: This coconut milk is shipping out from Thailand again and you can definitely tell the difference. We have been ordering this brand again for the last few months and have not received any of the low quality Sri Lanka product. I definitely recommend this coconut milk as long as it continues to come from Thailand.<br /><br />Original Review:  The first time we ordered this Coconut Milk it was delicious and thick as expected. We went through it quickly and ordered a second case. I was just about ready to set this up for subscribe and save, but after tasting the most recent batch I was glad I waited. As others have mentioned, they are currently sending out cans that were processed in Sri Lanka. I do not know if they are processing it differently or if the coconuts are just regionally different, but it is a big difference in flavor. Our coconut ice cream is coming out less creamy and more like blocks of ice and it requires a lot of extra peppermint extract to get the flavor right with the Sri Lanka Product. I will be ordering another brand until this is resolved. 4
It's an Assam-blend but it tastes more like traditional black and orange pekot tea than the Assam tea I can get in India. That said, it's still very good black tea and a great value. 3
Nice selection of flavors.<br /><br />blue - tastes like blue!<br />green with yellow center - sour apple<br />orange with white center - orange cream<br />white with black stripes - anise/licorice and it tastes good too!<br />white with red stripes - peppermint<br />red with red stripes - cinnamon<br />brown, white - chocolate vanilla<br />yellow, pink - strawberry banana<br />peach - peach (wow)<br />brown, white, pink - Neapolitan<br /><br />Six packs will last a long time. 4
Yo soy corredora, y he probado muchos tipos de productos, este es el que mejor resultado me ha dado. 5
Maybe I shouldn't be surprised, but there is no actual coconut in this candy. Wish I'd read the ingredients label before buying. Guess I fell prey to their packaging :) 2
A total nightmare. If you are going to make this, use crazy glue or a support system for the walls and roof. They keep sliding out of place. Some of my pieces came broken, and it tasted horrible. Dont waste your money. 1
This carbonated juice drink tastes pretty artificial, although they claim that it's made mostly of juice. This is really more like a Black Cherry soda. It's got a pleasant taste just nothing that will blow you away. It's a bit expensive for such a small can and not a fresh enough idea to really get anyone to Switch from their current drinking habits. 3
but I will never order a 16 pound bag of dog food with those shipping costs tagged on again.  I somehow thought I was going to save something.  Aside from having to wait 10 days for something I could have gone to PetSmart down the street for...oh, well you live and learn. 3
I was optimistic about this, but neither the people nor the dogs would eat this cereal.  We threw out all 6 boxes. 1
I find this particular brand as good as the local coffee shop coffee (D.D.) which is a compliment to the maker. I have made this particular brand my #1 choice. 5
I'm a huge peanut butter fan and tried pretty much every peanut butter by every brand and I honestly think this is the worse peanut butter I had ever tried. It tastes terrible and is kind of rubbery. This is my least favorite brand of peanut butter. 1
The beans are great, the parcel arrived on time, but many of the cans were badly dented due to poor packing. 2
The cookies taste great; however, they have no nutritional information anywhere on the package. In fact, the cookies are only wrapped in thin, clear plastic sleeves. There was no individual packaging at all, just 24 thin plastic sleeves inside of one plain cardboard box with no additional packaging or labeling. I didn't know it was legal to send manufactured food products without nutritional information. 3
I tend to get upset stomach/nausea in the evennings. This NEVER fails to make me feel better. I love it. They don't sell it at stores in my area anymore, so I was fine with buying a case of it! 5
The double Earl Grey is a pretty strong tea. It is as strong as going loose leaf, but the quality of the better loose leafs is better than this tea. It is great for convenience. If you don't care about convenience, consider Rishi's organic, Twinings Aromatic (not regular E.G.), or if you can find it, Whittard of Chelsea. 4
You have to love ginger to like this product. It's not a ginger-flavored drink, it's a ginger drink.<br /><br />I admit, i only like ginger, i don't love it. I found the flavor to be too strong, and too bitter. I had to add a fair amount of sugar to make it drinkable. Never once did i notice any lemon flavor.<br /><br />As with most drinks, it's going to be up to each individual to decide if they like it. Ginger-philes will probably love it, ginger-haters should stay well clear, and people somewhere in between might like it with a bit of honey or sugar. 3
This is for the Health Valley Tomato Soup No Salt Added, 15 Ounce Cans (Pack of 12).  I purchased this specifically for a person with heart problems.  One of the problems with canned foods is too much sodium, so the No Salt Added is a good feature.  Another problem is cholesterol content.  The ad for this product states 0 mg cholesterol, which is a false statement.  Apparently the supplier did not update the ad when Health Valley changed their recipe for their No Salt Tomato soup and is now adding cholesterol.  The cans I received have a "NEW" on the label, which the can shown in the ad does not.  This is an honest mistake on the seller's part, but he should correct it, and he should list the true contents. 1
We bought both brands to try and found this one with much less chocolate taste then Cafe Escapes dark chocolate.  It was also thinner in consistency. Won't buy again 2
Very tasty, I used it for years, they recently added more red peppers and that's makes it more spicy that I prefer, but it still very good. 5
This is like a junk food for doggies. My dog loved this, he scarfed it up and didn't leave behind a single crumb. I'd rather use this as treats than his actual daily food. Which is what I am doing with the remainder of the bag.<br /><br />Even though I am sure this dry food smells and tastes great to my dog, that is where my satisfaction ends. The ingredients aren't of high quality. It has artificial coloring, isn't a natural dog food and I think I am going to go back to Natural Balance.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this if you're looking for a lean, high quality dog food! 3
I love pumpkin, my dogs love pumpkin.  I quite often roast my own, but I need back up cans now and again.  Libby's has disappeared from stores.  This stuff is the only brand ANY store is selling.  It tastes like dirt.  It really does.  There is no fresh pumpkiny flavor.  It is also watery, which changes how pie and cake recipes turn up.  Finally, I gotta wonder-if LIBBY'S pumpkin harvest dried up, where are these guys getting theirs from? A mystery 1
This jar of baby food has 7 GRAMS of FAT and 110 calories - thats triple the fat and double the calories of most baby food!  I highly recommend for babies needing to put on some lbs - as well as picky eaters.  I have to offer my son a variety of 7-8 foods each meal (cheese, avacado, chunks of meat...etc) b/c he turns up his nose at so much (and I can't just say 'well too bad' b/c he desperately needs the calories!) But this is one of the foods he rarely turns down.  I highly recommend. 5
This product is good, and better than expected. When following the directions, it comes out thick, not like a soup. The seasoning reminds me of seasonings used in falafel mixes. I liked that it was reduced sodium, and didn't think it needed more salt. More or different spices would be good though. I didn't think it was amazing, so I rated it 4 stars. I would purchase again. 4
This Bisquick Gluten Free mix is amazing.  I haven't had a biscuit or banana bread in over a year and now I just can't stop making things.<br />I just made Banana Bread (for the 3rd time with this mix) and my family loves it.  I use it for everything, I am so pleased.  I made a cherry pie, Cheddar Biscuits.  I've been<br />using my old Bisquick recipes from ages ago and it is working fine.  I am so thankful for Amazon and their items.  I sure keep the UPS guy<br />busy. 5
This food might have great contents, but my 7 1/2 lb, 11/2 yr old poodle doesn't like the taste. She's not a picky eater. 1
Great alternative to fettuccine if you have gluten problems. Sauce is a big helper for taste and don't boil them to long. They will clump. Overall I am very happy with them. 4
This powdered peanut butter is quite tasty, either on its own or mixed with water as instructed. The problem is, it is about twice as expensive as normal peanut butter wherever you try and find it. I didn't like the price on Amazon, and Bell Plantation's website charges over $11 to ship their 4 pack, which makes the price of each bottle about $7. $7 is also about the price I've seen in specialty stores as well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, while it is a healthy, tasty substitute for real peanut butter, I'll be sticking to the real thing due to the price. Plus, nut fats are good for you as long as they're consumed in moderation. 4
Co-workers introduced me to instant Ginger tea. I've purchased a few different brands locally. I prefer the instant in this case because tea-bag varieties I've tried tend to lack flavor and be quite tame. I like my ginger with a kick to it!<br /><br />Gold Kili's Ginger-Lemon drink has that kick, though it isn't the strongest I've tasted. That honor goes to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0035UI0H2">Instant Crystal Honey Ginger Tea</a>.  The Gold Kili brand drink is almost as strong, yet its sweetness has a slightly artificial flavor. Not totally off-putting, but noticeable. The lemon flavor is there too, but very subdued. I prefer the honey taste of the other brand.<br /><br />The Gold Kili instant ginger drink can handle more than 6-8 oz. of liquid without tasting watered down, and I recommend 10-12 for most folks.  I can see it mixing well in various cocktails as well. Medicinal effects of ginger are well documented, though I don't know how effective they are in this formulation. Just be mindful that this is an instant beverage and not the same as one made with fresh ingredients. You get it for the convenience.<br /><br />3.5 stars for a tasty ginger drink.<br /><br />~ Kort 4
What can i say, I love iced tea. I drink a lot of it, and love the convenience of these new individual serving size packets. I am also a big fan of Stash products, or rather of all the other stash products I have tried.<br />I purchased a case of all 4 varieties,  (when i say i drink iced tea, i am not kidding) and these were all way too weak when i mixed them in my 16 ounces water bottle.<br />I finally found that i needed to dissolve 2 packets in a small bit of hot water first (if not the tea clumped on me), and than add a packet of sweetener before adding the rest of the water just to make these palatable.<br />unfortunately by doing that to this flavor, the ginger was out of control, and not in a good ginger tea sort of way.<br />Over all I am very dissatisfied with the product and will stick with the other brands that are out on the market. 2
These drinks are pretty good.  Nice to have something different to drink rather than the usual soft drinks filled with sugar and syrup.  This one is also more refreshing than soft drinks, and a little more interesting than just regular fruit juices.<br /><br />Everyone's tastes are different, but in my opinion they are surely at least worth a try! 4
Good price on these and they seem to be of good quality.  I can only give it 4 stars since there is some debris in each bag that has to be filtered out before use. 4
This USED to be my favorite breakfast, but now that they've fallen in line with the Nanny State of The Union and forcibly are choosing our lifestyle and food ingredients, this product is crapola, plain and simple. It used to be wonderful but now is not fit to feed my cat. ( I tried but she wouldn't eat it, either ) Worst stuff I ever tasted when it comes to oatmeal. And what is that horrible biting bitter flavor they substituted for brown sugar or real maple flavoring? Smells and tastes like something left in a cranky baby's diaper. Quaker has lost another customer. 1
Upon first glance, one would think this is your regular energy drink. The size of the product does seem to convey this. At 8.3 oz, this is something a lot of people could finish in one or two gulps.<br /><br />The flavor is nice and tasty. You can taste both the berry and kiwi.  No funny aftertaste and it goes down easily.  It is not tart nor is it too sweet. The carbonation isn't too overpowering. It's not as strong as a soda but it's not on it's last fizzy breath either.  I could see the bubbles disappearing faster than soda after sitting out for a while.<br /><br />All in all, I'd say this is a nice alternative to your average soda/juice box.  It'd be perfect for kids to drink in school.  My only suggestion is to make the can a little bigger as there's just not enough juice to completely quench your thirst for the price that you are paying. 4
She ate this but not very quickly.  Then she proceeded to stink up whatever room she was in for about the next 8 hours.<br /><br />Looks like others are having digestive issues.  Nothing life threatening here, just flatulence.  She didn't care...we did. 2
Mrs. May's pumpkin crunch is a great snack. For those of you watching calories and intake, be aware that the 2oz portions are two servings. Most of Mrs. May's products are great, but with the fat at 11g per serving, i find it's not a complete guilt free snack. However, the pumpkin seed crunch has 9gms of protein per serving vs. the usual 4gms in their other snacks. So if you're monitoring your intake and want to indulge in these now and then, the pumpkin seed crunch is the healthiest option of the bunch.<br /><br />That said, they are all tasty and certainly not bad for you, just a little high in fat if you're watching your weight. 5
I used this kind of hops in my batch of homemade Blueberry Wheat Beer. They worked great! Only thing the shipping was over priced for such a little pack of hops pellets. You should consider looking for cheaper shipping before placing your order. 3
I have used Lavender Essential Oil for years and loved the idea that these were food grade.  I ordered 7 different oils about a month ago - at the time of this purchase - but have only received 5.<br /><br />First the oils: They are mostly comparable to other brands but seem a thinner and do not seem to last as long as others - I expect that is due to the food grade. The bottles do not come with droppers - this makes it difficult to use as everything with essential oils is based on drops.  Depending on how often I actually use in food - I may or may not purchase this brand of lavender again.  The price is good but if I have to buy my own dropper tops it outweighs the better price.<br /><br />The company - faerie's finest - I was okay with the delay I was informed of on two of the oils in this purchase; however, when I recently emailed them to find out when those two oils would arrive I was informed that they were supposedly mailed before the date I was told there would be a delay.  When the issue is resolved - I will update this review.  In the interim, I will not recommend the seller nor will I buy from them again.  Which is unfortunate as they have nice selection of essential oils. 2
We have the pickiest dog on earth.  It took us 3 years to find a food that he would eat a full bowl of on a consistent basis!  When this came and we filled his bowl with it the first time, I fully expected him to possibly take a couple of bites then refuse to eat any more.  I was shocked when he ate the entire bowl then went to his food container, basicly asking for more.  I gave him another cup of the food, he ate most of that before he laid down again.  I was thrilled to find another food that he liked!<br />After 3 or 4 days of him eating this food, he started having REALLY bad gas.  Imagine a 100 lb dog with bad gas laying next to where you are sitting on the couch!  Nevermind, you don't want to imagine that but you get my point.  After 4 days of dealing with the gas from hell we put him back on his old food.  Viola, gas was gone!  Thank God!  I don't know if that's a common reaction to the food but it certainly didn't agree with our dog's tummy.  Good news is that the outside cats like it and if they have gas, too, I don't have to deal with it.  ;-) 3
I usually try to see the good side of things so I'll start with  - my dog liked the taste.  She is an older dog and it takes a lot to get her excited, this did.  As for me, it's messy, and kind of icky when you think about the dog's saliva being put into the bottle every time you roll the ball top.  The top is a roller ball that is very difficult to turn.  You get your fingers sticky with this strong smelling liquid, and it has to be done repeatedly. You can run it along the counter to turn it, also a bad idea. The dog just gets a taste from the ball, then wants to EAT the bottle which, according to the warning label, is a no no.  No eating the roller ball or the bottle!  If they were to get hold of the ball it could choke the dog.  Bad design if you ask me.  OF COURSE the dog is going to want to bite the bottle if it tastes like bacon juice.<br />  I gave her a couple licks and decided to throw the rest away.  Sorry puppy. 2
Definitely not my favorite.  I love KIND bars, but this variety has a strange after taste.  Would not recommend. 2
I love everything else from this company but these taste horrible- dry, fishy, bitter. I can't taste any cheese flavor. My daughter won't touch them. 2
I purchased this synthetic cat litter from Target for several weeks, thinking that the odor control was very good and that it was more convenient to scoop less frequently.  For the first few weeks, I loved it and continued purchasing.  We keep the litter box in an small unused bathroom in our basement.  This fall, my inlaws came to visit and would be staying in the basement on an extra bed.  In preperation, I cleaned the bathroom and was horrified to discover a thick layer of blue dust all over the bathroom.  It clearly showed on the white paper towels!.  It was everywhere.  On the walls, ceiling, floor, behind the door, etc, and it was thick.  For a synthetic product, the amount of dust was unbelievable.  I cannot recommend this product.  I have returned to traditional litter, and am disgusted thinking about the amount of blue dust that has probably been circulating our house.  We've never had a dust problem with litter before and clean the bath room ever few weeks.  I could not believe the amount of dust on the ceiling! Simply unacceptable.  There is no excuse for a sythetic product that is supposed to be absorbant to spew blue particles into the air, our lungs, and the environment I live in.  Avoid. 1
Truvia seems to be a version of sugar-free that is healthier than most.  However--it is WAY cheaper ($3.34 for the 40ct. bx) at Wal-Mart...  time for Amazon to catch up--they are usually my go-to for cheaper healthy foods but not today. 3
My kitty loves tuna and dry cat food.  I've never tried to give her soft food until this.  She didn't eat it until it was in her dish for most of the day when she had eaten her regular dry food.<br />It looks like it would be good.  It looks like pieces of fish, but for some reason this didn't excite her as much as tuna.<br />I'm getting a new kitty soon, and I'll update it when I try to give new kitty this food.<br />Edit: New kitty likes it fine.  This isn't her favorite choice.  She likes tuna, chicken, and beef all better than this.  Unlike the other cat, she likes this more than dry food - about as much as she likes the Iams wet food I also feed her. 3
None of the asian super markets around me sell the old style anymore. I am so damn sad. This new bowl it comes in doesn't hold back the heat and is very hot to touch. The flavor is so damn bad. Bring back the old regular hot and spicy picante please... PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEE. 1
My daughter (7yo) wanted a little tree for her room.  We thought this one had the best combination of hardiness, size, smile appeal, and ease of care.  We were a little concerned based on past reviews about how healthy the plant would be when it arrived.  I'm happy to say, the tree was/is healthy, packed well, and exactly as described.  My daughter named it "Lucky".  Seems like a good value. 4
This product did not include the "shaking bag". In addition, the package says that it will cover 6 pork chops. I was only able to coat 4 thin chops. The chops were done in 15 minutes as promised BUT they were not flavorful at all. Dry coating without much seasoning. I recall having shake n bake in youth and it was much more tasty. I so wanted to love this nostalgic food, but it just was not good at all. ): 1
I really wanted to give this coffee 1.5 stars, but Amazon does not allow half stars.  This is a fairly light brew with a sickly chemical vanilla flavor.  When we are paying nearly $.60 per cup, you would think that these companies would actually put out a decent product.  I can be pretty picky when it comes to food, but I am far from a coffee snob.  If you want a decent cup of french vanilla coffee, don't order this product. 2
Go to any grocery store, gas station or nutrition shop, and you will no doubt be overwhelmed with the panoply of energy drinks on the shelves. There is clearly money to be made here, so every company under the sun has their own brand, replete with flashy packaging and a mad-scientist assortment of ingredients. No Fear Super Energy Supplement drink is just such a drink. The cool black can with the menacing skull and bold lettering are alluring, likely to attract many. Tread cautiously, dear energy drink consumers.<br /><br />The aforementioned flashy labeling atop the can highlights ingredients such as Taurine, Arginine and L-Carnitine, which are all great components of a good energy drink, but the quantity included in this beverage are so minimal that their impact is likely negligible. And caffeine? 85mg per serving. Slightly higher than a cup of green tea. Basically, every ingredient falls far short of being able to have any real impact -- other than the sugar. But, I'll let the nutritional panel speak for itself:<br /><br />Serving Size: 8 fl oz (240ml)<br />Servings Per Container: 2<br /><br />Amount Per Serving:<br />Calories: 130<br />Total Carb.: 34g (11%)<br />Sugars: 33g<br />Vitamin C: 60mg (100%)<br />Vitamin B6: 2mg (100%)<br />Folic Acid: 40mcg (10%)<br />Vitamin B12: 6mcg (100%)<br />Zinc: 1.5mcg (10%)<br />Selenium: 7mcg (10%)<br />Sodium: 100mg (4%)<br />Potassium: 20mg (1%)<br /><br />Proprietary Blend: 1.35g<br />Taurine: 1000mg<br />Innositol: 100mg<br />Caffeine: 87mg<br />Panex ginseng Root Extract: 50mg<br />Guarana (Paullinia Cupana) Seed Extract: 25mg<br />Grape Seed Extract: 25mg<br />L-Carnitine: 25mg<br />L-Arginine: 10mg<br /><br />Ingredients: Carbonated Water, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Citric Acid, Taurine, Grape Juice Concentrate (Color), Sodium Citrate, Natural Flavor (Contains Soy), Inositol, Ascorbic Acid, Caffeine, Caramel Color, Fruit Juice Concentrate (Color), Monopotassium Phosphate, Grape Seed Extract, L-Carnitine, L-Arginine Hydrochloride, Zinc Methionine Sulfate, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Guarana (Paullina Cupana) Seed Extractive, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Potassium Sorbate, Selenium Complex with Amino Acids and Polypeptides, Folic Acid, Cyanocobalamin.<br /><br />Well, if that list isn't compelling enough to get you to rush out and slam a few of these, maybe the taste will! The flavor is something akin to a slightly un-ripened fruit blend, with a metallic, vitamin aftertaste. If you aren't yet drooling, then perhaps the energy rush will get your head swirling. Speaking of ... .<br /><br />For an "energy supplement," there was nary a buzz derived from this beverage. I experienced an ever-so-slight perk, likely due to the sugar content, rather than the blend of B-Vitamins, amino acids and caffeine, which was quickly followed by a large crash, again, likely due to the sugar (66g in the entire can, may I remind you!).<br /><br />Bottom line:  No Fear Super Energy drink is essentially nothing more than colored sugar (well, high fructose corn syrup, specifically) water. You're honestly better off drinking a good old 12 ounce can of Mountain Dew, which has better flavor, a bigger energy boost, lower caloric impact and cheaper cost. Fear the No Fear. 2
I've been making all kinds of soda for the last 5 years from various concentrates, with a home-made carbonation kit that consists of little more than a tank of CO2, some hoses, a filter and regulator.  I regularly get the Homebrew Root Beer and Homebrew Cola and have tried every other flavor they sell.  For starters, the Ginger Ale (and several others) keeps the essential oils in an alcohol suspension, yet is sold in a plastic bottle.  It doesn't take a chemist to figure out just how stupid that is.  Every bottle I've received has been partially collapsed, bubbled/sticky on the outside and has 'particulate matter' on the inside, due to the volume of alcohol migrating through the plastic.  Same with the Lemon flavor as well - it's been totally revolting.<br /><br />Avoid this - get the Ginger Beer instead of the Ginger Ale, use Koolaid unsweetened mixes for the fruit flavors, and really just use the Homebrew label for the Cola and RootBeer products.  Get any soda concentrate with essential oils in suspension (read: most) from a distributor that uses glass bottles.<br /><br />My Soda Rig:<br />*The Carbonator - fits to 20ounce and 2liter bottles: [....]<br />*Ball Lock Disconnect - connects the Carbonator to the CO2 tank: [....]<br />*5lb or 20lb CO2 tank (get the 20 if you don't need your rig portable) - local beer homebrew or welding store.  Make sure it's food grade.<br />*Dual Gauge CO2 Regulator: [....]<br />*3-6 feet clear tubing with 1/4inch interior diameter.  It only needs to handle 50-60 psi, so it doesn't need to be reinforced.<br /><br />Most of this stuff can be gotten cheap from various local sources or somewhere here on Amazon ([....]).  Once you put it together, you can start carbonating just about anything. 1
My 13 months old son generally liked the concept of eating by himself but not this combination of beet, berry and banana. It tastes sour probably 3
I love a really bold cup of coffee. I wish StarBuck would make pods.<br />I was disappointed with the Jet Fuel so I ordered the Bold Coffee variety pack.<br />For me the Black Tiger is better.<br />I will be ordering that one from now on. 3
I ordered this bouquet to be delivered to my daughter for opening night of a show. I specifically ordered a gerbera daisy bouquet that featured ALL daisies and no other flowers because these are my daughter's favorite flower.  The bouquet she received had ONE gerbera daisy in a bouquet of some other type of flower that resembled daisies. While she appreciated the flowers the bouquet she received was definitely NOT what I ordered.  very disappointed!!! 1
First time I tried it.  I don't like the puffed corn as well as the puffed wheat and rice.  It's similar to  Sugar Puffs without all the added sugar and is a whole grain. You probably want to try just one bag and see how well your family likes it before buying such a  large quantity. 3
These are the large bars and the box is huge as a big as a family size of cereal, but 3 times as thick! JUST WISH IT WAS STILL OFFERED AT THE ORIGINAL PRICE!!!! TOO EXPENSIVE NOW 4
I wanted to like this, Im a fan of the whole natural Ital way of eating/living, but this drink sucks allot. I am NOT a huge coffee drinker nor am I particular about my coffee. Some discribe this as pretty mild with not much of a bitter after taste...to my family it is wartered down coffee flavored old boring plain tea. It is coffee flavored water! All of that said if you like SUPER mild coffee flavored water give it a try, but its a no go here.<br />bummer... 2
Summary: Set an alarm to wake up 4.5 hours after falling asleep, take around 10mL of tincture and then go back to sleep for strongly enhanced dream recall, vividness, and possible lucid dreams, OBEs or other phenomena.<br /><br />I have been a lucid dreamer for over a year now, usually having 1-2 per week as well as remembering 2+ dreams most night, so I'm pretty in tune to noticing a change in my dreams. When this arrived I immediately noticed this tincture comes with no dosage information, so I looked around in the comments and decided to start with 1 dropper (roughly 1mL), and didn't notice any difference in the vividness of my dreams. I upped the dose to 3mL the next night, still no effect.  The next night I tried 5mL and smoked a bowl of mj before bed, and it added a nice dreamy feel to the bud and I noticed strong hypnagogic hallucinations as i was falling asleep, but there was no increase in dream recall or vividness, I assumed because of the bud. So I tried 6mL with no smoke, and there was not much difference. A little frustrated at this point i tried a tablespoon, around 15mL, and this worked. That night I had a lucid dream followed by an out of body experience and a few false awakening, much better dream recall and increased vividness. Since then I have experimented with a few different doses, and for the most part have had success by taking 7mL+ a few hours after going to sleep. 3
When we received our Keurig Elite for Christmas, we were so excited to break open the sample pack of pods to try out different blends and flavors.  Of the 12 pods we had in the box, four were Green Mountain Coffee brand.  I'd never tried anything from this company before, but from what I had researched online, they have the largest range of Keurig pods and have even bought out competitors to produce coffee under their brand names as well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was immediately disappointed by the quality of the coffee.  We tried their Dark Magic, Decaf and Breakfast Blend and all were underwhelming, to say the least.  I was almost completely set on writing off Green Mountain altogther.<br /><br />We had one GM pod left and being of the mindset of waste-not-want-not, I figured I'd give it one last go around before forgetting about them completely.  And I'm glad I did.<br /><br />The Nantucket Blend is a perfectly pleasing cup of coffee.  It is nice and flavorful without being thick and pungent (unlike some of the other GM blends we tried).  I added some flavored creamer to it and it almost measures up to our go-to Caribou Blend pods.  Almost.  All in all, this is a very standard cup of coffee which, while it isn't anything new or exciting, is very pleasing and definitely one of the better Keurig options we've been able to test out.  When we run out of all the pods we've accumulated, I'll probably pick up a box of these as well.<br /><br />Now that I know Green Mountain isn't completely disappointing I'll definitely be open to trying a few more of their coffees (with our promotion for getting the bewer we ordered <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I3Y4IE">Green Mountain Coffee Golden French Toast,  K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a> to try as well) and see how it goes from there.<br /><br />If you're looking for a go-to choice, this is your cup! 4
Bought the nacho chips regularly for my kids but the last delivery came and there was not a non-GMO label on the package anymore, they still use organic corn but use non organic canola oil and any non organic canola is most likely Genetically Modified, which is something I do not want in my body.  Will not buy this product again. 1
The coffee, when made in accordance to the directions, is bold and flavorful.  If you like your coffee to taste like coffee - this is a good blend for you.  Best left unadulturated - so no creamer or sweetener.  The second batch we made, we made it a little weaker than the directions, and thoroughly enjoyed that as well.  It is a premium coffee, and priced that way - but if you appreciate a fine cup of joe this will fit the bill. 4
I like raisins.  I eat them by the handful or in cereal or cookies.  Even with ham sometimes.  But, it seems, a raisin is a raisin is a raisin - no matter who packages them.  After all - a raisin is a dried grape.  These are good raisins but they taste no better than grocery store raisins.  Actually, I was a little disappointed.  I'd read many of the reviews here and expected something wonderful like little bursts of sunshine with each bite.  What I got was a good raisin.  Right now I am eating some while I re-read some of the glowing reviews and listen to Peggy Lee singing, "Is That All There Is?"<br /><br />The price is not great but it's not bad either.  It's Paul Newman so that's a good thing.  They're "organic" but I'm still not sure why that's important.<br /><br />Average 3
If this flavor lasted longer than it does, I'd probably die of starvation for lack of wanting to take it out of my mouth. 5
The kettle chip itself is crisp, crunchy and good, although somewhat greasy.  Over coated with the flavoring causing mouth burn when it was not expected in a chip with Rosemary flavoring.  Leaves greasy, gritty residue on fingers after two or three chips. 2
While I like the idea of these wraps, the rosemary garlic w/herb flavor was overwhelming.  We tried making a variety of wraps w/different cheese and meats, but the wrap favor was so intense, you couldn't really taste anything else. The whole family tried them and we all had the same opinion.  Now I'm stuck w/a freezer full of them and can't figure out what to do with them. 2
This stuff tastes worse that the juice from the olive jar. Oversalted, overpowering taste. To top it all off, I sliced my thumb open trying to pull the little string to get the foil off the top. It was wrapped poorly - the tab you're supposed to pull tore off. Save your $12 (including shipping) and get something else! 2
Organic foods of course are best for your health and starting your baby on foods that are pure is best no matter what. I highly recommend Earth's Best products. He loves the formula, foods and diapers. I love the products because it's best for my baby. I wish I knew about organics and Earth's best 16 years ago with my first baby. 5
Smooth, delicious, can't wait to wakeup with my coffee! I love all the Wolfgang Puck coffee flavors...never a dull flavor! 5
Yep i have been getting cases of string beans for 9 months now, and every case i get, has atleast 10 dented cans in it,, Do they know how unhealthy this is, I have cancelled my service of this, Please DO NOT feed this product to your children... Sad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 1
1 Month ago I looked up this product and it was about $23 for a case. I thought good price I will order next month.  I came back to order and the price nearly doubles!!!  What is with that?  Is there a shortage of coconuts?  Does any one know? 2
I have ordered this product on a monthly basis. I love that it comes to my home.  I have read other reviews and have read that they recieve them damaged. I have to tell you mine come in perfect order. I hope for those of you who order this product the same results. 5
I also asked By nature if their food has menadione on facebook, they told me the organic ones have menadione.  I got the reply about 2 months ago.  So does it or does it not have menadione???? 3
I make this product when we have any kind of Tex-Mex meal.  Everyone loves it.  It is easy to make and tastes great. 5
I got this as a gift and liked the flavor but I wasn't crazy about the texture.  I like fluffy pancakes and believe it or not, imo, Aunt Jemima's buttermilk ready mix is the best one out there and it's so easy to make.<br />Of course, the best tasting waffles are made by me from scratch with buttermilk and all.=)<br />Overall, I think buying gourmet pancake mix is one of the biggest waste of money.  And it still requires you to put melted butter, milk, etc.<br />I am sticking with my own recipes and Aunt Jemima's if I am in a hurry. 4
Wow, I had one yesterday and all afternoon and night I was filled with gas.  I couldn't figure out what I ate that caused this but I loved them so much that I was looking on line for a place to order a big box.  I'm so happy that I came across the reviews on Amazon, otherwise I would have ordered more boxes and had to get rid of them.<br />One thing I do know is that if your body is not used to a lot of Fiber that it can upset your stomach.  What you may want to do it gradually introduce it into your diet i.e. start with a third of one and see if that bothers you.  If it does, then its not the fiber - its something else in the bar.  This is what I'm going to try because I really like them.  Thanks for all of the reviews because I'm not sure I would have figured it out.  There is a blog on the internet about these bars complaining about the same thing.  They actually wrote to the company and received a response back that they all had a good laugh for the day!!!!  The blogger said that there is chicory root in the bars and that can cause GI problems I will have to look at the ingredient list myself then look up the chicory root.  If its not that, then its the fiber which means you have to gradually get your body used to it. 2
Having tried all of the Taco Bell bottled sauces, I have to say this is my least favorite. The chipotle flavor is very powdery, almost chalky, and the overall taste is extremely strong. You don't have to use much of it, literally 1-2 drops on a taco is all you would need, but I found it unpleasant. The other flavors are smooth and well balanced, but the chipotle flavor just doesn't cut it. The consistency of the sauce is good and it lasts a good long time in the fridge, and the 8-oz bottle goes a lot farther than you think it will. 3
It's an acquired taste, but it works.  For IBS sufferers with few other options for stomach relief I'd definately give it a try. 4
This is a new line for Friskies and is not a "treat" as the title implies. Just another can of cat food to try! My female loves this stuff, can't wait to get it in her dish, and gets quite angry whenever she gets anything else but this or the tuna variety. My male, forget it!  He loves the shredded turkey and cheese but won't go near this one.  Weirdest thing in the world to me - thought he'd go gaga over it like he does his turkey, but he just won't touch this stuff.  Anyway, this is a bit pricey here so check around for a better price.  At least in Ohio it's a bit high!  Highly recommend! 5
I enjoyed this coffee.  It had a wonderful taste, but just wasn't strong enough to be my morning coffee.  For me, it's better suited as an afternoon/evening coffee.  It's good if you don't like strong coffee, but I think I'll stick to Jet Fuel. 3
And where's the vegetable's while your at it? The last 3 or 4 cans of this that I've had has only had 5 or 6 little bits of beef in them. This last one was mostly carrots. It should have been called "Carrots in Beef Broth" Soup. It only had 6 pieces of meat and 5 or 6 little chunks of potato with about 20 pieces of carrots. I usually dump a handful of frozen sweet corn or peas in it and a handful of instant rice to help fill it out. But this time I was out of frozen veggies so I got to see just what ISN'T in the soup. Like there's more stuff missing than in it. Once I finish off the cans that I have left I sure ain't going to waist any more of my money on it.<br /><br />I scanned and uploaded the ingredients on the label from one of the smaller microwavable cans of the same Chunky Beef Soup. What I have got OUT of the can sure ain't like the picture ON the can! 2
I knew there was something wrong when I opened the outer packaging from Amazon an it contained loose coffee grounds.  I found the Breakfast Blend box to be leaking the grounds.  When I opened it I found several of the K-cups had lids that were applied off-center, thus not sealing the K-cups and the grounds were spilling out.  I have used LOTS of K-cups and have NEVER seen this before.  Poor quality control by Green Mountain with this batch.  Shame on the folks at Amazon for packaging up a box that was obviously leaking it's goods. 1
Beans were way too dry after cooking and had very little flavor. Too bad, I love the squirrel on the package :) I prefer Eden for day beans. 2
I want folks to know that this ear cleaner definitely has a distinct odor, contrary to what the other review says. However, I am buying lots more of this great stuff, as my kitties don't mind it at all and I find it to be very gentle, effective and it really is natural, with only 4 ingredients. Plus it's alcohol-free, so I have peace of mind that it is safe for my babies and not harsh in any way. And I found it for the cheapest price on Amazon - the key is to buy several bottles for lower shipping & you may as well, since it only comes in a 4 oz size! Stock up now! 4
Pork roll can be ordered directly from the company in NJ for a lot less - four boxes of preslice is the smallest you can order, a bit expensive to ship - but arrives fresh and ready to enjoy 1
My daughter loved this soup, but I was disappointed to discover that Earth's Best uses a resin liner on their canned foods that contains BPA - a toxic chemical for children.  While the company says the levels are low and within acceptale government standards, BPA is known to leech even more into acidic products like diced tomatoes, or tomato soup.  So, until Earth's Best moves to glass jars, we'll have to refrain from eating this yummy soup. 1
I haven't had a cat yet that liked this one.  It's just a little too interesting for them I think.  It smells nasty but I think it's just the taste that really gets them.  My current cat just won't touch it - he might eat a couple of bites if he's REALLY hungry, but I always wind up throwing it out.  This one is ground so if your cat likes pieces, don't try this one. 2
I use this for my twins and they love it, never had any problems. I just wish it were cheaper! 5
When I recently started using K-cups, wasn't sure that the quality or the intensity would be up to par.  I wound up trying many of the standard k-cups which for the most part were ok but not great.  The Barista Prima French Roast is well worth trying.  Very intense and flavorful. No more concerns about throwing away my old coffee pot. 5
I was really excited to find this product but was disappointed in the results.  I used it to sweeten some carbonated soda and the first sip was great.  Every sip after that had less and less root beer flavor and more and more of the artificial sweetener/alcohol taste.  So now I'm looking for another root beer extract to try! 1
Have a senseo coffee maker given to me a few years ago. For more than a year, could not find pods sold any more in local supermarkets - even at the big W. Just happened to come across them at Amazon & went on auto-ship every few months for additional savings. I have always liked the French vanilla so no problem there. Still like fresh brewed better but if you want a quick cup of coffee,these are perfect. I'm just happy that I did not jettison the coffee maker & will next look for the Sumatra pods, my other favorite. 4
I was furious when I found out the ingredients listed on the webpage are different from the product's true ingredients and it is  way different!  ASPARTAME is in this product and YUCK YUCK YUCK. I am so sorry I ordered this and even sorrier I believed the Amazon webpage. I wish they would correct this! 1
I LOOOVE IT..great coffee..cool name! You should buy it. In fact, I am drinking it right now. It is strong and bold. I have to use at least 20 words but really what else can I say? 4
I put this kit together tonight with my two young sons and we had a ball. (We paid $10 for it at Fred Meyer, which was $5 off their normal price, so beware that the cost on this site is ridiculously high). The pieces were easy to assemble and the tray that comes with the kit is handy (beats having to find some cardboard to cover with tin foil. My only complaint is the frosting because it got overly gooey before we could finish our assembly and it wasn't tough enough to hold some of the heavier candy. I kept putting it in the fridge to firm it up a little. I'd also recommend cutting the tip of the frosting at less than the 1/4" that the instructions recommend. I'd say 1/8th" would have been better. Overall, I was impressed with the finished product. It was easy to clean up the mess, there was plenty of candy and some to spare, and the kids had a blast. I bought a similar kit in the shape of a train and we look forward to putting that one together as well. 4
While I admit that the oversalted chip is addictive, I really think this one has gone too far. Skin literally peeled off my lips and inside my mouth after eating these. I am surprised that they are still on the market. 1
I got these for my gf as she isn't supposed to eat any gluten.  All of the flavors taste great and they seem to be much healthier than regular potato chips.  If you are looking for a gluten-free snack, I highly recommend Popchips! 5
great service and delivery for a really good product. i am constantly looking for a good hazelnut coffee and so far this is the best, along with green mountain... 4
I have always been a fan of Kettle chips.  When you open a bag of Kettle chips you know you are going to get quality.  These chips are no exception and live up to the name printed on the package.<br /><br />The New York Cheddar chips  have a very subtle flavor to them.  You can taste the cheddar in them; but it doesn't smack you in the face like supermarket brand chips might.  The taste lingers as well which is a definite plus!<br /><br />Another aspect about these Kettle chips is the fact every chip is nice and crisp, that crunch in your mouth.  On top of that there are no burnt chips in any of the bags I have had since the purchase.  The only negative I might have is that the flavoring of the chips is uneven.  Some chips might pack a nice cheddar punch while another might taste rather plain.  This isn't a big flaw as it happens when getting seasoned and doesn't ruin the bag at all.<br /><br />Overall the quality of the chips is fantastic.  The flavor is great and you wont' be disappointed , especially if you are a cheddar lover! 4
Trying to eat a healthy breakfast, but also don't have time? Me, too! This oatmeal is perfect - organic, quick, and delicious. 5
I just received my tea..  Thanks for getting it out so quick.. I really appreciate the extra box..  I drink this tea every night..<br /><br />Julianne 5
I have several of these converters in my home studio -- the quality is amazing on both dynamics and condenser mics!  I had an Icicle that initially had a low hum, contacted Blue, and they said that the first 500 units produced had a low hum but that has since been fixed.  They sent me a replacement unit and it works perfectly now.  BUY THIS PRODUCT if you have the need. 5
I have a picky dog with tummy troubles who has to eat a prescription diet.  She loves the Newman's treats but they are too hard for her since she is missing half her teeth.  Still, occasionally I hear a crunching sound and she is munching down a Newman's.  I was hoping she would knaw on these treats and thought the center would be a little easier to eat.  Here's how the trial went:<br /><br />Me:  opening the bag "you want a treat?"<br />Dog:  tail wagging, ears perked up and looking at me intently<br />Me:  I pull one treat from the bag and hand it to her<br />Dog:  She takes it carefully and sets it on the floor. "sniff, sniff".  She looks back up at me.  "sniff".  She walks away and lays down in her bed.<br />Me:  I pick up the treat and sniff and don't smell anything.  This doesn't mean much since I'm not a dog.  I pull on the outside "wrapping".  It's pretty tough.  I push the middle up a little.  It's hard!  I was expecting a softer middle. I taste the middle.  It's tasteless.<br /><br />I tried again to tempt her with one of these treats by giving it to her in place of our nightly "bite of cheese" ritual.  Once again she just sniffed of it and then ignored it.  The other treats I've tried with her (beggin strips, puperoni, blue bison apple/yogurt biscuits, milk bone) she will either attempt to eat or carry around in her mouth for several minutes looking for a safe place to hide it.  These treats don't even get the honor of being buried. 2
Like so many Americans I grew up eating quite a few varieties of Kellogg's cereals. The new "Crunchy Nut" cereal looked like it might be good so I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />To make a long story short, it's tasty but it isn't anything like what I expected ... and isn't like what is pictured on the box.<br /><br />First, Kellogg's probably needs to get rid of the individual who came up with the idea of calling this cereal "Crunchy Nut." Besides the fact that it's unimaginative and blandly descriptive, if you tell your friends you just ate a bowl of "Crunchy Nut" you're going to get some pretty disgusted looks in return.<br /><br />Beyond the unfortunate name, as soon as you pour a bowl of Crunchy Nut you'll notice that none of the pieces look as "nutty" the the pieces shown on the box ... not even close. The box shows pieces of the cereal covered in small chips/chunks of nuts but the actual cereal just looks like fat Cheerios with the occasional "speck" of what might be best described as "nut powder."<br /><br />Once you actually taste this cereal you'll notice that it tastes almost exactly like Corn Pops (another Kellogg's brand cereal). My wife also tried a bowl of this cereal and the first thing she said (without any coaching from me) was, "It tastes like Corn Pops." This isn't a horrible thing as long as you like the flavor of Corn Pops cereal, but if you purchase this cereal expecting a burst of "crunchy nut" flavor then you will be disappointed.<br /><br />Bottom line, this is a very tasty cereal (just like Corn Pops) but it has a horrible name, it doesn't look like the picture on the box, and it doesn't taste anything like the name suggests. 3
please be care full with this as i just complained to gerber as i found black powder inside sweetpottato tubs that i got from BJs , just a word of caution as im yet to find out what it is from gerber .upon calling gerber they said it could be charcoal from overburnt product & they are saying " as far as seal is intact its safe" hellooo plz dont tell me charcoal or rust or whatever it might be found in a tub sealed can be safe? im now going to be carefull while giving it to my baby .. so please u also be just carefull to see if no black powder is in .. if so discard it . 1
This honey is good. But I can't understand why the price is changed so frequently. One month ago I bought it at Subscribe price 34USD. This time I bought it at Subscribe price 40.83USD. But now it is 39.86USD. From the price aspect I don't recommend it. 2
The texture of these chips is terrible, it is like eating styrofaom, the taste is not bad but far from delicious. There are new much better option 1
I bought 2 pack of 3. I'm dissapointed because just 1 of 6 box was fine. I mean 2 boxes are almost broken and the other 3 were crashed. Now these boxes won't be a nice gift. However the tea has a very good taste. 2
For several months now I have been ordering this by the case on subscribe and save.  Compared to other brands, I have noticed that some cans go bad really quickly once opened.  Also, I recently received a case in which at least several of the cans had coconut oil that had separated from the milk. I know that the white and clear parts of the milk often separate, but i have never opened a can of coconut milk and had a layer of oil on top.  Very disappointed.  Was hopeful because the cans are BPA free so I would like to stick with this company, but how can I justify the expense? We have just thrown away so many cans of it because we weren't sure it was good. 2
As of this review, I've also tried Taste of Thai, Thai Kitchen and Thai Pavilion versions. For a Dr. McDougal product, the amount of sodium is inexcusable. Taste of Thai was the lowest in sodium (and best tasting of all, by far) clocking in at just 320 mg. Next in the sodium ladder is Thai Kitchen at 650 mg., then Thai Pavilion at 810 mg. The Dr. McDougal version, which the label says has 480 mg. is for a very small serving size, less than half a serving compared to all the others. So, multiply the McDougal version by 2 to get the real comparative sodium and you're at 960 mg. Like I said, inexcusable and from supposedly a "healthy" product. All I can say is watch your blood pressure folks. 2
Still not received more than a month after ordering product. Request for information taking forever too. Not sure if it will be rectified. 1
My dogs love Newman's the Chicken and the Peanut Butter treats, but didn't care for these treats.  They are about 1.5 inch square and very difficult to break in two.  I felt they were too big and solid to give to the dogs.  After several attempts to entice them with the treats and no happy response, I tossed them.  I will stick to the other Newman's treats. 3
Supposedly increases milk production? Yeah, I didn't see a difference after drinking this for a good 3+ weeks. Aside from that, it doesn't smell or taste very good. Very herbal medicine-like. 2
Olive oil in large bold print on the front of the bag is misleading!!  Olive oil is NOT the main oil the chips are cooked in.  The product has more sunflower, corn and canola oils than it does olive oil!! The ingredients are NOT listed in the description.  I should have known better.<br />There are other, much better "Olive Oil" potato chips on the market that use ONLY olive oil. I was quite disappointed in this brand. 3
This tuna has a very strong fishy taste. I was also disapointed that there is 100mg of sodium but it says "no salt added". 2
At one time this was my favorite guilty pleasure. Sadly, there's nothing left to enjoy in these dry, flavorless packing peanuts. 1
This same pack of dried apple rings in a TJ store, is like $2.99...what is with the ridiculous mark up on Amazon? 1
Description says PDQ tray of 6... It is not. Only one package and priced three times a much as in the store. I will take the time today to send it back and reclaim my $8. 1
Just finishing off a bowl (3 packets) of Quaker Instant Oatmeal Maple Brown Sugar. Its very quick to make, either using fat free milk or water and then microwaving it. Prep time is about 3 minutes. The taste is very good. It's very sweet-about as sweet as the sweetest breakfast cereal. It has a strong maple flavor.<br /><br />I would not go so far as to call this a "wholesome" breakfast. A cereal bowl serving-an adult serving that is (3 packets), has about 33% (260mg) of your entire daily sodium intake and a ton of sugar. The sodium upper limit for persons under 51 years of age is 2500 mg per day and for those over 51 or have heart disease the upper limit is only 1500mg. That means that this product isn't quite the 'heart healthy' food Pepsico (Yes) claims it to be. None-the-less, it is a fairly good alternative to many of the breakfast cereals available and probably healthier than a bacon and eggs breakfast. It is however, no substitute for homemade oatmeal in flavor or sodium/sugar content. 3
I'm an avid K cup user - coffee, tea, cocoa - and have my favorites and not-so-favorites, but dang... This one started off tasting okay, but actually gave me indigestion (burp!). There's a disturbing metallic, cloyingly sweet aftertaste in my mouth too. Your mileage may vary, but this is one K cup flavor I won't be revisiting. 2
These classic fries have no flavor at all.  They are crisp but they are like crisp air.  I am sorry I am stuck with so many of them.  I don't even want to give them to my friends, they just aren't good at all. 2
I found this tea by accident but it worked so well that i later ordered it,<br /><br />after not being able to find it again.  It really helps open nasal passages.<br /><br />Since starting to use it whenever I have bad nasal congestion, I have not<br /><br />had a sinus infection.  Everyone is different, but it sure worked for me. 5
These are our absolute favorite almonds and love that there isn't any fake sugars in them.  I'll take more calories with real sweeteners any day over sucralose in the other brands. And this flavor is DELICIOUS.  YUM! 5
Cobblestone Kitchen's Irish Creme Hot Cocoa mix has got to be the most luxurious tasting cocoa on the market.  We originally bought this cocoa to use as a base for Frappuccinnos but quickly decided it was way to good to waste in a mix.  The flavor is rich and smooth.  We have made it a part of our winding down for bed time procedure - a couple of cups together and just relax.<br /><br />Cobblestone Kitchen refers to the cocoas as "Delicious and Decadent"  and they are being extremely modest. 5
My son would rather have no cookie than one of these cookies. The taste is okay. The texture is hard and weird even when microwaved. Short shelf life if you are buying in bulk. Not absolutely terrible but worse than average. Try Pamela's chocolate chip cookies they are wonderful, or try a baking mix. 2
I got this after a mention in the NY Times and immediately became an addict.  It's a little hot but not too much, and it has an amazing depth of flavor -- a lot more than the plain version.  I use it in chicken salad to cut back on the amount of mayo, to add flavor to blah soups and as a substitute for a lot of the oil in salad dressings.  A little bit over steamed veggies and added to yogurt over baked potatoes (instead of sour cream) is also great. 5
Nice alternative if you can't find them locally.  Great gift for the avid cook. 5
My husband has gluten sensitivity, so we've tried several gluten-free pastas.  This one does not hold together, even with the minimum cook time, and it turns into smaller bits, making my pot of spaghetti runny and not noodly enough.  I won't buy it again. 2
I purchased these in lieu of the V8 Fusions since they sell for $2.08 per can on Amazon Marketplace (approx double the price Safeway sells them for).  First of all, they only contain 10% juice and the first ingredient after water is High Fructose Corn Syrup.  They essentially sold me Soda with a V8 label on it!  If I wanted to buy pop, I'd get a 24 pack for $8 not $30! Honestly, if you want juice, go to your local grocery store.  These are terrible for you, over priced and they taste horrible.  I would've sent them back but I figured I'd give it a try.  Now im out $30.  This left a bad taste in my mouth in more ways than one.  Oh!  I should also mention that these did not arrive in a 'weather-resistant tote' but rather were delivered to me in the original packaging.  The plastic was loose and a can fell out when I carried it in.  Not using Amazon marketplace again! 1
A recipe in Cooking Light recommended that Potato Starch be added to cupcakes, cakes, etc. when you reduce the amount of butter.  It worked well and I would recommend this company.  They had a fast ship and well packaged. 5
I drink my coffee black,so quality is a must! This is an excellent medium roast with a smooth consistency and perfect amount of kick. I love all the Wolfgan Puck coffee k-cups, but this is absolutely my favorite! 5
You can't beat the price and taste of this coffee. It will always be my first choice to buy. My husband brought it home one day because he liked the price and thought the the can looked neat. Little did we know it would become our new favorite. 5
I guess it might taste okay and I do wish I had heeded earlier reviews because they warned that the product could arrive broken in an olive oil soaked box.  It was true for me last month as well as it was over a year ago.  Didn't anyone get the message? 1
I am a complete novice about ginger tea and ginger beer (didn't even know there were such things until I read a review of this product).  I was most surprised when first drinking this beverage mix, added to hot water, at the strength of the flavor and the bite it leaves on the tongue.  There is nothing tepid about it.  However, if the drink is too strong for your taste, it can be weakened, but still taste good, by putting it on ice.<br /><br />The flavor of the honey and lemon is easily distinguishable.  So you have to be a lover of ginger in liquid form to really appreciate this instant drink.  I like the fact there are no bags, it's easy to prepare.  You just pour.<br /><br />It's really up to one's individual taste as to whether or not this drink will be appealing.  As for myself, I think I might drink it as a remedy for indigestion (rather than over-the-counter pharmacy remedies); however, for pleasure, I would choose something else. 4
This is clearly the best canned clam chowder I have tasted. It is refreshing to have a canned soup without all the unnecessary preservatives and artificial flavoring. The can is supposed to be "Condensed", but if you like a hearty thick soup, it is better just heated without adding milk or water. The clams are perfect, and not over cooked. I will order again, and look forward to trying out some of the other products they have on Amazon. 5
I received the tea and my first impression was somebody has been tampering with the product. The tea boxes were in super bad shape. I am almost afraid to open because of the packaging. I don't think I will purchase from Amazon again. 3
I have recently joined Jenny Craig as  I need to lose some weight, and these 100 Calorie Pack cookies are the greatest thing for snacks.  I appreciate the opportunity to get them from you so reasonably. I have agreed to take a shipment each month. 5
My dog was only somewhat interested in eating this.<br />I like to give him a wet treat every now and then- for some reason he wasn't so excited about this . - 3
For those of us on the West Coast Carl's Jr serves King Syrup in their syrup packets for French Toast. 5
The vanilla coffee taste is pretty good and mild, as I expected. But I bought it for a discount from the Amazon Warehouse (otherwise K-Cups are a little expensive). When Amazon does this, it usually means they are trying to get rid of this stock quickly.<br /><br />As I expected, the expiration date is for a month or two from now, so they were trying to get rid of them. I also noticed the seals didn't seem as tight as they normally are. This also could be because it was sitting in Amazon's warehouse in the heat all summer.<br /><br />As I expected, about half of these K-cups burst open while brewing. (This is not usual, and I've tried many different brands.) This made them leak (so clean-up was kind of annoying) and not taste as fresh, but it still tasted decent. Bottom line: When K-cups are discounted from Amazon Warehouse, be ready to pay in other ways! lol 3
Don't get me wrong, I wanted to try the holiday sampler (mostly coffee) but I ordered the summer sampler with teas.  There were just a couple peach teas, sweet teas, and unsweetened black teas.  I didn't send it back because I wanted to try the holiday sampler.  Almost everything I got was the eggnog coffee, apple ciders, ginger bread coffee, and french toast coffee.  The box was labeled summer sampler, so I'm sure that this was an accident.  I didn't contact the seller because I ordered it while I was gearing up for finals and now there is no contact seller button.  So seller, if you see this review message me and we can talk. 3
Pros - good price for its size, fast delivery,<br />Con - not the best tasting jimmies, still better than getting the small grocery store size 3
One of my boys needed to lose some weight and the other didn't.  I put this food on the floor for the chubby guy, and the protein-rich, no by-product food up higher where only my skinny boy can jump.  The higher food sits going stale.  They both really go for this food.  And my chubby boy has been losing about an ounce a week. 5
Great product to start your AM with as its not too strong but just the right tast for your morning wake us up. 5
Terrible clunky product.. drawer doesn't open/close without making clunky noises.  Not a space saver, hard on the eyes.  Would return it for a refund if I weren't terribly lazy.  Go to Bed Bath and Beyond and use a 20% off coupon for something else.  Not worth it. 2
My husband prefers this bread to others he has tried, and ordering in bulk saves money over grocery store purchases. It is relatively easy to make, which is nice.  This review compares Pamela's gluten free to regular bread according to my husband, but that doesn't seem fair! 3
Does not have a rich chocolate flavor. Tastes a little watery. Not sure who a makes a great cocoa but this is not it. 3
I can't say enough about these nuts, they are fantastic!  I stopped buying them years ago because they were way too expensive but at Amazon's price I'm now a subscription customer.  The only problem with these nuts is that once you open the can you don't want to stop eating them.  They have a Kona Coffee glaze and have just a hint of coffee flavor. I highly recommend this product. 5
These taste exactly like cinnamon toast crunch, but with the nutritional composition of almonds. They're pretty mind blowing. Don't be afraid of buying a 6-pack; you'll need it. 5
I got a single pouch of this Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger & Lemon Beverage Mix for a taste test.  After opening the pouch, I felt good about the contents' fragrant smell.  I poured the fragrant contents into a cup, added about 8 ounces of hot water to it, then gave the mixture a good stir.  My first sip was a nice surprise.  The gingery taste had a little bit of a bite to it, but this was somewhat smoothened by the honey used to naturally sweeten the beverage. With further sips, the bite became somewhat of a kick, but still a pleasant kick.<br /><br />To get a feel for how the beverage might taste when served cold, I put my drink into the refrigerator.  Usually, I like my drinks served cold.  But in the case of this ginger and lemon beverage, I thought the beverage tasted better when served hot.  Also, I wish the lemony taste was a bit stronger. 4
This coffee is OK, I have yet to buy a k-cup that has the same body that a regular brewed cup of coffee has. While this is strong in taste (almost too much), it lacks something that a regular drip brew has, almost kind of watery. Still a better k-cup than some that I've had. I do like the bulk amazon packaging though. 3
Excellent Product. Great taste and easy to sue in cereal, yougur etc..  That's it in a nutshell.  Very Timely delivery. 5
These cherry tomatoes have a nice flavor although they sort of "deflate" if you cook them for more than a minute.<br /><br />Even out of the can, if you pop one in your mouth, it feels hollow. Hard to describe. I added these tomatoes to a pasta primavera I made the other night and had to remove them from the heat after just a minute because half of them had already started to collapse.<br /><br />I shared this order with a friend so now I'm left with 11 cans and I think I'll use most of them in pizzas or to make quick sauces. And if that works out then I'll keep the Subscribe and Save on this item, otherwise I'll have to cancel.<br /><br />I can't recommend this product because, in my opinion, the tomatoes should be firmer and not collapse like these do.<br /><br />Also, these cherry tomatoes are not peeled.<br /><br />Prompt delivery, but six of the cans arrived dented. 3
This coffee is very mild with a slight aftertaste.  The pods don't fit snugly into my Keurig, so I have to push them in hard.  I probably won't buy these again. 3
These are so healthy, and I feel great giving them to my children.  I was disappointed with the packaging, though.  I am opening my second box and found that some of the packages of puree weren't sealed properly in the corners and they leaked on the others.  What a mess!  I bought another variety in the same brand and it was fine.  I would probably buy these again, but I don't know. 2
I bought several of the Kind bar flavors and these were the worst of the bunch. My son LOVES mango and macadamia, but this combination in the bar fell short of our expectations. So many other great flavors to try, I would not recommend these unless you do not care about the taste! Bleh. 2
This is one of my favorite K-cups.  It's a rich dark coffee without the bitterness of some.  Highly recommended. 5
I am fairly certain this is the same tea sold by Caribou Coffee.  I think I could be considered an addict! The flavor is so good - lots of cinnamon and slightly spicy because of it.  Price for 50 is good and less than I have been able to find it elsewhere. 5
These were a little disappointing. The hot chocolate is very watery and the flavor is a bit strange...kind of plastic tasting. Haven't been able to find a good brand of hot chocolate for keurig 2
This is one of the best dog foods on the market.  It saved me quite a bit of money to order it directly through Amazon rather than try to find it locally. 4
For those looking for a more exotic tea drinking experience and who like white Jasmine tea, Numi's Flower Jewel is worth a look. About the size of a gum-ball, these jewels slowly open in water to form a flower shape around the central amaranth flower. They are meant to be decorative so glass teapot is a must when preparing this tea.<br /><br />Decorative does not mean tasteless. As a white tea, the flavor is mild, but rich and soothing. The jasmine is wonderful but does not overpower the tea. I have had stronger jasmine teas, but this one is quite balanced and tasty. I used a small glass pot when preparing it and was able to get more than 7 yummy infusions out of the jewel before the flavor and scent began to fade. The white tea tips are plentiful and of a high quality and don't get bitter if seeped for long periods.<br /><br />I must deduct some points though for the high price to tea ratio and the fragility of the flower jewels. Pouring hot water directly on them can cause pieces to fall of and after the 3rd or 4th infusion more of the flower starts to fall apart, though to be fair the main flower shape remains fairly intact. Some even come out of the box starting to missing the central flower or bits of leaf. Better packaging might solve this.<br /><br />If you want a tea experience that looks as good as it tastes and smells, or are entertaining and want a conversation piece, then Numi Tea Flower Jewel should be on your short list. 4
When I was younger my mom used to buy trail mix bars, Nature Valley ones I think, and I really liked them, so when I saw these on Amazon I decided to give them a try. I absolutely love these, so much more than other trail mix bars. They've got fiber and protein, as well as good fats and sugars, they're filling and make an excellent breakfast or snack and I really like that they're not grossly sticky sweet. They're also on here for a great price, especially with the subscribe and save discount. 5
I haven't had this stuff since the 70's but was curious and looking for something easy and fast. It is still the same ol' product but with sides the pork made a good meal. 4
The liquor filled chocolates arrived in perfect condition and were securely but attractively packaged. i am unable to comment on the flavor as they were purchased for a gift. The secure packaging prevented me from sampling the various flavors. 5
Not too sweet.  The best K-cup hot chocolate I've tried thus far. The kids loved drinking and making the hot chocolate. 4
Why would you use this 15+ ingredient package to make a sauce that only needs three ingredients to make from scratch? Ok, Hollandaise is tricky, but practice makes perfect. Yes, I had a few botched batches, but now I have people requesting that I make my "good hollandaise". Awesome! Knorr has 4 ingredients that are derived from corn. The ingredients in hollandaise are egg yolks, butter, and lemon. Hmm... no corn, no soy, no gum. Seriously, make it yourself! 1
These rinds are so good! If you eat one, you may want to keep on buying them! Great price for a cased product! 5
I must admit I have not tried the rice yet: looks good.<br />I have noticed that the product expiration date (though partially obscured) was in late September of this year: I just got it November 4.<br />I ex[ect it to be good: but expect timely checks of exp. dates from Amazon. 3
These pods are so much better than the Senseo pods!  At 10 grams, these pods are packed with more coffee than the Senseo pods, making for a better, stronger, more flavorful cup of coffee.  I use these in my Melitta One-One.  Also love that each pod is individually packaged, so they stay fresh.  They come in a stand-up box dispenser which is nice too.  I can't understand the other reviewer here who didn't like the coffee - I love this decaf!  It really is the best pod I've found.  Also the value here can't be beat.  Comes 3 boxes in each order, so in each order you get 54 pods!  And Baronet has so many flavors.  Do check on the other Baronet flavors, though, because all the Baronet pods are not 10 grams, and all the pods don't come individually packaged.  Stick to the 10 gram, individually packaged pods, you won't be disappointed.  I get three different Baronet coffee pod flavors, all on auto-delivery.  Highly recommend.  Yum. 5
They sent a Country Meal Variety pack and not a Gourmet Variety Pack.  My son has so far refused every one of these flavors.  I called and the CS rep refunded me my total as she couldn't guarantee that if she reordered, they'd send the right pack. 1
These chips are tasty but not what I expected from a "low salt" item.  They seem as salty as any "regular" potato chip, and they also seem excessively greasy.  By comparison, Cape Cod Reduced Fat chips are less salty with at least as much potato flavor and far less greasy. 3
To me the hulls and taste were on par if not slightly better then Jolly Time white kernels.  From a price standpoint I will stick with Jolly Time, but that is just my preference. 4
I found that when working on dried gumpaste, these didn't allow for the finest lines. Also the flow of colorings wasn't super consistent.  Also the felt tip didn't maintain its shape well, making it hard to do fine lines.  It was a helpful tool since I'm not the best with painting free hand. 3
I can't tell who this is targeted to, but it doesn't seem to fit kids or adults, in my opinion.<br /><br />It's a small, skinny can - just 8.3 ounces, compared to a typical soda can at 12 ounces.  It's all juice and there's no sugar added, as promised.  But there's still 33 grams of sugar, compared to 35 grams in a full sugar version of regular Coca Cola.  They also aren't kidding about not full carbonation.  It's not exactly flat, but it's close to it, and it actually needs the carbonation to cut down on the sweetness.  This is some seriously thick-tasting juice to my palate.<br /><br />This is something like an amped up Welch's, according to my taste buds - slightly more complex tasting, but not as interesting as a Snapple or any one of the similar individually bottled fruit drinks out there.  It's hard to describe, but with a less sweet juice, you can pull the flavors apart and say, tell the kiwi and strawberry apart in the drink.  This isn't that kind of juice.<br /><br />The "black cherry" is made up of apple, grape, acerola and cherry juices - reconstituted - with filtered sparkling water, so it's not particularly bad stuff, but aside from the 100% daily dose of vitamin C you get, there's nothing here to recommend it over a glass of orange juice either.<br /><br />Sorry, if I want a carbonated fruit drink, I'd rather add ginger ale to a Snapple or Sprite to CranApple or something - this is just way, way too syrupy, even for a kids' drink.  Maybe it's being targeted as something convenient and fun for kids, but it's an awful lot of sugar for an alternative to soda. 1
This is good loose leaf tea and the packaging makes this tea a very good purchase. There are three packages so while using one the other two stay fresh, the package has a zip lock thing to help preserve freshness and the bottome is fasioned so that it can stand up like in the picture. The tea itself is very good, but you must remember that this is Jasmine green tea... All in all I am happy with the purchase. 4
I want to like Kettle because they contain no corn oil or soybean oil (which are both GMO, and also my kids are allergic to corn and soy), but darnit, these things bite back! On the plus side, the sharpness of them may keep you from mindlessly enjoying too many. On the minus side, a mouthful of cuts and scratches is not worth it. Do they have to be SO hard and crunchy? What's wrong with simply light and crispy? I vastly prefer Lay's texture, but suffer with Kettle due to the absense of GMOs and corn/soy. I wish they'd come out with something less harsh on the mouth, though. 3
My son loves these things, but they go too fast. He pretty much eats half a bag at a time - and that ends up being quite expensive. I stopped buying them because of this. However, I would definitely consider getting them again for a roadtrip because they are dry, portable, and not messy even if dropped on the floor or seat. But for snacks at home, they are not worth the money. 3
Human-grade chicken, all organic dog food.  The food is delivered to me monthly on schedule via the Subscribe & Save program.  The profits benefit pet charities.<br />What's not to like? 5
I've purchased a few of these, and they are very reliable. I've used them with Win7 and OS X. The A/D quality is acceptable for most needs. The limited bit depth and sample rate are probably the only drawbacks. 5
Bought these thinking they were the 'regular-size' gumballs sold in the store, variety tubes, as pictured, but was delivered tiny 'penny' gumballs in tubes, and they are ALL pink.<br /><br />The regular size gumballs sell between 80 cents and a dollar a piece, so this seemed like a good deal, getting 36 tubes for $16.<br /><br />The tubes that I received are all marked "25 CENTS" right on top, but as you will notice in the picture on the listing, the tubes are all turned around so that you can't SEE this.<br /><br />(However, the photo DOES feature the variety of colors/flavors).<br /><br />Do the math, 25 cents a tube, 36 tubes, $9.00.  I just paid $15.90 for $9 (RETAIL) worth of gum.<br /><br />Deceptive listing.  Feeling ripped off.<br /><br />OH, and to top it all off....they're STALE. 2
These arrived in the middle of May and they have an expiration date of the first week of July. This means I have to eat a lot of these in the next few weeks! Just beware if you're planning on stocking up for the future...the future will get here very soon with these!<br /><br />It's also interesting that the box inside the Amazon box says "For internal use only". I'm not sure what that's about! 4
this stuff really works, i love it and cant get enough.  It tastes amazing  Highly recommend trying it, you wont be disappointed!! 5
I've tried all Vanilla coffee K-cups and by far this is the best! Wolf Gang Puck Vanilla Francaise is a smooth vanilla experience that lasts way after the coffee is consumed.  Try it you'll love it! 5
This is a great way to stop wasting money on creamer.  We use creamer in cocoa and it's always been an issue for kids on how much to use.  With these little cups, that don't need to refrigerated, we have cut back on over creaming cocoa and wasting of creamer.  The creamer comes in one big box; I was expecting a box within the box.  I would recommend keeping a supply in the frige to help cook the cocoa when making it. 5
My 60-lb lab mix loved this bone (the large size)! I like that it doesn't leave a nasty mess all over the floor and didn't give Hobbes any gas or stool problems. But I bought it thinking that it would last awhile, since its large and feels hard, but he finished it in 5 minutes flat. Not very cost effective, since they are pretty expensive and don't last long, but I will reiterate that my dog absolutely loved it. 3
Effects with some foods are more remarkable than others. I found balsamic vinegar tasting fairly like wine to be one of the most remarkable. 4
Ordered this last month, and now regret it. The texture is right, saltiness about right, and sweetness about right, but there's an off-flavor here. Chew on one for awhile, then blow some air back through your nose: to me, it smells like ammonia. Not strong, but very off. Last time I bought Gimbal's. Too soft, but the flavor is much better; wish I had gone with Gimbal's again. 2
Every morning when I wake up, I know I am going to have a perfect cup of coffee!!!  It's not too mild and not too strong, just right for me. 5
These are the best potato chips that money can buy.  There is just enough salt to taste it, but not so much that it masks the lingering potatoey awesomeness after you've wolfed down a bag of these beauties.  Each chip has the perfect thickness - my teeth get excited every time I put one in my mouth!  Everything about these chips is so perfect, it's like they were made by God and delivered by Gabriel himself.  Now that I know Amazon carries these, I don't even have to leave my house to buy them!  I may never eat anything else again! 5
Like most Melitta brews, I found this one to be somewhat middle of the road.  It's certainly not undrinkable, but it's not the first one I'd reach for, either.  As many of the other reviewers mentioned, I did find it nearly undrinkable when brewed in the quantity shown; I think you have to at least double the amount you use to get a good cup, so take that into consideration when figuring the value.<br /><br />I'm a little sensitive to caffeine and like to have a decaf on hand for drinking later in the day, and I bought this primarily to use with my Mr. Coffee frappe maker (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002FWMF8G">Mr. Coffee BVMC-FM1 20-Ounce Frappe Maker</a>; let me just put in a quick pitch for that, I love it!)  I found the "Riviera Sunset" stood up well to all the milk, flavoring, and ice inherent in making a frappe (again, with a significant increase in the amount used).<br /><br />I would probably not purchase this coffee just because of my own views on coffee; I look for bird-friendly, Fair Trade brands, and I find nothing to indicate that Melitta makes any effort to meet these expectations.  Leaving aside these considerations, though, I think those who enjoy a somewhat light, easy-drinking brew would like this coffee. 3
A good product at a reasonable price. I find some of the product to be somewhat hard, harder when compared to other suppliers. 3
My son (now 9 months old) has been eating HAPPYBELLIES organic oatmeal cereal twice a day since he was 6 months old, and loves it. So I love it too - until recently. The last container I bought had a different color and smell. All our cereal until now had been a cream-ish color, soft and flaky in texture and smelled like, well, oats. Not anymore. The recent batch had cereal that had black/gray-ish flakes mixed with the regular-looking oat flakes, and it smelled horrible, almost like mold or really, really rancid oil. I had bought that batch from [...] and they promptly issued a refund. Now I'm a fix as to what to feed my baby! I don't want to experiment with an unfamiliar brand given how much he loves this one, but again I don't want him to eat what clearly doesn't look or smell like food.<br /><br />Can someone, from either Amazon or HAPPYBELLIES, please repond to this and other similar concerns and put them to rest? 1
I have tried about 75% of the available T-Discs, and the Kona Blend is one of the best regular/unflavored coffees for Tassimo. It has a nice smooth flavor that is not overpowering, and has a pleasant aroma. Personally, I would enjoy it more if it were stronger/bolder. However, being a bit mild, it goes well with breakfast and/or (gluten-free) baked goodies. I find it mildly perplexing that this product is not available from tassimodirect, nor is a subscription service available. Originally found this at (Dead Bats from) Beyond, used a 20% coupon, and was happy with the final price. 4
As a small dog owner, (Shitshu), we are careful about what our dog can easily get down her throat.  She is also a picky eater, as are a fair amount of small dogs.<br />She loves the Merrick Wingaling, but one day while breaking up one of the large chunks of chicken, I was amazed to find a fairly stout chicken bone within the meat.  I removed it, thinking it must be an anomoly.  Then it happened again in the same can, then another can, and on and on.<br />Final word, although my dog likes this food very much, we will stop buying this brand due to the possibility of our dog getting scratches in the throat from chicken bone edges, or worse yet, choking on the bones with a full mouth of food.  Many people have said on other dog sites that dogs can digest chicken bones.  That is true, if they can get them into their stomachs.  The problem arises on the scratches to the throat lining, then possible inflammation or infection, and at the worst, choking and not being able to dislodge a sharp piece of bone.  No thanks.<br />It is just not worth the possible worry, considering the price of this food. 1
I agree with this product's description as it having a unique" flavor. While the flavor is not unpleasant it has a certain Asian quality to it. I am a traditional tea drinker, but tried this one out to see what it was like. I enjoy lemon and ginger, as well as honey so I figured this would make for an interest brew. It does have a bite to it due to the ginger- a slight heat to the back of the throat. On the whole the aroma was divine and made my allergy nose open up a bit and feel great. The overall flavor is that of an herbal healing broth, not so much a relaxation and read-a-book cup of warmth. I would recommend this for those looking for herbal remedies that taste like the ingredients they are made with. This unique flavor is full of ginger and a touch of honey. 3
The tree came on time; but two words describe the tree I receive:  Ugly and sickly.  Obviously, I am not as lucky as the others in the reviews had said their trees were so wonderful.  Mine is consisted of only one twig, no branching, nothing like the picture!  I contacted the seller; he told me that in the description it says, "Tree shape and size may vary" and refused to exchange my purchase.  I understand that every bonsai tree may have been shaped differently but mine hardly has any shape at all; it is not artistically styled to be a bonsai tree, it is basically a slim twig stick inside a ceramic container.  I guess you have to be so lucky to receive a decent tree as shown in the picture.  Awful experience, I am very disappointed! 2
We have a Keurig coffee maker. One of the side benefits is the opportunity to experiment with different K-cups. I have already tried half a score. Some seem pretty tasty at first--until one taste something that is even better. Some early K-cups that I graded highly don't compare too well with later brands that I have tried.<br /><br />Wolfgang Puck's Columbian Dark Roast Noir is one of the better products that I have tried. It has a bold taste, although not strongly so. It is also smooth tasting.<br /><br />It is now on my short list of possibilities for my first morning cup of coffee. So, I am pretty happy with Wolfgang Puck's product here. 4
I do not have a green thumb.  Thankfully I'm great at feeding things, animals, children etc.  This plant arrived with minimal bud damage.  However once "fed",  she sprung back to life.  If you're squeemish around insects and worms, this is not for you.  If you enjoy nature at its best but live in suburbia, this offers a mini escape into the jungle :) 3
I really liked how my hair looked at first when I tried this shampoo but by day 3 and 4 I started developing itchy bumps on my scalp. I also realized that this product was leaving a film on my hair. I had been using sulfate free shampoos for the last few years but I broke down and bought this because of all the great reviews. This shampoo is not for everyone. If you're at all sensitive to chemicals, stay away. I went back to an awesome shampoo that I stick with. Every time I try something new, nothing treats my hair and scalp the way Henna Hut shampoos do. I've tried them all and I like their Neem shampoo the best. I don't work for them. I'm just a customer who appreciates them more and more every time I try other products. 1
This is my favorite of all the coffees I've tried. Smooth and flavorful without being a flavored coffee, its a definite treat anytime of day. 5
I am so upset that I didn't read the reviews first before buying this coffee.  I "assumed" all k-cups had coffee grounds inside.  I wondered why the k-cup was so light when I removed it, so I opened it ....and no grounds. This is nothing but instant coffee in disguise.  So much for a good deal on what I thought would be good coffee.  Never again. 1
This is the coffee we crave in our house. It is a strong brew, yet not bitter. Yuban is the best ground coffee we have tasted, yet. 5
I thought this was a great deal in the warehouse deals section, but it was pretty nasty and smelled like dog food when I opened each bag.  Slim Jim is made of crap too but at least it tastes good. 1
Just tried this Pumkin Spice Coffee.  Spouse said it left an after taste.  I couldn't taste the Pumkin -- the only reason to buy Pumkin Spice coffee.  Label says its Low Acidic -- that's a plus if the coffee was better.  Bean Coffee Engineer's have some work to do on this Pumkin Blend.<br /><br />PROBLEM:  We got use to GODAVIA, Pumkin Spice Coffee which is the VERY VERY BEST!  Unfortunately it is also $$$$$ VERY Pricey. 1
We bought this along with the Himalayan Inhaler (which works great).  However this fine ground salt does not work in the inhaler, it comes into your mouth as you breathe.  Use the rock salt instead. 2
We had this shipped directly to our family in another part of the country. They thought it was a beautifully put together and wonderful present. They loved everything inside of it and they tend to be very picky. The only complaint I have is it took forever to ship! Although I personally didn't see it from what I understand it was worth the wait. 4
Not familiar with what "chai" tea is supposed to taste like but this tea tasted like stewed cloves to me  Yuck.Got this flavor in a sampler box and, so far, it's the only Stash tea I've tried and disliked strongly. Some are better than others, of course, but I find this particular flavor really, really unpleasant, which is odd given my love for most of the spices listed on label.  The problem is that the clove just overwhelms everything and that's about all I could taste, outside a touch of cinnamon. IMO, clove has much too strong a taste to be used beyond sparingly...in anything. Perhaps adding milk and sugar might've made it more palatable - might even be the way it's 'supposed' to be prepared, but one of the reasons I drink tea is to stay away from having to add sweeteners or milk to make it taste good. In any case, I can't imagine using enough milk/sweetener to subdue the overwhelming clove taste would leave any room in the mug for tea or water. 2
Like another reviewer mentioned, it's thin and watery. I honestly prefer the Maxwell House stuff compared to this. I was really disappointed after reading such great reviews about this product.. Even more so becaue I ordered 6 tins of it!!! But it was a learning experience... won't buy it again, for sure! 2
If you've never had Monin's full-on sugar rush syrup, you won't be disappointed in this. The sweetener does have a noticeable aftertaste. Not enough to ruin the experience, but if you're a purist, stick with the sugary drink version. 3
Just as so many other reviewers have stated, PB2 is absolutely wonderful in shakes! Everyone has their own kind of shakes they make and for me, it's Slim-Fast + fat-free milk + 1 tbsp of PB2 + some ice in a blender. It is a great tasting chocolate peanut butter shake! I have not used the PB2 in other similar ways. I enjoy my shake so much though, that I will continue to buy the PB2 for it.<br /><br />That being said.. I mixed it to make it just like a peanut butter- 2 tbsp of powder + 1 tbsp of water. I spread it on an English muffin (I love an English muffin with peanut butter). Unlike other reviews, I have to say, that was not pleasant at all. The consistency was fine but I'd give up peanut butter altogether before doing that again. In my opinion, it was awful tasting and even made me sick to my stomach while I was eating it and for a while after I had finished.<br /><br />Even though I disliked the PB2 prepared with water, I still give it 4 stars because it is such a great mix-in and I will continue to make my chocolate peanut butter shakes with it. I will have to keep my natural Jif peanut butter though for sandwiches until there's a truly adequate/great tasting substitute. I've seen several dieticians and they have all said it's a good idea to fit in natural peanut butter into the diet for the healthy fats, but just don't overdo it. I've lost 20 lbs and still incorporated natural peanut butter into my diet, so it can be done (again, moderation).<br /><br />Nutrition: The nutrition is also why this product is so popular! With 1.5 grams of fat, 5 grams of carbs, 2 grams of Fiber and 5 grams of Protein, this is a great choice and it is diabetic friendly. :) 4
I discovered pickled okra (another brand) in a local store, but haven't found it again.  After developing a craving, I finally went to Amazon and found several brands.  There can be an enormous variation in taste and texture in this kind of product and went with Tabasco out of faith in the brand.  For $2.50 for a 12 oz. jar, the price is more than reasonable.  Tastes great.  Just crunchy enough, but the $7+ shipping makes the total cost at least $4.00 over comparable product if available here.  An included $1.00 coupon took a little off the pain.<br /><br />I sure liked the taste, but total cost outweighs value.<br /><br />I'll try a similar product with cheaper shipping and hope for luck of the draw good taste. 4
I HAVE ALWAYS LIKE BUSTELO ESPRESSO REGULAR, AND STILL DO. I FIND VERY LITTLE DIFFERENCE IN TASTE BETWEEN THE BUSTELO PREMIUM AND THE REGULAR TO MERIT THE EXTRA COST. 1
Before I ordered this coffee, I read reviews both here at Amazon and on other sites.  I used reviewers comments to base my decision to purchase it.  I am a lover of Starbucks Espresso Decaf coffee.  I have my own Breville espresso machine at home.  I have been using Starbucks for years.  My Lavazzo coffee arrived and I was eager to give it a try.  I opened the tin to find brown coffee - while I already knew I would be disappointed because I already know I prefer Black coffee beans to brown. While it pulled a decent looking cup, I put it to my mouth only to find it did not match my tastebuds. One sip was all it took for me to hand it off to my husband.  So. My verdict here is, if you are like me and enjoy only black bean coffee DO NOT buy this product.  If you prefer brown bean coffee, give it a go. 1
I am not sure why I bought these, I maybe thought they just looked good.  I didn't realize I was buying so many when they came.  This is like buying bulk at costco which I probably could have gotten cheaper there.  Anyways, the taste on these things is a little more than average, they taste good.  My favorite will always be S'mores though and I think a lot of people will agree.  These taste just like a cinnamon bun though and are pretty good.  4 Stars out of 5. 4
All four of my dogs, ranging in size from 30 lbs to 85 lbs absolutely love these.  As soon as they hear the crinkly sound of the package they come, sit, and intently watch me with all their ears up and alert (the 8 ears up rating) until they get their chews and then go off to enjoy them.  From the dog's point of view, they're perfect.<br /><br />From my ponit of view, and the reason for deducting a star, is the price for the benefit.  These cost more than ordinary chews and I'm not sure they are any healthier for their teeth and gums than the plain rawhide chews.  One of my dogs is prone to gum disease and often has bad breath, if these worked as advertised, her gums would be healthier and bad breath should be eliminated by the enzyme action.  I've tried giving the dogs nothing but this brand of chews for over a month and there was no detectable improvement.  I'll still be using one bag per month of these in hopes that there really is a benefit, but the bulk of their chew treats will be <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZF06JI">Green Cow Rawhide Dog Bones, Natural Chips, 5-Pound Bag</a> because of the cost savings. 4
We've tried so many gluten free products and this one was by far the best. I've made pancakes, waffles, biscuits and the chicken recipe for the whole family with this and they can not tell the difference. Pamela's is a good mix too but this one is much better. It is expensive but when you've got a loved one who is gluten intolerant you're just thankful to have options for them. I can find it at some of my grocery stores but not all. You just have to check and see who carries it and then try a box. It's worth it! 5
I am a coffee drinker and I thought this would be a variety of coffee,but there is a lot of tea in the box and there is not much variety from box to box each month.  With how many different coffees Timothy stocks, I thought I would be getting many different coffees to try.  Not a bad deal, but after a few boxes, the teas start to really pile up. 3
The product image you see is an image of the 5 (FIVE) pound gummy bear. Not of the .5 (POINT FIVE) one.<br /><br />Also, in the description it says ".5 pound gummy bear". That's just deceptive. They know everyone's going to be looking for the 5 pound one, and thinking this is it, since that's a picture of the larger bear.<br /><br />Deceptive. Wrong. Uncool.<br /><br />Do not buy. (I've bought the 5 pound one. I easily recognize its dimensions. You're welcome.) 1
I ordered Halter Sugar free candies for about fifteen bucks. Coffee flavor is my favorite hard candy, and sugar free was a must. This is the biggest Rip Off I have spent on amazon! The candies are great, but you get these eight little tiny boxes, the size of something you would give away as Halloween treats. Really liked the taste, Extremely disappointed on the cost for the amount. I will give it three stars, but only recommend if you are not concerned on price. 3
I had high hopes for this - I added it to seltzer water and it tastes every so slightly like root beer...more like diet root beer.  I was hoping to use this as a soda replacement to try to be a bit healthier - but I doubt we'll even finish this bottle. 1
I've always loved this tea, even though it is rather expensive.  I purchased it from Amazon because I've never been let down before.  Mistake.  The tea came in the same box shown in the advertisement, clearly stating "25 muslin tea bags".  My box had a STICKER over it, which said "20 muslin tea bags".  I figure if I'm already spending that kind of money on tea, I shouldn't get stuck with a 20% decrease in the product. 3
I love the idea of this product but with larger pills the beef pill pockets are much easier to mold around the pill than the chicken. Although my dogs love both flavors my boxer can easily eat the pill pocket and spit out the pill with the chicken flavor but does not do that with the beef flavor again because it is easier to bury the entire pill in the pocket using the beef.  They work great with smaller pills. 3
I can at least tolerate most foods, but these bars were so bad that I threw them away.  Very disappointing. 1
These are nice large nuts, well roasted and salted. I like the 12 ounce size and the three pack is nice. I get them on subscribe and save and the price for this quality peanut is good. I use them for snacks and for cooking stir frys and making lettuce wrap fillings. Good size to throw in your bag to take to a game, or put in your car for starvation emergencies. 4
I love all different types of beef jerky, but not this one.  It has the flavor of grocery store bought beef jerky once you get over the overwhelming taste of salt. These sticks are cut thin making them tender and easy to chew, but they're just way too salty and definitely not worth $20 2
So some people didn't like that weird feeling the chocolate left in your mouth that people mentioned as a "waxy" feeling, but I personally enjoyed the taste of this a lot, and I bought this quite a bit until I realized there's trans-fat in the cereal.<br /><br />In the ingredients, the cereal contains "PARTIALLY HYDROGENATED PALM KERNEL OIL", which for those who may not know, but anything "hydrogenated" contains a very small amount of trans-fat.<br /><br />It may only be less than .5 grams and so in the nutrition panel, they can show that there's 0 trans fat in the cereal, but if you had 3-4 servings of chocolatey delight, you could very well be eating 1-2 grams of trans-fat. Just be forewarned.<br /><br />Anyways, give the cereal a try if you haven't, and don't just think you'll hate the taste of it just because others didn't like the taste of it because I enjoyed the flavor of the cereal very much. 3
Chicken by-product, corn gluten meal, and whole ground corn?!!  Yeah, I'm NOT feeding my cat that, sorry. Googling "corn gluten meal" shows that it is used as an herbicide according to U.S. Patent # 5,030,268. If you Google "U.S. Patent 5,030,268" you will find out.  By-products are all the nasty parts of the chicken, turkey that humans won't eat: feet, neck, spleen, intestines that have bad effects on health. After all there are reasons why humans don't eat these parts, correct? So why should our pets? A good book that explains about by-products and manufacturing is The New Natural Cat by Anitra Frazier.  Because of these ingredients being in most cat foods, I buy Tractor Supply's 4HEALTH INDOOR dry food. Compare the ingredients in the Science Diet food to 4HEALTH and you will see the differences. 4HEALTH is a much better quality product with no corn, wheat or soy at HALF the price. 1
I got these in the mail today, i know right, sounds so weird to say i got hash browns in the mail, haha.  Come in dry ice cooler and were in box all in their own lil plastic bags.  Just stick them on a baking sheet for 35 min. at 400 degrees.  when you get them out of the oven you smell the cheese and it has nice crunchy outside with creamy potato inside, if you want the best side dish to your steak or other meat, hey could even use for breakfast with some eggs and sausage, your choice, this get a 5/5 for taste, 5/5 for presentation, buy these now, great price too, thanks for your time, and thank you omaha steaks, the best at great prices. 5
well, do you know how difficult it is to find WHITE RICE PUFFED RICE?<br /><br />Only company that does it is QUAKER.<br /><br />Millet doesn't cut it. sorry. won't but it again.<br /><br />Have tried all the puffed rice products. Most don't tell you that these puffed rice products are BROWN RICE PUFFED RICE.. Truth in advertising?<br /><br />I think not.<br /><br />BROWN RICE PUFFED just doesn't have the taste of WHITE RICE PUFFED.<br /><br />I can still find it at ALBERTSONS at around $4 bucks a box. 2
An overwhelming smell and taste of preservatives. Left the package open on the kitchen island and when the family came home they wanted to know why I was spraying for bugs. Seriously! 1
We have previously had Davidson's English Breakfast tea and stored it in a plastic clear container.  We bought the Davidson's Earl Grey tea and within 3 days the clear plastic container has been chemically etched where the tea had touched it.  The container ultimately became totally opaque and now permanently shows where the tea level was.  The tea tastes good but one has to ask 'Is this good for you?' - I doubt it and will not be buying the Earl Grey again.<br /><br />I have since been in contact with Davidson's.  They believe that the oils in Earl Grey may be the culprit (never heard of oils affecting plastic before!).  I have since sent them the container and they have sent it to their management for review.  Davidson's have also said they are going to send me a glass container in return. 2
I found this when I was shopping at Walmart and decided to give it a try.  I do have to say that it does smell good being "brewed".  I was very disappointed to find out that it tastes like the crap that you get at a convenient store.  Once you have Real Cappuccino you really can't ever drink that CRAPuccino at convenient stores.  I know I won't ever buy any of their "cappuccino" again, but I will give their hot chocolate and apple cider a try in hopes that they are drinkable. 2
I did not purchase this but received it as a Christmas gift.  It was wonderful!  My husband actually made the soup.  He followed the directions, added some ham and it was soup!  He did say that the beans seemed to get done quicker that he thought.  He would not presoak them as suggested.  It's a great gift that not only gives to the recipient but helps women in need as well.  I would highly recommend it and will be purchasing some myself! 5
Used to eat the Spicy Thai flavor all the time.  MSG makes my body unhappy and this was one of the few flavored chips that was MSG free.  Now they have changed the whole recipe and how they make them.  Instead of being real food on the ingredients like it used to be its mostly processed chemical garbage, a bunch more salt and MSG stuffed in under the label "yeast extract".  They removed the NO MSG from the label so they know very well what they did.<br /><br />The worst part though is that they taste horrible.  Instead of crisp, oily and full of character...say as if they were cooked in like...a kettle or something they instead have the color and uniformity of baked lays.  The Spicy Thai flavor now tastes like sour cream and onion or ranch that has gone rancid.<br /><br />What a shame, no more kettle chips for me.  It seems they are slowly moving one flavor at a time to this new cheap ingredient list and manufacturing method.  Dont be fooled into paying a premium price for these chips as they are not a premium product anymore. 1
The probe has a braided metal outer jacket on the cable that causes any flexing of the cable to strain the cable where it exits the probe.  This condition causes failure (shorting of the sensor wires to the jacket) at that point.  I have had 2 other probes with this type of cable that failed in that mode.  The best type of cable is a thick silicone jacket like used on microwave temp probes. 2
My pigs dont like this brand.I think oxbow is better. So I will purchase the oxbow hay next time. 2
Like most of the US, our local stores were all out of canned pumpkin and didn't expect any more to be available until after the Fall 2010 harvest.<br /><br />So, I turned to what I thought was a reliable online retailer - Amazon - to fill the gap.<br /><br />I read the other reviews, but not until AFTER I placed the order.  My mistake, I know.<br /><br />I was optimimistic that perhaps I'd be one of the lucky buyers who didn't get any serious dents.  Unfortunately, just like others reported the case came sealed in two boxes.  The inner box was well packed with bubble wrap covering the already sealed case of pumpkin cans.  The cans were dented even in the middle of the sealed case.  They had clearly been packaged this way and not damaged in shipment.  I find it appalling that Farmer's Market is using Amazon.com as a way to sell its dented and damaged product, knowing full well that buyers cannot visually inspect the product prior to purchase. 1
We had been eyeballing this on the shelf for a couple weeks at the local grocery store and were thrilled to get it to review.  My favorite cereals are Honey Nut Cheerios, Honey Bunches of Oats, or Crispix.  If it is my birthday or a camping trip and I am going to indulge in a sweet cereal I prefer Frosted Flakes. Cereal tends to be a sweet breakfast treat, and not a staple in our home, so I can overlook the nutrition facts.<br /><br />Probably the best way I could describe Kellogg's Crunchy Nut is "greasy Kix."  It left a funky aftertaste and slime on my tongue.  The flavor, even before the aftertaste, wasn't good, though it was not the most horrible cereal in the world.  It was edible so I gave it an one star more than something... inedible.  My son thought it was ok, though not a favorite, but this seems to be packaged as an "adult" cereal so his vote doesn't count.  I was done after my first bowl and let him finish the rest over the course of two weeks.  This is unusual in my house as we usually go to blows on who gets the last bowl of cereal.  Even my son did not ask to repurchase!<br /><br />Unfortunately this failed for me.  Sorry Kellogg's! 2
I had gotten tired of the Redbulls and 5 Hour Energys of the world and thought I'd try something new. I'm a big fan of anything pomegranate flavored and my dad (who rides 50-70 miles a week) said these made a big difference for him. The flavor is great but I haven't noticed any sort of energy pick up after eating them. I've since switched to Sambozan Acai energy drinks and those are a huge improvement. 2
We love this tray. It is very sturdy and holds just enough K cups. I would recommend this to everyone 5
If I wanted to eat rock hard, expired candy I would just go across the street to the gas station. These are the OLDEST, grossest sour punch straws I've ever tasted. They are as hard as a jawbreaker and they taste rotten and plastic-y. Do not order from amazon! I just basically threw $22 in the garbage. 1
This was purchased as a game for my thirteen-year-old daughter's Harry Potter themed get-together to celebrate the release of the final movie.  The jelly bean game is loads of hysterical fun, and fit very well with our theme.  :) 5
Don't waste your money. This was a ruined Christmas gift for my sister. She loved these as a child, so I got her a box for a surprise. They were so stale that we couldn't even eat one package.<br />They tasted like cardboard-what a disappointment!!! 1
Tough?!?  Ah, C'mon, you can't compare this to Cap'n Crunch, for heaven's sake..!  This one is all-natural, and has no preservatives -- sure, it's going to get a bit tough once it's open.  To combat that, just put the bowl of cereal (dry) into the microwave for 20 - 30 seconds... let cool, and then enjoy - voila!  (This can be done with any cereal that goes stale, btw).<br /><br />It's really good combined with yogurt and fruit.<br /><br />Seriously, don't compare this with the over-processed, preservative-laden stuff in the grocery stores.  Zap it and give it a shot! 4
K-Cup coffee was supposedly barely out of date, but tasted very, very old and I could not afford to order from Amazon as the ones I got were from Moriah Acres. 1
I didn't have high expectations that I would like this but I love coffee and have trouble with nausea from the acid. I am a Starbucks fan and while this was not as full bodied as that it was surprisingly good. Nice to not have the acid issues that come with coffee, this did not bother me at all or make me nauseous. I still prefer the taste of Starbucks houseblend but now I'm not sure the extra body is worth the acid. This is a good alternative that i found i liked better and better as i got use to it. Give it a try! 4
Salt and vinegar is just ok to me.<br />They are not in the same league of utz Salt and vinegar potato chips.<br /><br />Just ok<br /><br />Not enough taste to them. 2
When I finally manage to convince myself to peel out from under the sheets each morning the second thing I'm interested in is a good strong cup of coffee. I categorize myself as a coffee drinker as opposed to a connoisseur since I'm amenable to buying whatever happens to be on sale at the market and spending my money on boutique blends happens about as often as the pope personally dispenses contraceptives.<br /><br />Now, my palate is sufficiently sophisticated to distinguish between premium and plebian but the miserly gene invariably kicks into overdrive and inhibits forking over the cash for the former and definitely precludes an outlay for what my taste buds inform is a decent product yet well short of remarkable.<br /><br />The Marley organic medium Ethiopia Yirgacheffe is a step above valued oriented Arabica but I was reminded of an ground variety with a bitter, burned aftertaste from the most notable of those upscale caf&eacute; house coffee providers (hey, I'm cheap and a hypocrite. If someone else is paying, I'm drinking).<br /><br />I tried the pods in a variety of ways (single cup brewing; steeped like tea for five minutes; open grind percolation; microwaved to the cusp of boiling) but regardless of method with eight ounces of water I found myself less than overwhelmed, and definitely unmotivated to order more.  Drinking it with cream and sugar was less offensive than black; the additives tended to mask the burnt aftertaste I detected.<br /><br />For some this group's commitment to social responsibility may influence a purchasing decision. Unfortunately, in my case that altruistic gene is in dormant state so it's all about the taste and price rather than ethical considerations. 2
I am a chocolate chip cookie lover.  Once I learned that I had to give up wheat and other gluten products I started my search for alternatives.  That was about four years ago and boy were most of the gluten free products awful.  Then a couple of years ago I discovered Pamela's brand of baked goods and baking mixes.  I have yet to find one I did not think was wonderful.  Back to the chocolate chunk cookies.  This mix has huge pieces of dark chocolate and is delicious.  Some of the reviews that I have read state that it has too much sugar.  Yes it does, as all real chocoate chip cookies do.  I am a health nut myself, but when I want an occasional indulgence this is it. 5
I only used two maybe three tea bags and got pregnant - can not drink during pregnancy.  Not a bad taste, but I'm not a big tea fan either. 2
Loved this...kids finished off the entire pot! I added much more to the recipe as it is quite salty. I would say almost doubled everything...adding corn...black beans...onion etc. 4
I purchased a case of this product in the hopes to find an alternative to the high calorie, high sugar beverage I normally drink.  Dr Pepper has been my favorite for years.  I have tried other beverages that were supposed to be cheaper versions of it, only to be disappointed every time.  I thought, with this version (Dr Zevia) being so much more expensive and using stevia to sweeten as a healthier alternative than sugar, that this would likely be closer to the brand name beverage it was trying to be like.  Unfortunately, I found it not only wasn't closer to the flavor, it was much worse than any I had tried in the past!  It was like drinking carbonated cough syrup!  I did not return it because my son decided to drink it and suffer through it to try to reduce his caloric intake, but if he wants more of it, he will have to buy it himself.  I will never again spend 4 times the amount I spend for the real deal, just to be disappointed by what is expected to be a high quality product. 1
While, we wouldn't have blind tasted picked out the idea of Mozzarella for these, the flavor is still cheesy and good. Everyone in my family enjoyed these. A light flavor that left us all fighting over the to the last bite. Definitely going on the grocery list. 4
I ordered this for a custodian at the high school I teach at, she was still working while on the wait-list for a liver transplant.  It was so cute, and I knew it would really be a pick-me-up for her.  It was supposed to arrive in ten business days, but never came at all, not while she was still working, or even after she got worse and was home bound waiting.  I know this is true, because I didn't know her home address, so I told them to deliver it to the school....so I know it never came.  I have e-mailed the company several times, and they have never replied, although they still spam me with info on new items...as if I would ever order from them again.  Buyer beware - the company I bought mine from was a total rip-off! 1
The product itself is good I suppose.  Maybe it's just my dog.  I have a 7 month old lab, and he can't figure out how to get the food out very well.  It's kinda hard for me too--I have to hold the rope part with one hand and shake the bottle with the other hand.  So I can see why it's hard for dogs.  But anyway--the product is very durable, and maybe Samson will learn the trick one day. 3
I am a huge fan of Dr. McDougall's products and this oatmeal deserves a lot of praise.  These oatmeal packs contain a reasonable 120 calories (most store brands have 150 calories).  One package of this oatmeal truly fills you until lunch.  Each packet has the perfect mix of apples, cinnamon and oatmeal.<br /><br />As you search for healthy oatmeal, you will find that the company makes large oatmeal cups.  I found the cups to be too large -- I started to remove half the oatmeal for my next day's breakfast.  I don't have to do that with the oatmeal packets because the portion size is perfect. I hope the company begins to make packets for the Dr. McDougall breakfast cups. 5
I really love this sugar and price-wise it's much cheaper to buy it here on amazon compared to anywhere else. 5
I love strong coffee and I love iced coffee so this little can is a whopping good time.  I grabbed this on my way out to work one morning and the only complaint I have is that it doesn't come in a bigger can.  However, the strong taste is probably best in moderation.  It tasted freshly brewed and hit the spot. It also gave me that much needed caffeine boost on my way.  Hope they develop some more flavors in the future. 4
I must have gotten the scraps.  My tree was about 5 inches tall and crossed only once.  Since adding water, the braids are loose.  It is nothing like the pictures and descriptions.<br />9 Green Box should be ashamed to send out anything like this.<br />I would never had bought it... I would have never accepted it as a gift.  It will probably be in the trash next week.<br />It is a "Money Tree"  =  I lost money and they make a killing on swindling customers over the internet. 1
I know these are supposed to be good for you but they are a little hard to get down without lots of liquid.  Also, way too expensive.  I don't think I will be buying them again. 2
I order 2 cases,(12 packs per case), every 45 days or so. In the past, a few crackers were broken. No problem. In my last 2 orders, nearly 3/4 of the crackers werw either broken or totally crumbled! When Amazon shipped the packages, there was very little packing material to protect the crackers. I currently have 2, unopened cases. Crackers or crumbs? 2
Item arrived swiftly however, a lot of the cans were dented. If you can live with a dent in your can, the product is perfect inside. Highly recommended seller. 4
I bought this product because we originally thought our new puppy had a condition called megaesophagus which requires them to eat and stay in a vertical position for 30-45 minutes after eating and other people had recommended this product to keep the dog occupied during that time.<br />We later found that our dog doesn't have this condition (thank goodness) so I was going to return it but I decided to try it out when my puppy got a tick on her head, thinking it would keep her focused while I got the tick off (which it very much did)<br /><br />The only one I have used is the chicken flavor and when I took off the lid, I gagged and threw up in my mouth. It stinks that bad. But my puppy did seem to like the taste of it. 3
Does it matter if things are healthy if they don't taste very good?  This multi-grain chips may be packed with goodness, but they taste like a stale wheat thin that was left sitting in a bag of real tortilla chips for awhile and managed to pick up a bit of their flavor.  I think I would actually like these better if they were simple multi-grain crackers without the thin brushing of flavoring.<br /><br />Someone looking for a healthy alternative might be happy with these.  If you are a compulsive snacker, then maybe you could get used to the taste.  But anyone looking to chow down on some tortilla chips isn't going to be too happy, and would have to force themselves through a bag of these rather than eating what they really wanted.<br /><br />Unless you covered them with cheese and made nachos.  Because that makes everything taste better! 3
I love rice and really had hopes that this product would be great. Rice can be a pain to make, with this only taking 90 seconds in the microwave, it was really appealing! Really I should have known better though... a product being cooked in a plastic bag is going to come out smelling like plastic. The smell of plastic was pretty stomach turning, couldn't possibly be good for you.... 1
I bought this pack from costco last week. However, I feel all the chips in these packets are undercooked ones. I was wondering thats how they make these economical 1oz packets. I clearly see the difference between big bag of Lay's and these tiny bags. I do not like them. Will never buy again 2
You would think that if a company goes as far as producing an organic product, the rest of the packaging would be safe.  I will no longer be purchasing from this company until  they change this.  I would pay more if it were in glass. 3
This is one of the best K-cup coffees I've ever had!  It's has a nice aroma, smooth, and rich cup of coffee; love it in the morning. 5
I've had truffle honey before and thought to try this one out. It's a nice acacia honey but not much of the truffle essence comes through. I suggest the Casina Rossa brand that comes in a 3-pack sampler as a better alternative. 3
Our baby really loves to eat these and they come in glass, Great! But we discontinued using them after I found a web posting that the manufacturer uses lids that contain BPA! I emailed their customer service department (10/2010) and the company confirmed that BPA is used in the lids. This smacks of the worst kind of marketing, taking advantage of the organic label and the potential health benefits but selling it in inferior packaging, legal yes, but not really in the spirit of the organic movement. For Pete's sake the lid itself has the word "organic" written on it 6 times! We stopped using all the companies products including the dry oatmeal and rice because we personally found it such a dishonest practice (he loved those too unfortunately) so in summary good food, bad implementation. 2
Bought the tub at BJ's 33.9 ounce, Decaf Folgers and brought it home and it had no odor. Made it and it was no good. Exchanged it and second tub had very little coffee odor and again not so good. Could BJ's have gotten a bad batch. We have been drinking this decaf coffee for quite a few years and like it. Is there an explanation for these recent purchases. 2
It may be low acid, but the trade-off isn't worth it. The odor & the flavor are both poor, and the coffee is relatively weak, which I guess I shouldn't complain about - if I'm going to drink a cup of foul-tasting liquid, I'd prefer it to be as weak as possible! 2
I'm all for healthier, crunchy snacks. Popchips works for me in this category. Popchips Sweet Potato is gluten free too! These chips have a very, slight sweet flavor with a hint of salt. They don't have a strong sweet potato flavor.<br /><br />These chips aren't fried or baked, but are cooked using heat & pressure until they pop. They are all natural with no preservatives, no artificial flavors or colors, no cholesterol, no saturated fat & no trans fat. They are vegan & gluten free. 28gr of Popchips Sweet Potato have 50+% less fat per serving when compared to 28 grams of regular fried potato chips. (28g of Sweet Potato Popchips has 4g of fat; 28g of regular fried potato chips has 10g of fat) Keep in mind that this bag of Sweet Potato Popchips is 23 grams with 3g of total fat.<br /><br />Nutrition facts:<br />100 calorie per .8oz bag<br />Total fat 3g<br />Saturated fat 0<br />Trans fat 0<br />Polyunsaturated fat .5g<br />Monounsaturated fat 2g<br />Cholesterol 0<br />Sodium 95mg/4%<br />Potassium 45mg/1%<br />Total Carbohydrate 16g<br />Fiber 0<br />Sugars 2g<br />Protein 1g<br />Vitamins A, C & Calcium 0<br />Iron 2%<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Rice flour, sweet potato flakes, tapioca starch, sunflower, safflower and/or canola oil, organic yellow corn flour, seasoning (sea salt, dried cane syrup, maltodextrin, sweet potato powder, natural flavor, citric acid), sugar, annatto (natural color)<br /><br />My daughter & her friends love this flavor & give it 5 stars; I like it and think it's a little bland. I give it 4 stars. Since I'm writing this review, I'm sticking with the 4 star rating. 4
Local grocery stores don't carry this cereal so I order it. It is full of nuts, raisins, and other great stuff. I cut up a banana in it instead of adding sugar. My favorite box cereal. 5
the coffee tastes good when there aren't grounds in the coffee. i thought first time i made the mistake somehow...i don't know how since you just plop the kcup in the machine, but now it's happened for like 1/2 the kcups...it's terrible and a waste. this has never happened with other ones. i have other ones from different companies and it never happens, just with these caribou daybreak morning blend ones. :( 2
This cereal is difficult to find in the stores so I appreciate being able to purchase it through Amazon.  My husband really likes it and looks forward to the delivering of it every month.  Seems like an unlikely thing to look forward to, but it's the little things that count.  P. Looney 5
Cooking with fresh ingredients always makes your dishes taste, and smell, more delicious!  Highly recommend purchasing these vanilla beans, they arrived vacuum packed and ready to use. 5
I love popcorn, and this product is good except for the fact that it does not and will not give you the taste that you are looking for that you get from movie theaters. Even with the matching seasoning salt, it doesn't do the justice. But its ok,just not buttery at all. 3
It's not bad, as the fragrance just hits you when the bag opens. That being said, way too many stems in the product. I'm not a tea expert, but I've bought enough and I think they have more stems than the average. I do like the eco-friendly no frill packaging with the zipper though. 3
these are typically heavy and sweet, but are the best of the bunch that i've tried, in terms of "live food bars."  i keep them for a "not so totally unhealthy meal/snack" at my office. 4
This particular coffee is a bit strong for my taste. It was worth a try and you certainly get good amount of coffee for the money. 3
Eye Bought This Product On A Recommendation. However, Eye Cannot Seem To Get Past The Strange Taste Yet.  Eye Will Keep Using It To See If This Will Pass Or If Eye Will Acquire A Liking To It.  The Package States No Bitter Taste.  If It Is A Sweetener, Why Should There Be Any Bitter Taste? 3
I ordered these when trying to find a chicken treat that is USA made. For years I had bought the Waggin Train brand.  My dog loved them, but had a diarrhea every time she went "number two" and neither we nor our vet could figure out why.  Finally after seeing the story about chews made in China, I stopped buying them.  Within a week my dog had totally stopped her diarrhea!  She has hardly had it one time since and that was last year.  Back to topic - the bag does say USA made which is comforting, but the chews are very hard and crunchy.  I just rescued a male Shih Tzu and he ate them, but my girl wasn't impressed.  I am still searching for a USA made chew that is not hard as a rock. 3
My dog refused to eat any of these.  I had to give them away.  Beware if your dog is picky. 1
My sodium radar told me to not even try this product, but it sounded good so I did. Ew! A whopping 900mg of sodium in a one cup serving, to go with the 370 calories. It is worth it to take the extra effort to boil whole grain pasta, make a cheese rue myself, then add hamburger. Time-consuming, sure, but way better tasting and better for me. Even my husband gave it a thumbs-down and he is like Mikey from Life cereal commercials! 1
I purchased this holder after seeing it in an open house and I just had to have one. Very well built and engineered. The drawer slides very easy and it holds more K-cups than I expected. Overall, a great design with no disappointments. Definitely recommend buying one since it takes up no more space than the coffee maker itself. 5
I am not a white wine expert but I make plenty of wine.  I enjoy a nice Riesling during the hot summer weather but this one will not qualify.  Don't get me wrong, it is a decent and enjoyable white wine.  Nothing special but enjoyable.  I suspect this will make some white wine slushies and white sangria this summer.  My kids will like it so it will certainly not go to waste.  Buy it for an OK white wine but not for a Riesling. 3
Have been using this product for about a year now. My dog loves these chicken jerky treats. It's a great to be able to treat her with something she likes, as well as adding these needed supplements to her diet. 5
Take care if choosing this food as they recently released a new formula that has more grains and has resulted in the superpoops for my dog that I have been feeding canidae for 2 years. 3
I have been GF for the past year and have tried all sorts of flour alternatives. This one is certainly the best, and the best part about it, is you can substitute it for any creation that calls for original bisquick. The best so far is the waffles that you can make following the directions on the back. I will be ordering again!! My only complaint is that the boxes are small compared to the other boxes of bisquick available on the shelves. 5
I usually drink Farmer Brothers Coffee so maybe that's why I didn't care for this coffee at all. It was very bitter and the vanilla flavoring tasted just like that...a flavoring (and not a good one). I will keep the remaining coffee for visiters who adore the 'bucks but for us, we'll stick to our regular blend. 2
The kids love the hot cocoa and I like the fact that I can get the stuff shipped to me when I need it without worry of order. 4
This "Baby White" popcorn pops small and somewhat hard.  I have tried several batches with various adjustments of heat, using a "whirlypop" popcorn popper.  Unsatisfactory results!  I won't purchase this again. 1
Wasnt happy with this purchase. Coffee was completly stale I guess thats why they price was good, But wont purchase again. 1
This coffee proved to be a really nice treat.  I read the reviews, but gave it modest hope based on pricing. That proved to be a mistake.  The beans are dark and oily and very fragrant.  I used my burr grinder and had to poke at it several times so that the beans did not jam due to their oiliness.  I drink my coffee black with nothing in it, and this made a rich wonderful cup, with no bitterness.  My husband and I went through the 5lbs quickly.  I always have several kinds of coffee from which to choose, and found myself turning to this one more than not.  I'm back for my second bag, and trying more from this brand. 5
i ordinarily eat plain cheerios or oatmeal for breakfast, so trying this cereal was like having a candy bar for breakfast.  that being said, i think this crunch nut cereal resembles honey nut cheerios in appearance, but the flavor is more like that honey smacks cereal.  i thought it was very sweet (but that might be because of what my usual breakfast is), and did not notice any nut flavor at all. 2
Solid British tea.  The two packages are quite big and will last quite a long time.  Took up more space than I exepcted 4
Since being diagnosed with a wheat allergy several years ago, I have been on a mission to find good tasting, wheat free baked goods.  This crust is very good, it just takes a little more milk than the recipe on the back calls for.  I now look forward to making pizza every once in a while instead of it being a complicated chore. 4
My dog craves these...one each morning. She's never had digestive problems with them, unlike the beef rawhide bones which we wont give her. WE couldnt find them suddenly in any of the stores and i was soooo delighted Amazon had them! Right to my door quick!  thank you amazon! 5
Bought this on the recommendation of my son.  Not a big fan of flavored coffee, but a cup a day of this lightly flavored coconut coffee puts me in the islands.  How can you go wrong with Wolfgang Puck? 3
I've tried both the Italian and Colombian Via varities, and while there's definitely a 'Starbuckiness' to both, neither is a substitute for the real thing. However there are times when the real thing just doesn't work, and at those times Via gets just enough things right to make it worthwhile.<br /><br />I'll start out with the negatives. Both varieties remind of drinking from a pot of 'yesterdays' coffee. The kind where you can't finish the pot of coffee and rather than toss it all out, you let it sit and cool overnight and then reheat it the next morning. The next day the coffee is always more bitter and the flavor is flat as compared to a fresh brewed cup. Adding milk or cream helps, but the underlying flavor is still a bit off-putting.<br /><br />Though the worst part about the Via brand is the after-taste. There's something off about it. I don't know quite how to describe it. Almost like a tinge of paper/cardboard taste to it which is a bummer. I find I drink a cup of Via faster than a normal cup of coffee in order to combat that after-taste.<br /><br />Having said all that, I think I'm still likely to continue buying the Via brand. I understand this is instant coffee. I mean I'm tearing open a little pouch (love the design), dropping in some hot water, and I've got coffee. Just like that. That's pretty great. That ease of use, and fairly reasonable pricing means that in circumstances in which convenience trumps quality I can find a place for Via. Camping, too lazy to drive to a coffee shop, otherwise stuck drinking Folgers, quick pick-me-up during a zombie invasion, etc... are a few examples of when a packet of Via could come in handy. 3
Vanilla flavor is barely noticeable.  Acidic taste, not at all what I expected.  Breakfast in Bed and Hawaiian Hazelnut are much better choices. 2
I am really disappointed in these tomatos.  I have purchased sundried tomatos previously from Trader Joe's and loved the zesty flavor they contribute to dishes.  These are very disappointing by comparison. 2
The package was wrapped properly. The cookies were not fresh. They were broken into small pieces. Considering shipping charge, overall the price wasn't worth for these cookies. I wish I had purchased more at the Disneyland. 1
At least half the cans in my last order arrived in a crushed condition; not just dented but caved in. The inner and outer cardboard cartons that they were packed in were not damaged, so the cans had to have been damaged at the time the cartons were packed by the manufacturer, and not damaged during shipping. The can condition was such as manufacturers commonly donate to food banks, knowing that retail supermarket shoppers would not touch them. Perhaps disposing of such product through Amazon.com rather than taking a charitable writeoff is a more cost effective strategy for a manufacturer. Buyer beware when buying products sight unseen. The chicken itself was OK. 3
This is a great product, however, you can buy it in a salumeria in Brooklyn, NY for $9.99.  Frank & Sal on 18th Avenue--Brooklyn. And I'm editing my review because amazon assigned me the profile name "LIAR LIAR." Animals! I was only stating a fact about what a rip-off the site is.  In the future ,Amazonn please don't call me a liar. That's not nice you stupid thieves. 4
When I discovered my sensitivity to gluten about 6 months ago, I was dismayed by most of the horrible gluten-free foods on the market. I have since found some substitute foods that are acceptable to me. Bisquick gluten-free pancake and baking mix is one of them. I use it every Sunday to make either pancakes or waffles. I recommend this mix whole-heartedly! 5
The product I purchased was a gift for a friend. It arrived in a timely fashion. Unfortunately,the safety cap was not secured once my friend<br />received and product. I subsequently notified the supplier and informed them of the problem. They indicated that we should discard the product and they would re-issue a replacement. The replacement product took about eight days to arrive and again the safety cap was not secured. This was not a good gift giving experience.  I chose not to attempt it again.<br /><br />Regrets,<br />H.F. Slayton 2
I normally HATE canned soup but this one is an exception!  Great flavor and the chicken, carrots and rice actually seem 'real' - not imitation or over-processed like all the other canned soups I've tried. 5
Well, The smell was not as bad as Redbull but I still had to hold my breath while I drank it. I have no idea what flavor it is supposed to be but it is tolerable.<br /><br />The definite pros are that it did work well. Each can has two servings, I downed them both after a particularly grueling workout. I'm happy to report that I did feel renewed and my energy levels lifted and kept me going for the rest of the day.<br /><br />I would use this product again - however I might add I would prefer a Full Throttle for better flavor. Also what is it with the Soy? Why is soy in this drink? To what end? So I suppose I should add that those with Soy allergies will/should take a pass on this. 3
I received the hazelnut order yesterday.  The box was wet, some of the hazelnut was leaking and I had to throw out some of the product.  It has been not a good experience.<br /><br />Joyce Kwartler<br /><br />joycekwartler@yahoo.com 2
New design and new awful taste...have been drinking the Eight O Clock French Roast for years and it's now horrible and tastes like Folgers...like light sewage compared to old.  What a disappointment. 1
These pancakes are delicious and healthier then regular mixes. Very Filling all 3 of my children loved them. I daresay once you go Kodiak you never go back. 5
I ordered the chocolate hemp shake hoping that it would be easier to drink (or for that matter, to keep down) than the bulk protein powder, but I was not impressed. The only liquid I seem to be able to get this to mix into without having large lumpy chunks was coffee-hot coffee. I'm not sure what the high temperature does to the protein, so this left me a little frustrated. If you want hemp protein I would actually suggest just buying the bulk protein and dealing with the bad taste. 2
Needed some bulk quantity jelly beans to fill small jars for baby shower favors.  Buying them this way saved a lot of money over buying them by the pound at the local candy store.  As stated in another review, the jelly beans just come in an unlined cardboard box.  This seemed a bit odd, but there were 2 sheets of wax paper, I guess to prevent dust, etc from getting into the box through the top and bottom.  Not much else to say, they're Jelly Belly's at about half the cost of the local guy! 5
I am not a big fan of Starbucks coffee but I have to say this istant one tastes the same as their house coffee they brew. So, that puts it on the highest shelf within instant coffee family by far. It also has the<br />"kick" of a regular brewed coffee due to the microgranuls of real coffee beans in it. Must have if you are on the go or have no coffee maker near you... 5
I bought these chips in May 2009, and they were best eaten by 9/12/2009.  When I first got them, they were very tasty and exactly what I had expected.  I would have rated them 4 or 5 stars then.<br /><br />However starting in early August, there was a definite odd taste that was starting to creep into the chip.  And here in early September they are totally inedible.  My guess is that the oils used have gone rancid in the chip, since they are using natural oils.  Normally this is a very good thing, but the longevity of the product is sacrificed due to it, which is a problem when you are buying chips in 12 bag packages!<br /><br />So if you are purchasing these chips please make sure you are able to eat them quickly, they will not be any good about 1 month before the best eaten by date.  I had to throw away about 5 bags.... 2
This is good smooth harissa.<br />This brand is the most commonly found in France and my Moroccan Grandma was swearing by it.<br />I would get a lot more if the shipping charge were not so ridiculous! 5
To me, fruit juice in small cans are simply a staple - first example that comes to mind is good ol' Dole pineapple juice. The trend towards trendy little "health" beverages in overpriced little cans is nearly tragic.<br /><br />There is nothing about this product that would compel me to buy it. If I want a soda, I'll just grab one. I don't drink enough of them to have much dietary impact and despite the claim of "100% What You Want", there is nothing in here for me. If I want 100% Of What I Want, I will buy a few oranges and some seltzer water. If I want "0% Of What You Don't Want", well, why buy it?<br /><br />This is a time when we had better look pretty closely at what is an indulgent convenience and what is a necessity, and how to find a happy medium. I consider the likes of Pellegrino Aranciata, Orangina and Izze a luxury, and when I indulge it is a true delight.<br /><br />"Switch" is a product that is not better tasting, proven healthier, or even less expensive than any of many other alternatives. Once again marketing is driving product creation and design, and that is a hateful concept.<br /><br />If you want a similar taste experience for about the same price,  pick up some Alka-Seltzer Cold Plus Nighttime- you'll stop sneezing and sniffling and get a great night's sleep. 1
I didn't order from Amazon, but picked up in the grocery store.  Not a bad product, I just wish there was a sugared version of the mix.  "Health nuts" aren't the only people who desire convenience...  Not sure why this pops up in electronics or with an iPhone case picture... 3
I can only echo other parents - I have been buying this product only because of the Iron content shown on the package. My daughter actually hates the flavor, but I was trying to make her eat a pouch every other day hoping it will keep her iron levels high. Very disappointed that this mistake wasn't announced or anyhow made noticable; I found out about it just by luck - was bragging about these pouches and showing the iron information to my parents, and noticed that the last shipment (I have it on subscribe and save) has only 4% of Iron listed on the pouch. 1
I really like these chips and so do my customers. Tangy and spicy chips with a sweet finish.  I look for 2 oz. bags like these. 5
Not much of a lemon flavor for lemon cookies, more on the sweet side.  Coconut is listed in the ingredients, but you certainly won't taste it.  My son liked them, so they won't go to waste.  I would not buy them again. 3
I love coffee, but I also love not having to messing with the coffee maker sometimes.  This instant espresso is the best I have tried and I have tried about 7 different brands.<br /><br />Not overly acidic at all, melts instantly in hot water (no sand dunes left swirling at the top if your cup), travels wonderfully (compact jar) and is very versitile to have around for cooking:<br /><br /> -- I but a tsp. in a batch of brownies to deepen the dark chocolate flavor<br /><br /> -- I put a Tbs in a BIG batch of chili to compliment the spices and add extra richness.<br /><br /> -- I add a bit to mexican mole sauce for punch.<br /><br /> -- I also put it in: chocolate granache icing, chai tea with milk for a java chai latte, coffee drink mixes for extra umph, etc.<br /><br />It is over 5 bucks at some supermarkets, when/if you can even find it, so it is nice to know it is cheaper at amazon! 5
Emerald Sea Salt & Pepper Cashews is a pleasant treat for cashew lovers. The saltiness of the product is a little intense at times, but the taste of sea salt (as opposed to ordinary table salt) combined with some nicely-flavored ground pepper does give Emerald Sea Salt & Pepper Cashews a fairly distinctive flavor... and a good one, to boot. Recommended. 4
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ODRY9I">Wish Bone Fat Free Ranch Salad Dressing, 16-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />This is a great salad dressing...tastes just as good and is as flavorful as the regular 'fatfull' dressing. 5
As a warning - I am not a vegan, I do not hug trees (though I do love them), and I really am not into the whole organic movement (though I have no problem with it).... If my stance on those three "issues" was different, I might love this product... as it is, I found it to be somewhat disgusting.<br /><br />I typically drink Meijer branded chocolate shake mix (Meijer is a western US mega-store & the shake mix is a knock-off of what slimfast puts in a can).  I hoped that this mix would taste at least somewhat (even a little bit) like the meijer brand.... The ways that I described this taste to my wife each morning... well, they aren't good... I'm listing a few:<br /><br />- It tasted like rope<br />- It tasted like licking a wet horses bridle<br />- It tasted like sucking the water out of a wet hemp bracelet<br />- It tasted like someone had mixed dirt in with my unsweetened baker's cocoa<br />- It tasted like chewing on tree bark<br /><br />In all seriousness, the "rope" & "wet hemp bracelet" analogies are the closest... I used to wear a lot of hemp (before doing so was part of the "organic" eating movement I guess?)... and I remember chewing on the necklace/bracelets.  This product tastes just like that.<br /><br />Another note - I was not impressed by the blending of this stuff.  Most shake mixes actually dissolve in liquid; this stuff just sorta clumped into the liquid.<br /><br />On the other hand, I ate (almost) all of it... and it was much more palatable once I mixed it in with the meijer shake mix (2 parts meijer mix, 1 part this stuff).  The fiber content is really high (always a plus).. and it was fairly reasonable.<br /><br />So, if you are into the earth loving hipster movement or are just a standard faire hippy - this stuff might be for you.  For Joe Six-pack (even the liberal type), this product should probably be avoided. 1
When you have Libby's on the label....sorry, the old commercial popped into my head. Libby's products always taste good. I bought this along with some other canned goods. (See other reviews.) I'm working on building up my emergency food and kits and this 12pk of cans fit the bill nicely in quantity, price and expiration date of 12/14. Name brands aren't important to me as price, but this package was a good deal. I don't usually eat canned potatoes. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat these, but in an emergency they will do nicely.<br />The cans arrived promptly in advertised condtion without dents. No issues here. 4
This juice is my favorite (so delicious) but the juice boxes are smaller than I remember. My little kindergarten sister who is very petite needed at least 2 of these boxes in her lunch. I use these boxes to swallow pills and one pill takes 1 juice box b/c these are gone in 3-4 sips. 3
These noodles are excellent. Be aware that they are not Fried Ramen... these are much healthier. This one was a little basic for me right out of the package, but when i have a craving for noodles, I always make them my own when I cook. I added fresh ginger, tofu, broccoli and soy and these were excellent. I am going to try the mushroom next as they seem to be the ones people give the best review for. 4
I did not think coconut and dark chocolate could ever taste bad.<br />I was expecting mainly those 2 ingredients. I was wrong. It's mostly a date flavor and texture with a sprinkle of coconut and a thin chocolate coating. I did not taste cashews or almonds at all. Maybe the folks that are rating these bars highly have acquired a taste for such items. 1
I ordered three packages because the price was so good, then I saw this. I am asking Amazon for a refund - otherwise, they are going in the trash unused.<br /><br />Copied from FDA web site.<br /><br />FDA Continues to Caution Dog Owners About Chicken Jerky Products<br />November 18, 2011<br /><br />The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is again cautioning consumers that chicken jerky products for dogs (also sold as chicken tenders, strips or treats) may be associated with illness in dogs. In the last 12 months, FDA has seen an increase in the number of complaints it received of dog illnesses associated with consumption of chicken jerky products imported from China. These complaints have been reported to FDA by dog owners and veterinarians.<br /><br />FDA issued a cautionary warning regarding chicken jerky products to consumers in September 2007 and a Preliminary Animal Health Notification in December of 2008. After seeing the number of complaints received drop off during the latter part of 2009 and most of 2010, the FDA is once again seeing the number of complaints rise to the levels of concern that prompted release of our earlier warnings.<br /><br />Chicken jerky products should not be substituted for a balanced diet and are intended to be fed occasionally in small quantities.<br /><br />FDA is advising consumers who choose to feed their dogs chicken jerky products to watch their dogs closely for any or all of the following signs that may occur within hours to days of feeding the products: decreased appetite; decreased activity; vomiting; diarrhea, sometimes with blood; increased water consumption and/or increased urination. If the dog shows any of these signs, stop feeding the chicken jerky product. Owners should consult their veterinarian if signs are severe or persist for more than 24 hours. Blood tests may indicate kidney failure (increased urea nitrogen and creatinine). Urine tests may indicate Fanconi syndrome (increased glucose). Although most dogs appear to recover, some reports to the FDA have involved dogs that have died.<br /><br />FDA, in addition to several animal health diagnostic laboratories in the U.S., is working to determine why these products are associated with illness in dogs. FDA's Veterinary Laboratory Response Network (VLRN) is now available to support these animal health diagnostic laboratories. To date, scientists have not been able to determine a definitive cause for the reported illnesses. FDA continues extensive chemical and microbial testing but has not identified a contaminant.<br /><br />The FDA continues to actively investigate the problem and its origin. Many of the illnesses reported may be the result of causes other than eating chicken jerky. Veterinarians and consumers alike should report cases of animal illness associated with pet foods to the FDA Consumer Complaint Coordinator in their state or go to [...] 1
I love this product! BUT the downside is that I was overcharged. When I saw that the cost of this product was $10.00 I assumed that it meant $10.00 for a case. When I received only one can, I was stunned to say the least. A few days ago I happened upon this product at a grocery store. The 8.1 oz was $1.29. I am hereby requesting my change back!!!!!!  Rumford is one of the best baking powders presently on the market!!!  I like the fact that it's aluminum free.  Hence, I will be purchasing this product from the grocery store. 5
This USED to be my favorite breakfast, but now that they've fallen in line with the Nanny State of The Union and forcibly are choosing our lifestyle and food ingredients, this product is crapola, plain and simple. It used to be wonderful but now is not fit to feed my cat. ( I tried but she wouldn't eat it, either ) Worst stuff I ever tasted when it comes to oatmeal. And what is that horrible biting bitter flavor they substituted for brown sugar or real maple flavoring? Smells and tastes like something left in a cranky baby's diaper. Quaker has lost another customer. 1
Review of any product necessarily reflects opinion.  I am not you (whoever you may be, reading this review).  Therefore, you may love this coffee.  I did not.  I gave it four stars because I felt the need to recognize that there wasn't anything wrong with it; it was coffee.  It was drinkable; there was nothing wrong with it.<br /><br />I just didn't love the taste, that's all.<br /><br />I don't know if this taste is a reflection of its low-acid content.  Moreover, if I were to attempt to describe how I perceived the taste, my description could come off as vaguely insulting; worse yet, I should have enjoyed it.  It had a sort of harsh taste, in my opinion, of a type I enjoy in other beverages such as unsweetened tea, particularly lapsang souchong.  Don't know it?  My friends describe lapsang souchong, variously, as smelling and tasting like stinky feet, motor oil, and dirt.)<br /><br />I don't know what it was with this coffee.  Therefore, I warrant that my review may be virtually worthless.  I struggled to find a way to write it such that I could impart some information; the best that I can impart is:  Try it for yourself.  Look at other reviews.  See mine as only one opinion; but honestly -- I really didn't enjoy this coffee very much.<br /><br />So I wouldn't exactly recommend it -- but it deserves a fair shake.<br /><br />Thanks for reading. 4
I really love this mix as the pancakes are so soft and fluffy. Could not tell that they were gluten free. I also made carrot muffins with it and they turned out good. 5
I was pleased with the product's taste and texture, but it didn't make great BMs for me (made them a bit sticky without getting to graphic). I tend to have a sensitive system. I have switched to brown rice because that makes my innards feel better and the BMs better, but it is harder to make sushi with brown rice. 4
I truly love the Rieme Pomegranate Sparkling Lemonade.  DO NOT, repeat: DO NOT order this product online and have it shipped.  I ordered 4 bottles, and 2 of the bottles leaked have of it contents into the shipping box.  It took me 20-30 minute to clean the mess up and salvage the 2 other bottles.  (It would have cost more and been a huge mess to return for credit)  The "unique metal fastener seal" on this bottle is not designed to be shipped FedEx or UPS. BUY THIS PRODUCT FROM YOUR LOCAL RETAILER. 1
Syrup was not terrible, but as other reviews have mentioned, the chocolate flavor is a bit too subtle for my liking. Also, while I love other flavors, this one has a slightly odd aftertaste. 2
I purchased the Kyjen Dog Games Paw Hide Treat Toy.  Labs are exceptionally smart and I try to give mine, Autumn, a variety of challenging toys.  She loves her chew toys but she needs to be challanged.  First of all she found her toy under the tree wrapped and without a treat in it.  How did she do that?  With encouragement we allowed her to open her toy.  I took it away after she examined it.  While she wasn't looking I put a few treats in a few of the compartments.  It took her a few minutes to figure it out.  Next time, no challange at all.  That is why I only gave it 4 stars.  It was too easy, but I think to some dogs it will be great, others fustrating.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043A71PU">Kyjen Dog Games Paw Hide Treat Toy</a> 4
In the past I've enjoyed drinks with Aloe Vera. And I love green tea, so I had high hopes for this drink.  The taste is ok, though the bits of passion fruit make give it a texture that is rather slimy. That combined with the fact a one cup serving has 80 calories, makes this a drink I would have to pass up.  This might not be a problem for green tea drinkers that are not worried about calories, but they might be turned off by the bits of passion fruit floating around in the drink.  Also the price is a bit prohibitive.  It works out to $2.08 per bottle, which seems a bit much for an 11.5 oz drink. 2
I've dipped into my new bag of Chocolate Pirate Booty (eww?) twice, and although my experience has been consistent, it makes for a difficult review.<br /><br />First, the appearance: I won't bring this into work. I'm a brave person who does zany and odd-looking things at work, but the resemblance of this snack to poop cannot be overstated. I just can't bring myself to indulge in this snack in public. Can't do it.<br /><br />Then the texture: this is very, very similar to the cheese and veggie pirate booty snacks. The crunch is the same, less powder gets onto your hands, and it seems to have a bit more oil in it. No complaints about the texture.<br /><br />Now the taste: Um. The first one always tastes burnt and yucky. Then I try a second and a third, the chocolate powder flavor kicks in and identifies itself as chocolate instead of burnt stuff, and I find myself addicted and reaching for the next chocolate doodle without knowing whether or not I actually *like* the flavor. It seems the more I eat it, the more I like it. It's a strange, strange substance and I'm glad I tried it, but I won't know until I'm finished with the bag whether I'll purchase it again or not. It's likely I'll take it in to game night as a gag sometime so we can all have a laugh about poop doodles. (poodles?)<br /><br />I recommend trying it just because it's so incredibly unique, but if you find the appearance off-putting and the flavor incomprehensible, you heard it here first. 3
I cannot understand for the life of me why dye is added to color foods. I was excited to receive this to find out it has dyes and preservatives in it (which is not a good combo). I like to eat foods without these so I will be giving this away to the local food pantry. 2
If you're new to caviar or don't like overly fishy tastes, this is a fine pick. I prefer stronger taste and larger eggs. With better caviars, a little goes a long way. With this, you'll use larger portions - luckily, it's inexpensive enough to do so. 3
I will no longer be giving these to my dog!! They caused my dog to have diarrhea and vomit! When I did some more research online, there were many many posts about how the treats caused their dogs to have similar and even much more severe health issues! My dog loves these treats. I have been giving these to her for about a year or two now. Every once in a while she would have diarrhea or start vomiting a yellow foamy substance- in most cases both, and I finally now linked it to these treats. Do your research before you buy this product!! However, I would not recommend these at all! 1
I split this can with my work associates to get a more balanced view.  A dark coffee fan, a sweetened coffee fan and myself (Somewhere in the middle). All of us agree.  This is a very bitter coffee flavor.<br /><br />The sweetened coffee fan really didn't like this so if you are the type that puts sugar in your coffee - this is probably not the flavor for you.  The dark coffee fan and I enjoyed it more, but we agreed that the dark flavor is full but a little bitter.<br /><br />It's just going to come down to if you like your coffee sweet or not.  Sweetened coffee drinkers are not going to like this much... but if you like stronger coffee this may be just your thing.  This is a very strong flavor for a very bold coffee lover. 3
Purees are not supposed to be this thin.  What a mess!!  I make most of the food for my twins, but bought a few organic pouches to try while we were on vacation for Memorial Day.  I had an assortment of Plum Organics, Earth's Best and a few Ella's Organics.  The Plum are a much more normal consistency AND taste better all around.  I mixed this with Brown Cow cream top plain yogurt (as I have done with all the other fruit pouches I brought for the weekend). This particular packet was so runny it was like spoon feeding them a bottle! Can you say disaster?! Won't buy again. 2
I have purchased this particular item several times (10-12 canisters)and have been somewhat disappointed in at least half of these purchases.  I don't know how the process is done when adding the salt and pepper, but on most of the containers I have purchased, the salt and pepper did not stick to the cashew - hence, just another cashew!  I have waited for months in between purchases to see if the next canister is better - sometimes yes, normally no.  I don't know if I will continue to take a chance on purchasing these really good cashews (when S&P adhere to cashew)as they are rather expensive and I am tired of not getting what I pay for. 4
I enjoy sodas and carbonated drinks, but don't drink too many of them because I'm trying to consume healthier things.  I was sent a can of The Switch through the Amazon's vine program to review.<br /><br />The smell is very strong, medicine-like, and somewhat unapproachable.  The taste on the other hand is very sweet, and it does have hints of the kiwi and strawberry flavors.  It's a little too sweet for my liking, but I am the type of person who drinks juice watered down.<br /><br />As far as being a "healthy alternative to soda", they do a pretty good job.  There's no HFCS (a big plus), and no artificial colors.  On the other hand, all of the juice in it is "reconstituted from concentrates".  The can says it has "natural flavors" which I always consider a dubious term to hide behind on items claiming to be "healthy".  Also, and 8.3 oz can of "The Switch" has 135 calories, while a 8.3 oz of Coke has roughly 109 calories, so this thing is a sugar bomb (even though it says there is "no sugar added".  No kidding!  It doesn't need it!).<br /><br />If you like really sweet things, then this might be a good buy for you.  As for myself, I don't think I'd go out of my way to try this again. 3
I was looking for a good sweet and sour sauce for chicken and based on the reviews, I took a chance.  Well, no one in the family likes this stuff- it tastes nothing like sweet and sour sauce- more like what it says it is- Chili Sauce.  Now I'm stuck with two huge bottles.  Sometimes reading the label is really all that matters. 1
When I received the item, the part of the label with the weight had been torn off which made me suspicious.  I weighed the item on my electronic kitchen scale and the weight including the plastic bag was 4 pounds 14 ounces instead of 5 pounds of nibs as advertised.  I later transferred the nibs to another container and weighed the empty plastic bag; it was .95 ounces so I was shortchanged almost 3 ounces of nibs. 2
What better way to tell your mom you love her by reminding her of her age? This bundle comes with most of the candies from a decade long past. The amount of candy is generous and fun and fairly priced. Bring back old memories with this fun gift. 4
These bags had a lot of overcooked brown pieces. also felt very greasy. Had to keep wiping my fingers on a napkin. 3
I have tried spiced chai tea, but it did not have enough spices. I also tried a mix where you just add water, but they were too sweet. I prefer a stronger spice flavor and I like to be able to control the amount of milk and sugar. So, I usually make my own chai spiced tea from scratch. I get just the right amount of ingredients, but it is a lot of trouble and takes time.<br /><br />Then I tried the Stash Double Spiced Chai Tea. With more spice than most other teas I found the flavor and intensity to be fairly close to my home-made chai. This chai tea is able to maintain the flavor of the black tea with a nice blend of spices that give it a little extra kick with the double-spice. Of course, with more spices comes more bitterness. The way to lessen the bitterness is to slightly increase the milk and sugar. A better way to help cut the bitterness is to use honey instead of sugar.<br /><br />I will still make my own home-made version when I have the time to make it. But, I will also use this Stash Double Spice Chai Tea as an alternative until I find something better. 3
(These'd be ranked 4.5 if possible.)<br /><br />Holy crap, this preserve is amazing~!<br />They taste just like fresh out of the orchard strawberries, with a little extra sugar. If they got rid of one of the sugar sources, or reduced it by a touch, this would be hands down, one of the best fruit spreads I've ever eaten. 4
It works and the taste is very pleasing. I will order again to get through those occasional sleepy afternoons. Works faster than a cup of coffee. 4
Modeled after York Peppermint Patties, these mints are a perfect match of chocolate and sweet.  The honey filling is a bit thinner and sweeter than most mints this style, but you can tell all the ingredients are natural.  The thin layer of gooey honey complements the unsweetened chocolate beautifully.  I highly recommend this tasty treat! 5
We lived in Charleston for years and always loved the availability of fresh seafood - especially oysters!  Now we live about 24 hours away and I do miss being able to swing by the seafood market when I'm in the mood.  I had no idea that I could have it delivered to my doorstep within a couple of days!  It was well packed and smelled as fresh as if we bought it off the boat.  Impress your friends and throw together an oyster pasta dish.  SO much better than the stuff in the small plastic containers at the grocery store!  These were HUGE. 5
My dog loves the greenies but your photo is misleading. Shows the large box and you are buying the smaller bag. I know you state the size in the title so it's ultimately my fault but I unfortunately went off the picture. 3
These just don't taste right.  I think it is the kind of oil they are using.  Best cashews are at Costco.  That's where I'll get them next time. 2
I must say that Vitakraft has put life back into my dog. He is old and Vitakraft offers him more vitamins and minerals than what he was getting from his food. Now he has more energy and begs for these choco drops. 5
Good quality product- medium grain, cook quickly & taste great. Very good value versus buying single packages in the grocery store which even here in the South most often carry instant grits (Yuck!)<br />Cook 'em, add Cheddar & heavy cream with a dash of Tabasco sauce & top with sauteed shrimp for a quick & very tasty meal anytime.<br />Oh yeah they're good at breakfast too! 4
OK.  I admit it.  Cats can be finicky.  They can be very picky about wet food, so I wouldn't write reviews about canned, wet food.  But treats are another matter.  I've tried a lot of treats.  Usually, one of my three cats will eat the treats.  I have one who is picky, one who isn't particularly fussy and one who is a chow hound.  I keep seeing healthy treats and trying them.  I am such a fool!  As my cats started getting older, I worry about their mobility.  I tried some Omega-3 salmon oil and that was a fail.  I tried some of these treats.  Not one cat would eat them.  When I leave food out for them, sometimes it will eventually get eaten.  Not these.  So I gave them to an office mate at work who has two kittens.  Neither of his cats would touch these treats.<br /><br />I can't attest to the effectiveness of these treats.  But if you are looking for a healthy treat, try another brand.  It seems that these treats are disliked by lots of cats.  I'll give two stars instead of neutral three because so many cats won't touch these treats.<br /><br />What's a good Cat Parent to do?!<br /><br />PS.  My cats all like Whisker Lickins tartar control treats, so I've signed up for an Amazon subscription for them since they price is the best.  I think you would be hard pressed to find a cat that does not like the WL treats.<br /><br />PPS. Every one of my cats loves Trader Joe's Tuna for Cats and it was the only food my deathly ill cat would eat for several weeks.  It probably saved her life. 2
This cat food looks and smells a lot like the Fancy Feast premium brand, Garden Medley, that comes in the green cans. (Amazing that Fancy Feast, already an expensive, premium brand, would have an even more upscale variety that's even more expensive.) It almost looks like people food. I have eight cats and two ate it immediately and the other six walked away. In the morning, I would find the bowls empty (this is not always the case with other foods, even when they're hungry, they'll ignore some things). I don't know if others changed their minds, or the two who pretty much eat anything came back and cleaned it up. I can't compare prices with this brand because I have never seen it in any store (I live on the East Coast in Virginia, it must be a West Coast brand.)<br /><br />I was put off by the big Made in Thailand lettering on the box because I lived there for two years and it's not a clean country. I was a little worried about what actually was in this food.<br /><br />Since I don't buy Garden Medley because I can't afford it, and I suspect this is in the same price range, I can't honestly say I would buy it. But if your cat loves Garden Medley, and this is a better buy, then it's a good deal. 3
We have cans of the blue Rockstar in this house. We don't drink energy drinks everyday anymore. I did not care for the taste at all. I'd rather just drink a bottle of Mt. Dew. or 2, in replacement of the caffeine. I am not a fan of any sour, and this to me, was sour tasting. 1
The kernels were small and there were lots of hulls. 98% of the corn popped, no complaints here.I should have purchased  six one pound bags of different varieties, instead of one 6# bag of the same item. 1
I only took a couple sips of this before I decided it wasn't for me.  The first sip sort of burned the back of my throat as it went down, and it wasn't because of the temperature.  The second sip was a little better, I guess I was expecting it, but still too much ginger for my taste buds.  The lemon was sort of an after taste, which wasn't bad.  There were not directions on the package as to how much water to use.  Perhaps it was meant for two cups, or a VERY large mug?<br />  Maybe if it was mixed with tea and diluted it would be better. 1
First let me say my dog loves these, and I want to love them but the quality control on these remains a problem.  Every bad I have bought has at least 3 and often 6-7 chews that are about 3 times the thickness of the rest.  Anytime my dog has had one of the thicker ones, she has always vomited it up several hours later.  I contacted the co about this, and they said they're aware of this problem, and are changing the supplier.  I have continued to buy them and throwing away the thick ones, 10-30% of the bag over a period of several months, and the problem continues.  They are too expensive to throw so many away.  I don't understand why they don't correct this.  This would be a good product if this problem didn't continue. 2
The overall flavor was not bad, but certainly could have had a little more vanilla, I think.  The texture was dry and grainy.  Will not buy again.  I do have to say thank you to B.C. for making the effort.  We need more companies willing to experiment with gf REASONABLY PRICED products.  It's like starting to eat gf.  It takes some getting used to and a lot of practice.<br /><br />Please continue your efforts.  I would love to be able to try an improved version as it would be nice to not have to pay 10.00 for a decent cake mix at the health food store -- which is, incidentally, nothealthy for my wallet. 2
I received this product without any information on who to contact if anything was wrong. The pot was completely cracked & it appears as if 2 of the trees are close to dying. The plant is currently dormant for the winter, so who knows what will happen in the spring, however I know the pot won't be fixed!  I'm disappointed with the lack of customer service & the product for the price I paid. 1
my cat loves this  first time I have found a cat food that he will eat and every time i go in the kitchen he thinks<br />its time to eat 5
I LOVE raspberry, and Pepperidge Farms, so I thought this would be a "no brainer".  However, when I received them they were already a week past the freshness date, and they were very dry.  I don't think I will order again. 2
The mixture of juices they use to sweeten this give it a little bit of an odd taste and makes it too sweet.  It's not a straight orange/citrus flavor.  Not being an apple juice fan I wasn't fond of it.<br /><br />I gave it four stars b/c it is what it advertises - it's juice with sparkling water, unlike some other "healthy" sparkling beverages that are basically soda.<br /><br />For sparkling juice I prefer IZZE - it's a little less sweet. 4
I am a coffee fanatic - drink it day and night, no, coffee does not keep me awake.  I am enjoying the flavor of Emerils bold.  When I got my Keurig it came with a sample pak and in it were two samples of Emerils coffee.  I immediately went to Amazon to see if I could order larger amounts than at the Keurig site.  I am so glad I did as, yes, Amazon had larger paks at a very reasonable price.  This will become one of my repeat orders in the future. 4
Ingredient list: Sugar, Acidity Regulator (including miscellaneous chemicals). No tea whatsoever. $22 for 18 oz. (500g) of sugar with apple flavor. Most expensive sugar in the market!! Health benefit? None! It comes in a square tin with plastic bag inside containing granulated sugar. That's all. Nothing more. 1
frozen and fresh on arrival awsome tasting highly recomend this co.,the lobster tails were as advertized jumbo and tasty,some of the best ive ever had 5
The illusion of nutrition... The ingredients aren't all that wholesome (high fructose corn syrup and corn syrup are the first two ingredients), but these Nutrigrain bars are popular in the office.  3 grams of fat and 130 calories in a bar. 3
The popcorn is good.  I don't like the three pouch package.  It's a pain in the A** to open the oil and the little eity-bity salt/seasoning is worse yet. 4
The first problem I had with this shampoo, was expecting to see something CLEAR poured into my hand, given the name of it. When it came out a pinkish opaque I should have known that was only the beginning. But I proceeded to use it anyway and was sorely disappointed to the point of all out frustration, perhaps anger. I have very long hair, almost to my waist, and it's always been fine/limp, so seeing that this shampoo says VOLUMIZING, I expected it to do that. Instead it went on like conditioner without having used shampoo, and ultimately it felt like I gave my hair an oil bath. I actually had so much oily residue (or whatever that was!) as a result of using this, that I had to wash my hair again with GOOD shampoo (Pantene), to get that stuff off my hair. But in the meantime, while assessing the consequences of using "CLEAR", I found my hair to have zero body or fullness, and it was nearly impossible to get dry, or maybe it did get dry and felt so oily I couldn't tell. Either way, I absolutely hated it. I have been wondering what they were thinking, making a product like this. And as for it being opaque instead of clear, I find that odd, because every other volumizing shampoo I use (Pantene, Dove, Suave, etc) comes out clear and yet does not use that as their claim to fame.<br />Regardless of that, I very generously gave this 2 stars because I am assuming my hair type must be at least partly to blame for my bad experience. I would hope this shampoo is useful for someone that has excessively dry or "wiry" hair who needs the deepest conditioning to tame it or soften it. 2
This tea is something different for the tea lover looking for a non-caffeinated herbal tea. It's ok, but a little like a watered down chocolate drink. It's ok, and I'll finish it, but I don't think I'll buy it again after all my boxes run out, whenever that is. 3
I received a sample of this product in the mail. I really like a good cup of coffee and brew a pot in the morning and often enjoy a mid-afternoon instant coffee.<br /><br />I've bought Nescafe products in the past and been happy, but this particular flavor tastes off. It does have some weird foam at the top of the cup, but in no way does this coffee resemble anything you'd get at a good coffeehouse. I'd rather drink International Coffee than this. Definitely not worth the 100 calories. 2
Well, I was envious when I gave this my dog.  It really does smell good and he loves it. 4
We found this at BJ's before I started shopping on Amazon.  My wife and I were disappointed with it after having tried the Twinings in the sample pack that came with our brewer.  The Twinings is much smoother and balanced than the Bigelow.<br /><br />When I wrote this, Amazon was out of the Twinings and only one vendor was selling it at nearly double the normal price.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5WZ4">Twinings Earl Grey Tea K-Cups for Keurig Brewers, 25-Count Box (Pack of 2)</a> 3
If you are really thirsty this drink will be a welcomed choice, although almost anything would at that point.  However, I did not like this flavor as much as the Switch watermelon strawberry flavor which I found extremely refreshing.<br /><br />The Kiwi Berry is also 100% juice. Although the drink is good, it has a strong syrupy berry flavor which reminded me a little bit of the Robitussin cough syrup I dislike. I also didn't taste any kiwi.<br /><br />At 135 calories for an 8.3 fluid ounce can you might want to drink it sparingly. 3
It's more than a year that I daily feed Dogswell Happy Hips treats to my now 12 year old dog who has arthritis in her hips. Her moves are more fluid now, without the 'stiff' look to her stride because of the glucosamine and chondroitin contained in this product. Plus she looks forward to getting the treats every day (her favorite is the Duck Breast).<br />I also give my dog a Best Pet Health chewable tablet every evening that contains glucosamine, chondroitin, and MSM. These products really do help my arthritic dog a lot. 5
Good firm texture, comparing to other silken firm, this is just the right consistency. Hassle-free, it is easy to come out from the container Tofu shape as is.  Easy to handle and manage rather than crash or smash it. 5
VERY PICKY about my k-cups, some are to sweet or others are to strong.  This k-cup coffee is perfect in the a.m.  It was a great deal and will last us a long time. 4
Seriously, there's a 'do not shake' warning on the can and it's there for good reason - the contents are under pressure so... you shake it at your own risk.<br /><br />As a coffee drinker, I can't say that I'm impressed by this canned Espresso to the point that I'd stop making my own but I suppose that's not the point of the 'illy'. No canned coffee can challenge the flavor and aroma of a freshly brewed cup but when that is not possible, here comes the 'illy' and... it's passable.<br /><br />If comparing canned coffees to canned coffees, the 'illy' espresso is okay as in 'decent' and probably preferable to most other canned brands but to call it 'espresso' is a bit of a stretch. It's got 'sugar' for starters, 50 calories worth of it and I don't know too many espresso drinkers that would tolerate sugar in their espresso drink. And it's not espresso-strong. It's a little stronger than the normally bland canned coffee but maybe only half-way between regular coffee and espresso. As for the taste, this is supposed to be made of 'Arabica' and maybe it is but it tastes more like instant coffee to me. Maybe Arabica-based, cold instant coffee.<br /><br />So... if stranded on an island or anywhere a decent cup of real coffee is not an option or you aren't in the mood or don't have the time to make your own, the 'illy espresso' is an option and at least as good, possibly better than alternative canned or bottled coffees. In other words, "It's Okay" (3 stars) if used as directed and your expectations are reasonably low.<br /><br />________________________________<br /><br />Note: Should this be chilled before use? Ice espresso is an abomination but, again, just because it says 'espresso' on the can it doesn't necessarily make it so. 3
I expected much more from this coffee after reading so many raving reviews.  Im not a novice when it comes to grinding and brewing.. my equipmnet is high end and always clean....but this coffee leaves a very bitter aftertaste.<br />i adjusted the grind and extraction several times..even cleaned and backflushed the machine...but the result is always the same.<br /><br />the coffees aroma and crema are fantastic but the bitter aftertaste kills it.  im sticking to blackcat.<br /><br />i will give them the benefit of the doubt here and speculate that my 2.2 pounds was sitting in jersey city too long.  one could only hope after all the gourmet hype. 2
The idea of these "coffee bags" is neat. Put the ground coffee into little tea bag like pouches in order to make it easy to brew a cup. However, there seems to be a reason almost nobody else does this: The resulting coffee is weak and lacking flavor. I then tried cutting open the little pouches and making my coffee the traditional way using a single serving cone filter. The result was, to my taste, much better.<br /><br />Neat idea, great brand name and probably terrific people behind this effort, but for me the result fell short. Granted, I like a really strong cup of coffee. Others may have a completely different response. 2
These are hands-down the absolute best Salt & Vinegar chips you can buy.  They have a great, strong flavor that has left me addicted.  These are certainly my favorite chips.  I highly recommend trying them! 5
i followed pediatrician recommendations to start with rice cereals and oatmeals etc. mixed with breastmilk. they all seem like sawdust, though. so if you're going to be like me and feed your kid sawdust, this is probably the best sawdust there is with all its DHA and organic goodness. 4
The good:<br />1. This tastes really good to me. One of the better truly low carb pastas that I've tried.<br />2. So easy to cook - it only takes 5 minutes.<br />3. With regular pasta, I dislike al dente because it's usually too firm for my taste but with this, al dente is just right. It's not too firm and not mushy.<br />4. Only 24 grams of carbs + 6 grams of fiber and you get an entire 1.5 cups which is a much larger serving for way fewer carbs than regular pasta.<br />5. The subscribe and save price was very reasonable I felt and it's great to have it delivered right to your door.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />1. Unfortunately this made my blood glucose rise from about 100 to about 150 within about 45 minutes of eating and it stayed up there for almost 90 minutes. Next time I eat this I'll know to exercise within 30 minutes or so of ingesting and I think that might take care of the blood glucose spike. Worth it to have some decent pasta.<br /><br />I'd also like to point out that my husband had a bigger serving than I did and it didn't spike his blood glucose as many points as it did me most likely because he's more muscular and more active than I am.<br /><br />I gave this 4.5 stars because I think it tastes really good, it has a good mouth feel, the price is reasonable and you get a good sized portion. Even though it spiked my blood glucose, I'm still going to keep this on the menu at least once a month. 4
Have bought these in the past with no issues.  I have 4 labs and they love the rawhide bones.  However this last package made<br />every ONE of my dogs very very sick.  Both the young and old got really sick.  WILL NOT BUY THESES AGAIN! 1
I couldn't do without these to keep my energy going and stave off hunger during long runs.  I have tried both the fruit punch and multi-flavor packets, and found the fruit punch to be delicious, but some of the flavors in the multi were slightly unpleasant; I wish I could tell you which ones they were.  Beans are less messy and much easier to eat while running than gels or shot blocks, as you can breathe more easily with a small bean in your mouth than the other items, which are thicker and harder to swallow.  One packet fits into the zipper pouch of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004KQBH52">Fuelbelt Sprint 10-ounce Palm Holder with Pocket</a>, which I also love for longer runs.  My advice would be to find a store that sells these beans in individual packets, and try a few different flavors before buying a bulk box. 4
Delicious pepperoni!  Been buying Oberto since 1961.  Just wish we could find these large packages in the stores. 5
I opened a bag of these chips. I thought I detected a strange odor but put one into my mouth anyway.<br /><br />The chips were definitely rancid. I tried several other bags and discovered the same rancid taste.<br /><br />I threw them all away. Caveat emptor. 1
First ever problem we've experienced with k-cups and it's this Timothy's variety. At least 50% of the cups did not function properly, water for whatever reason/s does not flow out of the k-cup properly. 2
If you want a good cup of coffee and are rushed for time or your household is like mine and you are the only coffee drinker, then you must give this a try. I admit the price is a little high but for that occasional cup it is well worth it. No bitter after taste like other instants 4
i got a bag of these and the veggie sticks. haven't tried the veggie ones yet. the sweet potato didnt taste like sweet potato to me. just tasted like rice flour and cinnamon and brown sugar. tastes like that cereal cinnamon toast crunch. i put the the so called skinny sticks in a bowl and added milk. taste better! 3
The flavors you immediately notice after the first sip of this tea, are hisbiscus flowers and chamoile. The Pomegranate and Raspberry flavors and the green tea are all buried and very faint! If you are looking for a tea to wind down your hectic life, this is not a bad tea at all. If you are looking for an excellent blend of Pomegranate and Raspberry flavors in green tea, you maybe be very disappointed like I do. 2
Stash is a decent brand of tea. We've got a number of their varieties in the house. We only use loose leaf and this doesn't have that tendency you sometimes get in loose leaf to be teeny tiny powder bits. You can actually tell that this was, at one time, a plant.<br /><br />It's got a good mild flavour that is just right near bedtime. 4
Puroast Low Acid Coffee Low Acid Coffee French Roast, sounds delightful for those of us who need to reduce acid in our diets.  I made a pot this morning, very excited to try this new product but found it is a little on the bitter side, and has a slightly over-roasted flavor.  I had to add extra cream to cut the bitterness, and don't think I could ever drink this black.  For those coffee drinkers who like a very dark roast, this may be just the coffee for you, but for myself, I believe I will pass on this one.  Puroast Low Acid Coffee is a really great concept, just not for this coffee drinker. 3
These are awesome and if you know where to find the discount codes they can be super inexpensive.  I love the all natural ingrediants and I actually find them to taste great.  I actually put a little in my older kids oatmeal and they love it too.  I make 90% of my daughters baby food but this great for on the go or as a supplement.<br /><br />My twin niece and nephew who are 18 months old love these as a snack and my sister says they are so great for car rides or trips to the museum.  I highly recommend these over any other baby food product. 5
I was really disappointed when I opened my box of snacks yesterday. This product claimed to be pure cheese and even says it contains no MSG when in fact it has autolyzed yeast, maltodextrin and yeast extract. For those who don't know those are just synonyms for MSG but they hide it under any name they can. Check out the site www.msgmyth.com. 2
This tea is a disappointment because its flavours are weak.  It takes about double the amount suggested to brew a proper pot.  The packaging is green, but that does not make up for the weak tea inside.  If you do not like a strong, traditional bergamot flavour, then try this one.  You might like it, but I did not. 2
The Newman's Own Organics Ranch Style Dog Treats are pretty plain - a brown rectangle (the kids call them ugly), compared to the other dog treats we've purchased at the supermarket.  But the real consumer of this product are the dogs and they love them.  We have two large mixed breeds and one is more finicky than the other (think of them as the Oscar and Felix of the dog world) and they both enjoy these treats (though the treats are small for 60+ pound dogs).  The treats are sized for medium sized dogs (you can always give bigger dogs two) and the nice feature that I like is they come in a rectangle that has a line division down the middle that can be used to break the treat in half if you have a smaller dog.  So while, they won't be winning any awards for attractiveness, they are organic without unneeded additives and the dogs appreciate them as a reward for a job well done or just a treat for being the wonderful pets that they are. 5
I love a good cup of coffee & the scent of it is one of the best parts, from how it smells before brewing to the final product. So when I got the chance to try out the Melitta brand of coffee (something I've seen in some of my local grocery stores) for free, I figured what the heck? What resulted is a cup of coffee that is better than many of the average brands out there, but still not as good as the coffee that I brew at my bookstore job (when I work in the cafe).<br /><br />The scent of this coffee is great, so in that aspect it really didn't disappoint. It's also french press friendly, but then most coffees are. (But I thought I'd mention it since that's how I brewed my coffee.) I like my coffee strong, so I put more than the recommended amount & came out with a cup of coffee that was a little weaker than I generally like it.<br /><br />The taste of this is very good & is better than the Folgers coffee my mother gets (which I can either take or leave), FAR better than the shoddy Aramark coffee that is served at my full-time job (but then anything is better than that stuff), but not as good as the stuff that I make at the bookstore (my part-time job) or the Dunkin-Donuts brand coffee that a coworker makes. (He's got a specific way he makes it.) And compared to the pricey gourmet stuff my dad buys? This is swill in comparison. (But in all fairness, even my precious cafe coffee is swill in comparison. Like I said, my dad buys the good stuff.)<br /><br />Would I buy a bag of this product with my own money? Sure, if it was on sale in my local grocery store. It's a decent cup & I'm curious enough that I'd try some of the other flavors out there. Offhand though, I'd rather spend 8 to 12 dollars on a bag of the stuff at my bookstore job & drink that instead. Before buying bulk amounts of this coffee I'd recommend that any potential buyers purchase a bag at their local stores first. The price for three bags of this is decent (six dollars) since the bags of this go for about seven to eight dollars in my neck of the woods. 3
I did NOT expect this gum to be more than just your typical "lime" flavored "candy" type taste. But I was floored. This gum literally tastes like key lime pie. I swear I can even taste a graham cracker crust. The flavor only lasts a short time, but it's an amazing taste! Floored! 5
This product is delicious.  I will say this upfront - Thou semi messy (why not place the peanut butter in the center??? Instead on the back?)  The taste is great.  So great that I started to eat them all day -- not good as it ruins the enjoyment!!!<br /><br />These are actually so good I had to stop eating them!!! (I guess I over did it!!!)<br /><br />Value:  Excellent snack for everyone (all my friends love them) / family.<br /><br />Shipping:  Fast (as always with Amazon Prime membership - 2 days)<br /><br />Packaging:  6 Boxes Total - each contains 6 individually wrapped granola "thins"  (1/3 of granola bar but flat with peanut butter on one side [seriously).<br /><br />Also do not ruin the granola as I did by eating every day!!! Also I notice to avoid mess just open with scissors!!! (pealing makes a mess!!!)<br /><br />[...]  Exclusively 5
i assumed since Lorann seems to be the market leader in the cake & candy semi-pro flavorings arena, that this would be an excellent product.  I was making a lot of milk shakes with the standard McCormick strawberry flavoring, found in most grocery stores, which worked well but was getting expensive.  I thought this might help me save some money.  Boy was I wrong.  No matter what I did, I couldn't get anything resembling a strawberry flavor.  I couldn't believe it, so I literally titrated the stuff into a glass of whole milk with one tablespoon of sugar added.  Drop by drop.  2-3 drops wasn't too noticeable.  By 9 to 10 drops, there was a horrible chemical mouthfeel, almost a mouth burn.  It was as though I was drinking Kodak film developer or something.  Maybe there was the slightest hint of strawberries, but nobody would have found it palatable. Avoid buying unless you know for certain it will work...I'm giving it 2 stars instead of one because I can't be sure it doesn't somehow become edible after certain cooking or processing steps. 2
I spent close to $4.00 for each cube which turned out to be the 16oz size.  I know it says that upon further review but I was assuming it was the 3lb size because that size is $3.99 at the grocery.  And I just paid the same thing for the 1lb size?!  Shame on you Amazon.  Or better yet shame on me.  The expiration date is fast approaching too so I'm not even sure I'll use these up in a month.  I was very disappointed in the price as well as the expiration date.  I had the same issue with some sunflower seeds I bought recently, they expired before baseball season even started.  However, I did get what I paid for...it's just my mistake for not realizing the size was not what I thought I was getting.  Who would pay that for the 1lb size? 2
Bought four, 2 lb bags and use them to make bread and pizza dough. If you have fantacies of that perfect italian pizza you had  while touring through Italia, this flour is just the thing. The dough even smells slightly better, the final product produces the closest thing to that wonderful crust you can't find in the USA.  It's worth the dough, for the dough. 5
The tea tastes great hot or iced.  Very good for the price.  I recieved the package fast with no problems. 5
This stuff tastes ok, but its consistency is way too thick. If you like whole milk you might like this, but I couldn't stand it. I much prefer Almond Breeze (un-sweetened). 2
The quality of the food has declined drastically.  My 3 cats refused to eat no more than 3 bits of the food.  Looks like a more water downed version of potted meat. 1
This a nice tea chest, but for the price, I was really shocked by the size.  It is not worth the $50 it cost.  I wouldn't send this as a gift again, it's worth half the price! 2
These are great. We were told to stay away from wheat, barley and rye. This is a good answer for us. They a not pre-cut so you have to cut them in to. I recommend them. 5
Great for on the go, but a little disconcerting that its brown. Super handy though as my little one has gas issues so you cant shake her bottles so making them away from home is difficult & this makes it a breeze. Just wish they came in 4-8oz bottles. 4
The taste although very sweet is closer to a molasses taste than other grade B Maple syrups in my opinion. 2
This is my first time trying these they are very tasty and I would recommend them. That being said, if you are trying to loose weight or simply watching your diet you probably wont want to eat too much of these outside of occasional use it not for the health-conscious. The young ones and even my husband enjoys these they are very very yummy even to eat dry as a snack. The crunchy nut and gloden nut are both very good. 4
This tea is ok but it's not nearly as potent as the original product that was available 5-10? Years ago. 3
My daughter will eat just about any flavor from earths best, incl. Fruits, vegetables and soups. But for some reason she won't eat this one. The consistency is thicker and chunkier than the others. At first I thought it was because she wasn't ready for stage 3. But now that she is 10 months old and is used to eating thicker soups and other foods, she still refuses this one. It tastes fine to me, go figure 2
This is absolutely the best hot chocolate out there. It is not too sweet, so more for adults than for kids. Easy to make. Just add milk. No intense mixing required. Dissolves easily. 5
I bought these for my Daughter because she is not very good at eating healthy food at regular intervals!  These are perfect for her to put in her bookbag and take with her to school so that when she gets hungry or has blood sugar issues she can just eat one of these delicious bars.  They really do taste good for a protien bar - not only do they have a lot of protien in them but they have fiber as well!! 4
Although this seems like a great product it is definitely not minced.  The cans say it is minced but it isn't, it is ground beef.  My cat ONLY likes minced.  Not chunks, not ground.  Although she will eat ground cat food sometimes, it has to be inviting and delicious, yet she just walks away from this.<br /><br />I hate it when the packaging lies about the contents of a product.  The shipping was speedy and the value is great (as long as they deliver what the promise) now I am stuck with food my cat wont eat at all. 2
My dog loved these treats...and I like the fact that they contain all healthy ingredients.  The only drawback, and I didn't notice this when I ordered, that they have to be refrigerated after opening.  That didn't work well for me as I wanted to keep them in my car or my "to go" bag that I take to the sitter. Other than that, they're excellent!! 4
Bought a six pack of these and like using it from time to time...it's a natural way to detox...please be advised start off easy with one cup then work up to two cups a day. I usually do this for about 10 days...then go about 2 or 3 months without this tea and then repeat. All natural. 5
Original review -- I thought I had purchased salt with almonds in it. The amount of salt is RIDICULOUS and very unhealthy. Almonds are a healthy snack but not if they are this salty.<br /><br />UPDATE -- I contacted the company and they provided a replacement. The new bag was perfect, the almonds were tasty and not too salty. It seems that I purchased a bag from a bad batch. The company was prompt at correcting the problem. I originally gave the product a 1 star rating, I'm updating the review and giving the product 4 stars. 4
Our two Shih Tzu pups love Ziggies more than any other treat. We have given them Ziggies from the time we brought them home four years ago and truly, nothing makes them happier than when they hear the wrappers crinkle on these treats.  We give them these special treats when we leave for work in the morning and/or before we head out for a while in the evening.  Often we just split one treat in half to share between the two.  Ziggies aren't always readily available to order in the bulk cube and we've gone to great lengths to find them to keep our pups happy and in constant supply because they really bring joy to their little faces.<br /><br />You can use them to stuff into the rubber Kong things but we don't use them that way - we did when they were little but stopped bothering after a few weeks. 5
Please be aware that this tee from Frontier sold by ABC is non-organic.  I informed ABC about it but the product's 'Ingredient' desciption still mentions organic Earl Grey tea.<br /><br />To be fair they offered me to return the merchandize and receive a refund. 2
You know this stuff tastes really good... once you get it to dissolve. I suppose if you have a food processor and can powder it (as its in sugar-esq crystals on arrival) - or can make a liquid variant. Took off one star for the hassle of having to modify it from its original state for use in cold drinks.<br /><br />That being said, does anyone know if the heat + equal parts sugar / water = liquid sugar method will work with Erythritol? Or will the chemical process be different? 4
Generally I don't buy candy, not even in bulk. So i decided to save some money by buying these candies which are a COMMODITY, that means, same brands that ALL retailers sell all over the country!!!!!! Then I bought a couple of bags here .....THEN yesterday  I saw the same chocolates at a third cost of these prices!!!!!!!!!!! WALMART WILL SELL YOU A BAG OF 95 CANDIES, THE EXACT SAME BRANDS AT $8 !!!!!!!!!!!  I PAID HERE $25 FOR A BAG OF 150, YOU DO THE MATH !!!! THE SAME CANDIES AT A PRICE WHICH IS A THIRD BELOW THAT!!! CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND BUY AT WALMART OR PUBLIX OR WINN DIXIE ....THIS IS THE HALLOWEEN RIPP OFF ... 1
I've only used Shake N Bake for pork a few times in the past and decided to let my youngest (he's 10) give this a try.  While I supervised, he did all the work which to say isn't too hard.  It didn't come with a bag so we used a ziplock 1 gallon size. The product is simple to use and a quick fix if you're looking for something that requires little prep work.<br /><br />The taste is the same as I remember and would have preferred something a little spicier and not so heavily coated.  The pork was fairly tender but the coating does make it a bit messy. I thought it was okay but doubt I'll get it again. 3
I like Kettle chips but was really disappointed with this order because they were over cooked.  I bought a bigger sized bag from Costco and the chips were all cooked perfectly. So I don't know why these were different.<br />Will never buy these chips from here again. 2
Maybe it's just luck of the draw but I found this coffee stale and as bland as Folger's from an old opened can.  Never again for me. 1
Strong coffee with average coffee taste.  In the Starbucks category as I see it. 3
Not sour as some of the other reviewers have stated. I for one could not really taste any sour bits, but it's a fine gummi candy on it's own. Sugar coated, etc. Just wish it was sour, or at least Hairbo made a 'proper' sour gummi candy. 3
I bought a 48 pack of this through Amazon when it was on special.  I normally drink medium blends and stay away from flavored but my wife likes the flavored coffees.  Her favorite is Pumpkin Spice from Green Mountain.<br /><br />What we found is the flavor of this was artificial.  I almost think it tastes a bit like maple syrup.  Too sweet...it would be better with less of the flavor.  I tried making it on the largest cup setting on the B70 but that just waters down the coffee.<br /><br />If you like the flavored liquid coffee creamers, this might be something you will like. 3
I am using this for as a meal replacement for weight loss purposes.  I'm definitely seeing results, however I find it to sickeningly sweet (and I have a sweet tooth)! It's like over sweetened cake batter and I can't even stand the smell. However, my husband likes the flavor and is drinking it because he was encouraged by my results! I'm going to try ordering something other than the Vanilla Ice Cream . 3
I read the reviews on this and thought id get some for my dog and pup.<br />They will not touch it. Even if I mix it with home cooked food.<br /><br />They like the dollar store dog food better than this.<br /><br />Amazon let me down on even allowing this dog food to be sold under their name. 1
AFter reading the only review for this product, I accidentally purchased these thinking it was the actual toy. These are simply the treats made for the toy, not the toy itself. My dog seemed to like them but theres nothing exceptional about them that makes up for the price. 3
To start, I'm a big fan of Blue Diamond brand Almonds. I really like the bold flavors, Habanero BBQ and Lime & Chili. I had never seen the Blazin' Buffalo Wing flavor at the local grocery store so I ordered them here on Amazon.<br /><br />When you first put an almond in your mouth you get the initial hint of buffalo wing flavor but it quickly goes away and then just tastes kind of strange.<br /><br />They aren't bad but they aren't my favorite. Every bodies taste buds are different so you might like them but I don't think I'll buy this flavor again. 3
Our three cats don't like this variety. Probably because of the herring.<br />You would figure thyey would love the fish but I guess has too much of a fish odor. 3
This product is a standard item that can be purchased at any pet store.  The price for this item on Amazon was very good, compared to retail.  The problem was delivery time.  I am used to receiving my purchases from Amazon in two days.  This common item took approximately three weeks for delivery.  I will not purchase from this vendor (not Amazon) again. 3
I've ordered the sugar free Hazelnut syrup from Amazon before and it tasted just as I expected (like my local coffee house).  However, my most recent order (a pack of 3 bottles) tasted like caramel, smells very sweet and has no hint of hazelnut. I thought perhaps is was a packaging mistake since all 3 bottles had the same horrible taste. However, I was told that Torani changed the recipe. If you're expecting a hazelnut flavor, don't order this product anymore unfortunately. 1
Received 5 lb poly bag of gummie bears....very disappointing... they are somewhat hard and difficult to chew. Not like the Haribo Gummi bought at Walgreens in a small package, which were soft and easy to chew. Are these dried out? Old stock? 1
it is not what was expected,flavor is not that great,kind of overpowered by certain spices,not worth the price and shipping cost,Tabasco is probably better way to go 2
This bone is very good for a large dog. My rottie/mastiff loves them.<br /><br />But be careful the Amazon web page says "pack of 5" for 5.99 or 6.99 per bone and I had an order screwed up and they sent me one bone which is in no way near cost effective. Either buy five bones or none at all!! 4
My dog would not eat these bones.  Nor would my cats.  They were so tiny.  Maybe the size of a treat for a hamster or guinea pig.  And way too expensive. 2
very sad to say that this is salty, no I mean SALTY! Will try something else for my son. Annie, please make these less salty and I will try them again. 2
Sleepytime tea is one of those teas that can always be counted on. It's very mellow, with a great taste and smell. Perfect for relaxing after a long day. This is the tea that all other herbal teas should be measured against. 5
I had to order this twice and still have not received it!!! I ordered it the second time on Feb 6 and it says it's in stock but they're not shipping it until Feb 26!!! I am canceling my order and will not shop from these people again!!!! I should not have to wait well over a month for something and then not even be able to contact them about it!!!! 1
I live way out in the boondocks and even the closest little town stores do not carry Liptons' Loose Tea.  I don't want tea bags for both ecological and economical reasons, so the convenience of subscribing to a scheduled shipment at a reasonable price is wonderful for me.  Thank You. 4
I saw an ad for Runa guayusa in Mother Jones magazine and because it is a Fair Trade item and described as less bitter than tea, I thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />It is exactly as advertised - no bitterness, just a little hint of sweetness, and a nice gentle flavor.  Very easy drinking, and it does give a kick of caffeine energy.  I have been a Diet Pepsi / Diet Coke drinker for 25 years because I like their tastes and the caffeine (never could do coffee and tea is too bitter), but I have recently converted to being a bicycle commuter for work and needed to ditch the heavy soda drinks.  This guayusa is perfect - as tea bags, it is obviously lighter than hauling around sodas, and it has more caffeine too.  Better for me, too.  And no bitterness like tea or coffee.  And I'm supporting fair trade small farmers in Ecuador instead of giant soda companies.  The packaging is 100% recycled, 70% post-consumer.<br /><br />This guayusa is as good as advertised, I like drinking it, and I can't think of any negatives.  5 stars.  I'm glad I found this product, it is worth the price. 5
Good for wheat free diets. My son likes them.good choice for kids on this type of a diet.I recommend  them. 4
The plastic packaging is not airtight, so you might want to stick with the cans to preserve freshness. 3
I used to eat this almost every morning. Now it says new great taste but its horrible not even extra brown sugar helps. Change it back please!!! 1
Great stuff first thing in the morning if you need a brain jolt without the caffeine jitters. I get my coffee later in the day for my daily fix but this 5 hour energy decaf definitely clears the fog. 4
This is an excellent candy for those of us who have to limit our chocolate intake.  Each bar is sectioned into six pieces, which helps with portion control--and makes it perfect for sharing!  My only quibble is that it's sometimes hard to get all the waxed paper off the candy, as it's quite sticky. 4
I love hot chocolate, but I found this mix repulsive. There wasn't a strong chocolate flavor and the other flavor notes where far too sweet.  I had to throw it away. I will never purchase this again. 1
Have always loved apple butter not just in PB & J but makes a great glaze for pork and also a touch to apple salad or just plain apple.Have always trusted the Smuckers brand for quality and taste. 4
I dunno how Amazon gets this wrong - this cruddy tea comes with brain-drilling aspartame instead of Splenda. I am almost tempted to apply for a refund here. "Tea" mix is tasty enough I suppose but the cruddy bait-and-switch ruined the experience. 3
These are WONDERFUL -- BUT, the title makes it sound like you get 24 bags that are 8.46 ounces each. NOT SO! Each bag is only 0.35 ounces. The 8.46 ounces is the amount you get for all the bags put together.<br /><br />As I said, these are wonderful! But they are very expensive for the amount you get.<br /><br />I gave them 4 stars because the title is deceiving! If you zoom in on the picture, you'll see the bag says 0.35 ounces. 4
I'm 35yo and I remember eating this stuff for breakfast all throughout my youth.  I loved it.  Loved it to the point that there were days that I would eat it for breakfast and dinner if I could get away with it.  For some reason I stopped eating it.  I saw this and decided it was time start it up again.  I'M SO DISAPPOINTED!!!  The flavor is completely different.  The end product is soupy and letting it sit for a bit doesn't help.  The portions sizes do seem like they might be a bit bigger but that's the only good thing I can come up with.  It might be a healthy choice but I think I'll just stick to my fresh fruit breakfasts.  This is just bad. 1
Product received quickly and just as described.  Packaging was a little ripped up when arrived but no big deal.  One star less as I think this product (not just on Amazon but everywhere) is a bit pricier than it may be worth.  Although, it is obvious that I paid it, I believe they would do better if it was slightly less expensive ($2/bottle would be nice). 4
it was okay. Alot smaller bottles than I thought, however my guests loved them. The wood crate they came in was a little dangerous, because the wood seemed to have come apart and the nails were sticking out. Other than that, Id probably purchase again with diffrent packaging. 3
It is so wonderful to eat Pop Chips.  I am a loyal fan and will continue.  Tasty AND Healthy.<br /><br />/the flavors are good too and pleasing to everyone with their various choices. 5
I was crushed that my fav store discontinued my fav crepes (& the *only* mix I ever liked!).<br /><br />I called Trader Joes Customer Service, they were a brick wall ("Confidential" who the real manufacturer of their crepes were)...My French friend had a brilliant idea to google the ingredients which lead me to this discovery! It also appears others are catching on b/c the Kungsornen crepe mix is sold out all over the web...<br /><br />The boxes from Amazon taste slightly 'barkier" (hard to describe but I am a huge food snob), but it's the exact same ingredients so I'll live with it (ie, wheat flour, no sugar!).<br /><br />Pass the word out there, & if anyone else is as fanatical about this mix as I am, please help me petition Trader Joes to carry it once again! :) 4
Not much to say, other than the product solicitation is all hype! I carefully followed the directions on the packaging of the "mberry Miracle Fruit Tablets" and the results were about as miraculous as one of those potato chips baring the face of Mary Magdelene! Sorry "Believers of Miracles"... this is one that won't make "The Tonight Show"! 1
I've been eating Annie's Mac n' Cheese (not the whole wheat type) since 1994.  Amazon offers a excellent price (around $1.50 per box for certified organic, whoa!) and if I'm going to commit upfront to 12 boxes of mac and cheese, I figured I try to be a little healthier and get the whole wheat type.<br /><br />It is a quality product but it isn't suited to my taste buds.  I am surprised because I prefer brown rice and wild rice to white rice and generally enjoy whole wheat products.  But to this eater, the whole wheat shells were too heavy and chewy.  The watery white cheddar sauce enhanced the pasta's rougher texture and blandness.  (The white cheddar sauce is like an alfredo, and less creamy than Annie's regular cheddar.)  My friends love this stuff, but I think it's an acquired tasted.  If I had known what I know now, I'd have stuck with the enriched white (yet stripped of it's nutrients) shells or at least gone with the regular cheddar sauce.<br /><br />*Update*<br />While still not a full-on fan, I enjoying this product more now that:<br /><br />1.  Tastes much better when cooked 10-11 minutes at sea-level (the box recommends 8-10), the texture is less rough and gummy and is more noodle-y.<br /><br />2.  Adding fresh herbs with the cheese sauce.  It gives a depth to the flavor.  My favorite herb to add (so far) is cilantro (add about 1/3 cup chopped after mixing in the cheese sauce).  Other enjoyable variations were adding 2/3 cup of Italian parsley or 1/8 cup fresh dill leaves. 3
i wish these folks used sea salt...(and i've made that request to them).  however, i appreciate that the ingredients are simple and minimal, although not necessarily gluten free. 4
Great coffee.  We mix it with Godiva chocolate coffee or regular medium roast.  What a treat 5
I have fed the chicken and duck version of these--though now the reviews regarding china I find disturbing.<br /><br />Regardless, the beef liver version of these are not a hit with my pup and seem to be a very odd, plastic texture.<br /><br />The duck and chicken are both great--but I will be investigating the source of the food. 2
I live in a warm climate but have some major air conditioning at work so can sometimes fake the seasons. I was hoping to get a nice herbal tea to help warm me up that tasted and smelled great.<br /><br />This tea only has its smell to recommend it. It smells fantastic, and actually, the tin is pretty neat as well, but when I soaked it for a while it just tasted bland and watered down. I tried adding another bag to see if I had gotten the water amount wrong, but the second bag didn't add any flavor either.<br /><br />If you are looking for some AMAZING hot apple cider, I DO recommend Green Mountains Hot Apple Cider in K-cups for the Keurig brewer. THESE are what fall, and crisp mornings, and old fashioned donuts are all about! 2
I tried Coombs syrup just after Highland Farms and before Chafee Farm's. Coombs had a mildly unpleasant burnt caramel taste that I didn't care for in comparison, though it was fine used in recipes. 3
I received the order in time. I love the flavor of this coffee and I can only make one cup of coffee at a time so I have a fresh cup of coffee all the time. 5
Bought as a Christmas present. Smells like a milk shake. I might have to try it, might make a coffee drinker out of me! 5
I need to increase my nutritional intake due to a health condition.  It was suggested I put this on my popcorn to help boost my health. I toss it with some olive oil on my popcorn and treat myself to some Hawaiian sea salt too.  It isn't "much" but it makes me feel proactive in managing my health.  It is certainly an acquired taste.  It is helping me with my vitamin levels so I am pleased. It is a lot cheaper on so many levels than a visit to the clinic. 3
I wanted to try this product to see what all the buzz was about with the "5 Hour Energy" drinks.  Seemed like everyone is using them.  I had trouble finding them in local stores, so I ordered this box from Amazon.  The price was good and there were no problems with the shipping.  There is only enough caffeine equivalent to one cup of coffee in each bottle.  I'm a huge coffee drinker, so this product did not work for me.  I did not feel any more energy when I needed it and it did not keep me awake or alert.  In fact, I got stomach cramps and diarrhea for several days after using this product.  I'm physically fit and do the P90X workouts. I eat healthy food and rarely have abnormal bowel movements or diarrhea.  As a test, I did not use this product for a week and felt fine with normal bowel movements.  I then used another 5 Hour Drink and the next day, diarrhea again!  It may work for other people, but it did not work for me! 2
At this price, I was expecting 3 bottles; got a nasty surprise when 1 bottle got delivered.  Amazon sells other brands of 3 bottles for the same price that taste just as good. 1
The taste is different than flour for sure, but in a very good way. Just be careful when substituting it in recipes where you're hoping for something sturdy or stiff. When used in pizza crusts, it tends to crumble and you end up with more of a pizza casserole. However, it makes excellent pancakes, and when used in sauces/rousses, it's basically indistinguishable from flour. All in all, the texture takes getting used to but the taste and low-carb formulation are definitely worth it. 4
Too much of the white pith on this orange peel making the product overly bitter and diluting the real good taste of the orange zest. 2
This detox tea tastes so bad that I had to force it down! I thought that it would be a good thing to do a natural detox, but I could hardly get through one box, and had to gulp it down quickly to try to not taste or smell it. It also stained my teeth! I would NEVER take this tea again! 1
While I am happy with the coffee itself, I find the description of this item as "for Keurig K-Cup Brewers" to be slightly misleading.<br /><br />As a recent reviewer points out that these OneCup pods are mesh pouches with a foil top. Twelve of these pods are contained in a sealed plastic bag. Once the bag is opened, the coffee does seem to be more "exposed" to air which raises the possibility that they then go stale faster than a sealed K-Cup.<br /><br />Comments on the previous review said that the coffee has noticeable degradation in quality after 14 days of opening the sealed plastic bag. This seems unacceptable to me because the point of a Keurig Brewer is choice - having to use all 12 OneCups within 14 days limits my ability to choose other coffees.<br /><br />All considered, the company is using this "OneCup" packaging to expand their market to other brewing systems and save the costs associated with multiple types of packaging (and possibly multiple licensing agreements?). They pass this savings on by pricing these cups a couple cents less per cup than K-Cups - the price can be further reduced a few cents with Subscribe and Save. Subscribe and Save was the initial reason why I chose these cups - being a convenient way to keep a steady supply of a "house" coffee for myself and guests. This convenience is reduced by the fact that the packaging is not ideal for maintaining freshness. As noted by other commenters, the solution may be to put the rest of the OneCups into a Ziplock bag and hope that this will maintain freshness until I use up the others - not exactly elegant. 2
I cannot believe how expensive these are!  Even at the local grocery store they are only $.69 per packet, full price.  When you add in shipping, you are paying over a dollar a packet. Outrageous! 1
Our purchase from Das Salt was received quickly, and we have really enjoyed our first taste of gourmet salts. Each jar of the sampler trio has a nice portion of salt and I now reach for them regularly when cooking. Since all of the gourmet salts I researched online seemed a bit pricey to me, I feel like this one is a decent value considering the size of the portions compared to others. I recommend Das Salt and will buy from them again. The only reason it doesn't rate 5 stars is because of price. 4
I decided to try "The Switch" orange tangerine because it was promoted as a drink that is 100% juice, 100% RDA Vitamin C, all-natural and it happens to be carbonated.<br /><br />The taste is like drinking orange juice at first with carbonation and I have to be truthful, at first I wondered if it was an alcoholic beverage at first.<br /><br />But after tasting it, you do taste the combination of the orange tangerine and the carbonation.<br /><br />The drink contains no sugar or corn syrup and no preservatives.<br /><br />Overall, a tasty carbonated beverage with only 140 calories and no fat.  15mg of sodium and 36g of carbs.<br /><br />If you are interested in the beverage that combines the taste of juice and carbonation, give "Switch" a try! 4
I hated the taste and consistcy of these cookies.  Not very good at all.  I tried a variety of josephs brand sugar free cookies and did not like any of them. 1
I have purchased several different herbs/spices from Frontier -- the dill weed, mustard seed, anise etc in the bulk sizes -- and really like the quality.  It is better than what I can get in the grocery stores, including Sam's Club, and the prices are very reasonable.  A lot of them are available with the free shipping option, so that was also a major consideration. 5
This dog toy puzzle comes assembled (which I completely appreciated) and was easy and straight forward to set up for our two dogs. It truly put our Rottweiler's problem solving skills to the test and proved to be quite interactive and entertaining for our German Shepard. Colorful and easy to store, the Star Spinner has been a good addition to our household.<br /><br />This is a social writeup! 4
I bought this product thinking that it would be good for a rainy (or snowy) day. But actually I would rather have cereal than this. It is salty and has no taste at all. Perhaps since I am of Indian origin, I expected something more suited to my palate as I see that most of the others have given this a good rating (and that is what made me buy it in the first place). I have purchased similar stuff from grocery stores and they taste much better so it has to be this product. Definitely, will not buy in the future and not recommend either. Bon Appetit, folks! 1
It works. i took one, 2 minutes later i was trying different things in my mouth. Last thing im trying right now is beer and it taste different and sweat. if your into trying new things give these a try. i read that it wont work on some people but well chalk this as a did work for me review. 5
I liked the idea of something that was in between hot chocolate and chai, but in the end it turns out that I would much rather have hot chocolate OR chai. That being said, there's nothing *wrong* with it, per se. It's reasonably tasty, dissolves well, has a nice mouthfeel for a "just add water" mix, and a good level of sweetness (if you're looking for a hot-chocolate-like "treat"). I'd try Big Train's other offerings, but before getting this one, you might want to ask yourself if you'd do better to just have some hot chocolate and chai mixes on hand so that you can drink what you're actually wanting rather than some halfway concoction. 3
Not bad but I found it has more of a "carob" flavor than the rich chocolate taste of the Gluten Free Pantry Chocolate Truffle Brownie mix.  I am a chocolate-lover and this product was a disappointment to my taste buds.  I tried it because I love Pamela's baking mix.  I went back to the Chocolate Truffle Brownie Mix - far superior taste and texture. 3
Guys,<br />Check the sucrose content on this one. Very unhealthy. My baby started having green poop as soon as she got on this formula. After 2 months of guessing we shifted her to another brand -- lactose free and it turned yellow in 2 days. Stay away from this stuff. 1
The tea is good (for non-steeped) but my last order had several pods with loose/compromised foil tops which means it explodes in the Keurig and tea spurts out dispenser. 3
Ordered this type of tea because I saw on Dr. Oz's website that this tea supposedly helps with cravings if you drink it in the afternoon. The taste is bad, horrible!  I had to add some honey to makeit taste a bit better.  Tried this for 4 days in a row and it didn't aid in cravings, cravings as in food cravings. This tea sucks. I also read on other websites that if consumed long term, may have side affects. Discontinuing this tea for sure. 1
The coffee is overall OK.  I had to make it strong for it to taste good. When made weak it wasn't very good. My spouse didn't like it however I made it (personal taste). I used whole beans in a Breville YouBrew grinder/coffee maker. I'm glad that I tried it as Kona blend is suppose to be very good. Three stars! 3
Because I like sweet potatoe fries, I thought I would like these.  But, I found them to lack flavor.  There is just a bit of a bitter taste to them.  They may be better for you than potato chips, but they just don't give the same satisfaction.  However, they are not very salty and are in a 100 calorie pack which makes them healthier for you. I thought maybe it was just me, so I had my husband and sister try them.  They each gave them a 2.5 rating.  My sister said they were a bit bland.  Hubby said they weren't too bad.  But, none of us are excited about eating another bag. 2
Not sure if this was AUTHENTIC Cosmic Catnip, as it had a lot more larger bits of stems and coarse material. My cats had loved this stuff when I had gotten a small sample from a local pet store. So, I thought it would be a great idea to get this larger size, but the catnip was not the same. My cats barely like this stuff and it even hurts my fingers when I pinch it to release the aroma. Would not recommend this 3 oz size! 2
If you are used to buying the Piggy Twists that are about the size of fat cigars, these are not them.  These come 20 to a pack, but the individual twist is about as wide as a regular drinking straw, and 2/3 as long.  If you have a very small (as in toy breed) dog, they are probably great.  I have two dogs between 50-60 lbs., and these are barely worth pulling out of the bag.<br /><br />UPDATE:  After using all the piggy twists (because I'd bought them), we are now used to this size and actually prefer them to the big cigar-like ones because they don't make such a mess.  I still think they are made for tiny dogs, but they will keep a 50-60 lb dog occupied for a while, too.  Just realize what size you are getting with this purchase, because the product picture does not make it clear. 3
I bought this to keep in the bathroom to use on my skin and scalp knowing I would have to warm it up before each use. What I was not prepared for was the smell. Worse than toasted coconut, it smells burnt. Totally unacceptable, no matter what the benefit! I have not been able to bring myself to even put it on my skin, so I'm hoping Amazon will take it back. 1
Just recently purchase as I like the soda taste but not the amount of sugar in Soda.  Have tried all flavors and regardless of soda, they all have the DIET aftertaste.  If you suffer from migrains (as I do) the artificial sweetener used in the soda syrups will only cause more pain and surprisingly quickly.  There truely needs to be an alternative to the artificial sweetner for this to be a soda substitute. 2
This would have been a winner if my cat's would have like it, They will eat a little of it then walk away leaveing the rest. I like that it had quality ingredients and the price is very reasonable compaired to other quality cat food. I wish my cats would like the good stuff this is the third quality cat food I have purchased and its the only one of the 3 that my cats would even touch. 4
I consider myself something of a chocolate connoisseur, I love it and have tried many different types and forms of chocolate at quite a few "tastings".<br /><br />I had hopes that this chocolate would be divine.  It wasn't.  It tasted waxy and strangely, not all that chocolate'y.  It was also shockingly small after seeing the caloric content -300+ calories in a bar barely the size of my iPhone!<br /><br />Since I work on a system of "worth the calories or not" when it comes to sweets...I immediately placed this chocolate bar in the "not worth the calories" category, and that is why I can't recommend this product.  Seek chocolate cravings elsewhere! 3
I love bold/extra bold k-cups, but unlike some other choices this one was intense, bitter, and far too strong for my palate. I'm really surprised I didn't like this one since I have yet to find an extra bold k-cup that I didn't like.<br /><br />Some other choices I enjoy, in case you also found this way too strong:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002AQ0OS0">Timothy's World Coffee Rainforest Extra Bold Espresso K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO6DM0">Green Mountain Coffee Fair Trade Organic Espresso Blend (Extra Bold), K-cups For Keurig Brewers, 24-count,  Boxes (Pack of 2)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5Y8Y">Green Mountain Coffee Dark Magic (Extra Bold), K-cups For Keurig Brewers, 24-count,  Boxes (Pack of 2)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO7GYY">Newman's Own Organics Special Blend (Extra Bold), K-cups For Keurig Brewers, 24-count,  Boxes (Pack of 2)</a> 2
This isn't the cheesiest of cheddar popcorns, but is has a lot less fat than other brands. 3
We rececived our 50 flavor jelly bellies this week and boy do they taste good. The reason for this has to be because they use natural ingredients to create the flavors. My favorite is Tutti Fruiti (tastes like bazooka bubble gum - go figure). My wife's favorite is root beer. The soda pop flavors are good. My only complaint is the beans arrived all mixed up... is this the shipper's fault - I don't know.<br /><br />So when I saw the flavors scattered across the bins instead of being in each individual compartment I groaned. I even attempted to sort the beans - but gave up after 20 minutes. However, my wife who is much more patient than me spent over an hour to sort the beans and came up with every flavor in the correct compartment except for Jalopeno and Green Apple - which have the same coloring. So watch out when you grab a Green Apple. Otherwise this is a good buy.<br /><br />In conclusion - This comes with a menu for mixing flavors and the kids love them too... 4
I believe the world is divided into two groups: those that eat black licorice and those that don't.  I belong to the first group, which I also find to be superior.  (Just kidding, kind of).<br /><br />I'm always looking for black licorice and cannot get enough of it.  I find licorice from Europe to be superior to that found in the states.  Gustaf's licorice is made in the UK, specifically where, I don't know.  It comes in a huge and heavy 5 lb bag.  It contains a long list of ingredients, including BEEF GELATINE. Okay, that's gross.  It also has Desiccated Coconut, whatever that is.<br /><br />The licorice is not shiny like in the picture, but dull, like a tractor tire.  It smells good and has a nice pungent taste to it.  (The Beef Gelatin perhaps?) It's all stuck together but comes apart easily.  It's a bit soft for my liking, but hopefully it will harden up over time.  Despite the disgusting addition of beef gelatin to my licorice (I know gelatin is from hooves, but do you have to remind me?) I will eat this licorice.  I have uploaded a picture to show everyone how this mass of licorice really looks, just so you don't stock up for parties.<br /><br />Will I order it again?  Probably not.  I want a company to lie to me about where gelatin comes from.  Gustaf is just too honest for his own good. 4
I ordered a set of three cans and they showed up yesterday in perfect condition (no dents).  So far I have made some boiled red potatoes and seasoned them with walnut oil and sea salt.  I also roasted some yukon gold potatoes and english squash with the oil and it turned out wonderful--the walnut oil gives it a great flavor.  I will be giving one can to my parents.  Since my mom is not a fan of olive oil it will give my dad a new flavor to play with in his cooking. 5
I only drink green and white variety of tea (no fruit mixes), however this tea didn't have any taste and was slight improvement on having hot water. 3
I've never been a huge fan of oatmeal in any form. But I've learned to appreciate these instant packets as I get older. They're ready in mere minutes, quite filling, and the taste is not bad--I find Quaker brand far tastier than any generic or store brand I've tried. Maple brown sugar, along with apple cinammon, is among my faves. Add half a banana, and maybe some strawberries, and you have a high energy meal that leaves you feeling full and satisfied for hours. Great for the price and convenience. 3
Ugh, worst coffee ever.  I've been trying to find some good instant coffee that's cheap, but after this one I just gave up and gave in to buying the expensive Starbucks like everyone else.  If anyone has any other suggestions for cheap good tasting instant coffe, please comment below. There was nothing actually wrong with the shipment or product itself except for the terrible taste.  Definitely not my taster's choice though. 1
My husband came across Kodiak flapjacks when he was traveling West a few years ago.  It's not a product we can find around us and we were excited to see that we could purchase through Amazon. The buttermilk and honey version is highly recommended. 5
It does cause you to have more bowel movements.<br />But causes stomach cramps after 7 days and blood in stool.<br />Do not recommend you drink this more than few days.<br /><br />Anybody want to buy some sealed boxes, only used the first one? 1
I had a few handfuls of this, then saw the ingredients. BHT has been clinically proven beyond any doubt to mutate DNA and cause cancer. Educate yourself about it and you'll wonder how could any company put a wonderful food like walnuts together with one of the worst ingredients known to mankind. 1
This popcorn was tough and chewy. I have tried other "baby white hulless popcorn" and found it to be quite tender and crispy. I am not sure why this is not. 2
I like many of the KOI products but this one is very heavy on something I can't figure out.  I've read the ingredients but still can't figure out what it is that just doesn't sit with me.  I DO NOT like it.  YOU however, may love it.  I am a HUGE fan of the Butter Chicken Curry.  I NEVER run out of it and use it with chicken, cauliflower, summer squash, oh you name it, I make it.  This one just doesn't do it for me.  Hence my three star.  Still a good product but the taste is somehow "off" from many of their other products.<br />I've rated it 3 stars since the texture, packaging, instructions, etc were all great and my overall success with their other products. 3
I should have picked up on the MSG before I ordered the jerky. That's my fault.<br /><br />The jerky tastes OK. It lacks in freshness and tastes salty in a less than favorable way. Also, in true MSG fashion, the jerky leaves you craving more even when your last bite was not particularly amazing.<br /><br />I'm torn between two stars and three stars. I think I'll stay at three. 3
so so.there was great reviews on product only made it once will try it again 2
On an empty stomach, in a controlled environment, with plenty of water, I felt no physical change to stress levels, at least not the way that you feel an immediate sense of relaxation from Xanax. Like homeopathic medicince (highly diluted), this product is bunk.<br /><br />But it tastes good, and maybe it could have a little placebo effect. 2
I'm not a huge flavored coffee fan. Usually I prefer lattes with flavored syrups. A friend sent me a K-Cup to try and the smell was mouth watering before it even finished brewing. The flavor was strong enough to drink it only with milk; I added a little vanilla syrup when I reheated it. I am not a coconut fan but the flavor is barely there. It is just a unique taste for when you're in the mood for something different! 4
I am pregnant and so far went from 120lbs to 150lbs with 3-5 weeks left. I wanted something natural yet satisfying and sweet to help get me thru without going overboard. No pudge did the trick! They are not identical to full fat brownies, but pretty close. My husband eats them but compared them to a kid cuisine brownie. I think they are much better than that and with only 100 calories and being natural, they are great! 4
The price was comparable to Walmart for same size product.  However these nuts were not as crunchy; and they needed a little more salt. 2
This mustard isn't worth what people say. If you like an exceptionaly creamy and NO taste mustard this ones for you people with no taste. Waste of money. GO find Koops Deli mustard for the best taste. 1
This chai has good flavor but needs more black tea leaves to make a fully satisfying cup of tea. It leans on cloves but not overly, to my taste. The Tazo chai has more tea leaves and tastes very good if used properly -- 2 mugs of tea or an extra large mug from each tea bag. I've gotten used to the Stash spicing now (have enjoyed 6 boxes) and like to drink both the Stash and the Tazo (also finished 6 boxes), which I drink straight, in succession, in the morning. Then I switch to decaf Tazo chai which is very good and makes 2 mugs per tea bag. 4
I've got nothing new to say here; I'll just pile on with the rest.<br />The texture is ... friable. It's loose granular granola. The clusters have de-clustered. This doesn't bother me.<br />The acrid aroma does bother me. It smells like a drying oil portrait. In other words, like rancid linseed. This odor accompanies each spoonful down your gullet. If you care about healthy-eating things, you wonder about the oxidative-stress, anti-health effects of rancid fats as you finish your bowl, because this stuff is expensive and there's no way you're gonna waste it, free radicals or not.<br />Several have commented on the price. Note that it's gluten-free. If you had to eat gluten-free all the time (and I do), you'd be accustomed to this kind of gouging: $6 loaves of bread, $7 frozen pizzas, and now, $6, 11-oz bags (that's about 3 or 4 bowls IRL) of gluten-free granola. "Gluten-free," translated into English, means "Give me your money."  Celiacs' diets are limited to what's available, and a lot of it isn't very satisfying.<br />Fortunately there are many other less expensive and less rancid tasting cereals/granolas available.<br />Because I feel sort of bad for KIND, I will say here that I like their nut- and fruit-based bars very much.<br />[You may or may not be interested in the following: Oats by themselves are gluten-free. However, commercial oats sold on the world market are extensively contaminated with gluten-containing wheat, rye and barley, and are therefore not suitable for a gluten-free diet - this includes grocery store oatmeal and products made with oats. However, in the past 8 or so years, oats have been grown in dedicated fields using scanned seeds, and the crop tested for gluten. These are known in the celiac world as "gluten-free oats." These GF oats cost about five times as much as regular oats, and are the type used in KIND, friable, cinnamon-linseed granola.] 2
In my opinion, this is the best food for dogs.  My boyfriend is an avid researcher, and he concluded this is the bet food for dogs on all accounts - taste (the dogs love it), health-wise (it has healthy fats, and the first and main ingredient is meat as opposed to ingredients such as corn) and digestion-wise (the dogs get diarrhea when they eat human food or any other dog food).  We have two dogs we adopted from a shelter, and while at first, one of our dogs would not eat the food (he had worms though, so who knows what junk he was eating before), he soon began to understand that is what we were going to feed him and very soon, he came to love it.  Now they jump when it's dinner time!  Our dogs are happy, very healthy, have shiny coats, and a large part of this is due to this fantastic dog food.  We get it on Subscribe and Save and we usually go through 1 bag p/ month - for reference, we have one 15lb Bichon and one Alaskan husky. 5
I looked these Halo pumpkin dental chews up on Amazon to see reviews.  I also read the ingredients on them, and found they were wholesome good food products that I would want my dogs eating.<br />  I went by my local animal food store and bought two of these chews for the 25-60Lb size.  One was for my 20lb jack russell who is an avid chewer and the other was for my 40lb aussie/heeler.  Great ingredients.  Since this size has 85 calories a piece, I needed to give only half to the jack.  I gave the jack the half one and the aussie the full one.  Wow, were they hard.  Problem was my jack wanted the whole thing in his mouth while he tried to chew pieces off which he couldn't really.  So I thought uhoh I better get the rest away from him but if he thinks I am coming to take it he will gulp it.  So I distracted him with squirt cheese and took half of the half away.  The aussie promptly gulped the rest of hers fearing I was going after hers too.  So where these were great that they were hard so they actually had to chew on them, maybe not for gulpers.  The dogs seemed very happy with the taste and smell. 3
This candy is definitely not Chick O Sticks. There isn't any coconut surrounding each piece. The candy I received was extremely hard with a very faint taste of peanuts. I would never recommend this candy. 1
I can't figure out why anyone would want to drink this stuff!? The can is 1/3 less in size than a regular can of soda, it's got more sugar and more calories and it doesn't taste very good. It's also a bit expensive for what your getting.......need I say more?......I think not! 2
I bought this because I am trying to drink less soda. This gives you that same soda-ish appeal without all the sugar. In fact it is a little tart so if that doesn't bother you than this is for you. Hope this helps. 3
I have tried 4 times to make cocoa with this product.  Twice it appeared to plug the coffee maker and would only provide about one once of cocoa.  The other two times the product worked correctly.  I do not think it is the coffee maker problem because it has made dozens of cups of coffee with no problems.  So I can not recommend this product. 1
I bought these as a quick snack and because they were on sale. My kids won't eat them because 'they're yucky.' I tried them and indeed they are!<br /><br />They're dry and tasteless. 1
It may have 30 fewer calories per packet than the maple-brown sugar instant oatmeal, but you can really taste the missing calories. I can't even eat it hot anymore, the "apple" flavor is so weirdly bitter and unpleasant. It makes me hate breakfast. 2
These are flexible but also sturdy. I liked it so much in using to freeze portions of baby food, I picked up another. It is great to make your portions and then throw this in the freezer. Once frozen I pop out the portions with ease and bag them for later use. If there is anything you need to freeze (such as portions of stock, or soup) these are perfect for that. A great multi-use product. 5
First of all, these smell awful.  The fake smoked scent stays with your dog long after the treat disappears.  In addition, these are very messy and the color comes right off and stains the carpet. 2
I really enjoyed this candy bar, but then I tend to always enjoy Newman products. I'd have preferred a higher percentage of Cocoa in this, but what here was delicious and a nice little treat. It also helps that the bar is all organic and that Newman donates its profits to a lot of worthy charities.<br /><br />The bar here isn't as good as Endangered Species (Which is what i tend to purchase), but it was one of the better Dark Chocolate bars I've had in a while and it's great to see the Newman's Own company branching out into confectionary. 4
I used Super Gold Luster Dust to create the most exquisite chocolate aspen leaves for the groom's cake at my son's wedding. By using an artist's paintbrush to lightly coat the molded leaves with Luster Dust, the result was startlingly beautiful. In contrast to food coloring, the Luster Dust brushes on easily and imparts a realistically metallic color and sheen. The containers are small but the product goes a long way, making it extremely economical to use. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1933981350">The Step Dynamic: A Powerful Strategy for Successfully Growing Your Business</a> 5
These are pretty good size pieces and are very hard and do not become soft like a lot of similar items.  They taste decent have a mild banana flavor.  This product requires your child to have some molars to be able to chew these up, my 18 month old has some trouble with them and prefers other things much more. 2
My entire family and my extended family (Cousins) love the entire product flavor line. Why have they taken this product out of the stores? Several large food store chains have taken the products off their shelves. Why? 5
My dog **loved** this food. As soon as she smelled it she started barking at me, as I poured it into her bowl. One of my elderly cats even sidled up and tried to steal some of the dog food, and a small food fight erupted momentarily. So for palatability this rates high! I could see this being a successful food for a pet who just normally is not enthusiastic at eating.<br /><br />But let's break it down: the main composition of this dog food? Soy, rice, corn, wheat. If my dog weren't a carnivore, I'd be ok with this. But my dog has allergies, big time, and this food is mostly filler in my opinion. I feed her Blue Buffalo Wilderness (no grain) or else she will develop a bad smell, itch, and have lots of scabs and skin problems.<br /><br />At the end of the day I would recommend this to someone instead of Ol' Roy or some cheap store brand food, but overall I don't like that most of the ingredients are filler grains. I would not feed this unless I absolutely had to. At least I would know that my pets would scarf it down! 3
Nice spice, great taste.  Could use a little bit more chunk compared to other Campbell's chunky products. 4
I have been searching for an alternative juice drink for quite some time and although I find that this product is refreshing, when I order something that is supposed to be LEMON-LIME I expect it to taste like LEMON-LIME!! This does NOT! Why does it taste like apple and something  else??? I don't get why if it says it's LEMON-LIME it should be LEMON-LIME!!! Not a juice filler! Very disappointed in this product. In my business, I have to serve exactly what I say to my customers or I'd not be a Chef for very long!! 2
There are WAY too many flavors going on in this breakfast cookie...at least for my tastebuds.  Whomever was in charge of adding spices really went too far -- to the point that it is actually nauseating.  Obviously, I won't be ordering this one again. 1
The best chocolate that I have ever eaten. Arrived in perfect condition. If there would be more stars - it deserves them all.<br />Love it. 5
After getting used to using product where I live, and with everyone else using it they would run out witin 2 days.  so, now when thry run out, I have my own. You should see the looks on their faces when I still have some.... 5
When I opened the much-anticipated package, it smelled dusty and stale, which should have been my first clue. When I looked closer, I found it was at least half twigs & sticks, and the other half a poor quality crispy dry 'white' tea with moldy-smelling lavender buds.  Tried using it for tub tea...smelled musty there too! From now on I will stick to mixing my own - best I've found is Davidson's silver needle with Harney super blue. 2
The cats will actually eat this. To the best of my knowledge it has no harmful additives. It is a good value, and a decent-sized can. Considering that the cats, like humans, prefer everything that isn't good for them, I am very glad Amazon is carrying it. I need a "subscription" to it. 4
Barbara's has some good grocery items. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. This cereal tastes as if it has too much baking soda and left me with a stomach ache. I hope the folks at the food pantry will like these more than I did! 1
I wouldn't say my twins are picky eater, but they wouldn't eat this one.  They eat just about every Gerber's organics. 2
My dog is a bit of a picky eater and she will eat these but definitely prefers other bones over these.<br /><br />There are 7 bones per pack and each bone is fairly large (especially since she's a 16 pound terrier).  It looks like a cannoli with the rawhide wrap on the outside and bone / peanut butter flavor on the inside. The whole thing is quite hard, I suppose to provide maximum chewing time and teeth cleaning.<br /><br />I haven't noticed whether it actually has helped her digestion as she doesn't usually have problems.  *shrugs* 3
This popcorn has hulls, which I don't care for. It's not labeled as hulless, so it's not deceptive. I just thought for the price it would be - my bad. I only use the whilry pop popper, so this review is relevant to that method only. It produces somewhat light, crispy popcorn of fairly large size with a real popcorn taste. I did think it would pop larger though. It's good for the coated popcorns I like to make. It's not the best I've tasted though. Fireworks makes some delicious, hulless varieties that have spoiled me, I'm afraid. The company ships fairly fast, and the shipping cost is what I'd expect it to be. I'm ruined by Amazon Prime though, so to pay any shipping at all is a drawback; that being said, for this quality popcorn plus the S&H cost, I won't buy it again - simple as that - and for no other reason than that. 4
I'm not sure why, but this is our favorite pancake & waffle mix.  Just tastes the best to us. 5
I love nuts of all kinds, and eat some almonds and walnuts every day. I've tried all the brands of almonds--salted, unsalted, raw, dry-roasted, spiced, cocoa covered, you name it. These are by far the tastiest of all brands and types I've tried. Great texture, a hint of salt...just right. The only problem with these is that they're so delicious its hard to stop eating them. Plus, Amazon beats the store price. Love them... 5
I ordered this product two times now and have been very happy with both the delivery and the product.  It works great for cooking, baking and as a substitute sugar in my Chai lattes. 5
This product costs $2.99/bag at my regular market.  I don't understand why it would cost so much more here, especially when buying 4 bags at a time. 3
I normally buy Mee Chun fermented black beans from a local store (a tiny family run placed called "Nak's Oriental Market" in Menlo Park by Oak Grove). Those have a wonderful strong flavor and nice texture. I thought these would be similar. They are not. They are also NOT like in the photo.<br /><br />The photo makes them look just like Mee Chun beans, but they are not like those beans. They are dryer and lack the flavor of Mee Chun. These are not as salty as Mee Chun, but they do not add to a dish at all. In fact, they detract from it. If anything, the flavor of these is a bad flavor.<br /><br />The little market (Nak's) I go to normally has 8 oz Mee Chun for less than $1 each package (it even used to be $0.69 per 8 oz), but it is not close to me now, so I ordered these from Amazon because all Amazon vendors of Mee Chun charge an absurdly high amount for Mee Chun.<br /><br />Back to Nak's for me. It is worth the trip to get the real deal. I do not recommend these at all. 1
I received Old Country licorice in a gift basket for Valentine's day and fell in love. I ordered it in the 4/ 1 lb. tubs shown here and received it this past week. It is not soft, in fact it is a bit on the tough side. If you are considering making an order, wait for the bags. I do not think that the tubs are airtight. 1
The taste is decent.  Not good, but not really horrible.  If it didn't kick off my reflux, I could live with it.  But, unfortunately, it does, so I can't, so the taste is irrelevant.  I appreciate them trying!  Maybe a dark french roast isn't the best flavor for a low-acid coffee drink though?<br /><br />I'm rating this three stars because I think someone with less severe reflux might be okay with it. 3
Sadly, I quite disappointed with this product. It was definitely not the same tender popcorn I remember. Actually, the popcorn wasn't tender at all and had tons of kernels. I did not feel this sensation but my mother complained that the popcorn made her tongue feel numb. I did experience an odd aftertaste, though. Fortunately, amazon has wonderful customer service and I was able to receive a refund. 2
I had high expectations based on some reviews, but aside from the apple, these were mostly blech and my baby did not like them.  The consistency of the squashes was very pasty, and the peas tasted like powder.  I ended up just using them to sneak extra nutrition in other dishes (the squash wasn't bad mixed with mashed potatoes, but I couldn't put in too much or the little guy was on to me!).  The apple was actually a really nice consistency, a little bit of texture and tasted quite delicious.  I definitely recommend getting the variety pack before launching into a big box of one kind.  It's a great idea, but won't work for everyone. 3
These are very good tasting and very fast making drinks.  The convene e of having a cup of hot chocolate in seconds and have it taste good is such a plus. 5
i was wondering why it was so much cheaper than the other flavors... now I know... my cat wouldnt touch it. He acted like it stunk and backed away.<br />he then went over to eat his day old dried cat food rather than eat this junk.<br />Im concerned that someone wrote it might be tainted and be recalled later. well ill save it in case it does get recalled-maybe then i can get a refund. i dont like how amazon wont let you return food items(unless recalled), especially when they are just unopened cans.<br /><br />alot of people gave it good ratings but alot of people didnt.. I think if you only have one cat like me, the odds are bad... and you shouldnt buy it. 1
There is way to much surgar in this hot chocolate it's like having sugar flavored chocolate, I am going to have to buy some pure powedered chocolate and mix it in the bag, other then that I would say it would taste good if it was not so sweet. 2
I bought this for my teething 5 month old Pitbull and she seems to love it.  Of course, I don't think she quite uses it the way its intended.  She mainly just chews on the bottle but I think she might also be trying to open the end that screws on because she opened it once and got the treats and since then she goes straight to that part of the toy.  Either way it keeps her busy. 4
It's getting hard to find T Discs and there are limited types of coffee.  I like the Gevalia better than the Maxwell House.  Gevalia is not as bitter. 3
I've got 2 cats that love their wet food!!  We figured this'd be a big hit & for the 1st couple cans it was.  My cats are used to your everyday  mushy cat food (Friskies I think), so when we opened this stuff I was surprised to see that this stuff actually looked almost some what edible.  It kinda looked like tuna with peas & carrots, although it was really juicy (seemed like almost half the can was just liquid).  Anyway long story short the cats devoured this food when we first gave it to 'em.  However I must admit the cans were a little small for 2 cats, but a can this size would be perfect for a 1 cat family.  (Here comes the only 3 star rating part)  Anyway, after the 1st couple cans it seemed as though the cats loved it, but then, all of a sudden they just stopped eating it.  I gotta tell you with my cats that's a rare thing to be sure.  Everytime we've tried to give it to 'em since they've completely turned their noses from it.  I can't really say that this stuff isn't good, all I know is that suddenly my cats stopped liking it, your cats might love it.  Granted, my cats are used to the mushy stuff I mentioned earlier, but to be fare they also like canned tuna/chicken (it could just be the big veggie chunks they didn't like, who knows).  I guess in closing, it's kinda up in the air as to whether or not you'll get the most out of your purchase or not, I know I won't ever buy it again, but again your cats might love it, kinda hard to come to a real definative conclusion:(. 3
I bought these along with several other Raggedy Ann & Andy hot cocoas.  The Beary Blue and Pink Hot Chocolate both came with dented cans. I'm not sure if they came from the seller that way or if this happened during the shipping process, but I decided to keep them anyway.  This is the only set of hot cocoas that had a sticker of Raggedy Andy wrapped around the tin insted of it being imprinted on the actual tin. Kids seem to love that it turns blue once it touches the milk or water. 3
My ten-year-old dachshund loves these! How much does he love them? Two weeks ago, he hid under the bed and whined. I took a packet of these treats and began opening the packet, he ran out from under the bed in anticipation and into the kitchen.<br /><br />My miniature dachshund is fed the very best of homemade organic diet (a take on the Spot-Stew diet). He is not a picky eater but will rarely go crazy for treats that are not home-made.<br /><br />The reason I like Newman's Organics is because finding organic lamb to incorporate in my dog's diet is impossible. Finding organic lamb meat is almost as hard as finding unicorn meat. These treats allow diversity in his food (he usually gets chicken, turkey, or tofu with oatmeal or brown rice and a variety of vegetables).<br /><br />The ingredients listed on these treats are organic barley, organic lamb, organic carrots, organic apples, organic palm oil (preserved with mixed tocopherols, a source of vitamin E), organic molasses.<br /><br />The analysis listed on these breaks down as follows: crude protein - 9.0% min, crude fat - 4.0z% min, crude fiber - 4.0% max, moisture - 11% max.<br /><br />I'd definitely say these are dog and owner approved! 5
Quality is OK but if you need maltodextring in larger but not huge quantities, buy Carbo Gain from NOW Foods. Much better bang for the buck. 2
Again, exactly what I ordered. No fuss, no muss. Arrived on time. Pretty much an ideal transaction. Only thing that threw me was that I underestimated the quantity. (gallon baggie in the freezer, ftw) 5
Sent this as a holiday gift to out of state relatives.  They said basket/presentation was nice but the different food items didn't have a large number of pieces per package. 3
Some people want to criticize organic products due to their often higher-than-average cost. I'm not sure I agree with that thinking. Organic ingredients ARE more expensive, and their added cost ensures that you (and your pets) are eating food that meets strict production standards.<br /><br />Is it worth it? Well, consider the source of the ingredients in most pet food. I shudder to think about the junk that makes its way into "food" that you feed to your beloved animals. That's why I'm more than willing to seek out--and pay more--for quality in the form of products like Newman's Own Organics Lamb and Barley New Zealand Ranch Style Dog Treats. What you get for your money is the peace of mind that comes from knowing that your dog will be eating human-grade ingredients, including certified-organic barley flour, ground chicken, carrots, apples, rolled oats, etc.<br /><br />My beagle loves these treats, and I love giving her food that keeps her healthy. 5
The price of this coffee and the fact that it could be a little "earth friendly" convinced me to at least try it. The coffee came packaged as described, so "hat's off" to the seller. But that first cup just didn't do it for me. It's lacking that rich dark coffee taste and the pods leave a residue at the bottom of the cup, so that last gulp just doen't happen. I'd rather fill the little coffee baskets, use a mini-coffee liner and fill it with my favorite coffees than buy this product again. But again, this is a $reasonable$ price for Keurig compatible cofee. 2
WOW!  I have eaten quite a few potato chips in my day. Kettle chips are the BEST non-baked chips I have eaten. I decided to try the sweet onion chips, since I've never had them. I now have a FAVORITE!! If you like onions, this is a MUST buy! I will definitely reorder these, as I mentioned above, they are the BEST I have ever eaten! The flavor is GREAT. 5
I was looking forward to the popcorn and was disappointed it never arrived.  Possibly it is back ordered.  Hoping to have fresh pop corn soon. 1
These are pretty good. In my opinion, they aren't nearly as good as the Teriyaki Beef Steak Nuggets (which are sort of similar), but they aren't bad either. They have sort of a prime rip au-jus flavoring, but you can tell that the meat itself isn't prime rib. It's definitely work a try to see if you like it. 3
The Amazon product info claims they are a certified organic product.  The picture claims DOP certified.  Neither appears to be true.  The cans I received were just "certified", and it didn't say by who.  There is no USDA Organic label either.  I also knew all these things before I bought them since they are well documented in the Amazon reviews already, so I wasn't surprised by what I received.<br /><br />On the plus side, they are better tomatoes than I can buy canned in the grocery stores locally, so I'm happy enough with them, and I used reward points from my Amazon.com Visa to buy them, so they were essentially free to me.<br /><br />Would I buy them again?  Maybe.  If couldn't get any of the Strianese D.O.P. certified San Marzano tomatoes, then yes I probably would.  As I said, they are tasty and I do like them better than what I can buy locally, but they aren't the top tomato when it comes to what I can mail order. 3
I have one cat who cannot tolerate THIS PARticular Fancy Feast Salmon Product. It is only the Shredded one that gets her, but get it does.<br />Everytime she eats it, she throws it up all over everywhere. My shoes, the white rug and gratefully, the tile.<br /><br />She ate this for several years with occasional upsets, but now it is EVERY time. No more for this family. I realize that this occurs on an individual basis USUALLY.<br /><br />But, I also have one younger kitty who is at the "occasional upset" stage. So, if you have a kitty with a tender tummy, I would avoid this!! 2
works well as a rub on chicken<br /><br />also adds plenty of flavor when mixed in to meatloaf<br /><br />has some smoke, not too much fire 4
I'm a big fan of Emerald nuts, just check out my other reviews.  However, I was slightly disappointed in these cashews.  While they're very fresh, there was much too much seasoning, especially going overboard (haha, get it?) with the sea salt.  Furthermore, I question whether real sea salt was used, which typically has larger grain sizes than table salt.  It looks just like regular table salt.<br /><br />However, there is a saving grace for these nuts, and it prevented me from dishing out just 3 stars.  What to do with overly salty, peppery cashews?  Stir fry some chopped chicken breasts, and make Chinese chicken & cashews with bell peppers.  Don't bother adding salt to the chicken- just add in these cashews, and you're good to go! 4
For some reason, I can't find this in the stores or markets in my area, and I can't eat regular pasta, so I as glad to be able to find it this way. I wish I could have ordered a smaller amount, but it is convenient to have in available (in my house) when I want it. 4
Since Swanson's Sun Butter only contains roasted Sunflower Seeds and no other ingredients, it is the only nut butter product we buy! 5
I decided to try these when Clif peanut butter bars and Zbars were unavailable. The chocolate coating on the thinkThin bar makes it seem too much like a candy bar -- and it's messy if the temperature goes up at all. The flavor's o.k., but the texture of the inside stuff is mushy.  I'll be glad to have Clif back in a few months. 3
This is great coffee, you cannot tell that it is decaf.  The flavor is just perfect, well balanced, not burned like Starbucks and makes good crema.  Works nicely with my Jura espresso-cappuccino machine.  I bought two four-packs already and going through my 6th jar at the moment. 5
First I'd like to say that this pepper oil has a GREAT flavor. It is the best ever for seasoning many dishes (including fried rice as noted by another reviewer). Also like that other reviewer all my local stores stopped carrying the product, even the ones that carry other House of Tsang products. So I decided to buy a case here. That was a bad move.<br /><br />Know that with this oil a little goes a long way. The case I got has a 'best by' date of January 2011. From when I received my product that was almost exactly six months. Now I can use a good amount of this oil pretty often, but as I said a little goes a long way. I'll probably use perhaps 2 bottles by the end of January. If I still use up another one, well by that time the rest may not last. Anyway that means I paid about $20 per bottle when shipping is added in. I just can't recommend ordering this product by case of twelve bottles if it only lasts six months.<br /><br />The best thing I can recommend is that since this is a great product, just hound a local grocery store manager into getting it back in stock or find sonewhere to buy single bottles. 2
My kids used to LOVE Quaker Instant Oatmeal. It was a quick way to get them a hot breakfast on a busy morning and still get them to school on time. They started refusing to eat it, and would leave their bowls mostly full and uneaten. They said it tasted "funny". I tried a bite, and sure enough. I thought it had spoiled, so threw out the whole box, and bought a "fresh" box next time I was at the store. Nope, the flavor was terrible in the new box as well. Bad, bad move, Quaker. Go back to the old flavor formulas before you lose this line of business altogether. 1
I like to give good reviews but unfortunately, this time I can't.  This product made my doberman very very sick, Twice!  I thought, the first time it could have been something else.  Then I remember reading the post that said warning don't feed, her lab had explosive diarrhea, well same thing happened to my doberman.  So the second time, I tested it out, gave her two chips as a snack, then the next day, the same thing.  So, that's the end of those chips for me!  I will say, I think it's only for certain dogs as my heeler can eat them, with no problems.  So, it just depends on the dog and dobermans are known for having sensitive stomachs although, no other raw hide chips have ever bothered her in this way whatsoever.  Just want to put it out there, to help give you an informed decision. 3
I had hoped that this would still have a rich flavor without an acidic burn, but it just tasted bland, old, and stale.  I actually couldn't drink an entire cup and threw out the rest of the package I got as a vine member. I typically prefer a rich, strong flavor but often bold coffees have too much acid. This had no richness or flavor. 2
The first time I ordered this, it was great.  After adjusting my grind, it made the perfect espresso with a thick crema.  However, subsequent orders left much to be desired.  Some were OK... Some were horrible... None were great. 2
I was pleased with this jerky.  The price was less than most store bought jerky products which, in many cases, are over a dollar an ounce.  It has a wonderful flavor though it does have more calories than many products, likely due to the brown sugar.<br /><br />This jerky is a little tougher than some but certainly not overly so.  I did notice that in 15 degree weather it was very firm but most other brands are, too.  I just warmed it up and enjoyed the flavor as it softened in my mouth... When stored between 40 and 70 degrees it really was not much tougher than other similar offerings.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this product for flavor and value.  it's nice to have a 12 ounce bag... I chomp through the smaller bags pretty fast.  12 ounces is good for snacks for a few days of camping. 4
I consume about a jar every two weeks of this, either adding it to fajitas or using it as a corn chip dip.  It is hot, but after awhile the medium Salsa Suprema was too mild for me; I thought maybe I'd cut down how much I ate by going to the hot Salsa Ranchera.  It's hot enough that people who aren't used to it will say "That's hot!".<br /><br />Flavor: bright and forward.  The similarly hot Salsa Victoria is a duller taste to me, I guess earthy.  This salsa is much brighter in the mouth.  I don't like to go hotter than this because the sauces I've tried lose any resemblance to yummy salsa and just taste hot (this happens to me with Tabasco sauce, for example).<br /><br />A drawback is La Victoria doesn't make a larger bottle of Salsa Ranchera nor Salsa Victoria, nor do they sell them in [...] or Sam's Club.  To get a good deal you have to watch for sales. 5
The Spearmint Altoids do not taste like spearmintat all. They taste just like the peppermint ones.<br />Someone ought to tell them that there is a difference between peppermint and spearmint.<br />I hate peppermint. I bought these because the tin clearly says "SPEARMINT - New Great Taste" on it.<br />Even for the amount of money I paid, they still should refund it.<br />They suck. 1
Don't order from Faerie's finest, you will be wasting your time. Order your product from somewhere else.<br />Ingredients were not available for shipment when they promised and I kept calling for a status of my order. Every time they told me the same thing: "next week we'll receive the ingredients and after that we'll ship the product". Over an over the same thing until I got tired and I had to cancel my order. The person on the phone was not willing to help or answer my questions. Very frustrating and a waste of time. 1
i was very disappointed by the small size, but i was shocked by the brick-like texture of a bar with chewy in the name.  it tastes good, but the hard texture and small size were not what i had in mind.  i called amazon with my complaint and received a full refund. thank you 1
The soup itself was excellent -- a nice, well-tasting mix of meat, veggies and wild and white rices, but surely a few more chunks of chicken could have been added. I bought it at local grocer -- two cans for $4. 4
I purchased the unfortunately named "Pickle Pocket" from Petco.  My two labrador retrievers have varying levels of interest in treat dispensing toys.  I like the design of this toy as it seems to be indestructable (as much as anything can be called that when you're talking about dogs) yet easy on their teeth.  The toy is about 5 inches long and has 3 grooves that you can tuck treats into.  I put some treats deep into the grooves, and leave others closer to the top.  This keeps them engaged for up to an hour, sometimes longer.<br /><br />Both dogs seem to enjoy this toy very much, so much so that I am going to buy another one so they can each have one.  I paid less than the $20.99 though and $7.99 is a rip-off.  This can be purchased at Petco for around $15! 4
I received a pack of 8 cans of formula. Which 6 were damaged. I paid $80.00 for all but two cans to be partly opened. I  returned items. However, I still have not received new formula. The product is wonderful.I just wish that the delivery and shipping process was handled with care. 1
I bought this on a whim and wow do I consider myself lucky.  It was a shot in the dark, but this turned out to be one of the best hot sauces I have ever tasted.  Not only has some good spicy heat, but excellent flavor as well.  It's an unexpected mix of heat with a hint of sweet, and a very robust mix of spices.  One thing I really love about it is that it flavors whatever you put it on, but does not overwhelm it.  The heat is hot for sure, but doesn't linger for very long.  The flavor is very original.  I went back to Amazon and bought a whole case of it. 5
its ok ... the cardamom is quite present in the flavor... i tried it without milk or sugar yet... but i dont think that will help me to drink the rest of this 1 lb bag... 3
I like my coffee strong/bold, but the jet fuel seemed too acidic--definitely upset my stomach. I had bought the coffee people organic last time, and I will go back to that as soon as these k cups run out. The jet fuel is just not well blended, IMO. 3
Tea tastes great.  Overflows my ice tea maker, but worth it; I guess.  Tazo is better but much more expensive. 4
It tasts fine... But I was expecting a 3 1/2 lb. beef brisket...instead i got five packs of shaved smoked beef. Not bad mind you, but the description clearly leads one to expect a WHOLE beef brisket... I can get sliced meat at the local deli... I was expecting much more.<br /><br />James Hatsis 2
Unfortunately having ordered quite a few of these previously, I neglected to not look for the word: "supreme" in this offer and since I was then receiving free shipping had 4 delivered. We (that is my husband, guests and me)knew immediately that these were different from those previously enjoyed. BUT, currently Amazon featured the "supreme" babka and now I am awaiting to receive these. In the future, I will read more carefully. 1
It is great to have this available as it is gluten free. The taste is okay to good. It does have a taste that I characterize as the taste I expect from a packaged sauce mix. I don't use it as much as I would like to as I can make a better tasting, more satisfying sauce, IF I want to take the time and expend the effort. I don;t always want to take time/effort, so on those times I use these mixes. 3
I meant to pick up the normal Chewy Chips Ahoy and was flabbergasted when I returned home to find that they shoved the word "oatmeal" in the corner of the package but kept everything else the same. I decided to try them anyway and the oats definitely interrupt the normally wonderful chemistry between the chocolate and dough.<br />[...] 3
I've eaten a few of these, and while they tasted interesting at first, I can't bite into one now without gagging.  I'm not a vegetarian, but I was looking for some high-protein snacks so I picked these up.  A vegetarian friend of mine tried one and instantly hated them, calling the taste "disgusting" and the texture "too much like meat."  The taste is not something that grows on you and I can not recommend these to anyone, especially at this price. 1
I would never recommend this item. I made it tonight with some vegetables and it pretty much ruined dinner. The taste is very bland (unlike other brown rice pasta that I've had) and the noodles are so small that they seem to divide and conquer the plate and completely take over. These are thinner than regular vermicelli and probably should just be labeled as an Asian brown rice noodle instead of trying to be an Italian vermicelli noodle. If you're seeking a brown rice noodle that tastes good and has substance to it, this isn't it. Try Tinkyada instead. 2
Cool packaging, great price and very good coffee.  I have tried most of the Kicking Horse blends and this is probably the best.  A little bitter at the finish but overall a great buy. 4
This popcorn does all pop. Doesn't have much taste. I will get the seasoning salt or something and see how it tastes after that. I have poured butter over it but then to me that defeats the idea of diet stuff. 4
I have used this product multiple times.  In fact, I purchased four tubs of the gold and silver luster dust (2 each) five years ago and I am JUST NOW running out!  I use this stuff to gild all sorts of things for Renaissance themed banquets - including gilding an entire roast duck and then, using vodka, painting filigree designs onto it!  The clients thought it was prop food it looked so beautiful.  I can't recommend this stuff enough! 5
As other reviewers have noted, this version of Lea & Perrins' "original" Worcestershire sauce is far from the traditional recipe that's been used since 1838. As mentioned in the product description above, this product contains high fructose corn syrup. I hear Heinz has finally gone back to using sugar in the recipe this year (see the ingredients listing for the US version on the L&P website), but unless and until this product information is updated, I'll assume what's being sold here is old inventory containing HFCS. If in doubt, stick with the bottles with orange labels if you can find them - that is the imported British Worcestershire sauce, and will most definitely be HFCS-free.<br /><br />Good on Heinz for listening to the opinions of their customers, though! 2
I purchased this for my mother who is currently undergoing some powerful chemotherapy. During her first chemo, she hated everything because everything tasted like metal and it was short of pulling teeth to get her to eat something. She called me and asked me to order her this because an oncology nurse that she is friends with suggested it. During her second chemo she ate all her normal foods and actually enjoyed it making the entire process of eating during chemo a small miracle. We were so happy that she was eating because of this that we ordered more immediately! 5
This product is Hackleback Sturgeon roe which is very good. The problem I have with the supplier is that it is over priced. One may<br />purchase this product from Marky's Caviar-- the exact same caviar from Markys for a little over 43 dollars for 2 oz not 64 dollars for 1 oz.<br />The shipping for this product is also outrageous. If you like this product which I did get the most for your money from Marky's Caviar and<br />forget Charleston Seafood. I had even called Charleston and they were not able to  help me when confronted with the facts so poor<br />customer service. 2
I did not like them, they seemed flavorless compared to other brands.  The Byzantine olives are a little more, but are a MUCH better product.  I will likely never buy a Roland olive product again, as I was disappointed with their black olives as well. 1
First off, the tea i received was also very fine cut tea, of average quality. In my opinion the red canned Dilmah Supreme is better than this.<br /><br />I might be able to explain why there are different opinions regarding this product. I have bought dilmah tea for many years at a local Mediterranean store. about three years ago they sold the identical green box with the same fine cut leaves in a vacuum packed bag. then the product changed to a better quality course leaf tea, but the box was nearly identical except for a cellophane pane to show the tea leaves and cellophane bag. then dilmah seemed to stop distributing their Ceylon tea, and only marketed their flavor teas of all things. so i turned to amazon for tea.<br /><br />so its possible they are distributing both forms at different times, since it seems they are a bit schizophrenic about their marketing.<br /><br />for the record i bought mine in Dec 2009. 3
Love this Keurig Coffee; of course when they started offering it in a 50 pack just could not resist!!! You get a real coffee with robust taste and smoothness! Can't get enough of it. We have many Keurigs and even the small one for on the go! This coffee is good all day long! 5
Unlike this company's (not) Pretzel Salt, this product is exactly as described. A great fine flake salt that adheres to popcorn and other foods (french fries) wonderfully! 4
I was hoping these would be a bit more exciting than they were. My son eats everything, but was fairly disinterested in these. I don't really blame him, I tried them myself and was underwhelmed with the flavor. Couldn't detect mango at all in the mango risotto! Organic ingredients are a huge plus though, so I'm glad they exist. 3
I have bought these numerous times over the years as a 'backup' quick lunch at work if the need arises.  Frankly it was my favorite flavor since I tended to vary the noodle flavors I bought over the years for variety.  But this last order convinces me I wont be buying this flavor again.  What once was a good "Peanut Sesame Noodle" is now a horrible "Lemon Noodle with peanuts".  They changed the recipe for the peanut sauce and it's now just overpowering lemon grass. I don't expect fine dining when I get these, but I do expect edible and it's nearly not. 2
LOVE THIS TEA! COULD NOT FIND ANY MORE ! I FINALLY FOUND HERE ! THANKS SO MUCH FOR HAVING THIS AVAILABLE!LOVE THE FACT IT IS DECAF!SO I CAN ENJOY IN THE EVENING! TASTES GREAT !ANY TIME OF DAY! HOT OR COLD! ADD CINNAMON! AND MILK,AND SUGAR (OR FOR THOSE WATCHING THEIR SUGAR INTAKE,ADD SPLENDA OR TRUVIA) FOR A CHANGE.TASTES GREAT THAT WAY TOO!WHEN YOU MAKE THIS WAY YOU CAN ADD ICE AND PUT IN BLENDER  AND CALL IT DESERT! 5
My pediatrician suggested increasing my 3 year old's protein, and try upping the fish. I saw these online and saw they have a ton of protien, and were salmon.<br />They arrived in the mail right away, and my 3 year old is not a big fan. She loves the Plumb brand fruit and veggie pouches and likes to suck them straight from the pouch. It is not very easy to suck it straight out of these pouches. I have been able to cut a small spot on the corner to make it work, but putting it in a bowl and using a spoon made it loose much of the thrill.<br />My 18 month old likes them, but I'm not sure I'll get my older one on the band wagon. 3
I did a lot of research and decided to buy this food for my 4-year-old cat. I had been feeding him Royal Canin but he got fat, so I was hoping this food--without fattening grains--would help with that. (Side note: I only feed him a little bit at a time, he doesn't eat that much. But he still got fat.) When I got this and mixed it in with his old food, he didn't eat it at all, or even consider it. I'm not sure if it's because it's new, or because the kibble size is very small. It falls out of his mouth. Also, compared to the other food, it doesn't not smell very attractive (to a cat, I assume). I can barely smell it at all. While I like that, my cat doesn't seem to think it's food. He did eat some last night, but he still meows at me for the other food when I try to give this to him. He picks out his old food if I mix the two. If only they could make it smell better somehow while keeping out bad ingredients, and make an adult version (bigger kibble size), then I think this would be the best food (based on ingredients). 3
I just made myself a cup of San Francisco Bay Coffee, Rainforest Blend and am very disappointed in the lack of flavor.  I had previously ordered from this company a different flavor and was pleased with that roast which had a strong distinctive flavor. This current order is tasteless. Unfortureately, it is not returnable. 2
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0050OIU4O">Fancy Feast Delights with Cheddar Grilled Turkey & Cheddar Cheese Feast in Gravy Canned Cat Food 24 3-oz canned</a> Have not purchased a case of this yet, because I am still trying to determine which foods Cotton likes.  That means I am still at the stage of buying two cans of something new to see how he reacts, before I invest in a case.  He wants to like this one, but seems to be turned off by the wheat gluten, and possibly the modified corn starch, within.  He was already turned off by the wheat guten in a variety pack I did purchase (B0010B6IFY)  Fancy Feast has been notified. 3
The dog and I disagree.  She loves it; I don't.  The title is misleading it states Grilled Sirloin, but it is based largely around soybeans, corn and wheat -- among the first few ingredients; this typical of most Purina products.  My vet has warned me about potential allergies like corn & wheat.  It also contains artificial colors, such as Yellow 6 and Red 40.  Artificial coloring this has been known to lead to bladder, and/or urinary track issues.<br /><br />Even when I fed her the recommended amount, 1 cup per 10 pounds, she seemed to remain hungry.  I don't recommend as a daily feed but, as a supplement - she gets to gobble it up & I don't have to worry about her nutrition or health. 3
Good strong coffee.  The problem is with the kcups themselves.  In my keurig these are the only cups I've ever had a problem with.  After making my second cup of the morning there were coffee grinds in my coffee cup. Happened a couple of times.  No other brand has done that...might have been a bad batch in my box.  Nevertheless 3 stars for you. 3
Unfortunately, I didn't see the other reviews warning that the image falsely advertises brown cubes and am now stuck with 4 boxes of white cubes that I do not want. Not happy. Amazon, or whoever is the supplier, needs to change the photo so that it correctly displays the white cubes.  I feel like the victim of a bait and switch scheme! 2
I have used Cavender's for years. It tastes great on meat and veggies. I haven't found anything I can't season with it 5
Great idea - no calories, no fat, etc. They are slimey and chewing them is what I'd guess chewing worms would be like. They are firm enough to have more texture than pasta, but still gel like. I just put them with spaghetti sauce, but maybe there's a better option. Have not found it yet. I've read more about them and what nutritional benefits they may have so it makes it worth the try. Cost is certainly reasonable enough. Give them a try and maybe you'll have a better idea. 2
Caramilk bars are soooo good.  One of the pleasures of visiting Canada is getting yourself these Caramilk bars.  Along with Aero and Kit-kat, they are top of the line!<br /><br />If you happen to have read the article from the Food/Dining section of the New York Times, dated July 11, 2007, you will agree that British chocolates (and their commonwealth brethren) are da best! 5
Wish I could get this on auto-ship.  Wonderful product, wonderful flavor and wonderful to be able to have it whenever we want!!! 5
We got samples of this at the hospital & the few times we used it our baby seemed to like it. When we decided to give our baby a formula bottle at night so I could pump & build up supply, we switched to the gentlease formula b/c he had gas & was fussy so we thought it would help. The morning after we gave him the gentlease he was worse. We kept him on it for a few days but saw no improvement. So we switched back to this formula. He has no spit up, isn't gassy or fussy after having it. 4
Nowhere in the description does it mention anything about this coffee being flavored. I'm still not sure what flavor it is. Some type of nut. I wrongly assumed that Jamaican coffee would be similar to the Blue Mountain coffee which Jamaica is known for! How silly of me to assume that! I hate flavored coffees so I was so disappointed to now own 2 boxes of such a horrible coffee. It only says flavored very small on the box so I didn't notice it before I opened it. Hopefully I can pawn it off to visitors and buy some regular bold coffee-flavored coffee for myself! 1
This brownie mix is just ok, not great by any means.  Its more cake like and very crumbly without much flavor.  The next day, they are already very gritty and not worth eating.  These are almost impossible to add frosting too. 2
What a dilemna, delicious, juicy prunes loaded with potassium sorbate, the stuff that sends you running to buy that specialized dairy product with the actor lady on the cover. So, if you want to avoid having the potassium sorbate kill off friendly microbes in your digestive tract, rinse the prunes before eating. (You can't hardly rinse the prunes after eating.) 4
I was expecting some "serious flavor" as it was advertised on the bag.. but compared to other jalapeno chips I've had, it's pretty bland. The ingredients list is short, which is a plus, and it's fairly low in sodium (160mg per 1oz serving) which is probably why I prefer this less, as I like saltier chips. Overall I'd say this is a good choice if you like a healthier version of a jalapeno chip.. but if you like strong flavor like I do, stick with Kettle brand jalapeno chips. 3
when I went to make a larger order of it at Amazon, found it's cheaper and immediately available at the local grocery store ($22.68), though I do have to add tax. (On the other hand, I'm supposed to declare the tax avoided on my state tax anyway.) So, double check on pricing at your local grocery chain, etc. Another problem - turns out my digestive system is allergic to its non-sugar sweetening ingredients. 1
My grandomther boought this a few years ago and gave me some of the flowers. now, a few years later the tea still tastes great but the flowers dont look very nice when they open 4
The quality of the tea is very poor. For this quality of the tea there is no need to buy on Amazon. Any grocery store sells this kind of tea. I would suggest Adagio tea. Or, even better, expensive Lupicia tea, if you can find one in retail store  ( unfortunetely, on Lupicia site there are only cheap teas) 3
I give the Zico mango flavored coconut water 4 stars because that touch of flavor does not do it for me unless I add some Splenda.  The natural flavor Zico coconut water, on the other hand, taste just right, and I give that one 5 stars!. 4
I bought Planter's creamy PB since I'm a big fan of their packaged roasted nuts.  I was hoping to find a tasty peanut butter from Planter's as well, but this product just tastes bad.  First, it looks really shiny in the package.  It does spread well, but it's so oily--and I'm not talking about the natural variety either--that it slides off the sides of the bread.  I suppose this might be related to the fact that hydrogenated vegetable oil is the third ingredient on the list.<br /><br />Second, this peanut butter leaves a bitter aftertaste.  It doesn't really taste right.  I had to take a drink of water after every single bite to get the piece of cinnamon raisin toast I experimented with down.  It wasn't the cinnamon raisin bread I used either because I have bought the same brand--Sunmaid--for years.<br /><br />I do believe I will be sticking with my usual brand of peanut butter from here out.  I've never had an issue with Jif, the brand I typically buy, tasting bad. It's too bad because the price was really good on the Planter's brand. 2
Save your money and do not buy this product. Does not even come close to bacon flavor more like a hickory smoke taste. After everyone in my family tried it we all agreed it was nasty(we're not picky either). 1
Let me start with a few things. I love Nong Shim's Shin Ramyun. I am also a big fan of kimchi. So I thought what could be a better combination than that? So I ordered a case of these from amazon during the back to school sale. I must say I was very disappointed. First of all the noodles are more of the traditional ramen noodle, not the thicker type you get with the Shin Ramyun. (So disappointment #1) Then the flavor of this was not good at all, it wasn't like adding kimchi to a bowl of the Shin Ramyun stuff at all. To be honest the flavor was quite off putting. Now I have a case of these noodles I have no idea what to do with. 2
I liked it fine.  We can buy it around here now.  I'd recommend it to others.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E76570">Kellogg's Special K Cinnamon Pecan , 12.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> 4
I only get these when I forget to order my regular brand (Spectrum); my local GNC has Nutiva. Every bag has had dirt in it and a couple have had other 'foreign' hard objects. I have to look at every spoon as I eat to make sure nothing other than chia is included. I tried to find a better way to clean them, but of course.. water is not an option. I do buy these locally when in a pinch, but I would never, ever order them. 2
The coffee is too strong for my taste and the container does not fit well in my carousol.  Also the price of initial purchase is satisfactory however does not stay that way, which makes it too expensive. 2
I have three dogs.  Two of the three would normally eat just about anything that you put in their bowls.  The third one (a Yorkie), has always been pickey. For the past couple years I had been buying those expensive brands of food that promise "natural ingredients and better health". I decided to try Newman's Own.  None of my dogs seem to be crazy about this food (no disrespect to the late Mr. Newman).  If I mix Newman's Own with another brand, the dogs make an effort to pick out (eat) the "other" food and they will tend to leave Newman's Own in the bowl.  If they are hungry and nothing else is available, they will eat the Newman's Own. I am not here to "knock" Newman's Own.  I am simply telling you my experience. BTW: The food is not old. It does not smell stale or old. 3
I bought this product because my dogs were having accidents in the laundry room overnight.  I'm not sure how or why this works...but it stopped them from peeing.  The dogs love em too. 5
My husband just loves nuts.  We usually buy at various markets but really haven't tried getting them online.<br /><br />These were just as described: crunchy, large, perfectly salted and fried.<br /><br />They were really fresh and delightful.  I wouldn't have tried them if it weren't for all the great reviews and I am glad that I did.  In this case, the reviews are accurate.  You will be surprised at how great these are in contrast to many others that are out in the world or online.<br /><br />Try Royal Oak Peanuts.  Excellent product. 5
My original review was pretty harsh, but after a few months I have gotten somewhat used to these and enjoy them more than I did originally. I will restate, however, that Griottines are much better and have less of a fake syrupy taste and hard chewy texture.<br /><br />I bought these at the recommendation of a local liquor store owner, who thought that they were amazing as far as cocktail cherries are concerned. My past preference has been Griottines, which never seem available on Amazon these days (in the larger, more reasonably priced jars). The Griottines are nice small, tender sour cherries. I would suggest finding those somewhere on line in the larger (10+ oz) size, which is more reasonably priced than the small size, or these Luxardo. Do yourself a favor and seek them out. 3
We have three dogs.  One will eat anything, one will eat almost anything, and one is a picky eater.  Fortunately, the picky eater is the chihuahua.  Part of the picky eating comes from his sensitive stomach, and we avoid chicken and turkey because that consistently upsets his stomach.<br /><br />The first time he was offered Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin dog food, he devoured it with pleasure, and I was ecstatic to have a dry food that got some enthusiasm.  Unfortunately, that enthusiasm was gone by the next day, and he absolutely refused to eat it for two days.  We gave up.  If he'd rather eat the big dogs' food than eat his premium food, there is no  point in spending extra for a more expensive food.<br /><br />From my point of view, the "premium" seemed to be mostly the "Chef Michael" name, as it didn't seem to have any better ingredients than the other Purina foods.  Beef was the first ingredient, but it was followed by soy meal and soy flour. (Can we say GMO?) It also contained chicken by products (a long ways under the soy products, by the way.)  Even salt appears before green beans and potatoes.  It is cuter than regular kibble, but I don't think the dogs care.  It also has varying textures, but once again, even when I let the big dogs try it, they weren't overly impressed.<br /><br />My opinion is that either spend more and get real premium food or save your money (unless you want attractive kibble) and just buy a standard dog food. 2
Just to clear things up, no brand of Baking Soda contains aluminum. Some baking POWDERS do (so check these labels), but not baking soda. The benefits of this brand vs. A&H, for example, is the way in which they are mined. Bob's is mined naturally so this baking soda is in it's natural state (yay). A&H on the other hand uses chemicals during it's mining process. So, yes, Bob's is more natural. No, you don't have to worry about aluminum when buying any brand of baking soda (this label is just a marketing gimmick ... for shame...). Check out: [...] 5
My daughter will start school this fall and i was concerned about lunches and fruit-to-go choices. We've bought several different fruit pouches at a local organic store and she and I loved these the most. It it not overly sweet (and a strawberry variation as well), tastes really good. She can easily eat 2 of these every day.<br />I really like the fact that it has no sugar and color added + it is organic. Just fruit puree.<br /><br />I, personally, don't like banana variation, but it's just because of my own personal preferences (i like fresh bananas more than cooked), other than that, my daughter approved all of flavors to 10 stars. 5
This stuff really stinks. Made me sick for days after using it once. End up throwing the rest away. Do not waste your money on this 1
This stuff is pretty dang hot.  It doesn't have the best flavor, but that is understandable for sauce that comes with a dropper.  Best used for spicing up a pot of beans and rice or chili.  So if you want to try this stuff on a chip or something you better have a half hour or so to deal with the burn...its intense! 4
I really wanted to like this product.  The other reviews were outstanding.  However, no one in our family liked the flavor and mostly the smell of the sauce.  I would rather make my sauce from scratch.  I will not be purchasing this product again. 2
I love chia, but I have gotten two different packages of this brand that were rancid.  The expiration dates were over a year away.  Amazon doesn't allow food returns, and Navitas said I would have to ship them the seeds for them to check before they would send me new ones.  I will still enjoy chia, but I'll avoid this brand from now on. 1
I was doing the 5-6 meal a day thing and trying to get some lean protein in between lectures until I could get some lunch. I work out and eat pretty healthy but was trying to lean up some more but as a college student don't always have the time and resources to cook a bunch of chicken breasts. Overall, these are pretty bad. They have low sugar, and are just about the cheapest protein bars you can get, but I'm 175lbs and these just don't really satisfy any hunger, and in fact only whet my appetite and make me hungry for some real food. I think the cheap price is just not worth the bad taste, and hunger they don't fill.  If you're looking for quick convenient good tasting protein that gives you a little sometime to go on, I would go for some protein powder like Syntha 6 or something, or at least get a little more expensive, slightly more sugary but more filling and better tasting bar like Builder Bars. These can be a last resort if you're just looking to stash them around here and there in case you find yourself without something to eat but you can definitely do better. If you're going to go against my advice, I would recommend getting the peanut butter instead of the chocolate, because cheap, fake, crappy peanut butter still tastes better than cheap fake crappy chocolate, and I've had both, the chocolate is much worse. Also, pair it up with an apple or banana or something to help fill you up a little more and have at least something with some nutritional value in there. 2
Our dog has not figured out how to use this toy.  He loves food and eats it quickly if we put it in his bowl but is not particularly curious and tends to leave things he does not see as his alone.  For instance, he will not bother an open bag of dog food if it is in the pantry and easily accessible to him.  Our dog's brother has a similar toy and figured it out with few demonstrations.  Construction seems somewhat sturdy but it has not had much use in our household to really be tested.  Filling it is a bit of a pain as you have to unscrew the screw at the top.  It's easiest done with a screwdriver.  I don't think you should have to need a screwdriver to fill food but the way this is constructed, if you don't use one, the lid remains loose. You will need a small scoop or a funnel to not make a mess filling it. 3
Add these to some hot water and they perk up really really fast and get huge in size compared to the dried version. More so than the tree ear fungus I am used to using. However, these turn pale brown in color and have a different flavor and a bit softer texture than tree ears I have used before.<br /><br />I do like these, but I miss the tree ears that remain black after I re-hydrate them and keep a higher level of crispness when re-hydrated.<br /><br />The price for the quantity of these is good, but the quality is only B level not A level.<br /><br />I probably would get them again because of the price. 3
I've never been a huge fan of oatmeal in any form. But I've learned to appreciate these instant packets as I get older. They're ready in mere minutes, quite filling, and the taste is not bad--I find Quaker brand far tastier than any generic or store brand I've tried. Maple brown sugar, along with apple cinammon, is among my faves. Add half a banana, and maybe some strawberries, and you have a high energy meal that leaves you feeling full and satisfied for hours. Great for the price and convenience. 3
I purchased this brand as I wasn't so satisfied with the Kernel Seasons cheddar cheese. The reviews convinced me that this was the best on the market. As it is the ingredients and nutritional value are EXACTLY the same, number for number, word for word.. They must be made by the same manufacturer and packaged differently. So to sum it up --I paid $10.81 for 6.14 ounces as compared to buying 6 of the Kernel Seasons which would have come to $13.57 for 17.10 ounces. Big difference, I paid almost 100% more for this product which of course isn't so great either. I feel ripped off but what can I do, you can't win em all. How would I have known if I didn't order the Paragon brand and compare.. This is just my consumer alert to others.<br /><br />This is Aug 20 2012 and I just corrected my previous review. I said I paid almost 50% more and it is really 100% more. Sorry, I never excelled in math. 3
We got our Canned Beef from Amazon around last summer but opened it just now.  It smells vile.  No way we are giving it our dogs.  Not sure if this a variation or do they always smell that bad.  Definitely deleting it from the Subscribe and Save list. 1
Unfortunately these nuts have left me with "pine mouth" it's been about 4 days since eating them and it doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon. Do some research before you buy! I have contacted the FDA on the matter so we will see where that goes... 1
Due to husband's blood pressure, I eliminated salt from my cooking and searched for ways to add flavor without much fuss.  This original seasoning has a nice blend of pepper with other seasonings and is a quick fix for boring rice, bland vegetables, etc.  I use it a lot when I don't have time to make a more complicated dish. 4
this is the best halal beef jerky i have ever tasted. also the company truly gives an Orthodox Muslim a good choice in buying because when you call them to ask about their slaughtering process they quickly give you the answer unlike other Muslim company's who try do deceive the consumer. 5
Are they kidding? Who would name a product this? Really!!! Love the part about preventing it from spurting...LOL! 4
I'm disturbed that these treats, as many reviewers state, are so "addictive." My dog, too, loves them but has now begun to shun her meals and will only eat these treats. In trying to make sense of her current state of anorexia, I recently became aware of the FDA advisory on Dec. 19, 2008 stating that one of the symptoms to be aware of in dogs eating chicken jerky treats made in China is "decreased appetite, although some may continue to consume the treats to the exclusion of other foods." So be very wary of the fact that dogs seem to go crazy over these treats.  Although the Dogswell Company states clearly that their product is not contaminated, and that third party testers have confirmed this, do the owners of the company truly know what's happening in China behind the scenes?  Or who might get paid off to test certain batches of jerky?  I and my vet have been unable to come up with any other explanation for my dog's anorexia, except that it coincides with her increased interest (and now ONLY interest) in Happy Hips since I began treating her with them last spring.  Thankfully, her kidney function is still fine, but if you research this on the web, many other dogs were not so lucky and died due to kidney failure.<br />See this link to the FDA website suggesting caution to consumers in using chicken jerky products from China.  Be informed!  [...] 1
I purchased two cases of Merricks Wingalings and Smothered Comfort. The label states "whole thighs" and "whole wings" but that is a lie. Once opened, the cans have one - if you're lucky two pieces. The rest (3/4 of each can) is processed cubes of who knows what my dog refuses to eat. Merricks should either fill the can with what they advertise - "WHOLE thighs and wings" - plural - or tell the consumer the truth about what they are selling here. 2
i share my muffins with the women in the other trailers on my street. in the rv park in florida. that way i don,t have to bake any ,they bake them for me. a great way to get to know your neibours. 4
These are not traditional udon noodles.. these are flatter noodles and are not as chewy. It's not a bad noodle but it says Udon and it is not udon. 2
the mac and cheese, meat sauce, seems to fit his taste more, so now we got allmost 20 of these sitting on the shelf with all the other ones gone 2
Oreos have gone downhill in quality. Little creme filling and mostly chocolate cookie. Recommend Newman's equivalent, much more filling and great tasting. 3
Very dry, difficult to find that happy-place with this product.<br />I grew up in a Greek restaurant, I know food.........this product have us problems. Maybe missing quality-control, storing issues? Not sure.<br />There's far better products available for the money. 2
Since this seems to be a main concern, I thought I would start with saying that all packages of cookies arrived intact along with a lot of other items I had ordered. Now on to the cookies themselves, they are very good tasting cookies. These taste like real chocolate chip cookies that crumble in your mouth and chocolate in every bite. The flavoring is great for packaged cookie. Yes, I would rather have a cookie home baked and out of the oven. But I will buy these again. I would recommend them for when you just don't feel like baking. For its price, it is the best chocolate chip cookie so far I have had shipped to the house. 4
These taste synthetic. There is a big difference between mashing your own potatoes and the contents of this package. The second ingredient is powdered cellulose and that's what they taste like - something that just can't or shouldn't be digested. 1
Order was done well and without a problem.  Employees like all of the 5 hour energy. 4
This blend makes a very weak tea. I tried it because it was less expensive than the Numi brand Genmaicha. You get what you pay for here. It has none of the depth or flavor that Numi has. I would not recommend this tea. 2
I'm used to cheap tea (by the way, cheap tea isn't low quality), but this one's awful. It tastes like very spicy water.. water with Tabasco added, essentially. Although I did steep the tea bag for about four minutes, there was no depth to the flavor. I finished the cup, but I certainly wouldn't buy it. 1
Good product and decent shipping. However, the price was $15.95 and I later found the same item in a local store for $6.95. What a gouge. 4
This dog food arrived quickly and was packed and wrapped well.  Food was fresh and smelled good which is why I gave it two stars.  However, I will not be buying again.  My dog has had the worst farts since starting this food.  I've had her on it for ten days hoping that she would adjust to it.  She rode with me in the car today and I couldn't get the windows down fast enough.  Whew!  Not recommended. 2
These Honey Stingers are great.  I've used them a handful of times on runs lasting over an hour.  They do seem to provide some much-needed energy.  They're easy to chew, taste great, don't stick in my teeth or make me extra thirsty, and the packet is small enough to be portable.  I really like that the ingredients are pronounceable and healthy enough (organic tapioca, cane sugar, fruit juice, etc.).<br /><br />However, I don't see how they're any different from organic fruit snacks (like Annie's bunnies), which I can get much cheaper in a multi-pack from my local wholesale club.  The ingredients and nutrition information are virtually identical.  For that reason, I gave them just 4 stars. 4
I have  started experimenting with different brands of Peppermint Hot Cocoa and I started with Stephen's Gourmet Candy Cane Hot Cocoa.  It was a home run.  Very peppermint, very creamy, perfectly sweet, very chocolatey, wouldn't change a thing.<br /><br />Next I tried Bellagio Peppermint Truffle hot cocoa (this one).  What a drastic difference.  The first problem is that it tastes more like Mint than Peppermint and even has a slight cooling affect to the mouth like brushing with mint toothpaste -- not something I expect or particularly desire from hot cocoa. I noted that Stephen's Gourmet Candy Cane Hot Cocoa has Peppermint Oil, while this one contains merely "Artificial Flavoring".<br /><br />The second problem is that this cocoa isn't sweet.  It isn't bitter, but it was necessary to add a little sweetener to bring out any flavor, else it was just a bland hot drink with a cooling minty affect.  Even then, the mint is more detectable by the cooling affect than by actual flavor.<br /><br />The third problem is that this hot cocoa isn't creamy.  I had to add a little half-and-half to make it creamy.  In contrast, Stephen's Gourmet Candy Cane hot cocoa only needed water to produce a very creamy hot cocoa -- probably because it includes Nonfat Dry Milk, while Bellagio Peppermint Truffle hot cocoa (this one) includes non-dairy creamer.<br /><br />The fourth and probably biggest issue is that this hot cocoa isn't very chocolatey, no where near as chocolatey as Stephen's Gourmet Candy Cane Hot Cocoa, and this is someone who actually prefers milk chocolate to dark/rich chocolate -- i.e., it is even weak by milk chocolate standards.<br /><br />Two stars for the following: 1) attractive and convenient packaging 2) it doesn't taste bad.<br /><br />Bellagio Peppermint Truffle Hot Cocoa is Made in the USA.  Directions: add 3 tablespoons of mix to 3/4 c. hot water and stir.  I also add a little sweetener and milk or cream. 2
I ordered the the sweetner because I could not find it in stores anymore. The original dispenser was a much smaller container with a small flip lid that was very easy to get 1 or 2 tablets out. This new dispenser has a spring loaded mechanism that is supposed to shoot out 1 tablet at a time but half the time crushed bits of the tablet come out and sometimes nothing comes out . Another example how trying to make something so simple is made into something that seems smarter but is not!!!!!!!! 3
These have to be the worst noodles I have ever eaten--udon or otherwise. Like others have said, these broke into pieces, were not thick like udon should be, and tasted terrible. "Traditional"? No way! I got these thinking that since they were "organic," they would be of good quality. What a crock! Now I'm stuck with these things that I wouldn't feed to a dog. I'm never buying Roland anything again. 1
While Earth's Best produces great organic products for kids, these use some but not all organic ingredients. All Earth's Best products that are organic will have that word below their logo, this does not. We were disappointed to see these marketed as organic on this website but then noticed the legal disclaimer that Amazon will not be held responsible if the information on the site does not accurately describe the product. If you are looking for good, healthy cereal bars for kids, these are an excellent choice. But if you want a 100% organic cereal bar, keep shopping. 2
It makes it easier to use my 8oz popper( Gold Medal 2408) But its too SALTY. The Gold Medal Seasoning Flavacol is much better. I will not get again. I have adjusted by not cutting the salt portion then adding the Gold Medal Seasoning by hand that Works better. also others have talked about old maid. that comes from the Popper design. I also had issues with those Cheaper poppers & 4oz. poppers -That's why we upgraded to the professional Brand, Gold Medal, you will pay a tad bit more, but its worth it because parts can be replaced & fixed easily + it can pop ALL day with out issues + better product (popcorn) 2
Good...but too strong leading to higher acidity for my morning joe.  had to adjust it with more water & salt to increase the pH. Not what i want to do..... not sure I would reorder. 3
The Company:  "ITAL stands for all things Pure, True and Vital.  We believe that pure food from the earth is physically and spiritually beneficial".<br /><br />They also claim to treat their workers ethically and they know where their beans come from and how they are grown(?).  They are committed to "sourcing the finest  quality 100% Arabica beans".  Their "organic coffees are Fair Trade Certified and USDA approved".  The company started the "Kicks For Cause Foundation" of which partial proceeds form coffee sales go towards youth soccer programs.<br /><br />The Coffee:  I like good coffee.  This tastes like instant coffee.  The packets are nicely designed and the coffee is fresh, but the taste is  bland. Even with two packs per cup, the taste was very mild.  I also did not get much of a caffeine kick.  But what do you expect when the cost is about 'sixty-six cents' a packet?  You get what you pay for. 2
i paid $11.50 ish with free s/h which equals .29 per treat_ i would not pay more than that- they're pretty small....definitely not as good as home made but they're not awful either. i don't think i would buy them again unless they were cheaper. total weight is only 31 ounces- so just under 2 pounds. at 11.50 that equals $5.75 per pound- which is kinda of a lot for rice krispie treats_ so it all depends on how much you're willing to pay for ok rice/marshmallow treats- 3
The seeds arrived a day early. These seeds fall into the middle quality.  They are not totally washed but don't have a strong peppery flavour like completely raw unwashed seeds which contain more residue on the outside shell.<br />I would prefer these seeds to totally flavorless washed seeds, but they aren't the dark large aromatic seeds that pop up now and then with that beautiful earthy and peppery flavor that are almost sticky with residue. The packaging was excellent and they arrive really fast for standard shipping. 3
Ordered the product in the middle of june and i have yet to receive the product despite contacting customer service 1
I enjoy the Coffee Master Flavored Coffee,"Jamaican Me Crazy".  It is very tasty and I will reorder when empty.  The "Butter Pecan"flavor is great also, and I will highly recommend both flavors. This is high premium coffee.  You will not be disappointed.  The flavor is just right not overbearing. 5
To help me drink more water I used flavor crystals to make it more palatable. When I visited my doctor I was told I had high blood pressure. I asked why for 66 years my blood pressure was normal but now it was high and I needed 2 prescriptions. Doctor said that was normal. Since I like to research I found that the crystals I was using had Aspartame, one of the most dangerous artificial sweeteners. Side effects include headaches, anxiety, abdominal pain, nausea, heart palpitations, irritable bowel syndrome & high blood pressure. Acesulfame potassium is another artificial sweetener used in some Crystal Light varieties. This sweetener contains methylene chloride, which is a known carcinogen - long-term use of this carcinogen may cause cancer. Other side effects include nausea, headaches and impaired liver.<br /><br />I stopped using anything with Aspartame(threw out the prescriptions)and my blood pressure is now normal. The "Natural" crystal light is not really natural because it contains Aspartame(which I was told is also genetically modified). Crystal Light has a very good product called "Natural". It uses cane sugar (not GM sugar beet) & TRUVIA. This is a much better product and only a few calories more than the "Natural" which is not really natural. Aspartame is not natural. Many other synthetically sweetened products use Aspartame. You have to read all labels. It's better to eat smaller amounts of real food rather then more synthetically sweetened, GM frankenfood and avoid the side effects. What's the big deal in a few extra natural calories? 1
I ordered these as a gift for my parents-  the almonds are very nice, large, nice flavor but they are very very very salty! I wish I had ordered them plain (I like salty food so for me to  find these overly salted is really saying something.) Also, they came taped together with clear packing tape so to separate them I had to tear the label off and the plastic lid did not fit very well.  If you are gifting these and big on appearance I would reconsider. 3
After being diagnosed as a celiac recently, finding products that are tasty and gluten-free really challenged me.  I traded off tasty for decent tasting after a while, but FINALLY I have found something that actually tastes good.  The crunchy texture makes me feel satisfied after finishing the bag.  These cookies are truly delicious and well worth the journey to find them.  Since God hasn't healed me yet, I am so thankful that He let me find these! 5
I've ordered several bags of this xylitol now and really enjoy it. I must caution that you use it sparingly to see how your digestive system reacts to it. Also, can be used in baking/cooking, but you can't use it in any recipe that needs yeast to rise! 4
This cocoa is like any other cocoa, other than it is white and turns pink when touches liquid.  The tin is cute, but 2 cans were dented when they arrived. Not sure if it was from shipping or the seller.  A bit over priced in my opinion as well. 3
This flavor of Fancy Feast is decidedly the favorite of our waif of a cat.  She is usually a very picky eater, but this trout flavor really gets her excited.<br /><br />The local store ran out of this flavor and may not restock it, so I ordered online.  We got a good price and the case of food arrived in good condition.<br /><br />I was a little confused by the old label image that was on the web site that is just different enough from the new label that I had to double check that I was getting the item that I was expecting.<br /><br />It turned out to be the correct item, so all was well. 4
The Altoids Wintergreen mints are my favorite flavor of all time! Everybody always compliments me on how great my breath smells (I know it's kinda weird)! Anyways, I would absolutely recommend these mints! 5
The Uncle Ray's BBQ Potato Chips are comparable to Lays or most commonly available chips in local markets.  The BBQ spice ia a bit too much; the one pound bags consisted of about half broken chips.  I won't think about buying these again, even with the discounted price and will pay a bit more for a much better kettle fried potato chip. 3
As I have problems with sleep at night and tried all sorts of things which are most commonly recommended to improve it, I tought I try this well rated product. I tried it in all the various recommended dosages. But it didn't make the slightest difference for me. Thus I guess that it probably only works if the cause of the unrest is a magnesium deficiency.<br />Reportedly:<br />"With supplements, overdose is possible, however, particularly in people with poor renal function; occasionally, with use of high cathartic doses of magnesium salts, severe hypermagnesemia has been reported to occur even without renal dysfunction".<br />"Safety Issues<br />The US government has set the following upper limits for use of magnesium supplements:<br />Children<br />1-3 years: 65 mg<br />4-8 years: 110 mg<br />Adults: 350 mg<br />Pregnant or Nursing Women: 350 mg"<br />"It has been called nature's calcium channel blocker."<br />"Magnesium assists in calcium uptake, but it also competes with dietary calcium for the same absorption site in the intestine. Excessive dietary calcium (or phosphorus) is much more likely to block magnesium absorption than vice- versa in the typical American diet. Magnesium absorption is also inhibited by excessive dietary fat, phosphate, lactose, phytates and oxalates which form insoluble compounds with magnesium. Magnesium is also lost in diarrhea, long term use of diuretics, excessive sugar intake and protein malnutrition...<br />...  there are lower levels of minerals in food today due to depletion of the soil in modern farming methods. (23) Modern methods of milling, processing and the preservation of food cause nutrient losses, eg 85% of magnesium is removed from whole wheat in the milling."<br />Thus it is advisable to consult a qualified health care provider if a deficiency is suspected.<br />It's usually best to avoid deficiencies by a healthy diet: "Kelp is very high in magnesium, as are whole grains, almonds, and cashews..." 2
Its a great product.I would recommend this to everyone who wants a tasty sweetner other than sugar.I just started using it,taste so good,the jar is almost finished. 5
I bought these along with several other Raggedy Ann & Andy hot cocoas.  The Beary Blue and Pink Hot Chocolate both came with dented cans. I'm not sure if they came from the seller that way or if this happened during the shipping process, but I decided to keep them anyway.  This is the only set of hot cocoas that had a sticker of Raggedy Andy wrapped around the tin insted of it being imprinted on the actual tin. Kids seem to love that it turns blue once it touches the milk or water. 3
This coffee is the best I have ever had.  If you like good coffee you should try it.  I mix it with another coffee that is not as strong but the results are wonderful. 5
My little dog (15 pounds) loves these things!  I like that they are small and easy to cut into smaller pieces.  Be careful of treating with the whole piece if your dog likes to inhale food.  My dog has choked twice. 4
I bought these at walmart for less then $2.00 dollars a box.There over  $2.80 a box @Amazon for (box of six).Then you need to add another $7.00 dollars to your order to get free shipping ....I would not buy these again could be better if you added chicken or an egg like other reviewers mentioned. My box does say gluten free so maybe there are 2 versions. 3
As an ex-Montrealer, I found the meat to be too smokey compared to true Montreal smoked meat.  However, the quality of the meat was excellent, and the meat packages were packed extremely well and shipped quickly. 3
I can hardly eat a hamburger, steak, roast, or any kind of beef without A1 Sauce.  I get really annoyed when I run out of A1 Sauce.  A1 is the best steak sauce out there.  It has a great tangy, spicy flavor that enhances enjoyment of many meat products - especially beef.  And it makes tough or poor beef or steaks at least tolerable.<br /><br />A1 is the best steak sauce in my book. 5
I've tried many different brands of dried fruit and this one was one of the poorest quality.  More than 1/2 of the slices in the package have seeds and they don't come off easily. I either had to cut or bite off the pieces with seeds.  Definitely not worth the money. Some of the other brands on here with individually packaged fruit might be more costly per pound but are much better quality. 2
Great value and much superior to what you find in stores. Makes a great snack or after dinner treat, but for those who are health conscious remember to keep it to a few pieces since they are covered in thin sugar. Try to keep the bag tightly sealed once you open them since the slowly begin to dry up. Will be ordering more soon :) 5
GOOD PRODUCT BUT THIS COMPANY IS RIPPING OFF CUSTOMERS.  GO TO YOUR LOCAL WALMART OR PUBLIX AND GET IT FOR LESS THAN HALF THIS OUTRAGEOUS PRICE. 1
I'm a little perplexed by all the great reviews.  This was the most bland chowder I've ever had.  I prepared it with just milk and a little butter, and it tasted like nothing!  Added some salt and white pepper, still nothing.  Added some black pepper and Provence herbs, now it tastes like herbed potato soup.<br /><br />On the plus side the clams were nice big chunks and the potatoes were tender.  The consistency was pretty good too.  It just had no flavor.  Not going to be buying this again, certainly not when it's this expensive, too. 2
To say I am no expert on tea is ...well... the truth. My earlier experience with tea was the occassional cup at a Chinese restaurant,or the cup loaded with honey for a sore throat. For me it was coffee, coffee, and more coffee.<br /><br />However,hearing so much about the benefits of green tea,I picked out a box of it at the store and put it up on my shelf.It just sat there. Then disaster struck - I was out of coffee! I remembered the green tea on the shelf and thought what the heck, maybe it will hold me over till I get to the store. I liked it! It gave me an afternoon pick-me-up that I wasn't expecting and even thought it tasted pretty good as well. I don't remember what kind it was as I have been through several boxes of green, various brand and flavors of the tea since then. Then I hit on:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BM68QG">Good Earth Tea Green Tea, Lemongrass, 25-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> -see my review for details of the Lemongrass - I loved it. It was the best I tried. Naturally I found the best deal here at Amazon.<br /><br />Next I wanted to try other flavors. This Orange flavored sounded pretty good. It has the added benefits of super anitoxidant(70% more than Good Earth's standard green tea) Japanese teas matcha and sencha. I found both the aroma and taste much lighter than the Lemongrass. The Orange gives just a hint of it's flavor. Other reviewers felt otherwise, so I would suggest to try one box first and if you like it go for this multi-pack. I do agree though that it's great for what ails ya. It's definitly one I would drink for anything from colds and sore-throats to aches and pains of all sorts. I also read that the matcha leaf helps to cleanse the body of toxins.<br /><br />This blend brews up an appealing golden shade. It gives me a renewed and refreshed feel but I also found it to be more calming than the Lemongrass which gave me quite an energy boost.It also doesn't seem to be dehydrating -as coffee can be - with more health benefits.Although I personally prefered the taste of the Lemongrass - my only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 - I still like this one and it is nice to have a litle variety for different moods or needs. And I don't need to add anything.<br /><br />It is caffeinated, but comparably much less then coffee per serving. It may be served hot or as Iced Tea.<br /><br />From the box:<br />Ingredients: Sencha Green Tea,Orange Oil,Green Tea Extract,Natural Flavors,Matcha and Chamomile Flowers.<br /><br />Super Green Tea - 162 mg avg antioxidants per serving.<br />Good Earth Standard Green tea -108 mg avg antioxidants per serving<br /><br />So I still love that morning cup of Java, but now I look forward to my afternoon Green Tea as well.Now I would find it a disaster to be without that! I even took some with me on a recent road trip - just to be sure I had some wherever I went.<br /><br />Remember to breathe,eat healthy and...enjoy the holidays!....Laurie 4
THESE TWISTS ARE STILL IN MY FOOD PANTRY...NEVER TO BE ENJOYED...I HAD PREVIOULY USED TWIZZLERS HERSHEY PRODUCT BUT THEY CHANGED THE RECIPE AND WERE NOT VERY GOOD...I THOUGHT THESE MIGHT DO AS A SUBSTITUTE BUT I WAS WRONG...POOR TASTE AND TOO HARD TO SATISFY ME. 2
I purchased this maples syrup for the Master Cleanse diet, which is great for that.  I tried using on pancakes and the taste was not to my satisfaction.  It's fine for the lemonade diet, but that's about it. 3
Kind of bitter. I recommend buying on first in a store before buying a case. But, almost all these strips are such a great portable vegetarian protein snack. 4
Arrives always in about 4 days. It is more convenient and cheaper than the store. Recommended!! Great service too. My Dachshund love it! 5
I am glad I was able to find these on this site. I love this flavor and they are so crunchy. The box is packed inside another box but still some bags end up as crumbs. Most of the bags survived in tact. 5
My dad just loved this. It was full of so many things plus the cooler bag!! Great price and great product! 4
Horrible stuff, does not smell fishy, smells rotten, taste like metal, mushy, just bad expensive tuna. Can not get pass the smell. Rotten. 1
Purchased this to use for travel as it's difficult to find iced coffee in most hotels & using water to mix makes it the perfect travel drink. I so wanted to love this. You have to shake vigorously - preferably using a shaker with a stirring ball or filter - as it's VERY grainy & takes about 2 minutes of solid shaking. Grainy I can live with, but the taste is the deal breaker. It has an incredibly strong metallic taste. The only way to soften the taste is to add lots of milk, which defeats my purpose of bringing a water mixing drink to travel. It's expensive for the convenience and would have been worth it - if only I could drink it. Oh well, the search for a traveling, water mixing iced coffee continues. 2
What I expected: Something that tasted like green tea with perhaps a hit of honey, strawberry, and acai flavor, finished with the typical sugar-free aftertaste.<br /><br />What I got: A pleasant tasting strawberry soft drink with very little sugar-free aftertaste.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, the taste of this drink is quite nice. The strawberry flavor is quite fresh-tasting and at room temperature is very fragrant. It's just not at all what I'd expect for a product from Lipton calling itself "Green Tea Mix". The powder dissolves very quickly, even when stirred with a spoon in an open glass (vs shaken in a bottle).<br /><br />So why only three stars? Like I said, I expected green tea. I got strawberry drink. If you're looking for strawberry, this is very good. If you're looking for tea, move along. 3
I'll start off by saying that this gum has a very good flavor. The electric watermelon also mixes in with some sort of banana flavor making a perfect combo. Its a great addition to the 5 collection and would recommend this gum to anybody here who enjoys the 5 gum series. My only negative sight on this item would probably be the lasting time. Flavor only lasts about 10 min, or so then begins to fade.<br /><br />ALSO: Item has only 10 pack not 12, so I had to ask for a refund of $5.00. Be Careful! 4
Each package comes with 8 milk creamer discs and 8 chai tea discs, making a total of 8 drinks.  You use the creamer disc first, then the tea disc.  Tassimo recommends that you run the brewer through a cleaning cycle after making a milk drink (you don't want to spoil your next non-milky drink).<br /><br />I love Chai (or spiced) tea with a little sugar or honey, so I was really looking forward to a Chai Latte made with my brand new Tassimo Brewer.  Boy was I disappointed!<br /><br />I don't see it in the description, but the tea contains sucralose (that's the sweetener in Splenda).  While I generally avoid artificial sweeteners in general, as I don't like the taste, I do make some exceptions.  It's possible to use them and have an enjoyable flavor if the flavors are balanced.<br /><br />They aren't in this Twinings Chai.  There is definitely too much sweetener.  I would prefer that they err on the side of not enough sweetener---after all, everyone has their own preferences, but I can always add more, I can't remove what's already there.<br /><br />The balance between the milk and tea was also off and the milk has a decided reconstituted dry milk taste to it.  Not my fave. ;0)  Between the sweetener overkill and the milk, it was hard to even tell that this was spiced tea or tea at all.<br /><br />I won't be purchasing again. 1
I was giving my shihtzu the Fromm Adult Gold dog food. She didn't seem to want to eat it though so I thought I would try something different. I found the Harmony Farms and thought I'd give it a try. She actually liked it. It's cheaper then the other food and it seemed to contain really healthy ingredients. I couldn't believe how she gobbled this up. BUT after having her on this for a week she developed a rash on her stomach. Took her off and the rash went away completely in 2 days. Her hair also wasn't as soft. This kibble did not do well for her. 2
My 10 year-old black pug has problems with her back left hip and knee. Sometimes, the leg goes out on her and she ends up on her butt, unable to get moving again. I started feeding these Happy Hips treats to her a few months ago, but did not realize that I was not feeding as many as prescribed which is 1 jerky treat for each 7.5 pounds of body weight. She did show some relief at the lower level. However, after realizing my error and increasing the dosage to the recommended level, she now shows FANTASTIC results. After 3 weeks, she chases her squirrels, she and her cat brother play chase, and she hops right over puddles. She has not had her back leg go out on her this entire past month. She's a real dog again! Just know that you must be patient - it took 3 weeks of daily use at the recommended level to see the full results. This product has worked so well, I now have it on auto-order. 5
This granola tastes really good.  It doesn't have enough berries nor pieces of chocolate but the flavor is not too overwhelmingly sweet.  The serving is 1/4 cup and has 140 calories.  I am not sure I'll be satisfied with just 1/4 cup since it tastes pretty good.  I shouldn't be surprised about the amount of calories considering that some of the ingredients have a high caloric number anyways, like: soy oil, spelt, choco chunks, flax seeds, and dried coconut.<br /><br />It does taste very good and it is organic.  It really makes a good snack and it's not too dry, just watch your calorie count. 4
Same price as Dr. Foster & Smith. 2
I love me the regular Mi-Del Ginger Snaps... but out of a fluke I picked me up a gluten free bag once and thought it tasted not so yummy.  like ginger flavored sweetend hard dirt.  so unless you have to have the gluten free for some reason go get you the normal ginger snaps which as of Sep 2006, Amazon offers 3
I tried to like this tea being that I bought a whole box, but I am still working on it going 4 months now. I drink at least one cup of tea at work everyday and I am partial to mint in my tea. However, there is little to no tea or mint flavor going on here. I have shared this with many people at work and it isn't just me.<br /><br />There are particles left behind in the tea bag with more aroma than the brewed tea itself. I always leave the bag in the cup as I drink it and it never gets stronger. There is nothing satisfying about it, I might as well just drink hot water.<br /><br />I do like stash teas but don't make my mistake, try it first. The packages I received are different than pictured now, maybe it has improved. I am disappointed. 2
I liked the taste but it is basically just rice with some flavoring. It would be a lot better with more beans and other veggies to add substance. I'm not familiar with the dish so I can't say how close this comes to what you would get in a good restaurant. 3
LOVE them!! I love knowing how much better this is for me than potato chips or typical crackers. I am focused on eating nutrient dense food and am avoiding putting into my mouth non-food items for entertainment only. I love crunchy foods and this is great. The flavors are all good except don't like the sweet maple and cinn. flavor as much.<br />My family doesnt like them because they are not evolved yet, immature taste buds is all I can say at this point. Start your babies off early and you won't have to erase habits of eating NON food for fun. 5
The advertisement for this product is very misleading and accualy lies out right about what you are getting, it says you are getting 30 8oz packets of  mix when you are accualy getting 30- .5oz oz packets and because of the high price of $17 you are easily misled. The same amount of product at Walmart is approx. $5, around 30% of what this seller sold his for. RIP OFF!!! 1
This was not at all what I expected. It was like the old-school roll-on deoderant from the 1970's. Only instead of fresh-scented anti-persperant, it was drippy, smelly, bacon-flavored dog juice.<br /><br />So I guess you're supposed to stoop down and hold the roll-on bottle in front of the dog while it licks the roller ball to get the dog juice on its tongue. You're supposed to do this without yacking from the smell. Meanwhile, there's a million dog treats out there that you can throw to the dog and he runs off and eats it and you're not doing deep knee bends to apply dog juice roll-on to your dog's already funky tongue.<br /><br />To say nothing of the fact that the dog just wants to take it and bite it. Like a dog would do.<br /><br />Try again. Fail. 1
Tea smells fantastic, but there was not a great deal of taste.  No complaints at the price I paid, but if it had been full price, I would have been dissapointed. 3
I did not find the smell to be anything but inviting.  Warm pork rinds is a concept that was new to me.  I found the taste to be very good.  I had no problems with the cook time and the bag did not collapse on the product.  My only complaint is that there was just too much salt. 3
Low quality.<br />Self Hand wrapped.<br />No "Best Before" Date,<br />No Nutrition Fact,<br />No INGREDIENTS. 1
I ordered a bag of these chews for Extra-Large dogs, I kid you not!!! The first chew I take out is about 3 inches long 1/2 inch wide and paper thin. It looked like a piece of bacon that had been dried up. Less than 1/2 of the bag were actually large chews and only 29 were inside. This company obviously thinks of their customers as idiots!!!FALSE advertisement lawsuit cerntainly is warranted in this case. They are getting rich and ripping YOU ALL OFF at the same time. DO NOT PUT UP WITH THIS BS, SEND BACK THE BAG LIKE I DID. Every one of your dollars is good so why should all their product not be good as well? Again, do not let them rip you off! I hope the lawyer that sued Innova dog food gets a wind of this!!!! 1
This tea tastes like paper.  I have made it by "Sun Tea" method and steeped tea then I tried steeping it long and short times. It lacks that wonderful POW, it used to have.  This cannot be the "Original Tea".  More than the color of the box is changed. I do not like this new tea. I drank the old Good Earth Ice tea instead of sodas.  I am unhappy about the change. I tossed out my old box, so I cannot compare the ingredients or distributors.  This was a comfort, hot or cold, and now it is gone. How sad.  I will not recommend or purchase this tea anymore.  Francine 1
Good: comes in smaller cans, which is much better for one-cat households since there's less waste<br /><br />Bad: my cat only slurps up the gravy and doesn't eat the morsels. Your mileage may vary. 3
This is my favorite K-Cup Brand/flavor so far.  Nantucket Blend is just right for me.  Not too strong not too weak.  Medium Roast with lots of aroma & taste. 5
This diet root beer has earned a rock-solid four stars. The only reason I'm withholding a star, is that I recall the authentic root beers of my youth [e.g., Hires], and reserve the ultimate rating for them. This beverage delivers a crisp, clear, and creamy sasparilla taste, and does it with no discernible aftershock. Try this stuff...you'll like it. Delivered to your door, at 75 cents a pop, you can't go too awfully wrong! 4
After searching for a more constant and less expensive supply of "real" licorice over my favorite (more about that later), I decided to try this one based upon other reviews and the description. I have to say that I was disappointed. It is not intense enough and a bit too salty for my preference since all that I noticed was salt and more salt until it got down to the licorice flavor which I would charactize as "modest". My all time favorite licorice was discovered years ago while visiting a St. Louis mall has been and remains an excellent choice made by Bissinger's Chocolate Company and they call it French Long Licorice. It is not noticeably salty and packed with flavor without being a sicky-sweet candy. I say that and caution licorice lovers to know their favorite "type" of licorice; this is important when reading reviews and purchasing. I was looking for something not American-style junk candy, with actual licorice extract not anise, chewy, lasting, with true strong licorice flavor and no other flavor overtones.<br /><br />As far a Bissinger's is concerned, they do not make this licorice year round nor advertise it on their website or in their catalogs so you have to call their toll free number and ask if it has been in production. It is expensive but well worth it for excellent flavor and lasting ability (I can enjoy one for at least 15 minutes if I don't chew). These are my favorite thing to have when reading a great book and I limit myself to 2 at a sitting for my "fix"; okay, sometimes 3 if it is a superb book:D.<br />The last time I ordered it they were generous and added a pound of their premium chocolate as a thank-you for being a customer that troubled to find their particular product because I do not live near one of their stores and unless I visit say St. Louis (where it is headquartered) I have to mail-order.Anyway, I prefer my licorice hard and let it soften in my mouth so when I get an order ($56 for 2lbs) I leave it out lightly wrapped for a few days to harden off. That makes it last longer in my mouth and does not affect flavor but that it personal mouth feel preference. It frezes without problems so I will just have to go back to that and pay for my pleasure and stock up :). Licorice-gotta have it! 3
As the description says: this is for single-serve "pod" type brewers, and it will be quite the pain to use if you're using a Keurig or a Mr. Coffee. Keep that in mind...<br /><br />Now, to the coffee: it was good in a 6-8oz brew, with the flavors being pretty much as described. However, at 15 pods to a pack, this a week's worth of coffee if you drink a 15 oz mug every morning, as I do. So, while it is a good coffee when made properly, the value just is not there for me with this product.<br /><br />If you're okay with that, because you see value added by the social marketing related to this product, then go for it.<br /><br />If you're just after good coffee, you can probably get just as good a cup with a different brand for a little less. 3
I love all of Newman's Own products, and I like that their dog treats are all-natural and that it's a trustworthy brand. My dogs really like these treats and they are a good-sized for a snack for medium/small dogs (I have pugs). The biscuits are hard and they come in "sets" of two, but are easy to break apart. The broken-apart squares are about one square inch.<br /><br />They are definitely hard snacks, and they are easy to break into one square, but I could see that it would be difficult to break them up further. They are perfect for my dogs, but I would say that they may be difficult for tiny dogs to chew because of their size and crunchiness. 5
I wish Amazon had a policy of also posting the Nutrition Facts label of food products.  This product has 30g of sugar in a 2 oz serving and 140 Calories.  The ingredients List is Quince & Citron Rice Black Vinegar, Fructose, Water, Oligosaccharide, Conc. Apple Juice, Polydextrose, Maltodextrin, Mixed Apple Juice.  If you're fine with that then it does add a certain zing to recipes but I was looking for something simpler. 3
Just received my beans today and wow!  There's an amazing amount for the price paid, they smell absolutely fantastic and came vacuum packed so they'll keep practically forever. 5
This is very similar in flavor to Kusmi St. Petersburg, although St. Petersburg is far superior in complexity of flavor. Ultimately, I find Paris to be a little boring.<br /><br />I've noticed that the caffeine in Paris makes me feel jittery for some reason. I drink black tea every morning and don't have this problem with other brands. Not sure why Paris seems intensely caffeinated in comparison.<br /><br />For those who'd like to try this tea without breaking the bank, I've found Paris and other selections at The Fresh Market for just $5.99. My local grocery store carries a few flavors as well, all for around $6. H&S Dragon Pearl Jasmine is my favorite from this line.<br /><br />If you're willing to shell out $15-20 for a tea, try Kusmi instead. 3
I hardly ever write reviews but this tea is quite excellent.  I decided to try it without any sweetener or any other added taste enhancers.  It is flavorful without being overpowering.  It is a great pleasure to have a fine tea like this loose and reasonably priced.  After the first try I have continued to drink it just as it comes.  You can see by the leaves once they are soaked that it is a premium tea. 5
My one year old daughter drinks this every day and she loves it! I haven't accustomed myself to the "gamey" taste as other reviewers call it, but I'm thrilled that she is getting a whole fatted milk, free of hormones and overflowing with nutrition. Get 'em started early! 5
Okay, it does smell kind of like cat food. But it is packaged fish, which I think is what cat food is, so I guess that's not a huge surprise. My daughter really likes it, and I like that it's good for her, so overall we give this our seal of approval. 4
Not really sure if they really are "power" bones, but my dog loves the taste and doesn't complain! We buy lots of other Zuke's products as well, and my Golden loves them all. 4
These Albanese gummi bears and rings and so on are very good and tasty and high quality. The bears even have little faces. At my local candy store this type of gummi stuff (bears, rings, snakes, balls, worms, whatever) are about $10/lb. These twin packs of 4.5 or 5 pound bags is a screaming deal as far as I'm concerned. I'm probably 50 pounds deep in these friggin' things. Consumed! 5
This product is labeled "100% of what you want". But one look at the nutrition facts and you may not agree. While it contains 100% juice and vitamin C, no preservatives or sugar, it contains 135 calories, 15 mg of sodium, and a whopping 34 grams of carbohydrates. All this in a tiny 8.3 oz can! I also thought it was too sweet for my tastes, but I normally drink a diet carbonated beverage, so the sweetness did jump out at me. Just okay. I won't add this to my shopping list. 2
If you are trying to eat healthy (like me), but love junk food (like me), these are the chips for you.  I have given up potato chips and french fries in my quest to eat guilt free, but a sandwich just needs something on the side. These chips add a great crunch as a side to a sandwich, and are a great snack for only 100 calories. They have no preservatives, no artificial flavors or colors, no cholesterol, 0 grams saturated fat, o grams trans fat, and are gluten free. Ingredients are potato flakes, potato starch, safflower oil and/or sunflower oil, rice flour, sea salt. They would be great to pack in a school lunch or for an after school snack. I ordered them on the subscription plan, a case a month, but might have to add an extra shipment. Everyone I have given a pack to loved them too and came back for more. 5
Pan Ducale Almond Biscotti were a  disappointment to me, not because they were bad, but because they could not come close to the great Lettieri Prato Belli Cantuccini Almond Cookies.  At best they are low in calories - also in almonds. 2
I've used Cento San Marzano DOP certified tomatoes many times in the past and was always pleased with the quality of these great tomatoes.<br />That said, this is the 1st time I've ordered this item from Amazon and ALL 12 cans arrived completely dented and banged up!<br />Terrible presentation for an expensive item.<br />As an aside, none of the cans I received has a "DOP CERTIFIED" label but only "CERTIFIED" and no serial # on the side of the cans so I'm not sure if these tomatoes are actually DOP certified or not??? 1
It doesn't taste like walnuts, plain and simple. It tastes like paper glue loaded with alcohol. And I got heartburns afterwards. Who knows what is in this. I really regret buying this, what a waste of money. 1
I love this tea.  It is very rich in taste, smells wonderful, and doesn't leave a funny after taste.  It's my favorite herb tea. 5
I have drank Bigelow band peppermint tea and loved it.  But, by current supermarket doesn't carry Bigelow's peppermint tea and I figured how different can they be..after all the ingredients on both is "Peppermint".  I was very surprised to find Celestial Seasonings peppermint tea is very weak tasting.  I am using two tea bags just to get more flavor.  Also, there is a subtle difference in the taste of the two teas.  Bigelow's brand has a slightly sweeter taste, which I enjoy.  In the future I will not be purchasing Celestial Seasonings peppermint tea. 2
Awesome little snack treat for your favorite pup/dog.  My two pekeingese just love these.  You can use them for training as well as just a treat.  They come in a variety of flavors.  My pups like the liver the best.  For senior dogs, these are perfect if they don't have the "jaw" power or teeth use anymore.  They are easy to carry so you can treat your dog whenever you want to for example on a walk around the neighborhood.  They are just 3 calories each so you don't have to worry about their weight.  Absolutely recommend these to every dog owner! 5
I have pain and numbness down both arms from a pinched nerve at the bottom of my neck.  I started drinking this juice three months into what will likely be a four to six month recovery.  Because my doctor has put me on a long-term anti-inflammatory medication, I am not allowed to take over-the-counter medications like Advil and Tylenol.  I can say that taking a glass of this juice has the same pain-killing effect as taking two Advil.  I enjoy two glasses a day - one in the morning and one at dinner.  The only down-side is the sugar, which is really the only processed sugar I eat during the day.  The juice tastes good and the quality of the syrup is consistent and pleasant.<br /><br />I usually don't go for "miracle" foods or diet fads, but this juice simply works - this is the real deal.  It will not cure pain, but it will inhibit inflammation and facilitate faster healing of arthritis, spasms, and sprains. 5
The aroma of this blend is sharp and bold, but not as appealing as some of the other varieties ive tried, semi astringent. I brewed this on the 7.25oz setting and found it to be strong and dark enough to use milk and one tsp of sugar.<br />The taste is underwhelming, and seems to be along the lines of an average at best cup of coffee. The taste characteristic is along the lines of walnut and brandy, which is nice but not present enough to make this blend memorable.<br />It is as drinkable as a mild cup of starbucks coffee... 3
very cute idea however they dont allow u to pick a flavor u get whatever one they want to send u they gave me lemon my least favorite flavor and the hole in it is tiny plus the lollipop gets digusting after awhile definately something that u shouldnt really eat would not order this again. 3
Once again I did NOT receive COMVITA Raw Honey.  This is not the first time that the supplier substituted another New Zealand honey for the Comvita Honey which I had ordered.  The two are not the same and I will not order the 35.2 ounce jars again because I do not have this problem when I order Comvita honey packaged in small jars. 3
This mix was OK and the price is reasonable, but there are a lot of unusable seeds in the bag that do not sprout - I'd say about 25%. 3
I was a little disappointed in this product.  The cookies are heavy.  The taste is fine, but the heaviness got to me.  I have to admit, I am very picky about cookies.  It is hard to find good, natural cookies.  I would recommend trying these, but I prefer other brands. 3
So my Mom often buys bags of kitty treats for her "grandkitten"... and I find it so hilarious that if it isnt the Temptations treats in the yellow bag, he will NOT touch them. We can mix different brands together in a pile, and he will pull the Temptations treats out with his paw and leave the others. Its unreal. Either they just hit the jackpot with the perfect cat-seducing ingredients, or they have some sort of addictive substance in them.... who knows! :) I only give them 4 stars because they are not the "healthiest" treat for a cat, but honestly... he just loves them so much I cant say no. 4
I miss read before I ordered, got 2 very small tins of oil.  Later realized that there is a 2 LITER pack for nearly the same price.  So I'm going to say this particular version of the product is overpriced.  Especially for a tin can, I have used this packaging for olive oil before and you tend to lose that last serving or so in the lip of the tin.  Drives me crazy!  For this reason, I'm 2 starring it, and am going to make sure to check my ounces before I send in a future order. 2
I was looking for an alternative green or white iced tea powder after I realized that the Lipton brands all contained sucralose, and did not come in an unsweetened version.  I found Stash tea online and decided to try it, using stevia as the sweetener.  I bought the lemon ginger flavor.<br /><br />By comparison, I think the Lipton powdered iced tea I had been used to drinking was more like sweetened and colored fruity "kool-aid" for adults.  This is different.  I am having to get used to the green tea taste, and it upset my stomach a little (when I drink hot tea, I usually drink white tea, because I like the mild taste).<br /><br />I tried using only half to a third of the packet in 16 ounces of water and that worked better.  I would probably like white tea better, but Stash doesn't make any white tea in the iced tea powder mix.  Anyway I hope to get used to the taste.  Since right now I like it watered-down, it's really a good deal as far as price. 3
I'm sorry I just can't eat this.  It is too thick and chewy and slimy to eat.  I have tried, several times, several different ways. I wanted to like it. It isn't something I will buy again.  I do, however, like the angel hair pasta.  Is is much thinner and is easier to chew and good in soups and oriental dishes. 1
Item appears to be Keurig brand by title & description (big $$$).  However upon receiving it, it is an off brand "My Perfect Kitchen" sold at Bed Bath & Beyond and at HALF the price. I was disappointed in the jading and sent it back. Signed up for BBB email promos and got a 20% off coupon for use in the store so I bought this EXACT item for $20 (reg only $24.99 in store).  I mean EXACT!  Do your homework and save yourself some money.  Oh and the item itself is great...we have the larger Platinum B70 and it does have an issue with the cupboards but I just pulled it forward about 3.5in and it's perfect.  I am fortunate enough to have a lot of counter space and I may move it to an open top area so for us it's all good :) 1
These are made with partially hydrogenated vegetable oil; an adult can make the choice whether to eat them or not.  But why give them to kids with a perpetual sweet tooth who don't know any better? 1
it tasted awful almost stale and old and it smell bad .will not buy again bilberry tea was not for me even with all the great benefits. 1
I have generally fed Hills Science Diet to my cats over the years. This year I started over (my elderly cats have passed on) with a young cat and her litter. The mother was up and down with her apetite in the hot weather, during pregnancy and nursing, and not keeping a good weight. She also had an upset tummy off and on. So I tried a few different chows, and Purina One certainly agreed with her the best. Once or twice I went back to other brands (including the regular Purina chow) and they just did not agree with her. She also seemed hungry all the time on the regular Purina chow.<br /><br />Kittens are now 3 months old and glowing with health, as is their mom. The vet sang their praises at vaccination time, and even asked me what I was feeding them. It pays to try different brands if your cat is not happy. This one sure worked for us.<br /><br />The price is $6.95 at our local supermarket, though, so I won't be buying it here! 4
This is for the hardier consumer, taste wise. If you don't mind the flavor of powdered peas, this one is for you. Good texture, good dissolvability. Price is what you would expect--no bargain but not a killer. There is, however, most definitely the flavor of peas there, and nothing really covers it up. I like peas when they are green and I have to chase them around on my plate. In the form of a vanilla, or chocolate, or coffee, or banana, or blackberry, etc., etc. drink?--naw. 2
I love this company and what they are trying to do.  However, when I first got my celiac diagnosis, though, I got glutened by these.<br /><br />A couple of years passed.  The buzz on the celiac boards was that Mi-Del had really cleaned up their act, and that their cookies were safe.  From about 2004-2009, I ate these without incident.  I even figured out how to make cookie pie crusts in them and put the recipe in my gluten-free cookbook.  Then, I got a bad batch two times in a row, and got glutened again.<br /><br />Maybe they have problems with suppliers?  I understand they've been a lot more careful with the actual manufacturing process.<br /><br />It's sad, but I would buy Pamela's ginger cookies (available on Amazon!) instead. 3
Arrived quickly ..packaged as described .. Beans looked plump , However not so sure about the product .. First time with vanilla beans so not quite sure what they are suppose to look like ..only a very faint,faint smell of Vanilla ..smelled more of Bourbon than Vanilla ..Used 80 proof Vodka and half of the beans ..but it looked like mildew floating with the Vodka as well in my canning jar .. since I used a sterile jar ...it's not from my jar ... they arrived quickly  so I figure they came that way ... didn't see the mildew till I put it in with the Vodka..did a video on my phone of the floating mildew but can't get it uploaded ( not sure how just yet but will figure it out soon and leave an update )after looking up further on another site what they are to smell and look like .. I feel I got a poor quality and even mildewed product .. tried to leave a review of 3 stars because I was unsure of the product and it wouldn't let me thus the 2 stars ...did not contact the seller since I could not leave the feedback ! Will not be using this product or the rest of the beans since I already lost out on the Vodka as well.. This is my first bad review on a product .. been using Amazon since the 90's and had great luck on all the other products I have ordered ..I hate leaving bad reviews is why I waited and the product received great reviews is why I ordered them . 2
First had these Oloves as the result of a United flight. They were in a snack pack given to me for being moved from an aisle in EconomyPlus to a middle in the back of the plane, but I'd just eaten lunch. So I took them home.<br /><br />They're delightful! I just ordered a 10-pack of the Lemony Lover. Good for a lunchbox, road trip, afternoon snack or anything you want a proteiny, low-fat, low-carb snack. And because they're dry-packed in the European style instead of standing in brine like olives at most U.S. grocery stores, you can eat them with your fingers.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed them.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the're awfully pricey at $1.59 per packet. Behind a sandwich, it's the most expensive thing in my lunchbag. 4
I love pistachio nuts and I also like working with nut oils of all kinds. I had not even thougth of using pistachio oil.<br />After purchasing this oil and using it once as a salad dressing(spinach,nectarines and toasted pistachios) I am sold and am on a hunt for more ideas..I would welcome ideas. 4
I've tried several brands of almond milk and coconut milk (granted, I don't usually pay attention to if it's organic or not, this may one of the few organic options). I picked this up at the store as they were out of the coconut milk I usually get. This stuff tastes so bad, especially the smell. It has a faint smell of almonds, but a bitter soapy smell and tastes like soapy water. Maybe it's an acquired taste, but it was bad enough I wish I'd read a review first, and therefore thought I'd better leave one!<br /><br />Also, this is the same stuff I tried, but they may have reformulated it (my package didn't look quite the same, and it said "now with 25% less sugar"). 1
While certainly edible, I don't think Jack Links brings a realistic competitor here with their version of the Slim Jim.  Honestly, there are some bites I take which remind me of dog food.  I know we are talking about meat sticks here and not fine dining, but the texture of these is just not right, almost too granular.  I know Slim Jims have that greasy taste but these guys have a bit of it too and I have to admit I kind of enjoy it.  Overall, in my opinion, Slim Jims are much much better than these guys, but to each his/her own! 3
It has MSG.  That was not mentioned on any of the description nor on the manufacture's web-site.  Other than that, it tasted okay and the texture was average. 2
It's nice to see this product made with all-natural ingredients, with proceeds going to benefit educational institutions around the world.  The blackberry flavor is quite tasty although to all of us in the family it's more of a generic sweet fruit, not specifically blackberry-flavored.  But it's too sweet.  I tried cutting it with tap water but of course that flattens it (but makes it less sweet and more enjoyable); then I tried cutting it with plain seltzer water, and that was fine.  It retained the fizz.  But we probably won't buy this product (or any of the other Izze flavors) because when you want to grab a can of something to drink, you don't want to have to fiddle with mixers.<br /><br />Unfortunately the grapefruit flavor is the same.  There's a nuance of grapefruit flavor to it, but it's mostly just a too-sweet drink that makes our teeth feel funny.<br /><br />We also tried the Clementine flavor which is good in an unobtrusive, not-too-sweet way.  It's not as overly sweet as the blackberry, but still, this has as much sugar as a can of Coke, and Coke is much cheaper, comes in larger cans, and more easy to come by.  I was hoping this product would be less caloric, but it isn't.  So, this is not going to be a repeat purchase for us. 3
These condiments are overpriced and terrible. The classic is disgustingly sweet. The spiced tastes like a bad spicy marinara sauce from a chain restaurant. 1
I had hoped that this would taste like Pina Coladas but it doesn't.  It is rather nasty and left a film on my tongue.  I wanted something to drink after a work out or to give to my kids when we are traveling but it is to hard for me to swallow.  The reason I gave it 2 stars is because it is good in mixed drinks.  I have been able to add it to smoothies and drinks with alcohol.  If you are going to drink this straight, it helps if it is really cold....almost frozen.  If you really like the taste of coconut milk you might like this because that is the only thing I can taste in it, 2
I'm not a gourmet coffee critic, but this stuff is disappointing.  Based upon previous good reviews, I suspect that the coffee in the K-cups I received is not the same -- they may have changed the manufacturing.  The Wolfgang Puck Decaf I received is lifeless, watery, and tasteless.  There's no aroma when it's brewing in the Keurig.  Never again. 2
When I read the other review of this tea, I had to write.  This tea has a wonderful, balanced flavor that mixes the tartness of raspberry and the sweetness of peach to come up with a smooth blend.  I usually want a little honey in my tea, but this one doesn't really need it.  Makes a great iced tea, too! 5
purchased and it came looking new, as i had bought it NEW, but it was actually damaged.<br />customer service with the actual company is awful--as i needed to contact the company itself to return it. 1
My 2 year old Golden Retriever spends about an hour to get out all the kibble treats from the jug...<br /><br />No problems with the toy and she is a HEAVY Chewer... I would recommend it for a dog that is curious enough to keep at it for some time.... 4
When I bought this coffee I was expecting a light-roast coffee with smooth body and great flavor as could be found in some donut shops in days gone by.  For me, this doesn't fulfill either.  This coffee should be described as bold, there is nothing light about it.  Forget about smooth body, instead it has an acidity and bitterness that I found unpleasant.  I'm still debating just tossing it out or letting it collect dust in the event I need to use it if I'm out of all other k-cups.<br /><br />This coffee made it to my "Do not buy again" list. 2
Sent to my sister and she loved them!  Kind of costly but had free shipping which offset mailing cost to purchase and mail. 4
Royal Oak is the very best at this moment.  There are a dozen other brands that I have tried and, speaking as a former Virginian, this one is at the summit.  They are so large, so crunchy, and so tasty that you will insist on EATING THEM ONE AT A TIME.  The Royal Oak container is still a 40-ounce can, which was once the industry standard.  Many competitors have slipped to 36 ounces or even 32.  Be careful when you select others.  You may not be buying the number of peanuts you expected.  Don't accept any peanuts that were canned over six months ago, as they could be stale.  I am not connected with this company in any way, other than as a customer. 5
This is an excellent tea, very flavorful - the cinnamon is fresh and powerful, and overall it's slightly sweet without needing any sugar. Excellent with milk or straight. 5
I will continue to give these to my dogs. They like them and supposedly they clean their teeth.<br />I started to give these to my dog daily, but her digestive system did not like it enough for that. Most of it seems to be digestible, but she threw up green foam on the morning after the second day in a row of eating one-a-day greenies. Note that she was also constipated as well. Greenie advises to have plenty of water available for drinking these, so I am guess they know these side effects can occur. My dog has plenty of water available, but she didn't drink any more than normal, which may have resulted in the effects. I don't plan on training my dog to drink lots of extra water after eating these. Giving here one every now and then shows no negative effects, and that what I plan on doing.<br />Not a complaint to me, but I think people who like giving there dog all natural health food should know that this product is far from "green." It is pumped pull of artificial ingredients like a multivitamin. It is also made from concentrated grain protein, rather than the animal protein dogs should be getting. I personally don't feel that this is that big of a deal health wise for a creature than lives 12-18 years, but or people who invest the extra money on organic/natural dog food, you should be staying away from this product. 3
The idea behind buying this is to have a natural pick-me-up in the morning.  The problem is they have doses of things in it that are too high.  Back when the natural supplement/remedies law changed allowing manufacturers to sell so call natural products it created a problem and this type of product is one of the symptoms of that problem.  They can claim it's herbal and natural etc.  and put out stuff that is not good for you.  I curse the day I signed that partition in a Whole Food type of store.  A already sick pharmaceutical industry is now even sicker.  I want a do over on that damn change.<br />If you don't like my comment good for you.  If you leave a comment I will not be reading it.  So swear away. 2
illy cafe is the original portable coffee drink. It is plain coffee without milk, cream, or any sweetener. It's It may therefore, be more to the liking of coffee purists. illy drinks are available only in the cans (not in glass). While I might prefer glass, these cans are the only option for illy. They are available in 12 packs through Amazon. With a larger order you can get them with no charge for shipping making for a competitive price. They do not need to be refrigerated at all. However, they do taste better if refrigerated prior to consumption. 4
Some people don't like it, but if you like sharp cheese, you should like these.  I take them to parties and at least one person can't stop eating them every time.  I like them okay. 4
I was happy to find this gluten free cereal available, but am disappointed in the taste - I'm not tasting "honey nut".  In fact, these have very little taste. 3
I'm not sure exactly why I thought I'd like this Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla Flavored Ground Coffee, since I usually find Starbucks coffee not to my taste. The ground coffee has a nice vanilla smell while it's still in the bag but my first sip was a huge disappointment--it tasted decidedly harsh. I tried brewing it stronger and weaker; still harsh, almost acidic. The only thing that made it drinkable was adding quite a bit of sugar, and I really don't care for my coffee that way.<br /><br />The ingredient list claims "ground vanilla beans," which I wouldn't expect to have a harsh acidic taste. Vanilla is the second most expensive spice in the world (after saffron) and grinding the beans is known to be a good way of dispersing the flavor through hot liquids. How can it have gone so wrong in this product? Is it the coffee itself that's so unappetizing, or the combination? I just don't know.<br /><br />From now on I'll look for vanilla in baked goods and body lotion, and keep it out of my coffee. Sorry, Starbucks, I'm not a fan of this brew.<br /><br />Two stars, not really for the coffee but to encourage Starbucks to do better with recycling and other green issues, and to increase fair trade initiatives.<br /><br />Linda Bulger, 2010 2
I am a huge fan of Two Leaves and a Bud.  They make a beautiful English Breakfast Tea and many others.  I ordered this giant box of White Tea being a Tea lover and especially a White and Green Tea lover.  The idea of Rose Pedals in my Tea was also enticing and I dreamed about early mornings on my deck, sipping White Peony Tea with Angels flying and Songbirds singing.  Not really. But I did have high hopes for this Tea and I was let down.  The leaves are too small, the Tea goes bitter quickly and it's hard to brew as the bag won't immerse easily in the water.  Try Mighty Leaf Teas for real White and Green Teas.  They are almost unmatched in quality.  For more reviews please visit my blog [...] 3
I absolutely love this mix.  We keep it on our home bar and everyone loves it. 5
After reading the reviews on the salt I decided I wanted to make Kalaua pork for my husband to remind him of the 5 years we lived on Oahau.  Bummed that I got Lava salt instead of Alaea salt.  Amazon was great in crediting me for the wrong product but bummed I had to reorder and can't make the special dinner I had planned. 3
Like that is it organic, don't like that it comes in plastic containers.  Earth's Best was always our first choice, but Gerber Organics comes a close second. 4
I've tried all the flavors at least once.  Original and Teriyaki multiple times.  First batch of Original and Teriyaki was great, 2nd and 3rd batches too over-flavored.  Pepper was too peppery (and I love pepper).  Hickory was too strong/salty.  Just not consistent.  Not going to waste more money on this product. 2
This product is a great idea -- finally, someone made instant hot chocolate that contains recognizable food ingredients. Sadly, the flavor is very mild, and tastes more sweet than chocolately. Less sugar, more choc. would have been better.  I have to put in a little instant coffee to bring out the chocolate taste. 3
The package says that this is supposed to be practically break-proof, which I thought was perfect for my year-old Beauceron who is a pretty aggressive chewer.  Finally!  A toy that would make his brain work and keep him occupied.<br /><br />Three uses.  First one he very quickly discovered how to get the treats right out.  Second, he learned how to get the screw-off bottom to come off of the jug.  Third time - he chewed the plastic to bits by the time I got it away from him - and he was in the same room with me!<br /><br />I'm a dog trainer and only recommend high-endurance products for my clients.  This didn't even come *close* to meeting my expectations!  Total disappointment.  Will not buy another 'Premier' Busy Buddy toy for my chewer!<br /><br />At almost 3 years old, we still rely on the blue K9 Kongs, Holey Moley, and Everlast Treat balls to stand up to his strong jaws and chew drive! 1
I have 4 cats, and none of them really like these treats. They will eat them eventually, but the certainly don't go wild for them. I do like that grain and chicken free, so they are good for cats with allergies. 3
This was a gift for my husband.  We love to cook and have been intrigued by finishing salts for awhile.  We've used the white and the pink with good results.  Really liking them. 4
My dogs who will generally "play" or destroy any toy had no interest. I tried placing everything short of hotdogs into the jug with no avail. 1
No coffee gets 5 stars from me unless it was just roasted and ground within the last half hour. Additionally, I have no problems with acid reflux. Given that, I do like a light roast; not a fan of french roast or anything Starbucks.<br />Given that, this is the first french roast I have ever liked. I found it mild smooth and drinkable. I was surprised, especially given my low expectations. If the acid in some coffee bothers you, I think this is worth a try. 4
So I am the proud owner of an almost 80-lb. 1-year-old lab mix whose sole mission in life is to seek and destroy.  I have been looking for toys that would hold his interest longer than the 5 minutes it takes him to rip them to pieces, and saw this at my local pet store, but in the small size.  I was thrilled to see the larger size on Amazon, and ordered it.  This is a toy for smart dogs, and, of course, I like to think my dog is smart.  However, he may be too smart.  Gave it to my dog tonight.  It was interesting to watch him try to figure out how to get the treats out, and he seemed occupied.  I walked away to leave him to his work.  10 minutes later, he had chewed through the rope coming out of the top of the bottle.  He cheated.  This had potential to be an awesome, time-consuming toy to same some of my sanity.  Unfortunately, if you have a strong chewer, or a dog who can figure out the short cuts, save your money. 2
Vermont Country Blend is my favorite K-Cup. However, There were 2 different selections. Box of 24 for $24.25 and Box of 24 (Pack of 2) for $25.38.<br />I didn't see the (Pack of 2) for $1.13 more. Bummer! 3
These have a good kick, come in nice packaging, and have an initially good flavor, but they have a sour aftertaste that leaves a nasty flavor in your mouth that lingers.  Not exactly what I think of when I think of Cherry Jelly Bellies.  However, they do give you a quick shot of energy. 2
I have 4 felines of my own and feed the one who sleeps in my backyard who has been stopping by to eat supper on an  almost daily basis for 3 years.<br />I am never surprised at the things my finiky, spoiled kittys will turn their collective noses up about. I have learned through testing and error what they will generally eat, but they never cease to amaze me: will not touch crab, shrimp, calf liver or lamb. Usually they are pretty good about all things seafood though. I am aware that the older female is not fond of food in the form of Pate. However, I have two kittens who will generally eat whatever is put before them (the no crab, shrimp, liver or lamb rules were in place when they arrived.) The older male is better about taking on new things than the older female. He WILL eat pate.<br />This particular item Friskies Cat Foof Classic Pate, 4 flavor Seafood Variety Pack was purchased primarily for the outside kitty who is not technically mine. I buy Friskies food for him all the time. It is so convenient to have these Packs set up on Subscribe and Save. They are delivered to my front door and I do not have to lug them home from the local grocers. That gives almost everything that arrives from Amazon on a routine basis a 3 star rating from me to start with. Usually Subscribe and Save Items work UP to a 4 star or 5 star rating from there. I have no shame, but say with gratitude that those items have a favorable positive predjudice from me going for them from the beginning! This Pack was no exception. I thought my older female might refuse it, but expected to hysteria from the others, outside Kitty inclded.<br />All four inside cats are now getting a half of a 3 oz can at their back feeding station at supper time. I used to give them all a whole can, but jealousy of the kittens is still present, so each gets a half and then I go to fix dinner for my outside, feral guy who is known simply as "Yellow Kitty."<br />Now, I am not dense, I realize that the four of mine were accostomed to an entire 3 oz can each for supper at one point. Then the green eyed monster of Jealousy appeared on the scene and brought along with her Screeches and Skirmishes over what bowl belonged to whom (Each had his own station which was 10 feet away from the next fur person. Squabbles ensued anyway.) So the Front Feeding Station now has two bowls which hold a half can each and in the next room is the Kitten Station with two bowls which hold a half can. Everyone circulates around and disagreements have almost disappeared. I admit to the use on the elder cats of a calming collar: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003SLYWLQ">Calming Cat Collar 1 Count</a> and to the use of Feliway throughout the house.:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00608SVD4">Feliway Electric Diffuser Kit with Vial Electric Diffuser Kit with Vial</a>.<br />Having become an artist at cat rigamarole, I usually suceed in finding foods that the cats will eat. Friskies is a dietary staple. I receive The The Meaty Bits and the Seafood variety pack plus the Pouches of Gravy Sensations on a regular rotating basis. EVERYBODY will eat those. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00376301U">Friskies Prime Filets Seafood Selections Variety Pack, Seafood, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CJG2H2">Friskies Cat Food Meaty Bits Variety Pack, 24-Count</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012KIB8K">Friskies Gravy Sensations Pouch Favorites, 6-Flavor Variety Pack, 3-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 24)</a>.<br />The Pates being reviewed came up on Amazon's Recommendations For Me a few days ago. I was thrilled. This was a 32 pack instead of the 24 Packs that I usually get. So I ordered it right away. I was just about out of large canned food and none was due until mid January.<br />During my feeding production tonight, I gave part of one can of food, thereby using 3 of the varieties, placed at various feeding stations. I paid no attention to who ate what but headed out to feed the outside boy, Yellow Kitty. Salmon flavor had not gone to an indoor cat, so I gave it to him, along with a can of Mariner's Stew. Yellow Kitty eats a lot in the winter when it is cold and hunting is difficult. He is only fed in the evening, so will eat a lot at his first sitting, then nibble on and off until his next feeding.<br />Today was a BUSY DAY. It is 21ntin days until Christmas and I still have many things to wrap. Little last minute sales precipitate unplanned purchases, and that means more wrapping, and, what is for Christmas Dinner. Better be on that too!<br />So, I paid little attention to who ate what and went busily on my way. It must have also been "noisily" on my was as no one mentioned a thing.<br />As I was preparing for bed, I started turning off lights. The back door light was on. Yellow Kitty is fed by the back door. His wet food bowls were almost full though the dry food was almost depleted, which was unusual. Usually he eats the wet food first. Hmmmmmm.....<br />Front feeding station: Friskies Meaty bits which were a leftover, had disappeared. Otherwise, it appeared that one or two bites had been taken and then the rest was left. Kitten Room: Bowls were full, just as they were in the back feeding station. Oh well, I went to bed.<br />The next morning, bowls were still full. Breakfast of a different variety was served and gobbled down by all.<br /><br />This scenario took place several times over the next 10 days. Yellow Kitty, who lives outside, finally began to give in and eat about half his normal portion. My inside kids continued to nibble at the pate. They then ate some dry food and waited a bit, THEN BEGAN TO COMPLAIN LOUDLY FOR SOMETHING GOOD TO EAT! I finally caved and gave them a different menu.<br /><br />This product recieves 2 Stars which represents "I don't like it." I really would not personally have feeling about the Pate and would let the cats vote. HOWEVER 1. I have had to clean up several uneaten meals which means picking up and doing something with 4-6 bowls of disgusting looking brown stuff which purports that it is Cat Food; however, my guys will not eat it. 2. I have to delete my Subscribe and Save order. It ism't much of a pain to do so, but I like to think that if I put an item on S&S, I will give Amazon their money's worth and reorder the item several times. 3. Also, I now have about 3/4 of the pack in the cupboard and that must be taken out and donated to someone. It adds up to more work than I had in mind.<br /><br />I guess that is the 2 star bottom line: my cats will not eat it and it causes a disposal dilemma. Gabriella, Trinity, Mischief, Mercy, Yellow Kitty and I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT because none of my 5 Fur People will eat it. 2
These are great treats - in fact they are the only thing I use for my dog.  But this price seem way wrong - so far off as to possibly be incorrect??  In my local PetSmart they are $5.99. 3
My dog loves them, can carry in my pocket while on a walk for quick treats to help with training (acting appropriately around strangers) and then no crumbs in my pocket!  Little pricey, but I think they're worth it. (hence the 4 stars) 4
Tastes great, but has MSG and partially hydrogenated vegetable oil.  It's my fault for forgetting to check ingredients before ordering--but seriously, it should be unthinkable and illegal to use such chemicals in our food. 1
I really wanted to love Cherry Switch. I'm a big fan of cherry-flavored sodas and I like Switch's blend of natural juices, vitamin C, and filtered water. On paper, this seemed like the perfect beverage for me. In reality, it tasted like I was drinking a vitamin. You ever have one of those cherry-flavored acerola tablets? That's what drinking Cherry Switch is like.<br /><br />By no means if the beverage offensive; it's just not particularly tasty. I'll give it credit for being a natural product that offers vitamin C, but I'm dinging it for the taste. Would I got out of my way to buy this drink? Absolutely not. Would I buy it as an impulse purchase if I saw it at a deli? Maybe...but chances are, something else would get my attention.<br /><br />On another positive note, my wife liked the beverage because of its low carbonation. If regular soda is too bubbly for you then maybe you'll enjoy this product. 3
Don't waste your money on this product.  It did absolutely nothing to deter raccoons.  If you want to stop raccoons you have two options:  1)  Trap  2) Gun 1
I am impressed at how easy these are to use, much better than the one that you can buy from Keurig.<br />Great company to buy from when i go through these will reorder again 5
I love Happy Baby products but this is GROSS. Unless your child really loves Spinach (in which case, why would you be buying this? you could just feed them spinach : )<br />It just tastes awful. UGH. 1
Is so good. Lots of flavor and great coffee taste. Especially good to wake up with. Enjoy this coffee. I give it a plus 10. 5
For the price (which was a little high), I fully expected to get what I ordered. .......16 ounces of fresh Vanilla tootsie roll midgies. I got two 7-ounce bags. Thats not a pound of candy. And not worth the price. Disappointed in the un-true quantity description. 2
This is the first STASH tea I will not purchase again. I won't be giving it away or toss it out to get rid of, but . .  where is the mint!?  Very, very mild mint flavor. With Moroccan Mint clearly plastered on the box, I really expected more flavor. 3
I bought these because they are a quick and easy way to get my coffee fix.<br />The price on Amazon was 50% cheaper than what I saw at StarBucks stores.<br /><br />They are not as good as fresh brewed coffee, but the result is still impressive.<br />This is not the rancid instant coffee that has been around for decades.<br /><br />I gave this three stars because the flavor is adequate only.<br /><br />These will not replace brewed coffee, but will definitely be useful when I'm short on time or options! 3
This one is not the recent style. But still good. Will not recommend this one since the new one is better. Thanks! 3
The food is great, but the bag that I got from amazon seemed very stale - half of it was smashed to powder, and you can get a better pricess elsewhere. 3
would never order from this company again. they are based out Miami, FL, I live 40 miles north in Boca Raton, Fl, it took abt 3-4 weeks for the product to arrive. they apologized when I inquired about my delivery and they offerred to send a compensation gift, which I never received. 1
We had an earlier model of this jug, with a rope instead of the rubber "rope."  My dog was able to get the food out a little easier, which I preferred.  This rubber thing in the middle quite effectively blocks the food and my dog gives up.  She used to eat her whole meal everyday in the old jug.  So I am disappointed they changed it. 3
Its great to be able to get sugar this way.Its not good to eat but if you are going to use sugar at least this is not processed to an unhealthy state on top of what sugar does to your body,and i am helping the  fair trade farmers.It is a good thing all around.I am happy i can get it in Amazon. 5
I should have read the ingredients list before purchasing this - they are not plain roasted walnuts or tasty roasted walnuts. I did not care for them at all. Strange combination of sugar and garlic coating. 1
I just got these beans and have pulled a couple dozen shots, trying out different permutations of amount, grind, tamp.<br /><br />I'm disappointed as I expected a better flavor from the beans.<br /><br />The beans have a strong midrange coffee flavor and a strong sharp lemon note. The midrange coffee flavor is uncomplicated but good. A little chocolaty perhaps The lemon note is unpleasant for my taste which makes the beans go from a four star to a three star.<br /><br />When you pull a good espresso shot it tastes smooth for about 10 seconds, then the lemony taste creeps in and makes it unpleasant.<br /><br />The lemony taste is good in milk drinks however, it provides some character and interesting flavor. The strong coffee flavor also stands up to the milk and gives it a good flavor. I like lattes with these beans.<br /><br />The overall verdict is meh. If you only want milk drinks then these beans might suit you. If you like shots, I'd advise you to look elsewhere. 3
Berries are find, but the package is bad. Unable to open neatly and then it rips open and your berries are all over the floor. 3
My baby loves this apple sauce. He didn't like the gerber brand at all, but yummys this down right away and I like that it is organic. 5
I am a Teavana tea freak, love the stuff, but this one tastes very odd.  Has an odd chalk flavor similar to tums or pepto, very odd can't figure it out.  Big dissapointment, especially at the price! 1
I ordered the Grade B Hidden Springs Syrup -- Grade B is my favorite for baking.  I love the strong, rich maple flavor.  This is my favorite amongst several maple syrups that I've ordered from Amazon.  Maple syrup is understandably expensive, but this syrup is a good value among its' competitors. 5
I ordered these to try them out and the price was cheaper than the supermarket.  The cinnamon apple bars are not tasty at all.  They have a very dry texture and taste chalky with a (surprisingly) bitter after taste.<br /><br />Basically, they are not palatable...there are better fiber bars out there--especially the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YNQRSM">Gnu Foods Flavor & Fiber Cinnamon Raisin 1.6 oz. (Pack of 16)</a> --<br /><br />I know a few people gave high ratings to this, but honestly, these bars are not very good at all.....YUCK is the best way to describe them. 1
We have a pug that suffers from chronic ear infections and skin problems.  We've consistently kept him on expensive brands that are well known for having good ingredients like California Natural, Chicken Soup for the dog lover's soul, Royal Canin, and a couple others that I can't remember off the top of my head.<br /><br />My Mom picked up this Newman's food because it was available at the grocery store.  They love the food, but what really surprises me is that his ears and skin have improved dramatically.  His stools are also much firmer and way less stinky than before.  This food seems like a real winner for us. 5
I have been drinking espresso a long time and use the beans in my Jura X90 commercial automatic espresso machine.  Larry's beans are way too light to work as an espresso blend.  The coffee tastes good, but it is not the strong taste that a seasoned espresso drinker is looking for. 2
The taste was ok, but every cup ended up having sediment at the bottom of the cup.  I will not be buying this brand again.  So far, Brooklyn Bean Cyclone and Coffee People Jet Fuel are my favorites. 3
I can't imagine why but it seems that grocery stores have stopped stocking this item. If you haven't tried it you must, it is the best coating mix available and my family keeps asking me to make chicken only with this shake and bake. It has a very different flavor than any BBQ sauce on the market, a flavor all it's own that is really delicious and goes with any side dish. I have made stuffing, mashed potatoes (a favorite) and almost any vegetable to go with it and everyone always has a second helping of chicken.It's perfect for company because it is unique and tastes like something you would cook for a special occasion. I am always afraid that they will stop making it, it really has become a staple in our home and even the most finicky people love it, kids all seem to love it and I love it because it is quick and easy. It's a very unique flavor, I want to say a little sweeter than most BBQ sauces or flavorings but not really sweet , kind of like a honey BBQ but better, that can be used on pork chops as well. There is a plastic bag enclosed to shake it in but I find that more of the mix sticks to the sides and it is very hard to coat the chicken , a lot of wasted mix that way. I put it on a plate a little at a time and add as needed, then I rinse the chicken pieces and kind of lightly roll them on the plate in the coating (shaking a little out of the packet on spots that are not coated) and then place them into a baking pan that I line with foil, it makes clean up much easier after cooking, almost don't need to wash the pan this way.Try to get all the pieces covered especially on the tops because the bottom will come off a little bit from the grease that cooks out of the chicken. Any mix left in the packet I shake on pieces that don't look completely covered and then just on top of all of them. I usually get a package of about 3 or 4 half breasts and a package of 6 thighs and one pack of mix will cover it all if you roll it on a plate. It becomes very sticky when it gets wet so it will stick to the plate, your fingers and of course the chicken pieces. I have also used a little bit of plum jam brushed on the chicken before coating it and thats very good too, but honestly you don't need to add anything it is delicious the way it is. Cook it long enough to get browned and crispy and remove it to a serving dish right away so it doesn't sit in the grease and you will be extremely happy with the results. I would really be interested to hear from someone who has never cooked with this before and see what they think. 5
What can I say??? This is delicious on any day.  Sip til your heart's content. 4
I really love Cheez-ITs. I can sit down in front of the tv with a box and before I know it, it's half gone. But these were different. I don't know why, but I expected just a little more from this box, and yet it seemed to fall just short of hitting the nail directly on the head. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed them, but they left an odd after-taste in my mouth that I honestly wasn't that crazy about.<br />Not much else to say, but I do hope that this review helped you in one way or the other.<br />Enjoy. 4
When i opened the package the box was wet, so i figured out why it was wet, i found it came form the spam can, the can was not sealed enough, and i guess its not healthy to eat it, but i already opened one can, wonder if i can return the remaining cans,the expiration is year 2014 but i guess it will only last maybe few days since the can wasnt not sealed enough. 1
I bought this juice because I really like mangoes. It is great refreshing and smooth beverage that everybody in our family enjoy. Will buy again. 5
I really tried this with an open mind. I love hot tea in the afternoon as well as other 'soothing' drinks. But this one was a killer. It comes as a powder to mix with hot water. It doesn't say how much water on the packet so I assumed that one packet is for one cup of water (as per the directions on this site).<br /><br />One sip put me into the gag zone. I'm sorry to say that it was horrible. It was bitter, spicy, too strong, and way over the top. I like ginger but in small doses. This was like chewing on a piece of ginger root. I guess there are some people that like that but for me, it was not a good experience. I tried additional sips just to be sure but it was a killer taste each time. And, it's hard to get the strong ginger taste out of your mouth.<br /><br />I know this is a personal choice but my choice is to stay away.<br /><br />*****Added note*****<br />My husband tried it and liked it. He would have given it a 3-4 star rating. It just goes to show the difference in what our taste buds like and how this is truly a personal taste opinion. 1
Until I found this item, I was taking up valuable storage space in my overhead cabinet with 3 boxes of K-cups.  (I like variety!)  This tray is sturdy, holds plenty of K-cups, and basically disappears from view once you put it under your Keurig.  I love it so much that I ordered one for my cousin - we both grew up reciting "a place for everything, and everything in it's place" - guess what?  She loves it, too!  If you're lamenting having bought the carousel, simply sell it at your next garage sale and give this tray a try! 5
They taste pretty good. I eat one of these with some of the poultry selections from Omaha Steaks. It makes a great meal. 4
I'm a big fan of Buffalo chicken and beef jerky, so I thought I'd love the Jack Link's Flamin Buffalo Chicken Nuggets.  I was wrong.  I bought the Steak Nuggets as well, which aren't as good as Jack Link's jerky, but definitely tasted better than the Buffalo Chicken Nuggets.<br />To put it bluntly, they tasted like an old chunk of salty chicken with a slight Buffalo flavor.  They're not very spicy, I was expecting more of a kick.  They also smelled a little funny.  I'd give Buffalo chicken jerky a try, but I won't be buying these ever again. They're OK, but there's so many better options out there. 3
Green Mountain is our favorite coffee.  We switched from grinding our own to K cups recently.  We still love Vermont Country Blend and Heifer Hope, but this is the ultimate K-cup for us.  A medium roast, rich but not bitter.  It satisfies every time. 5
I purchased these chips on October 18, 2010.  They were rancid/stale so you can certainly believe the other reviewers.  I had not noticed the reviews about the horrible taste and staleness of these chips.  I wish I had.  I contacted customer service for a refund which they approved but I think Amazon should either stop selling these chips due to such poor reviews or check their stock to make sure they are FRESH. If you order, you should order with caution.  I am trying another brand instead of reordering these. 1
I have never tried an illy product before but I love coffee and was excited to try this product. I like the taste of this espresso flavored drink for the most part but it has a slightly artificial taste to it. Each 6.8 fluid ounce can has 50 calories. They display it on the can in a way that leads you to believe that should be good but straight espresso doesn't have any calories so 50 calories worth of sweetener seems like a lot to me. The size of the can is quite small as well. For the cost of this product I would think that they could be a little more generous with the size of the drink. It's nice and convenient while on the go and I like the energy boost from the caffeine. 3
I like these and order them pretty regularly. They are good if you want a portable snack that is low calorie and low carb. 4
This coffee is supposed to taste like vanilla, but it somehow manages to taste like cherry cough syrup. That may sound crazy, but both myself and a coworker have said the same thing: "tastes like cough syrup." It's not the worst coffee I've ever had (still tastes fine if you mix in lots of cream and sugar), but it definitely doesn't taste like vanilla at all. The flavor is just kind of weird, and strong. 2
Lentils are one of the oldest cultivated products.  There are about 35 varieties of lentils available commercially.  I really like this variety.<br /><br />I thought that they would cook-up to be blacker rather than brown but I was mistaken.  I used a really simple recipe to compare them to other lentils:<br /><br />6 cups low sodium chicken broth<br />1 cup lentils<br />1 bay leaf<br />1 finely diced onion<br /><br />Cook it until the lentils start to break and you're good to go.  Compared to other lentils, I found these to taste (but not look) better. 4
These FunBites treats are a typical rawhide dog treat. They are cylinders, about 5-inches long with about a 1-inch diameter, and are stuffed with hard, brown filling.<br /><br />You get seven of them in a pack, and I guess the idea is to let your dog chew on them for awhile so that his or her teeth get nice and clean. Given their girth, I imagine this would take awhile for most dogs to get through, so it should give your dog something to do for an hour or two when you're away. But apparently the big selling point of the product is its "digestive support" which it apparently gets this property by containing papain enzyme - that may mean more to you than it does to me. It's also apparently "low fat" which according to the nutritional information means that it contains somewhere between 0.5% - 3.5% 'crude fat.'<br /><br />However, my dog's digestion and fat consumption are not problematic, so what really matters to me is whether he likes it... which he doesn't. I can't blame FunBites very much, he's generally not a fan of rawhide treats, but I was hoping their "delicious peanut butter flavor" would get him interested. Unfortunately, he just licked the treat a couple of times and walked away.<br /><br />That said, if this is the type of treat you think your dog might like then you may want to give it a whirl - especially if you're overly concerned about digestive issues (though other reviewers have apparently had problems, so be careful). 3
The same item at stop and shop for 2.19$ x12 =26.28  Save you money 1
Despite looking good "on paper," this granola isn't very nutritious.  The recommended serving size (there must be some government regulation that pegs cereal servings at around 1 ounce) is only 1/4 cup!  Who is going to sit down and have just 1/4 cup of cereal for breakfast?  I'm thinking more like 3/4 cup.  This will put you at 500 calories if you add a cup of (skim) milk.  And most of the protein will be coming from the milk, since even three "servings" of this granola will only give you 6g.  (See the pictures I uploaded for a closeup of the Nutrition Facts label and what one serving looks like.)<br /><br />But if you do go and have yourself a 500-calorie bowl of cereal (570 if you're using whole milk), it's actually pretty filling.  With 18g of sugar in a 3/4-cup triple serving, you're going to be feeling kind of guilty, but the triple serving would have 6g of fiber, so at least that will help slow down the sugar spike.<br /><br />The taste is pretty good.  It's kind of like you went for a hike with a chocolate bar and some trail mix and they melted together.  Can't go wrong with that!  With the notes of coconut, it kind of reminded me of German chocolate icing.<br /><br />I didn't think I'd like the berries, but I do, and I actually wish the mix had more (and bigger pieces of them; these are minuscule).  Watch out if you order online and the weather is hot.  My bag arrived kind of melty (made me feel like I'd been hiking!), but I take that as a sign of the chocolate's quality.<br /><br />If this weren't so carby (and expensive), I could happily sit down and eat it every morning.  But it is, so I won't. 4
This is the worst coconut milk ever. My wife is Thai and we had used this brand before and appreciated that it was organic and BPA free cans. However, now its made in Sri Lanka and the quality of the coconut milk is unacceptable. The packaging is completely misleading as the product looks nothing like the image on the label. I would give it zero stars if that was a choice. I now have 11 cans of inedible coconut milk. 1
This is as good as what I had in Peru - try mixing 1 tablespoon with 8 oz of an alfredo sauce - mix in shreaded chicken previously (2 breast)  cooked to your liking - let simmer on low for about 15 minutes - awesome 5
From the above review (just like fresh) I purchased this product (Royal Anne Cherries). The previous reviewer was about as wrong as possible. The cherries are mush, tasteless and certainly not worth the money.<br /><br />Only reason I gave one star is I could not give 0 stars. 1
These chips (all flavors of the variety pack) are really terrible.  I have thrown away a lot of them and suffered through eating some of them.  They are over spiced and nasty. 1
Hun Fung? Who wrote this?! They can't even spell sriracha! It's the same Huy Fong sauce from Rosemead, CA, and full of preservatives. Go for Shark brand from Thailand. 2
The coffee cartels and monopolies are desperately trying to control market prices, enter Coffee Bean Direct, offering a great product for a very reasonable price, and oh soo fresh too! That $8.99 a pound stuff at the grocery is just not on the same page! I am gonna shut up now; you need to go order up a bag and see for for yourself! 5
I love these so much I'd give them a 10-star.  I love them so much I have an Amazon subscription so they get mailed to me regularly.  I discovered them at Henry's but they're the only cracker on the shelf that are always sold out so when I saw the 10 pack here I was so happy.<br /><br />I eat them as a bread substitute with everything!  Can't go wrong with the calories and they don't have a strong flavor to mask the food so really they can be eaten however way you like.  Endless possibilities ... 5
Snappy white popcorn is one of the best popcorn I have ever tried. Very tasty and most every kernel pops every time. 5
I received my Lickety Stik bacon flavored dog treat from the Amazon Vine Program, free in exchange for writing a review.<br /><br />I thought this product was a kind of stick, based on the name of it. Instead it's a flavored liquid in a bottle with a roller ball something like a deodorant applicator.<br /><br />We have a beagle who loves treats and loves to chew.  I thought he would like this treat simply because I was giving it to him.  He did understand that he had to lick the ball to get the flavor, but he wasn't impressed.  Two sniffs, three licks and he was done.<br /><br />I don't think this treat is safe for dogs unless you stand there and hold it for them.  Any chewing on their part will either separate the roller ball from the end and choke them, or their teeth will puncture the container and the liquid will go everywhere.  It's certainly not a treat you can give them and turn your back.<br /><br />I much prefer treats that they can totally eat, and I can't see this "rollerball" treat being very popular with pet owners. 3
I ordered these simply out of curiosity. All those rumors about space food people have been spreading around. First of all this is NOT what NASA eats as their regular food supply. They do in fact have real fruits and other things like meat products and they do have freeze-dried snacks to reduce the weight on the space shuttle. this food is extremely light weight as compared to traditional foods. On a space shuttle launch every pound costs thousands of dollars so literately every pound counts. I would see this being a good snack pack for the crew of a space shuttle on the bridge or other space craft crew or the I.S.S(International Space Station)teams. But let me explain what exactly you are supposed to get in this sampler. Two 4inchesx4inches freeze dried astronaut ice cream squares one green mint chocolate chip and the other strawberry/vanilla/chocolate combo flavor, and one freeze dried ice cream sandwich. You also should get two astronaut space food energy bars with a refrigerator magnet. One chocolate and the other peanut butter. So basically what they show in the picture is what you get in this food sampler. But if you ask me it did make me thirsty. So I would drink a good amount of water after eating this stuff. Oh and FYI the ice cream is broken up into peaces so you can eat smaller peaces of of it. So my opinion is great sampler for the money. Just have water with yours. 4
Arrived completely melted.  This was strange because it was not hot where it arrived, it must have melted during transit or even where it had been stored. 1
I shopped around a little after purchasing this antler chew, and I really don't think this one was a good deal. It is about 6 inches long, as advertised, but pretty thin. Also my dog, who usually goes crazy for elk antlers, isn't really interested in chewing it. I recommend ordering from Grateful Shed Antler Chews instead. 2
The main reason the Newton Fruit Thins earned 3/5 instead of 4/5 is because I'm the only one who liked them out of all the people I tested them on.<br /><br />Let me back up. These Fruit Thins are flat, crispy cookies with a touch of fruit flavor (Being from the Fig Newton family, I expected a bit of moisture, but you'll never get confused that you're getting one of your daily fruit servings from these cookies).  Since Amazon sent me an entire package, I shared it with my 8th grade students and some adults. The students across the board tolerated the cookie, but wouldn't select it given a choice. The adults were mixed in their reviews. Some gave it a thumbs down, citing a cardboard bland taste, and others loved it as a low-calorie snack (about 50 calories per cookie.<br /><br />Me, I think they live up to their name--a crispy thin with a hint of fruit. If you like graham crackers, you may like these, although they aren't as flavorful. I certainly don't find the 'luscious flavor of figs, sweet raisins and honey' advertised on the package. A couple of setbacks: The fruit is so sparse--ninth on the ingredient list and behind 'folic acid' and 'palm oil'--I don't know how they can call it 'real fruit'. It is 0 carbohydrates, which is good, but it's also 0% of vitamin C, A and Calcium. You won't eat these for their nutrients.<br /><br />One complaint: the packaging is inferior. When I opened the bag and tried to use the retie at the top, it fell off, so I had to transfer the crisps to a plastic bag.<br /><br />Overall, a good choice for a snack that doesn't overfill you. 3
There are very seldom any unpopped kernels, which is nice and the flavor is wonderful. Not a whole lot to say about popcorn. I always buy from you guys and will continue to. 5
I had no reason to buy a gluten-free bar, but the reviews won me over. These are incredible! They taste great -- chocolatey with hints of coconut -- and they actually stave off my hunger for more than twenty minutes, which no snack bar has ever done. Even shortly after eating something like a clif bar I'm ready to gnaw someone's arm off. I'll eat one of these before I go for a long run; it doesn't weigh me down, but I have something in me so I don't feel nauseous afterward. I bought these on sale, but I think I'm going to take the plunge and buy them at the non-sale price. That in itself is an amazing review coming from me. 5
Ya- its okay.  The price point is great so ya get what ya pay for - average.  My fresh(er) french chicory goes for about $12 a pound.  I mix it with my ground coffee.  I prefer my coffee perked so this fine ground tends to go through the basket a bit - not a big bother. 3
After reading all of the positive reviews, I was anxious to try out this product.  I was so disappointed when I got it.  The texture is chalky and the taste to me is unpleasant.  It was really quite solid so I warmed it up so that I could mix it up better.  It became more of a spreadable consistency, but the grainy texture and the taste did not improve.  I'm going to try using some of it in my smoothies, but if it still doesn't taste good to me, it's going into the garbage.<br /><br />I also ordered the Artisana coconut butter and Artisana macadamia butter.  I had the same same bad experience with the coconut butter in that the texture was grainy and the taste was unpleasant to me.  I did, however, really like the macadamia butter a lot. 1
I enjoy this tea daily with lemon. I had been drinking the stash green tea that isn't organic. I may like the non-organic a bit better but it always depends on the batch. I doubt this compares to fine, whole-leaf, carefully brewed tea but I'm no connoisseur.<br />I put a bag in a travel mug, pour in the hot water, add some reconstituted lemon juice, and I'm happy. If the tea, or any beverage for that matter, were too good, it would distract me from my work, which I would rather not be doing, but I have to eat and pay the bills. 4
I ordered this product for a themed baby shower. They went over well and they tasted just like normal cracker jacks. Loved that I could find the box and they fit perfect in favor bags. 5
I ordered this product because I have enjoyed Crystal Light since it first came on the scene. I was really looking forward to enjoying all the packettes of drink. I have high blood pressure and imagine my dismay when I discovered the Strawberry (which I was very much anticipating) was an "energy" drink with caffiene added. I had always relied upon Crystal Light because I did not have to worry about getting ingredients which would be harmful to my health, however if I had not noticed the caffiene in the packettes and drank them my blood pressure would have shot up and I could have had ill effects from it. I threw all the Strawberry packettes in the trash so I did not feel I got the value that I paid for because in the discription there was nothing about caffiene. 3
These are not the famous ghost chilis that send you screaming in pain, they are a smoked chili of mild heat. I was unhappy with them because I wanted fire and got a fizzle. I will say they add a smokey element to what you are adding it to but not much heat. If you want a little extra flavor they work but if you want heat keep looking. I have a bunch of hot sauces way hotter and a bottle of 1,000,000 scoville unit capcacin extract that made everyone that tried it totally light up in pain. Now that's what a ghost chili is supposed to do. 3
Perhaps this coffee would be surprisingly better if I had a special single-serving pod brewer as the page here recommends, but I don't.  We tried this coffee a couple different ways.  Once I put three pods into a 20oz coffee brewer and it was sort of like coffee-flavored water.  Then we tried using it like a tea-bag.  We've sort of given up.  It is sitting on the counter and I think I will just throw it away.  I can't seem to make a decent cup of coffee with it at all. 2
Not what I expected. From the taste I honestly thought it might be a vegetarian concoction.<br /><br />I will not buy again. 1
I will start by being kind, It is a good idea to save money with an item or concept like this. It makes good sense to use your own coffee beans and avoid the cost of the pre-filled commercial K-cups you buy at the store.<br /><br />Now, I received my DisposaKups over a month after ordering them and put them to use.  I was immediately disappointed, filters did not hold very much coffee, It was a struggle to get the lids to fit together with the filter and outer plastic cup.  The coffee was very weak.<br /><br />This product actually creates more waste in a landfill than the commercially made K-cups. The body and lids are plastic.  Normal K-cups do not have a plastic lid.  Notice they say 100% disposable....So put them in the trash. They are not recyclable = landfill.<br /><br />They are not convenient, they are a bit messy, a pain to put together and still expensive.  Not worth it! There are better alternatives out there that will save you money, make better coffee and not go into a landfill.<br /><br />Sorry, I wish I had better news, I think I will return these. 1
I guess I was expecting a more authentic beef jerky but the texture and flavor of this is terrible. It reminds me of the "parts is parts" commercial that used to run on TV about all the bad pieces being pressed together to make a totally unpalatable piece of food. I was very disappointed in this and will never purchase it again. 1
I love juice and I love carbonated beverages, but it is difficult to see this product having a long retail life.<br /><br />Essentially, this is a good drink that doesn't really do anything well.<br /><br />It doesn't taste good enough to be a juice replacement--and is there really a need for a juice replacement?  It might have limited value in camping situations or during other times where small cans make better travelers.<br /><br />It's not exactly a post-workout recovery drink.  Juice would be better.  Minute Maid juice, for instance, has less sugar and carbohydrates, even though Switch doesn't add any sugar.  And there are plenty of other juices that have more nutrients, including Calcium and other vitamins and supplements, including potassium.  So, it's less healthy than most juices.<br /><br />Switch isn't exactly a diet soda because of the natural sugar content comapared to zero sugar in diet drinks.<br /><br />As a regular alternative to sugared soda, it tastes good, but there is nothing really to distinguish it from other fruit-based sodas.  And, $22 a case, it's more than twice as expensive of sodas that come in bigger cans.<br /><br />So, in the end, Switch is worth a try but likely not something you will habitually buy. 3
I have been following directions for about a month with the kefir I received--which by the way was a very miniscule amount, looked to be a little less than a teaspoon!  It does something--resulting in curds resembling cottage cheese, but so far I see nothing like translucent "kefir grains" developing. I have an excellent source of fresh raw cows milk and I've tried 24 and 48 hour culturing.  I've tried draining it using a plastic can colander and straining it in a regular plastic colander.  Maybe kefirs vary from source to source.  I am still new at this.  So far I just mix part of the curds into already made yogurt and put the rest back into the jar to make more of this stuff. I did appreciate the referral to Dom's site 3
Not really the best tea but not awful either. It is good if you just feel for a cup of tea and don't have anything else. 4
I enjoyed the vanilla flavor of this shake.  It was smooth, not gritty.  Although I am not sure I would be a regular user of this.  After a workout I am not concerned with replenishing calories.  If I am I will have a piece of chicken.  Usually I am more concerned with hydration.  I am not knocking this product for its lack of hydration (it is not meant to be used for that), I am just explaining why I would not use it regularly.  I could see that it would be nice if I know I have to run off somewhere and I can having anything to eat.<br /><br />That said, I did not find this shake very filling.  Within the hour I was looking for something else to eat. 3
I bought this fondant to use with young teen girls who had no experience with fondant.  We used gel colors to make several different colors, and the gel colors worked beautifully with this fondant.  We didn't need the expensive cake decorator colors to get gorgeous results.  The other thing I liked was this fondant was not hard to work with.  If you can work with playdoh, then you can work with this fondant.  AND it tasted good, too!  I have tasted other fondants and it looks pretty, but you peel it off before you eat your cake.  With this fondant you will actually want to eat it as well as look at it.  This is a good choice for cooks who like their creations to look and taste good. 4
I had a hard time drinking this tea as it tastes like cardboard! There's no taste or flavor. I don't know if it actually works to strengthen the uterus as I wasn't able to make myself have it for the couple of months required. I'm not sure if all raspberry tea tastes like this or just this brand. 2
This tea comes in individual packets. It's kind of crystalized, not exactly powdered, but it dissolves quickly and easily. It has a very strong ginger bite to it to please those of you that are disappointed with the weak ginger taste of ginger ale and some ginger beers. I love ginger and enjoyed this tea immensely. It was flavorful without adding sweetener or lemon. 4
We ordered the product...our dog loves them...but no one cares if its 100 degrees outside.  recieved in one big melted ball.  thought they would ship in dry ice.  If its summer or hot in your area dont order them !! 1
The names of these juice drinks rarely really reflect the majority of what is actually in them.<br /><br />Ingredients: 100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, kiwi, acerola, raspberry and strawberry juice concentrates), natural flavors, ascorbic acid (vitamin c).<br /><br />I've never heard of acerola and I want to know what the "natural flavors" are.  Anyway, its really mostly apple and grape. Of course, you probably don't want to drink pure kiwi and berry juice, they are just the "flavor".  So, this is a lighter flavored alternative.  I like that the carbonation isn't overdone.  There's just a bit of fizz.  Its sweet, but not horribly.  Its definitely better than soda and I like it better than the other carbonated juice drink that I have tried (other one had too much carbonation).<br /><br />I get irritated that the nutrition facts are so brief.  Surely this stuff provides more vitamins and minerals than vitamin C.  Did they kill the vitamins in the manufacturing process or are they just not telling us what is there.  If its there, you'd think the company would want to advertise it.  If it isn't, where did it go?  (BTW I have this gripe about most nutrition labels).<br /><br />So, its a good drink, probably good for you and definitely better than soda. 4
I have no choice but to drink "half caff" since my stomach does not deal well with full caff anymore.  So this is the only half caff product I could find.  Honestly, it tastes very watered down.  I don't like it but have no choice.  It's either this, or no coffee at all.  Please make it stronger.  Thank you. 2
I did a search on Amazon for Kettle reduced fat chips, hoping to find a good deal on Kettle brand chips.  I stumbled upon these Deep River reduced fat kettle chips, and liked the per bag price (works out to about $1.50 per bag, about half the price of a similarly sized bag of Kettle brand chips at my local grocery store).  I am so glad I ordered these.  I love the taste, and I love the texture, and never would have guessed they were reduced fat.  I particularly like the short list of ingredients: Potatoes, Sunflower or Corn oil, and Salt.  That's it.<br /><br />I do wish Amazon would make it easy to find the nutritional information...so, here are the basics: 12-chip serving (28g) is 120 calories, 6g fat, 1g fiber.<br /><br />I will definitely order these again. 5
Newman's Own organic chocolate is pretty good. It may have a little waxy taste than other dark chocolates, but it has a nice consistency. 4
These are my favorite, but they aren't for everybody. In a way, they sort of taste like Oriental flavor ramen, but with a kick. For me, how can one go wrong with the combination of jalapeno and ginger? They are a bit rich, so they aren't for EveryDayForAMonth snacking. Because this is a case purchase, I recommend trying out a single bag before buying an entire case. The 2oz size seems to be no longer available, which is a shame; I can eat the entire 5oz bag. 5
Maybe it is because of decaf, but this one has no taste of green tea. I am a Japanese who has been drinking various green tea for 4 decades. If it does not have to be decaf, go for Takaokaya genmai tea. 2
I really like this brownie mix.  Unfortunately my local grocer has stopped carrying them - hence buying them from Amazon!!  They are easy to prepare and bake up very nicely.  Very moist and I think it has just the right amount of chocolate flavor.  Yes, they are healthy and are more dense than traditional brownies - but they fill my chocolate craving better and I really feel like I have eaten dessert - not just some fluff from a box.  [...] 5
My 9 month old refused to eat more than a bite of this stuff. I tried it and I couldn't blame him. This stuff tastes terrible! 1
104 once tin at local store $18.99.I thought I'm getting better deal at Amazon for two  this size and not 34 ounce.My bad ........... I should've pay more attention.If you have only seen my face when I opened the package ;-)I didn't know they make tiny tins like that.Funny! Too bad I cannot return it ;-(....The highest price I've seen so far in other stores is $27.99 for 3 L (104 fl oz)........still cheaper than here!!!!!!!!Check your local store! 1
basically glop rolled in sesame seeds - very poor texture - not fun to try to eat 1
Ordered it, but they didn't have it in stock, luckily they promptly gave me a refund. 3
I usually buy this at our local Whole Foods or Harris Teeter it's a great product but when I ordered it from Amazon all but 2 out of 12 cans arrived dented. Amazon quickly replaced the order but in the replacement case 9 cans were dented. That is really unacceptable. They did refund my $ but I really want the pumpkin so I am going to try one more time and order it again and see if I can get a case of undented cans. 3
I have used it in cooking and the taste is good. The bottle is huge. The price is worth what you get. 4
Each of the different Wat-aah! varieties have themes. I picked up the Power theme at the Natural Foods Expo, and I asked the guy what made it different. He looked a bit stunned, but he pointed out the magnesium in it and then looked at me blankly. That's one of two things wrong with the company's marketing. Everything else is spot on--well, except that they're selling water, and they're selling it to parents who should be making their kids drink water whether they want to or not. But that would require parenting. I digress.<br /><br />The other thing wrong with this product is the label copy. I don't know what the other bottles say, but I'm guessing kids aren't buying this water, so the label copy SHOULD sell the parents rather than the kids, but I would think the parents would reject the water, based on the copy. The copy explains to kids that they should fight to drink this cool Wat-aah! Power instead of spinach, because of the magnesium, which is apparently the only value in spinach. I digress again. The label even says that spinach "is green and sticks in your teeth" in comparison to the water that "comes in a cool bottle." Right under all of this is a Fight Childhood Obesity logo. Right. So, I'm going to bring something into the house that argues against them eating spinach, AND that helps me fight childhood obesity how? Now, I'm not saying that spinach is the answer, but do I need a company marketing themselves as a substitute for something else that is good for kids? Moreover, how could they think that's a good idea, a selling point to adults with critical thinking skills?<br /><br />Well, apparently they do. This water is marketed based on its cool bottle. But it's just water and some of the usual "special" stuff that is often in water we buy. It's also marketed to give kids "buying power" with the cartoon front and the spinach argument. Frankly, I'd rather any kid of mine didn't rely on marketing to make a product choice, and oh, guess what: they are kids. They don't get to make the product choices.<br /><br />The company has somehow made the right connections, gotten the right endorsements, achieved school distribution, and is conducting a social media campaign that is textbook perfect. Too bad they're also selling water and the idea that marketing to kids (and marketing to them in a way that doesn't support eating leafy green vegetables) is a good thing. If it wasn't for the mixed message on the copy, maybe I could accept that it's marketing like sugary cereals do: to the kids. But this product just teaches kids that bottled water is good. It's not a horrible lesson, but parents should be teaching their kids through the parents' buying power--not the kids. When they get a job, they can buy spinach-replacing water. And eat their damn spinach. 1
The price is great but I just didn't like the taste of this coffee. I'm pretty picky about coffee and love to drink strong. This one produce very acidic coffee when made strong, but if you make it thin, then it tastes okay with just slight acidic after taste. How you'd like this coffee is really depending on your personal taste of coffee, but if you are like me, drink coffee strong, or dislike acidic after taste that lasts while, then this is not for you. 3
Green Mountain keeps changing the wording on their Amazon description and box for this coffee, and this led me to mistakenly buy it for the third time.  I expect products labeled with the Newman's Own label to be good (or at least worth trying).  They advertise it as being a medium roast, and it's not.  When you look at the package it says 'regular' 'medium roast' and 'extra bold'.  How can it be all three?  I like my coffee strong, but not burned (think regular Starbucks) or bitter, and this coffee is both.  I love other bold brands like Deidrich's French roast, but really don't like this coffee. If you are a fan of regular Starbucks you'll like this stuff. 2
This is just fat, pure fat, made from soy bean oil.  And, it's too hot for me.  If you don't care how many calories you pour over your food, and that those calories are all fat calories, you won't care that this is so incredibly high in both.<br /><br />I don't like hot stuff.  A little bit of tang is a good thing, but all I tasted in this is hot.  I really didn't taste the flavor at all.<br /><br />This is a pass for me. 2
Hmm. I don't doubt these ingredients are good! But my cats don't love this and one of them only eats the 'gravy' part and ends up with really bad diarrhea. So...I guess my two are just picky since it seems to be a hit with others! 2
I have tried this product before and I really love it. The price is fair and I enjoy it... 4
DESCRIPTION:<br />> Blue Diamond Roasted-Salted Almonds are moderately roasted with canola, safflower, or sunflower oil (but not oily or greasy), and lightly salted.  These are "heart healthy" oils which are actually good for you, as is the almond oil itself.  Roasted Salted Almonds are available in bags or small cans small.<br />> Blue Diamond Smokehouse Almonds are similar with wonderful smokey flavor.  At this time Smokehouse Almonds are available from Amazon only in 16 oz (and smaller) bags.<br />> I have not tried the "lightly salted" variety but I presume that they have almost no salt.<br /><br />CANS vs BAGS<br />Various types of Blue Diamond Almonds are available in bags or small cans.  The small cans (3 1/4" in diameter by 2 3/8" high) are very convenient and assure that the almonds stay fresh until openned, and afterward, because they don't stay "openned" long (it is easy to eat a whole can at one setting).  Arguably the bags more environmentally friendly, but you don't get much of a price break for the much cheaper packaging.  I prefer the convenience and freshness of the cans.<br /><br />EVALUATION: Excellent and flavorful.  Well roasted and crunchy.  I cannot decide which I like best: the Roasted Salted or the Smokehouse.  Although not oily, the roasting oil does effect the flavor.  Whether that's a good thing or not is a matter of individual tastes.  I happen to like the roasted-in-oil flavor.<br /><br />LESS ROASTED ALMONDS<br />If you prefer less-roasted almonds, roasted without added oil, consider <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001COJ85G">Back To Nature California Almonds, Sea Salt Roasted, 11-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3)</a><br /><br />UNROASTED ALMONDS<br />Unroasted almonds are available <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001COE1AI">Back To Nature California Almonds, Unroasted & Unsalted, 11-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3)</a> but beware that thorough roasting makes almonds more digestable.  Unroasted almonds are susceptable to fungus which can be carcinogenic.  While commercial domestic almonds sold in the US do not contain significant levels of cyanide, bitter almonds, (which have a much richer almond flavor, particular in baked goods).  Indeed natural almond extract is made from bitter almonds---artificial almond extract is safer.  Bitter almonds are sometimes illegally sold in the US and are often encountered in other countries, and do contain dangerous levels of cyanide when raw.  7-10 raw bitter almonds can kill a child.  Moreover, a child raised on raw almonds may conclude that raw peach pits (essentially a variety of almonds) are safe to eat---they are NOT.  The safest practice is NOT to eat unroasted almonds. 5
Having gone through two herb seed kits, I have had mixed results.  For my first kit, the basil really thrived and provided me with far more leaves than I could possibly use, and the dill also did well.  Unfortunately, the cilantro never sprouted, the mint provided enough harvest for maybe a few mojitos before it died, and the chives were just barely alive.  I had better luck with the second herb kit: both types of basil and dill did very well again, and the mint was at least respectable.  The cilantro sprouted this time and provided enough leaves for a bit of salsa, but results were still underwhelming. Once again, the chives again were disappointing and barely did anything beyond surviving. I do enjoy watching the plants grow, but the operating costs alone ($20 that seed kits costs plus a few dollars per month on electricity that the bulbs use) are probably far more than it would have cost me to buy these herbs from the grocery store. Still, I'm just not inclined to go and build my own hydroponics garden, and I do plan on using the aerogarden in one way or another until it falls apart.  It only kind of works as advertised, but it is an interesting introduction to hydroponics, and I can't imagine making this product any easier to use.<br /><br />Update:  I tried the salad greens kit and would not recommend it.  The lettuce plants grow quite well, but I find the leaves to be limp and flavorless. 3
I recently purchased these capsules because some of the reviews were positive.  I was excited to order them so I can use my own real Italian espresso beans.  Nespresso does not quite understand the consumer yet.  The consumer wants options not restrictions on having to order nespresso coffee only and very very limited where you can buy them.  So when I saw these capsules, it was excited.  Unfortunately, they don't work.  They are too thin that they crush when you put the lever down. Good idea but it would be great if they work.  Maybe, next time. 1
A diluted hot sauce derived from the jalape&ntilde;o pepper. A 5 oz bottle is far too small given its diluted nature. You might use close to a bottle for a single family sized meal.<br /><br />Ingredients (as listed, in this order, from the product label): Water, acetic acid, jalape&ntilde;o peppers, carrots, sugar, ...etc<br /><br />Tasting notes - diluted heat along with a heavy vinegar taste and, at best, a vague jalape&ntilde;o flavor.  The vinegar flavor dominates (acetic acid is a component of vinegar).<br /><br />As noted in the title of my review - a below average hot sauce. I'd pass on this one. The vinegar taste is over powering. Note that the second ingredient (after water) is acetic acid (a chemical component of vinegar)!<br /><br />I'd recommend the El Yucateco Hot Jalape&ntilde;o Hot sauce which uses the same Jalape&ntilde;o pepper but it has a much purer and fresher taste. I love the Jalape&ntilde;o pepper but this sauce does not feature its fine qualities very well.<br /><br />PS - As should be evident -- I enjoy taste testing hot sauces and writing up my results. I've tried about 50 different ones to date. I try very hard to describe flavor notes and list the actual ingredients. 1
I think the ingredients in this food speak for themselves - cheap filler & byproducts supplemented with vitamins.  After doing a tiny amount of research on cat nutrition I was absolutely disgusted with myself for feeding this food to my cat for over 3 years.  I am also disgusted that so many veterinarians have apparently been bought off by the Hill's company.<br /><br />This Science Diet formula's first 8 ingredients:<br />1 - Brewers rice: Filler. Processed rice product that is missing many of the nutrients contained in whole ground rice. (Cat's don't need grain, and this is the first ingredient!)<br />2 - Chicken By Product Meal: Parts of chicken not fit for human consumption, i.e. head, feet, bones, entrails, blood, intestines, etc.<br />3 - Corn Gluten Meal: Corn byproduct used as an inexpensive protein source.  Many cats and dogs are allergic to corn and, again, cats are carnivores and do not need grain.<br />4 - Powdered Cellulose:  Sawdust!<br />5 - Ground Whole Grain Corn:  More cheap, HYPER allergenic grain that cats don't need.<br />6 - Chicken Liver Flavor:  Self explanatory, but why not just use real chicken liver?<br />7 - Animal Fat: Fat from an unnamed animal source, most likely fat from many types of animals that the Hills company would rather not name.<br />8 - Soybean Mill Run: Soybean hulls - a cheap, byproduct filler.  Soy is also highly allergenic.<br /><br />The funny thing - anyone who buys Science Diet knows it's pretty expensive food.  Yet we can all reasonably presume that these fillers and byproducts probably aren't that expensive to source.  What's worse is that this food can cause serious health problems like diabetes due to the ridiculously high amount of carbohydrates (aka sugars).  The guaranteed analysis on the Hill's website indicates this food is composed of 43.2% carbohydrates.  That's completely inappropriate for the nutritional needs of cats.<br /><br />I was lucky to "see the light" before my cat developed any serious health problems from this food.  My cats symptoms on Science Diet were fairly mild, but still concerning - she got fatter and fatter, she was inactive, her coat was dull, and she pooped a lot.  The first food I switched her to was Taste of the Wild Rocky Mountain Formula, which is a grain-free, high protein diet that costs about half the price of Science Diet.  The first 8 ingredients of Taste of the Wild are chicken meal, peas, sweet potatoes, chicken fat, pea protein, potato protein, roasted venison, smoked salmon.  Obvious improvement over Science Diet's ingredients.  My cat loved it, started losing weight, more activity, coat became shiner, and there were litter box benefits as well (less poo because she was no longer eating filler that her body couldn't process).  I absolutely feel Taste of the Wild is an amazing value for grain-free cat food and a vastly superior product compared to Science Diet and most other commercial cat foods.<br /><br />A few months ago I found Orijen cat food and decided to switch again.  The first 8 ingredients of Orijen are fresh boneless chicken, chicken meal, fresh boneless salmon, turkey meal, fresh chicken liver, herring meal, russet potato, chicken fat.  Now doesn't the Orijen ingredient list make the Science Diet ingredients above even more laughable and sad?  After feeding Orijen and a bit of high-quality canned food every day (Tiki Cat or Nature's Variety Instict), my 4 year old cat has practically become a kitten again.  She plays every day and is the picture of lean, bright-eyed, happy feline health.  Changing my cat's diet from Science Diet to a diet appropriate for felines has completely transformed my cat in less than 6 months!<br /><br />There is so much information about feline health out there and so many holistic foods to choose from now.  I strongly believe that anyone who currently feeds Science Diet would feel immediately compelled to switch foods after doing 20-30 minutes of research.  Please do. 1
I go through stages where i seek out different alternatives to regular mass market products and look instead for artisinal or just somewhat unorthodox alternatives.  sometimes it works out and other times i end up with a cabinet full of stuff that noone in the house will touch.<br /><br />this time it worked great.<br /><br />this mix is an excellent change from the standard big brand pancake mixes (haven't used it for waffles).  the flapjacks have an excellent consistency and taste great.  i've actually noticed the whole family uses less syrup with this mix than our old stand by which produced pancakes that weren't much more than syrup delivery vehicles.  the cakes are moist and delicious. 5
I've enjoyed Izze drinks in the past and for the past year and a half have been drinking pomegranate juice whenever I get the chance.  When I learned about Izze's FORTIFIED ALL NATURAL SPARKLING POMEGRANATE JUICE, I was rather excited at the prospect of tasting some. I was rather disappointed.  To begin with, even though this product is labeled as pomegranate juice, it's a misnomer because this is not real pomegranate juice.  Instead it's a hybrid containing juices from concentrates of apples, white grapes, pineapples, lemons, cranberries, pomegranates, and a few other added vitamins.  The other vitamins don't bother me so much, but when a product is labeled and marketed as pomegranate juice, that's what a person should expect to get, not a mixture of a bunch of juices only one of which is pomegranate.  Besides the false labeling, the drink is quite bitter and hard to drink.  Drinking the beverage straight from the cans doesn't quite cut it (it tastes a bit metallic) and I've had to pour the stuff in a glass with ice.  Perhaps the absorption of the ice takes away part of the bitterness, but I've found the drink tastes much better this way.  But, overall, you'd best just avoid buying the stuff altogether. 2
Very flimsy material. Not true to size, extremely small. Color is not as described. Light Moss looks more like DARK BROWN/GREEN! Don't waste your money on these tee shirts. 1
Just got a shipment of bulk candy for Christmas (reds and whites).  Honestly kind of disappointed in the taste, not horrible but rather chalky and artificial tasting.  Also I think the fact that they only use the "sunflower kernel" rather than a "sunflower seed" may make a noticable difference.  I got the idea after buying a few packs of Sunny Seed Drops[...] which are delicious but more expensive and I don't see any Christmas varieties on Amazon (they do have other varieties).  In this case you get what you pay for.  If I had to do it over again I would buy a smaller quantity from Sunflower Food & Spice Co.<br /><br />No issues with shipping, packaging, etc. 2
I hope Amazon restocks this item always.I can't stand the other brands out there since it got this brand.And the price is right at Amazon to. 5
I found these to be flavor-free.  They tasted like white flour, the snickerdoodle ones I bought had hardly any cinnamon.  True disappointment, my kids will not eat them and I bought a whole box. Tastes like sweet, baked flour and water.<br /><br />However the chocolate chip ones are good. 3
This is a tasty product that I really like. Unfortunately the standard put-up is 12 cans in a half-carton -- a cardboard box bottom and a flexible plastic film top, which apparently is a cost-cutting measure. The cans bang into each other during shipping, because the plastic film top is the equivalent of putting them in a bag.<br /><br />The cans arrive severely dented, which could compromise the seal, and allow baterial contamination. Although I pointed out this problem sometime ago, my most recent shipment arrived damaged again. 3
This wasn't very caramel tasting .... Lacked flavor !! I couldn't even taste it in cookies or the dip I made ! 2
We have five cats - one an elderly cat of 15 years, the other four in the 9-11 year range.  The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.<br /><br />Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.<br /><br />I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.<br /><br />Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck. 1
I bought these because I'm a sucker for low calorie carbs. I just loves my rice, noodles, pasta, etc.and thought these would be a great substitute.  These are a no calorie substitute, but like substituting tofu for meat, the taste is in the myriad of ingredients you cook them with. They have no taste on their own and a rather obnoxiously slimy texture. The fishy smell you get when you open a package quickly dissipates with rinsing in cold water, they firm up a little with a quick parboil, but on their own they are BLAH. I have stir fried them and boiled them for soup with veggies, garlic, sauces, you name it. They aren't worth the effort. I will continue to stir fry and boil veggies, but I probably won't bother with these "noodles" again. A Tofurkey will never be a turkey and these will never satisfy a noodle craving. 2
The PB2 is everything it said it was. When you mix the 2 tbls of pb2 with 1 tbsp of water just make sure you do not put in extra water as it is mushy and doesn't taste right. If you do it correctly it is the exact replica of real pb and taste just like it. i would definitly purchase it again from this seller as it arrived in good condition very quickly, it only took 2 days. 4
I ordered this coffee a while back when it was $.40 a cup. I enjoy the Hazelnut creme as well as the Breakfast Blend. I would be willing to buy this coffee again but not at the current price of a dollar something per cup, that's ridiculous. There are a lot of K Cups out there for cheaper that are as of similiar quality. I don't know why they would even think this is a good price!!!! 2
Called a stew, but it's really a soft pate, and with big chunks of green beans and carrots.  Overall my cat seems to like it okay -- not a difficult task for him to work around the vegetables and leave them in the plate. 3
I enjoy just about any coffee, and I liked the illy issimo caffe Italian Espresso Style Coffee Drink too.  It does have a bit of a bitter taste, even though the ingredients include sugar.  So it's not a real sweet drink.  I liked the strong, somewhat bitter taste of it, even though my favorite coffee drinks are mocha style beverages (both hot and cold).<br /><br />I refrigerated the can before drinking, and it was a nice quick cold coffee beverage.  However, I am used to drinking large cups of coffee, so the small 6.8 oz. can seemed too small, and I finished it off pretty quick.  The nice thing about the small can is you can take these with you just about anywhere.  So they are very convenient.<br /><br />I'd recommend to people who like iced espresso style coffee drinks that have a bit of sweetness, but remain a bit bitter and who want very convenient small servings that can be taken just about anywhere. 4
This is just ok.  The good news is that it's cheap.  But a few days ago I drank a really high quality (and really expensive) organic coffee and there was absolutely no comparison.  If you put lots of sugar or flavored creamer in your coffee, this might be fine.  But if you drink your coffee with little cream or sugar, get a higher quality coffee. 3
This tastes just like the milk left after a bowl of cocoa puffs....which, if you ask me, is a good thing.<br /><br />It would get 5 stars if it weren't for the added sugar.<br /><br />If I had the choice, I'd give it a 4.5 b/c at least they used cane sugar. 4
I've tried over a dozen varieties of K-Cups and this is, by far, my favorite!  It's strong but not bitter and just has a great flavor.  This will be my choice from now on. 5
These are a pleasing size and retain a good texture, without the "rubber eraser" taste when chewed for a while, but all the various colors taste the same, with no decernable fruit flavors.  The purple (grape?) may have a slight tang.  They are not overly sweet, which is good, but have no interesting flavor(s).  A disappointment. 2
Every morning after they are fed, two of my Poms get Happy Hips and the third wants in on it.  They think it's a great treat and never not want it. 4
They should put the origin of the product in the information so we can make more informed choices about our purchases. This tea is from Thailand. Do not be fooled. No thanks. 1
I looked at the old fashioned pop corn poppers (you know, the red cart and metal popper), but those looked like they would be a lot of work to keep clean as well as take up counter space I don't have. However, I still really wanted "movie theater" or "carnival/fair" popcorn. So I got the Presto popcorn popper that goes in the microwave and works either with or without oil. If you get the 2.5oz size pack of Northern popcorn, you can easily split it in half and make 2 batches. (The Presto popper is too small for a 2.5oz pkg all at once.) This stuff tastes great. Yeah, I know palm oil is horrible for your heart etc. etc., but THAT is what makes all that fake buttery taste so yummy. Like another reviewer said, the salt packet is a quite salty so I only used half (maybe even less) the salt for all of the popcorn in each packet. After looking at several online distributors, at $18.95 (subscription price) Amazon has the best price. 4 1/2 stars 4
I love the taste of this coffee.  It does not have a bitter taste and the size of the can, which per ounce is the same as if you bought the large can, keeps it fresher as a smaller amount is exposed to the air. 5
I don't know how they did it, but this pepper doesn't taste like pepper.  I prefer course ground pepper so it isn't just that I am expecting it to behave like regular pepper.  It is bland.<br /><br />The glass jars are nice and I will be able to make use of them or this product might have only got 2 stars. 3
Ok, so I absolutely love the packaging and the nifty description on the back of the bottle, but when I'm paying .64/oz, I expect it to moisturize. Giovanni claims that their washes include "essential oil complex to soothe, smooth and regenerate skin's lost moisture" but the ingredients' list contains no such ingredient, unless they are referring to the "Essential Oil Fragrance" in which case they are blatantly lying because essential oils provide scent, not moisture. Even the dollar bottles of cheapo wash at Walmart contain some type of moisturizer, albeit petroleum. Sometimes I use St. Ives Whipped Silk body wash and it's definitely more moisturizing than Giovanni due to the sunflower oil. I've noticed even JASON's washes contain Sodium PCA to moisturize (although their stuff also has harsh sulfates, so I've never tried them). Or maybe Giovanni deliberately left out any moisturizers out so that we buy their lotions/body butters. Ha!<br /><br />While I sound like I hate the product, I really don't; I just wish it provided some moisture. The good: it looks and feels like a spa product, washes well and rinses cleanly, and smells good and not artificial perfumey like Herbal Essences and all that other junk. Also, it actually works well as a shampoo when in a pinch. In fact, I've taken to using it as shampoo as well since Giovanni keeps changing their shampoo formulas (and for the worse, it seems, judging from the new ingredients) and body washes tend to be more gentle than shampoos. I've tried Raspberry Winter, Lavender Vanilla Snow, Cassifluer White Tea, and D:tox (bar soap form) and they all smell awesome. True aromatherapy in a bottle. 3
I love Earth's Best products and only use them to feed my baby, besides home made foods. I rate this one one star because the seller didn't specify that this product contains milk, which my baby cannot tolerate since he is lactose-intolerant. So for us, it was a waste of money, and I bought two packs... 1
This coffee is weak and bitter.  I like bold and smooth coffee (such as Tullys or Starbucks). This coffee is barely a step up from grandma and grandpas instant folgers coffee. YECH! never again. 2
We love the Earth's Best line in our house. Our 9 mo old daughter  will ONLY eat Earth's Best dinners, and I don't blame her. The smell from both of the other 2 brand was nauseating. I've sampled the Earth's best dinners myself, and they aren't half bad... It is baby food.... The fruit blends and veggie blends are great as well. 5
My beagle has severe food allergies, especially to anything high in beef and chicken. Alternative meats just give him horrible gas to go along with his itchy skin. This food works WONDERS. A few days after feeding it to him, his itching stopped completely. Not only that, but he has a beautiful coat. I have heard a lot of criticism for feeding my little guy vegetarian food. People say that he's not getting enough nutrients and it's unnatural for a dog to be a vegetarian. I would much rather feed him something with more meat protein, but it would only work if I fed him steroids for the itching. I think the food is the lesser of two evils. His vet says that he's perfectly healthy and there's nothing wrong with a vegetarian diet. My only qualm is this: why does it have to be so expensive?! It's worth every penny, but seriously? And Natural Balance NEVER sends out coupons. 4
What more can I say. Barley Edible - Crunch on Sugar.  Did come on time but have a feeling that they wanted this unloaded because it didn't sell or maybe bad batch.  Doesn't make you sick or anything like that but you can actually find yourself crunching on sugar like you put a sugar cube in your mouth.  Kids probably don't care.  Hope this helps. 2
We love these sugar cubes in the office.  They aren't your grandmother's sugar cube.  They have a rugged appearance (can sugar cubes be considered rugged).  And we combine them with the white sugar cubes from La Perruche. 5
I have been ordering this coffee for about a year because it was the best deal around. Using the Amazon Subscribe and Save program, a pack of 50 K Cups previously cost $17.85 delivered. That's .36 cents a cup. The cost went up a few months ago to $23.59 for a box of 50. That's .47 cents a cup. The new Amazon price is what you would expect to pay in any retail store. I see K Cups selling for $11.99 for a box of 24. I will keep watching to see if this price increase is temporary. If it isn't, my Subscribe and Save days are over. 3
Good for what it is (a peanut butter alternative). The "knead package before opening" requirement might be problematic with kids. 3
The food keeps my dog super healthy; I believe it is the best. Was not happy the bag was ripped in transit or the fact that  I was forced to buy the bigger bag because the smaller one was not significantly less money. My dog weighs 5lbs so a bag this size takes her 6 months to eat. 3
Bought a plastic tub of this.  It was not good.  Folgers I like.  I thought this would be of similar taste.  Too weak.  Threw it out half way.  Life is too short to settle on bad coffee. 2
Like other reviewers I found these to be way to salty. They do not need to add extra salt when cheese already has enough on it's own. If they change the recipe I will be more than happy to try again but not the way they are now. 2
I try to give him one every night as a treat. Although my puppy is only 4 mos and only 22 lbs, he is quite the rough chewer so the Medium size is just fine for him. We may need to step up to the large size as he gets older and larger in size. 4
For at least a year Amazon has been shipping me two dozen cans a month of Crown Prince Two Layer Brisling Sardines. I happen to love sardines, at least the northern-based sardines, such as from Norway or Scotland. Hence my continuing order from Amazon. However, suddenly, with this month's shipment, the quality seems to have changed, for the worse. The sardines this past shipment are darker in color and with a salty flavor. It's as if the packer has changed his procedures or the fish have come from a different place. I'm going to accept my November shipment to see if it was an aberration, but if it wasn't, I'll cancel my order. 3
What a wonderful surprise to find LUCY's on Amazon.com!  I haven't enjoyed a cookie as much as I enjoy LUCY'S since going gluten free several years ago.<br /><br />They have that just-right crunch.<br />They are just sweet enough - not too, not not.<br />They are just the right size.<br />They have just the right "mmmmm" factor.<br /><br />THANK YOU DR. LUCY for sharing the "lemonade" you made from the dietary lemons life gave you too!  You've given me many appreciated "mmmmmmm", "mmmmmm", "mmmmmmm" moments!<br />Catsy 5
I was really looking forward to trying these chips since I love cheese but I was SUPER DISAPPOINTED! I am a big fan of Kettle Chips but these tasted somewhat stale and almost plain! They are supposed to have a cheddar taste but you cannot taste any of that...it's annoying. I do not recommend this flavor..salt and vinegar and buffalo bleu are my favorite. 2
I have to be upfront and tell you my family loves these but I do not. I do not like baked Lays or Pringles either. This product reminded me of them, not the same but similar. My son wanted me to try them and then invest in the company. I am glad so many people like them but I will pass on eating them and it looks like it is a private company.... So no stock either. 2
I think these had been sitting around in a warehouse for a long time, because it took them a long time to send it to me and, when I got it, the tea tasted like cardboard. I've had red rasberry leaf tea before, so I know it's not supposed to taste like this... 1
got these jaw breakers and the color made them look good. but they r not. the outter body of the jawbreaker have a little flavor than the rest is just a ball of sugar. i mean straight sugar no flavor at all. you get what u pay for with these i guess. 2
Actually until the recall I was very impressed w/this dog food, & I have used it for a long time.<br />So I ordered this dog food and I also ordered professional cat food, and just my luck as it usually is with these dog food recalls, I happen to have a bad bag. Actually, I'm not sure why but I guess I assumed that Amazon might have dropped me a line to let me know that there was a recall & that i may have received a bag (or two) of the bad pet food.<br />Now my question is, what do I do with it & how can I get reimbursed for it? Or can I? 3
We had been looking for a healthy waffle mix that tasted good, along with being made with natural ingredients. Most of the mixes I would find, either did not taste good, or full of ingredients I prefer to avoid. This has been the perfect mix, along with the Proctor Silex waffle maker we also purchased from Amazon.<br /><br />We have found that 1/2 cup of mix and about 1/2 cup of water is the exact mixture for this waffle iron and six minutes is the idea cook time. Now that we have figured that out, we just mix, pour, and time the cooking process. We have started adding a few things like fresh blueberries, Watkins flavorings and other fruit to give them some variety without adding a lot of calories. Keeping the calories in check was a goal we had too when deciding on this mix.<br /><br />If you like waffles and looking for a good alternative to the normal mixes, this is it. Also a big plus is all you need is water and no other ingredients. If you are a backpacker or camper, this can be an advantage too. 5
While I received what I was looking for, the picture showed six sticks and the description said that the shipping weight would be 12.8 oz.  When it arrived it was ONE 12" stick, weighing ONE oz, and in a box that weighed nowhere near 12 oz.  For this I paid over $5 shipping.  The ad was misleading for not indicating exactly what would be received.  Additionally, this is the same picture that they show for some they sell for 4x the price and a shipping weight of 16 oz.  The shipping cost for this item is the same.  I would be hesitant to order this item for fear that I would not know what I would be getting. 2
I like the busy bones.  My pit has to work at it a bit harder than she does some of other "large" bones on the market.  I do wish it would last a little longer.  She can finish one in under 5 minutes.  I'm giving it to her because I want her to be BUSY.  Not distracted for 5 minutes. 4
These aren't grandma's cookies, but tasty enough when eating healthy is what you try to do. 4
I got this to go with the HCG diet - Not much flavor.  I tried chocolate and English Toffee - both had more flavor.  Difficult to find in stores -and much more expensive in stores.  Worth it to have a different flavor - but if only buying a couple buy a different flavor.  Ones that come in packages of 2 are a better deal.  Find a friend and split! 2
My small dogs were not thrilled with these they did eat them though. They may have beeen to har for them as they  are small dogs 3
If you buy these sauces directly from Ghirardelli, they send you a free pump with every bottle.  Don't pay for one! 1
These packets are so easy to use and the popcorn is good quality as well.  I signed up for the automatic delivery and if I can be critical of anything, I wish I hadn't signed up as it is too much popcorn, too often.  But otherwise, I'm happy with the purchase. 4
This coffee is very full bodied, and has a great aroma; however, it is the only K-Cup coffee I've had that has a bitter aftertaste. I would still drink it if someone offered me a cup, but I won't buy it again. 3
Ordered this goat cheese and it is just fantastic! I can't digest cow milk so finding these goat cheeses was a great treat! I would order them again they are that delicious! Looks spectacular on a cheese platter with fruit and selected crackers. 5
I am potato chip-addicted. I don't only enjoy potato chips, but I also enjoy any type of potato product. This product really hit the mark for me.<br /><br />I consider these a full-fledged snack. Each bag is packed with chips. They are moderately seasoned, and full of flavor. The consistency is slightly like a popcorn cake -- but they're crisp and crunchy, not puffy. They have a distinct potato taste.<br /><br />The best part? Each bag clocks in at only 100 calories! And I repeat -- these are not a simple "100 calorie" snack. What you get here is a full bag of chips. What's great about the content vs. calorie content is that these are perfect to accompany your lunch without feeling guilty about eating a 200-300 calorie bag of chips.<br /><br />My personal favorites were the Sea Salt and Vinegar and the Original. The barbecue flavor is sweet, not smoky. The Salt and Pepper, Cheddar, and Sour Cream and Onion flavors are standard fair. But the chips are adequately and evenly seasoned and I did not notice differences in seasoning from one chip to the next.<br /><br />These are a great product, well manufactured, and a treat to eat. I'll definitely buy more of these in the future. 5
tasted great.  Anyone's idea of a guilty pleasure.  However, ingredient statement a shocker.  Very little in the mix was healthy.  It was not something I would want to indulge in on a regular basis.  Once in a while OK. 3
I just don't see the reason why you should buy this when there's a box of Pocky, Stikko, and pretty much any other chocolate-related product sitting right next to it. You've got a couple bucks, why buy this when you could buy something much better with your money?<br />These have the same problem I had with pocky-- Sure, the chocolate part is good, but when you get to the bread(?) it's just bland as heck and out of place. I'd rather just buy a chocolate bar made by the same company, ya'know?<br />And don't misunderstand-- There is absolutely no bread inside the chocolate part of the candy, at least any that matters enough that you can taste it. Why can't they just be split apart and sold as two different candies? That'd how I felt when I ate it. (But then again, the bread(?) part of it isn't all that great in the first place, enough to be sold.)<br />They're cute. That's pretty much it. I just don't see why I'd ever eat these unless someone else bought them and offered them to me. They're not BAD-- But they're just stupid. Stupid in candy design. Unbalanced. It's like buying Lucky Charms and picking out the marshmellows, really. That's what it feels like. And again, I must ask, why do you buy Lucky Charms if you could easily just buy a cereal completely made out of marshmellows?<br />Also, for the cute mushroom aspect-- The mushroom tops are always tipped sideways. That's also a damper when the packaging clearly makes them all look like they're balanced. 2
I have the regular my K cup accessory that comes with the Keurig, but you have to insert the special holder and fill the filter each time, then wash them both out.  I like these because they are disposable.  And I can fill several at one time and have them ready in the refrigerator when I want them.  Very convenient. 4
I like Dynasty Chinese Five Spice as a product.  I use it in stir fry.  It is a strong flavoring that works well for me since I reduce my sodium intake. I wasn't able to find it locally when I ran out, so I decided to buy  the 6 pack choice thinking it should last for a year and a half or so.  In this case, the spices all came with a best used by 12/15/12 date.. 4 months only. I got.. old(er) spice.  Disappointing. 2
Most cats have a hard time digesting cows' milk, as much as they love it.  The problem is the lactose, and Whiskas Catmilk is a reduced lactose milk product with taurine and other vitamins added.<br /><br />Cats need taurine.  Most mammals can make their own, but cats can't.  They have to eat taurine.  However, powdered taurine is cheap, and you can find it right here on Amazon.  These little boxes of brown milk will cost you more per ounce than grass fed organic milk costs.  For me, it makes sense to keep them handy, because my geyser cat can keep this stuff down when no other food product will stay in her, and that keeps her out of a fatty liver crisis.  But if what you are trying to accomplish is as simple as giving your cat who eats normal food a treat?  Try having a carton of lactaid on hand. 3
I think these had been sitting around in a warehouse for a long time, because it took them a long time to send it to me and, when I got it, the tea tasted like cardboard. I've had red rasberry leaf tea before, so I know it's not supposed to taste like this... 1
I wasn't expecting the product to bs packed in water. Has a fishy smell that almost made me not even try it. Kinda a pain to cook, and really had no taste at all. I'm going try cooking with veggies next time to see if that makes it better. 3
We have been experimenting with different brands of K-Cups since we purchased our Keurig last Christmas.  While this one was okay, it just is not as good Green Mountain's Breakfast Blend for an everyday staple.  We haven't tried Green Mountain Columbian yet as a closer comparison.  However, when we make a larger cup of coffee with this one, the brew is noticibly weaker than with GM Breakfast Blend.<br /><br />Also, please note that we LOVE Timothy's World Italian Blend!!  It is definitely amount our favorites. 3
...about this water as everyone else. To me, it tastes a bit like unsweetened mouthwash. I guess I was just expecting something different. I've only tried the Spearmint so far, and I've noticed in another review that this one is not a favorite...a bit scared to try the others though in that I'm not very enthusiastic about my first one... 3
I liked this toy when I first got it and it kept my 1 1/2 year old corgi busy for a while. I put his food in it and a few other "interactive toys" to keep him busy, this toy is actually too easy for him and lately  he will only get about half the kibble out and then loose interest. The other thing I don't like is that I can't wash it without getting the rope all wet. It would be better if you could twist off the rope portion and throw it in the dishwasher. 3
this stuff is black pepper in an oil base,,, i just got scammed,, dont buy it  i paid twenty four dollars for black pepper,, what a god dam disgrace thanks alot amazon 1
Have plenty of water handy.  The over-the-top taste of sea salt and cracked pepper nearly overcame all the cashew flavor.  The Emerald almonds were much more enjoyable because they were more subtlely flavored. 3
I didn't know what this would taste like, but I'm so glad I ordered it.  What a perfect cup of yummy coffee for a cool summer morning! 5
This item was cute, but had absolutely no appeal to the 2 five month old Labs I have. They picked it up once and that was it. Basically, money wasted!<br />The company offered to take them back, but the postage would cost about the same as the item, so I declined.<br />Note: I've purchased several of the Nylabone products (toys to bones, etc.) for my pups, from 10 weeks old to their current 7 months, they have yet to use any of them at all.<br />Might work for some, but I ended up giving them all to the humane society. 2
Not a good flavor overall. I have only tried the TERIYAKI flavored strips, and hate them. The texture and the sweetness is just gross together. I'm going to try a different flavor before writing this off, but yuck. I'm a vegan by the way, and I've had some amazingly delicious fake-feet products: this is not one of them. 3
I love most of the flavors Perfect Potful makes.  This one is a little too weak to get a repeat order.  Raspberry should be much bolder and this one barely tastes like chocolate and I detect no raspberry.  It's still a decent coffee, I just don't really detect the advertised flavor. 3
Coconut water not for me, but will keep it in my emergency kit...just in case we get any more of those earthquakes and it nocks out power for awhile....lol! 2
Stale. The worst flavored, worst tasting walnuts that anyone ever tasted. They shouldn't even be on sale. Where is your quality assurance or quality control? I want my money back. 1
I personally didn't like the flavor. It tasted okay when you actually toast them, but raw it was an odd experience. 3
I could not be more thrilled with this product! It works perfectly - the large ice cubes slip right out! Zero order like some other product reportedly had! Because the ice cubes are very large they last a long time.<br /><br />These large ice cubes are so awesome that refrigerator designers will have to redesign so their refrigerators can make these! 5
I was a bit disappointed in these.  They crumble very easily and have an unusual texture.  My son (6) does not like them. 2
I found this exact same product, same size at our local grocery store (QFC and Safeway) for $2.99. So, am not sure why this product is priced so much higher. 1
I did enjoy the snacks. Since I am diabetic there are few such snacks I can get away with and this one did not affect my blood sugar adversely. However the cost is more than I can justify. I will be canceling my next shipment. 3
I have to admit, it's nice that Petite Cuisine doesn't have the standard nasty canned cat food smell to it. It actually looks and smells decent, compared to the stuff I'm used to. It also has an overall healthier list of ingredients than most canned cat foods. Normally, that would add up to a five-star meal. The problem is, our cat won't eat the stuff! Granted, she's used to dry cat food but usually she'll scarf down a can of food as a treat. We've tried giving her both kinds of Petite Cuisine that were included (Chinese Chicken and Chicken Pot Pie) a few times each, and she'll lap up the liquid but won't touch the chunks of food. It's left to sit and dry out, until we dump it in the trash. She'll even sit next to her bowl and meow angrily at us, looking at the bowl then looking back up at us, until we dump it out and get her some dry stuff! Overall a disappointing experience on this end, but it's worth a try because every cat is different. You may find that it suites your cat's tastes just fine. 2
I've been very happy with the majority of the Earth's Best products, but the peas are TERRIBLE.  I am amazed that this received any positive reviews.  I have never seen my 1-year old son refuse a food as violently as he did these peas.  He immediately spat out the first spoonful of these peas and looked at me indignantly, as if to say, "What kind of garbage are you feeding me?"  He then went on to turn his head to one side, refused to eat for the rest of the meal, and start struggling to get out of the high chair.  Since he's generally a good eater with a healthy appetite (and he wasn't sick), I was puzzled by this response and tried the peas myself.  I nearly gagged, and tipped over MY chair in my haste to expunge these peas.  My son just watched me spit out these peas and grinned, as if to say, "See - I told you they were BAD!"<br /><br />If you do decide to go ahead and buy these peas, try them yourself first before subjecting a poor innocent child to them!  I will NEVER give my child this product again. 1
So for a "healthier" snack it sure is salty. But then the salt is a way for them to make the chips taste better without additional calories. Each bag is 100 calories with 10% sodium intake for the day.<br /><br />The chips are not bad, i just wouldn't get them again because most of the flavoring comes from the salt. 3
The jars of aji amarillo were so well packaged with bubble wrap. ( I mean really well-packaged)The quality is great. 5
Fast delivery and packaging was excellent.  The kisses are exactly as expected - excellent taste and plenty of almonds.  The kisses were made with milk chocolate and packaged in 10oz plastic bags.  I wish the kisses were available with with sugar free sweetener and almonds. 4
For some reason, the stores around me stopped having these.  I use this type of bag for a few things in my life: camping gear (sleeping bag, hammock/tent) is able to breathe without being all over the place, storage of down comforter during summer, etc.  Then I got the great idea of using them for my recycling.  What a change in life this has been.  For three years, we've had to take moldy cans to the recycle center to redeem all our beer cans for the 5  apiece.  The little sips of beer in each can accumulate, and get trapped in a plastic bag, so I took my recycle cans and drilled holes in the bottom for drainage, then I line them with these bad boys.  The beer leaks right out, and when they're full, they're dry and while they smell slightly of stale beer, the change to that from stale wet beer and mold is incredible.<br /><br />Would I trust them for laundry?  Probably not if I had to carry it any distance.  They're mesh bags.  Going up or down stair or across the house is probably not a big deal.  Since I don't have machines, I wait until the last possible minute to do my laundry, so these bags would be totally and utterly full, stretching the mesh past its abilities, and would probably rip on the first or second go.  If you're smarter than me, though, and do your laundry in a reasonable amount of time, or don't have to leave your house/complex to do it, they'd probably be fine. 5
Over the years I've had the pleasure of receiving jumbo cashews as gifts. These cashews, unless the USDA has changed their grading standards are not jumbo. Furthermore, the bags are uniformly filled with maybe 10% broken pieces some in half, others broken and split. The thing is, when you look at the broken pieces it's clear that they are not the same size or grade as the whole cashews. Cheat! The nuts also had a taste that was that of Cashews that have spent some time in warehouses. The nuts are not terrible, but the consumer is being cheated by paying a premium for a very average product. Not recommended. 2
OK, I'm sorry but when I see a package that is labeled "Chicken and Broccoli" dinner kit, I sort of expect that there will actually be some CHICKEN and some broccoli included in the box! Although the product, as prepared, is tasty enough (though not so nutritious with high calories and sodium), I do prefer the brands of these easy prep dinner kits that do include the meat in an aluminum can or sealed pouch in the kit. I also think there needs to be more evidence of broccoli in the dish.<br /><br />This item would be great for hungry kids and you could definitely skip the additional step of having to cook and prepare the chicken if you're in a hurry. The velveeta and pasta are creamy and appealing to that age group. 3
Roses Lime Juice has that lime flavor that the knock-offs do not have.  Roses has just the right amount of sugar so that it's not too sweet. Great for making any kind of gimlet...vodka, gin or even tequila (my favorite).  Since liquor is expensive don't settle for less than the "Original" ! 5
These wine gums were pretty good. Compared to Maynards wine gums they are more tart and less chewy.  They are more "more-ish" so they disappear faster.  I don't regard that as a good quality though; I prefer wine gums that are more fulfilling that I can savor for longer.  I'm going to stick with Maynards, even though they cost more. 4
I think the title says it all.  The ingredients aren't exactly what I would choose.  And the texture is a bit odd (a bit like smooshed raisins).  But it did taste really good!  And the nutrition info fits within my diet. 4
*Previous lists don't mention the French Vanilla, which was incl.<br /><br />I've enjoyed quite a few varieties of Timothy's (and others)K-Cups and had little to no problems with them. Cinnamon Pastry is one example of a coffee I really enjoy.<br /><br />This variety pack however seems to be a mix of their least popular blends, or perhaps the batches that were slightly "off". And going off this experience I won't be trying any of the coffees in the pack on their own except for the Kona & Breakfast blends.<br /><br />The tastes were dark (burnt), bitter and unappealing, each cup made me regret my choice to reach for the coffee mug. Not to mention the after effects were not pleasant, I actually could feel the crappiness of these blends for hours.<br /><br />The French Vanilla was downright disgusting, I don't think they could decide if they wanted to make a soft vanilla flavor  or a strong vanilla liquor experience and it's a horrible mix of the two.<br /><br />Also, as previously mentioned, nearly half the box is NOT coffee but tea's that sound... more interesting than appealing.<br /><br />So if you're in for an adventure and don't really care about the taste of your coffee or tea, go for it!<br /><br />Otherwise... consider sample packs directly through the coffee company, they cost less and give you better options. 2
Energy Drinks are very popular these days.  Most, if not all, are loaded with sugar, various overloads of vitamins, and varying "energy blends."  A few energy drinks have tried adding pure juice, but have only come up with 50% at most.<br /><br />If your not a young'un and can't handle that blast of sugar and crash that follows, then Switch is a better alternative.  Switch is 100% juice, ZERO sugar, and lots of vitamin C.<br /><br />Switch is carbonated, so with the Orange Tangerine flavor, picture your morning juice with a little soda fizzle.  The taste is sweet, but not sugary.  Although the size of the can probably relates to the recommended serving, most people probably don't have this little juice in one sitting.<br /><br />Soda fizzle meets juice benefits.  It's a no brainer.  How about some more flavors? 3
I dont like the taste of this at all.  I have some other fennel tea from another company not on amazon and it is fantastic.  Cant remember exact name but think it is something like MB - is a french company and I got it in canada and by mail order after that.  It is much better to my taste.  Never dreamed there would be this much variance among fennel seeds as only ingredient. 1
My son is sensitive to cows milk protein and I am trying to keep him off of soy.  My milk was not enough for him, and I did not like the ingredients in baby formula (all had soy and most have cows milk protein, not to mention 45% corn syrup solids).  My pediatrician recommended this powdered goats milk because they add folate (not normally found in goats milk).  Since I have been feeding my son this milk, he has been SO happy and growing so much better! Have not had to add any vitamins/supplements to it to make it a whole food, it is fine on its own. Although, I have been using organic brown rice cereal because he is getting close to being ready for solids.  LOVE this milk! (always consult your doctor before changing your babies diet) 5
Just started using this so will update more later, I have an older cat 15 years old, everything she ate she would throw up she pretty much grew up on Iam's Weight Control cat food due to a previous urinary tract infection,and a weight problem (vet recommended) she weighed in at 17 lbs her heaviest the Iams never helped for years for weight control.Later in life she started losing the weight got down to a perfect weight then really started to lose to much then the last bag of Iams I bought her she refused to eat but a couple of kibbles a day, she was starving herself to death because even then she was throwing up,(she went down to 7lbs) I bought the Science Diet Sensitive stomach she is finally eating again, not throwing up so the food is A-OK with me and will spend the price for it, but like I said just starting using it will update on how she does more in to eating the food. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of 5 is the price and since I ordered this food online maybe finding the product in the stores around here I live very rural so getting to a store is a chore in itself at times. 4
When I found these chips I was shocked to see how little fat there is in these. They taste great and the are actually not bad for you either. I told my sister, and she has told her friend everyone loves them after they try them. We order boxes so we can have them at work instead of using the vending machines, the office loves them. They can be a little hard to find, that why I order the online. 5
This tea left a bad taste in my mouth. I found it very difficult to drink because it caused acid issues. I enjoy Timothy's white tea orange blossom much better and also the Timothy Cranberry. 2
I actually didn't buy this through Amazon, but from a local general store in SC. I don't know when the original was out, but I'd never had it before now, so I have nothing to compare it to. I just finished my first ever piece and it was WONDERFUL! I guess if you're being nostalgic, brace yourself. But, if you're trying it for the first time, DIG IN! Just be warned, they are addictive. 4
I looked for a long while to find a dry kibble that my cats would enjoy and tolerate. One cannot have rice or other grains. They preferred the previous formula of Nature's Variety Instinct Rabbit meal formula. I purchased a new bag and the cats wouldn't touch it and in fact were repelled by it. I looked at the ingredients and the order, and they were the same until you got to the ingrediant "Natural Chicken flavor" on the old bag. On the new bag, it said "Natural pork flavor."  The individual kibble are flatter and airy and the old kibble was denser and a bit rounder.  Further the old formula says "90%+ of the protein is from rabbit,salmon,chicken, herring meals." The new formula says "75% pure animal ingredients and nutriousl oils."  In any case, there are some differences. I'm not sure if it is the pork flavor, the disc texture and density or even if there is a change in the ratio. THe first bag references the percentage of protein and its identity, whereas the new bage simply indicates the percentage of animal ingredients. I have some sad kitties who loved the old formula. Looking at [...] review of premium dry, it also lists other types that might also appeal to kitties. 2
Check the first 4 ingredients: Brewers Rice, Chicken By-Product Meal, Corn Gluten Meal, Powdered Cellulose. Rice is ok but not as a first ingredient in a cat food; meat by-product is sketchy in general in a food this expensive; corn meal I have no great opinion of, but whatever; but the 4th ingredient - powdered cellulose - is sawdust. SAWDUST is not what I want to feed my cat, even to help her lose weight.<br /><br />No wonder this food feels so "light" physically.  The color is lighter, and it is less dense than normal food because it's truly just fillers.<br /><br />I give it a second extra star because my cat would willingly eat this food and didn't seem to mind a whole lot, but I switched her (50/50 at first) to Blue Buffalo, which has real food ingredients and which she actually does prefer. 2
I should point out from the get-go that to the best of my knowledge, I don't suffer from any sort of celiac sensitivity in the slightest. However, I'm very aware that this is a problem for many people, some of whom are unaware that they have a problem but know they're not functioning as they should. I do know what it's like to be unable to digest food that you like (in my case, any sort of meat) and wheat is even more difficult to avoid, so I can sympathize.<br /><br />Pamela's Products Oat Chocolate Chip Coconut Whenever Bars are meant to provide a tasty, healthful snack for the gluten-intolerant. They're sweetened with agave and the ingredients are palatable to both celiac sufferers and those who just want a snack that's devoid of white sugar. These bars are guaranteed gluten-free, come individually wrapped, and are packed five to the box.<br /><br />The cookies themselves are actually pretty tasty--their lack of ingredients like stevia ensures that they have a pleasant sweetness that's gentle and tastes completely natural. And the other flavors are well-balanced as well--there are plenty of chocolate chips of good quality and the presence of coconut is a plus. But the fact of the matter is that Pamela's Products Oat Chocolate Chip Coconut Whenever Bars suffer from a fault that's pretty consistent in individually wrapped desserts of this kind: they're just too damp and lacking in crispness. Yes, I know that we all want chewy cookies nowadays and that cookie dough is held to be a gastronomic pinnacle to some. But I prefer my "soft" tempered by some external "snap," so this isn't the ideal snack for me. It tastes nice but the texture, for me, falls short (your own mileage may vary).<br /><br />Regardless of my personal quirks, the fact that the food industry is accommodating those with food sensitivities and doing their best to do so in such a way as to use quality ingredients is fantastic. For those who like a damp, moist cookie, these just might be your idea of heaven--gluten-intolerant or not. Not my first choice for a nosh but this, I reiterate, is a purely personal call. 4
So I am a huge Chocolate Peanut Butter freak, and have been looking for a peanut butter cup cocoa for a while. I finally broke down and ordered this after a few months hemming and hawwing about it. Now I aadmit to not reading the directions the first cup and at first was like wow slightly chocolate water and added a few more spoonfuls of the mix to my cup and it improved but was not quite what i expected and this was made with water(I was at work and had little choice) The next day I deceided to try it again at home in my hot cocoa machine with milk and there was a GREAT improvement!! So as a result I'm going to try an experiment tonight and make a shake in the blender with the mix!!! I said im a peanut butter cup freak!!! 3
I was expecting a lot more from a tea that is named "Double Bergamot". Some other Earl Grey's I have used have more Bergamot flavoring in 1 tea bag then this little tea in 4. Thus I am rather disappointed! Although for a regular Earl Grey fan this tea might be good, for the Bergamot enthusiast it is not recommendable. 2
The others like it a lot and I think the taste is good, but the texture is just off to me. Its very soft and tender, but kind of crumbly. I prefer the honey pepper. Not too spicy, either, so that's nice. Over all its ok and the others in the office will buy more, but I will stick to the other kinds. 3
This icing is average and unfortunately expensive. Wilton will insist that you bring this to your first class, ignore them and make it yourself. The Wilton recipe is all over the internet, is fairly cheap to make and is what you'll be making for your second class. This tastes fine, but is far too expensive for what you get.<br />The only way I would get it again is if it were on sale because it does give you icing of the right consistency for your first cake decorating class, if you've never made icing before. 2
I first ordered the Chipotle flavor.  I didn't enjoy the flavor very much, but the texture was crispy and the amount of flavor was perfect.  There was plenty of flavor there but it wasn't overwhelming like some brands are.  It was because of this that I decided to give Blair's a second chance.  I ordered the Habanero flavor next.  I was extremely disappointed.  Gone was the perfect amount of flavoring the chipotle chips had.  Instead the chips had so much seasoning it was darn near falling off the chips.  I've had a few brands of habanero before, but this one tasted nothing like any of them.  It has almost a sweet flavor to it.  I personally didn't care for it at all.  On top of it all, the chips aren't even very hot.  I was very disappointed in how hot both chips were considering the brand is called Death Rain.  If you can find them, try Poore Brothers Habanero chips.  THOSE are some hot chips, with a fantastic flavor. 2
I have tried original, BBQ and salt and vinegar. They all they good, the BBQ is the most flavorful. The salt and vinegar is a bit off, and it kind of has that "hmm this taste like health food". Which the BBQ doesn't have that effect at all. Though I'm still happy with my purchase. I have always been a fan of Popchips and always recommend my friends and family to eat this instead of their fried trans fatty chips. 4
I gave this review 2 stars because the dark chocolate isn't bad.  The plum bits are very hard, mostly flavorless.  It's like eating chocolate covered cardboard.  I would not recommend these to anyone.  The plum bits are so small, I can't image you would get that much benefit from any antioxidants. Go eat a regular prune and a good piece of dark chocolate and you'll be much happier. 2
This tea is a nice change from my regular black tea. I'm not big on the taste of herbal teas so this was a good choice. It's closer to black but has it's own special taste, which I found myself looking forward to. Great in the evening as it doesn't contain caffeine. 4
My dog enjoyed getting her treats from this toy.  I had watched some videos of dogs playing with the star before I purchased it and those dogs were pushing the star around with their paw.  Mine just nudged it with her nose and was able to get all of the treats. I think I can tighten the tension on it but I haven't tried that yet.  Overall it was fun but not super challenging. 4
Love getting something new for my diet. Tried it plain, then added cubed chicken and broccoli. It was really good! Everything I have tried from NaMASTE HAS BEEN WONDERFUL. Keep coming up with new things!<br />Elinor in Kennewick, WA<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKXG8W">Namaste Foods, Gluten Free Say Cheez Pasta Dish, 9-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a> 5
On the first offer my ferret didn't want the treat. But a couple of days later I noticed him trying to steal the whole bag, so I offered a piece again. This time, and ever since, he's loved it. Go figure!<br /><br />I like this treat for ferrets because the pieces are appropriately sized (ie- small) for a ferret, and the ingredients and stats are superior to most ferret treats! His digestion has been less affected by these than by many ferret treats also :) 5

The reason why I ordered this on-line is because the only Pop Chips they have in my store are the regular and salt and vinegar & barbeque.  I LOVE the sour cream and onion ones - actually I love ALL of them, but it's great to have them in the 100 calorie bag, because if they weren't I wouldn't be able to stop eating them. 5
I bought both the Creme Caramel and this Hazelnut kcup and I couldn't tell them apart even if my life depended on it... The flavor is pretty weak and the coffee itself is too and unlike the Caramel one, this one has a nasty bitter aftertaste like the flavor is artificial.  Yeah, I know it's artificial but I hate that it actually tastes like a chemical!  Yuk...<br /><br />This is one of those coffees you can serve to company who doesn't know good coffee or people you don't want to have come to your house any more as one cup of this and they won't be your friends after it!  It really is quite bad. 1
This peach flavored diet tea by Snapple is extremely refreshing after a long summer's day! It's truly a diet tea--there are zero calories. It's best served chilled; and it has a mild but not overwhelming peach flavor to it that is just right. Snapple makes this with green and black tea leaves; there's also a mild green tea flavor mixed in with the peach flavoring. They use filtered water as well. This tea is sweetened somewhat with Aspartame; but Snapple adds in just the right amount so that it's not excessively sweet. If you want really tea that is rather sweet, you'll either have to look further or use this with added sweetener. It also contains phenylalanine and it is kosher if these are dietary concerns for you.<br /><br />If you have other questions, the company has a toll free number so that people can contact them.<br /><br />Overall, this tea is perfect for a hot summer's day when you want something cool to refresh yourself and whet your whistle. I highly recommend this product. 5
This is a very good deal. The coffee goes without saying. A perfect cup every time.  I have had a Keurig for a few years now, and to me there is nothing out there that can touch it. A fabulous, fresh cup every time. I never go to Dunkin Donuts or Starbucks anymore.<br /><br />The offer is a good one. I bought 5 boxes of 24 for $10.95 each and shipping was free! I saw another review where the guy said this was "high" compared to prices locally. I have yet to find the same deal locally. Supermarkets rob you for 12 pods and Bed, Bath and Beyond gives you 16 or 18 for $9.99 at last check (and it could have gone up) as coffee has gone up. I also used to get the same coffee at the same price a couple of years ago at "CoffeeforLess.com. Their prices have increased dramatically recently. I don't see where there are any better values around online or locally. 5
I thought this salt was fluoride free unfortunately it is fluoridated, avoid paying extra. [...]. (Over the last few years a new scam has emerged in Europe which is rapidly spreading across the world.<br /><br />  It involves ordinary rock salt from the "salt range" in Pakistan being marketed as luxurious and healing "Himalaya Salt".<br /><br />  It is also sold as "Himalayan Crystal Salt", "Hunza-Kristallsalz" or natural "Kristallsalz", "VitaSal", "AromaLife", etc..<br /><br />  The scam is currently being introduced in India and the United States.<br /><br />  It will result in very high overall fluoride intake in anyone who follows the various "therapy recommendations") also noted from above website. 1

They taste great. Of course they are some what expensive. The lower rating is because of slow order processing and shipment. I ordered this on July 19 it wasn't shipped until July 26 I received it then on July 31. Which was the weekend and we were gone all weekend. So they sat on our doorsept all weekend. But they did put an ice pack in the packaging. So that helped. My daugther came home and found them and put them in refri. right away for me so when I got home and tried one they were fine. I think if you are not in a hurry order them. Otherwise find another source to get these bars. They are good and taste just like a real chocolate bar. 4
If you put enough creamer in this coffee, it is tolerable.  It does not have a good coffee taste, and I would not buy it again.  It is also highly overpriced. 2
My first impression on this particular drink when I first tasted it was that it reminded me a bit of the "Shasta Black Cherry" soda that I drank occasionally as a kid, although nowhere near as carbonated. Unlike the "Shasta Black Cherry," this drink did not have the lingering carbonated fizz that your typical sodas have, and a very pleasant surprise was the fact that I didn't get any disgusting soda burps after drinking it. You know the kind I mean, when you burp and you could swear that you just swallowed a week old dead skunk tail first. I also didn't get any real aftertaste when drinking it either.<br /><br />Now coming in at 8.3 ounces, the calories in this drink are reported at 130 calories per can. By comparison, a 12 ounce can of Pepsi comes in at 150 calories per can. So, on the calorie front I wouldn't say that there is much of a difference between this drink and Pepsi, although if you do the math, this drink would actually have more calories than Pepsi if you compared them in equal amounts. However, if you look at the list of ingredients in both, you can see where this product is far better for you than your traditional sodas, although obviously not as good for you as drinking an actual 100% pure fruit or vegetable juice.<br /><br />To put in plainly and succinctly, this is a fairly good tasting beverage and is definitely one I would consider drinking over the more traditional sodas that are currently available. However, the one primary detractor to this is the size of the can compared to the price.<br /><br />The one thing that I had not quite decided on whether it is a negative or a positive is the size of the can, which as I stated earlier comes in at 8.3 ounces compared to your traditional cans of soda that come in at 12 ounces. In addition to the size of the can, there is also the consideration of price, coming in at roughly $1.00 per can which is considerably more expensive than your average can of soda. Therefore, when you take the size of the product combined with the price, I would have to say that it is a definite negative and would probably keep me from purchasing this product.<br /><br />If they created 12 ounce cans and lowered the price, then I would be more apt to purchase this product.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Author of the Achieving Kicking Excellence series. 3
I like all kinds of snack foods and potato chips. The regular kind, kettle cooked, and the "modified" potato snacks such as Munchos (my favorite) Pringles, Lay's Baked, etc.<br /><br />But not these. They have almost a styrofoam consistency...so they aren't really crisp and snappy, just hard. Like stale styrofoam. Now, I could learn to live with the texture, but the flavor is odd, too. . Almost like an unnatural type of flavor. My husband doesn't even usually notice or comment on flavors in snack foods(just sorta eats,) but he said "I don't like these, they taste funny. Don't buy these again." My 12 year old kids wouldn't even eat them. Maybe the ones with flavoring (like BBQ) cover it up, but not with the plain. 2
I really enjoy this disposable. The only thing that would make it better would be for the cups and lids to be made out of a more eco friendly material. Coffee tastes great. 5
As a general rule, I hesitate to order food products for my kids that are made in China.  This, after the recent melamine-laced baby formula scandal in China.<br /><br />When I received my two boxes of this item, I was surprised and dismayed to see "Product of China" printed on the box. When I tried to return, Amazon refused because according to Amazon policy, grocery items cannot be returned.  The Amazon site for this item does not specify country of origin as China, or I would not have ordered it in the first place.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I am not generally against products of China. These banana chips may end up being a very fine product (I did not open the box and even try it yet), and I will probably end up eating it myself.<br /><br />But I cannot recommend it if you, like me, are concerned about Product of China food products for your kids, because it is from China, according to the box. 1
The package had 2" cuts down the center of the bag. The bag was also wrinkly. When I purchase this dog food at local stores the bags never look in bad condition as this one did. Some kibble had come through the cuts and spilled in the amazon packaging box. Not pleased, who knows how sanitary the food is anymore with the bag  broken. Love wellness brand dog food, but not the seller.<br />About wellness small breed- my toy poodle I was told was underweight even with free feed on  eukanuba  but know is a health weight due to the good taste and small kibble size. After disc surgery I soaked his food and he ate on own, big accomplishment for a picky eater who is in post surgery discomfort. 1
This was the most potent orange drink I have ever had. It might be "100% juice," but this drink has some kick.<br /><br />There are no artificial sweeteners in this drink, but it is so highly concentrated that it was overwhelmingly sweet and even the tang of the carbonation couldn't cute into the sugary flavor.<br /><br />It was WAY too strong for me and I thought it had kind of an odd aftertaste, but if you like carbonation and have a powerful craving for orange-tangerine, this is the drink for you. 2
Buffalo Bills Premium Snacks<br /><br />I realize that taste is an individual thing, but I thought I'd share my thoughts on these products.<br /><br />First, customer service is excellent.  I've always gotten exactly what I ordered in a very timely manner.<br /><br />So far I've ordered the following products:<br /><br />1) Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Mild Short Shots<br /><br />2) Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Hot Short Shots<br /><br />The first two short shots are very similar to Slim Jim's, just not individually wrapped, I just put them in a zip lock bag and find them very convenient to munch on( about a quarter pound per bag.<br /><br />3) Buffalo Bills 1.2lb Extra Smokeys<br />These are very smokey, but a little too dry for my taste.<br /><br />4) Buffalo Bills 16oz Premium Hickory Beef Jerky Pieces (random size)<br /><br />Taste great if you are a jerky lover.<br /><br />5) Buffalo Bills 2.1lb Pepperoni  Short Shots<br />Probably the closest to Slim Jim's of all the short shots<br /><br />6) Big Buffalo Ole Smokies<br />Fatter, crisp not as crunchy as short shots, individually wrapped.<br /><br />7) Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Honey Strung<br />O.K. taste.  My wife hates the smell.  My Brother doesn't care much for them either.<br /><br />All- in- all, I highly recommend these products (in the order listed) and this company.<br /><br />Gunner  January, 2010 5
Last year I tasted several of the Izze fruit drinks for the first time and became addicted.  I have an affinity for fruity foods and beverages, and that fact combined with my positive experiences with Izze prompted me to try THE SWITCH.<br /><br />I'll say it right off the bat - THE SWITCH was okay, but it doesn't really compare in taste to Izze.  If I had never tasted Izze, I might enjoy THE SWITCH more.  As it is, I thought it was tasty enough, but I wouldn't drive out of my way to get it.  If I were in the convenience store looking for a refreshing fruity beverage, I might buy it again.<br /><br />I tried two different flavors of THE SWITCH, and the Black Cherry was my preference over the other flavor, Kiwi Berry.  The cherry flavor really stood out and with every sip I felt sure that real black cherries were used to make this beverage.<br /><br />To sum up, I think THE SWITCH is a nice alternative to sodas, although a little pricier than colas are.  It is a refreshing fruit beverage, but there are other brands that have a tastier flavor.<br /><br />If Amazon allowed half-star ratings, I would give this 3.5 stars. 3
A Quaker Soft Baked Cereal bar in Banana Bread was sent to me as part of the Summer Beauty VoxBox from Influenster. I have never been a big breakfast eater, so these light bars are perfect for me to grab and go with. I did not have the bar warmed up, but it's nice to have that as an option if you have more time than just grab and go. Will for sure buy these! 4
That's not a compliment. Maxwell House isn't exactly top shelf. Personally, it's not as good as Donut Shop but it is 13 cents per cup less when you subscribe and save.<br /><br />I love the packaging where the bottom is a coffee filter and not a k cup. Since it's not the proprietary k cup design, they can probably avoid royalties to Keurig. But in the end you drink coffee not for looks or cost but taste. And while it tastes OK, there are tastier options out there. 3
My dog used to LOVE these.  I thought I was was giving him a great "treat", that was actually a supplement to improve his arthritis symptoms.  Then, his liver enzymes were elevated, and he was becoming less active, and always thirsty.  Thank goodness a friend sent me a link about the FDA warnings, 2-3 since, 2009!<br />Hundreds of dogs have died,very painful and expensive deaths.  If you love your dog-go to the FDA  website yourself...and Do Not BUY these "treats"! 1
I guess it boils down to one's taste buds or the outright need to have pasta in your diet, both I can live without thanks to cabbage, cauliflower and broccoli...all which I shred to appear like either rice or "broccoli slaw" or eat my spaghetti sauce or whatever other sauce with other ingredients without pasta.  I was diagnosed Type 2 Diabetic four months ago and despite taking insulin I couldn't get my blood sugar under control; I made the switch to LCHF and  less than a month later reduced my insulin by half and again by half and today I manage my diabetes without any insulin, pill or injection.  A reviewer used the analogy of eating rubber bands and another, cartilage and both are right.  I remember someone recommending me Dreamfield's pasta...except it tasted pretty darn good but falsely advertised it's product; it was no different than Ronzoni's Smart Taste which I allow myself to eat about once a month as a splurge treat.  I gave up long ago thinking this sort of stuff is low carb heaven and accepted it was better to retool my recipes then to allow myself to believe I couldn't live without starch; come to find out, I can. 2
This order of crackers was burned, the entire case! The tops of the crackers were falling off because of it.<br /><br />If you like burned crackers, then these are for you.<br /><br />The price has also increased. Let's see now, burned crackers, super high price. Do you really want to purchase this item?<br /><br />Where oh where is Susie and quality control? 2
We have enjoyed this tea and the price was very reasonable.  However, we expected a more robust taste. We felt we needed to add two bags to make it to our taste.  Overall, we would recommned it, but we would like to see more tea put in the bag. 4
Seriously?!!!! Have you read the product features? It Says "Place in large critter keeper for frogs to burrow." What the hell???!! Does anybody preview/edit this stuff? I volunteer. 1
Our recipients said the cheese was wonderful but I will say that if you are ordering as a gift make sure you wait until right before you are going to give it to buy.  The cheese itself comes in a beautiful box with ice packs but then is in a styrofoam cooler for shipment. I recommend taking it out of the cooler before giving as it can ruin the effect. 4
I have two cats.  One cat loved this all natural grilled tuna; the fussier one tried to bury it.  There were two things I didn't like about the product.  First, the zippered plastic envelope was very difficult to open. (I ended up placing it in a different sealable bag.) Second, it was very pricey: almost $10 for just over 4 oz compared to about $1 for a 5 oz can of tuna at a grocery store.  I tried the product because it was available to me at no charge through the Vine program.  Despite the fact that my one cat loved it, I would not pay full price for it myself.  (Sorry, kitty!) 2
I love apple chips but these were terrible. They are rubbery and did not taste any apple flavor. I would not buy them 2
My wife and I shared a can of illy issimo Coffee Drink. I am not a great fan of cold coffee so I included my wife's opinion in this review, since she drinks iced coffee daily. The illy was too strong for both of us, but was not bitter. If it had been hot I probably would have liked sipping it, it seems to be close to the strength of espresso. My wife added ice and a lot of flavored half and half and found it very good. Doing as she did, rather defeats the purpose of a can of coffee that one opens and drinks on the go. I would recommend this drink to those who like cold espresso. 3
I was interested in trying this coffee.  Although I don't have a problem with the acidity in most coffees, when we make a pot of coffee, we often tend to let it sit for several hours while we drink it over time, so we need a coffee whose flavor is able to be consistent for the duration.<br /><br />I was a bit wary of trying a French Roast--my husband and I tend to prefer our coffee on the mild side, and thus we usually drink Breakfast Blend varieties.  Upon opening the package, however, this coffee did not smell overly strong, nor was the flavor overwhelming.  In fact, perhaps due to the low acid, I found it to be a relatively mild-tasting coffee with just a hint of "roastiness" to it.  The flavor did remain fairly consistent over time.  I would not re-purchase this coffee myself, as there are definitely other brands that I prefer, but if you find the acid in coffee to be problematic, this may be worth a try. 4
My cats love it.  It is a bit overpriced though.  And I don't like the epackaging claim that it is made of rice paper.  Now, that sounds all so nice and eco friendly, but the truth is, it is plastic.  Perhaps the outer packaging is layered with rice paper for effect.  This doesn't change the fact that I am stuck with plastic packaging that is not biodegradable, and possible leaching of chemicals into the product.  Nonetheless, I concede convenience of plastic packaging and some inevitability of its use, especially in shipping.  Just, let's not make a misleading claim to give off a wrong impression. 4
Ordered these for my two Chessies. They love them and the price is a third of what local stores wanted. The section between the knots is hollow and contains bits of hide instead of layered rolls of rawhide; the dogs dont mind and consume every part. The bits out and tend to make a mess, thus 4 stars.  I subscribed for bimonthly for both the addition discount and the ease of not having to remember to order more. 4
It's sweet, packed with seeds that get stuck in your throat, doesn't taste at all of pumpkin, and filling after a couple teaspoons. Wouldn't buy again. 2
I've tried 3 different recipes with Carbquik.  I used it to bread chicken- just barely ok.  The biscuits I tried were terrible.  The dumplings for chicken and dumplings were a mess.  They didn't hold together when I put them in the boiling chicken broth to cook.  I had to pitch the doughy mess and order dinner out.  The mix its self has a peculiar odor that is unappetizing.  I wouldn't recommend buying this product. 1
These are just OK.... was expecting better from Cat. The flavor is good, not great. Unlike other reviews, I have not found the olives to be particularly firm.  Perhaps the pitted olives are better?  Probably won't buy again. 3
I had been offering my housecats the Fancy Feast canned foods with the Fancy Feast kibble always available.  My black Coonie-mix cat would regularly vomit up the clearly identifiable, undigested, highly dyed, cutesy shaped, Fancy Feast bits (usually on my cream colored carpet!)  This cat also had already had to have one tooth extracted and I wanted to try to feed him something that would set better on his tummy.  After doing some web researching, I ordered our first bag of Royal Canin Indoor Mature Cat 27 a month ago.  We went through the gradual change over thing but I don't think it was really needed as the new food was readily accepted.  The first bag has been eaten and joy, and the upchucking has ceased!!! Even his  hairball "gifts" are getting smaller and much more infrequent.<br /><br />My other Maine Coon is 12 and oddly enough, hairballs never seemed to bother her but, she was eating less and less.  She was becoming less active and just didn't seem to be interested in eating kibble or canned and she was noticably loosing weight! Her vet said she could be heading towards a thyroid problem but he wasn't ready to put her on medication yet.  I am happy to report that my sweet girl has really taken to this Indoor Mature Cat 27 diet.  It is helping her get back to her normal, Maine Coon size and she does seem to be feeling much better, even joining in on some playtime with the young'uns!<br /><br />Who knew a change of diet could work such wonders?  Clearly, the attitude of "kibble is kibble" is out the window.  How could I ever return to feeding my cats a food that would make them vomit?! 5
Received the Petite Lite Greenies 27 oz box today.  The picture shows a count of 96 bones, but I only got a box of 45.  I realize that the picture shows the Teenie size w/96 and 27oz, so naturally the next size up Petite would have fewer bones, but I think receiving only 45 is a bit deceiving.  45 bones for almost $25 isn't bad, but I won't be purchasing on a regular basis.  These are for a Christmas gift, so they are a splurge anyway!  My dogs, a Chihuahua, MinPin and Shichon love them! 3
This is a really fun idea! It is a fun treat to give them, and my dogs REALLY like it. The reason why I am giving it a low rating, is because it stinks, really bad! The smell is so offensive that my boyfriend won't let me feed this treat to my dogs while he's around. If my dogs didn't love the taste, and if it wasn't so much fun to feed to them, it would be in the garbage. I won't be buying it again, and don't recommend it. However, if you ever find it on sale or find a free sample or something, it is kind of a fun thing to try ONCE. Another issue is the fact that it comes in bacon and beef flavors, which can (and did) stain their mouths and cause dark tear stains. 2
I really like pasta, so I'm probably not a good judge of what's "good" in pasta - I like it all.  That said, I liked this product as far as the food, the taste, etc. goes.  However, I have to say that I really prefer the packaged pasta dishes that Hormel puts out.  With the Hormel products everything in the package is already together.  All you have to do is throw them in the microwave for a bit and you're done - and flavor/product-wise the Hormel packages are just as good as this.  So, in a nutshell - while I liked this product, I really like the Hormel pastas better and will probably stick with those in the future. 3
A very tasty little cake. The cake was surprisingly moist, and the caramel rum sauce was very sweet but not too overpowering. We'll definitely be buying this product again. 5
The presence of cinnamon makes the chips softer and kind of soggy. The taste is good and cinnamon is good addition, but I perfer the crisp non-cinnamon version. 3
My favorite of the Wolfgang series discovered when trying all of the flavors in the available sample pack. Very good flavor, consistent with each pod and not overdone with added flavors. Very good dark roast Colombian cup of coffee from the Wolf. 5
These mushrooms are wonderful!  They taste rich and woodsy, and add real complexity to soups, stews or anyplace you would use fresh mushrooms.<br /><br />Dried mushrooms don't weigh much, so you will find your order may be larger than you expect.  The supplier recommends that you store them in the refrigerator or freezer.<br /><br />Shipping was amazing.  I ordered them on Friday and received them on Monday, standard shipping -- the package started in Massachusetts and arrived in Seattle in four days!  Very happy with that! 5
I was really excited to try this and I work at 3 am once a week. I usually take an AMP energy drink with me which I enjoy and works quite well, but I thought I would try this one. It was not a good experience for me. The morning that I drank it, I really needed. I did not get much sleep at all (probably about 2 hours) and I was tired. I started sipping on the the drink and I started feeling nauseous. I don't know if the nausea was because I was really tired (I tend to get nauseous whe I'm tired) or if it was from the drink itself (after I read the label I saw it had 1,000mg of Taurine compared to the 173mg in the AMP. But I decided to stop drinking it and switched to an AMP afterwards and my nausea went away.<br /><br />So, this is not a drink that I will have again, and I'm a little disappointed that I didn't get the chance to see if it actually worked or not. But compared to other energy drinks, the taste wasn't that bad. It wasn't my favorite, but it was a lot better tasting than other drinks that are on the market. 2
Very odd product.  Can says No GM ingredients (Genetically Modified?) but the ingredients include partially hydrogenated canola and palm oils.  Yucky source of transfats so be aware that thsi imported product contains 2g trans fat per serving...and each can has 3.5 servings.<br /><br />Taste wise - in my opinion, tastes like soggy, wet fruitcake (not in any good way at all).  WAY TOO SWEET and I even got a few bites with a sandy, gritty, crunch texture which was horrible and I can only hope it was from the raisins?!<br /><br />This product is not pleasant tasting at all so I am just not sure about all the other great reviews.  But for my taste, I couldn't choke down even a few bites of this stuff.  Only thing I appreciated from this was the few laughs from friends/family over the name of this Heinz product. 1
I still haven't eaten all of these. It takes a while to go through five pounds of gummies :) 5
Our Cavalier King Charles Spaniel loves these treats!  We purchased soft milk bones to help her with her training but we have to break them up every time we want to praise her.  There are the perfect size and I don't feel too bad for giving her a couple at a time.  We haven't really started training her but giving them to her every time she goes potty outside rather than inside is working out great.  Glad I got the 1 lb bag too because she is going to go threw them.  Oh, my cat even likes them.... 4
This product is the same as I get in Petsmart at a much better price. The service was quick and efficient. We use it for our old wiener dog who has some iron deficiencies and it helped him alot, but I am not a vet. 5
When it says don't leave dogs unattended with this bone they mean it. It also says don't allow them to ingest pieces larger then rice or something like that... they mean that too. My 18 month old Pit was loving this bone and I tried to take every piece that she chewed off away from her as it came off. A few pieces must have got past me and in her tummy and on the floor, because she started having violent vomiting a day latter, then our 8 year old pit started doing the same. We were for sure that we had got some Chinese chicken strips or something then we started going through the vomit (sick what we do for our kids) and found Nylabone chunks in both dogs vomit. Haven't had a issue since. My husband has banned any product from this company from entering our house again.<br />Buyer beware and watch your dogs. 2
This canned chicken is the perfect thing to make a quick salad, sandwhich, or toss into a soup for lunch or dinner.<br /><br />While it will never replace a roast chicken in the oven ready to be served, it's got a nice chicken taste. It's just not as firm as regular chicken you prepared yourself.<br /><br />If you remember to keep a can or two in your desk at work, you won't be without some solid nutrition in a pinch. Try it cold with some yummy salad dressing and a few crackers!<br /><br />Swanson Premium Chunk Chicken Breast is an excellent buy. 5
I took these into the office and they were a hit. Good assortment of flavors, tasty, and vitamin fortified is a nice benefit. Would be five stars, but a little pricey, especially with shipping. 4
Popcorn tastes OK -- but the kernal pop way too small.  It's like a whole bowl of the bottom of the tub of popcorn crumbs.  Regular Orville Redenbacher popcorn is much better 2
This food is great. My 11 year old beagle loves it and she is much more active since I changed her food. I highly recommend this dog food. 5
An otherwise good gum reduced to a three-star review by really mind-boggling packaging. I fail to see the advantage of the foil-covered capsule approach. I lose approximately one piece a pack by pressing just the wrong way and having the gum shoot out of the package like a cannon, forever lost.<br /><br />The gum itself is decent, lasts for slightly less than a twenty five minute car drive, packs a comfortable punch, and improves breath. Still, it's not outstanding, and doesn't overcome the poor packaging, so won't be buying any more. 3
I bought this along with the regular dark roast at a considerable discounted price.  Well lets just say you get what you pay for.  The flavor really is not there and this as well is not much of a dark roast. 3
I had ordered the the GN popcorn to go with the popcorn machine that I purchased for a Christmas gift for my husband.<br />The 6 oz size was perfect for a family of 4. My husband loves the convenience of the portion packs and the popcorn tastes very close to movie theatre popcorn.<br />It was a bit salty for my taste but my family loves salt so they loved the popcorn.<br />I just ordered another pack but this time the 8oz portion size for bigger gatherings. 4
At long last, an option for writing on melting chocolates!  These are the only brand I've found so far that is able to do that.  They still require a little coaxing and repeated strokes for the color to fill in solidly (and for that I give 4, instead of 5, stars), but the marker tip and shape really makes detailed decorating so much easier! 4
ordered some from an amazon-fulfilled associate. Normal amazon shipping etc...The cigars were cracked and stale. How does chewing gum shatter and break? No way it was fit for consumption.<br />Easy return process. 1
I've been buying Jet Fuel for over a year and really like it. So, buying the 50 pack seemed to make sense. Amazon's list price is $27. The third party sellers start at $45. Need I say more? Buy it somewhere else. 2
This canned cat food is my cat's favorite, and I'm happy to be able to feed it to her. Given what I have read about non-organic cat food, I hope this continues to be available.  She also likes the Newman's organic turkey canned cat food, but that's just her second-favorite. 4
i picked those bars, because they're my favorite larabars. When package arrived, I noticed, that even though there's still 2 months till expiration  date, my bars are stale and don't taste as the one I was usually getting at my grocery store. 2
I know organic has a different taste, but this is bad. Couldn't get even one cup down. I won't buy again. 2
so you get 5 bully sticks for 25 bucks if you subscribe and save.  Give me a brake... if I am giving my sweet puppy more expensive treats than I eat than i need a labotomy...check out the downtown supply 30count  6 inch bully sticks for 40 bucks...thats alot better value 1
I have tried all brands of gourmet peanuts and these are by far the best peanuts.  In addition, they are a little bit cheaper than the leading competitor. 5
I bought these cause I'm a chocolate snap lover, and I had been craving some. The lack of trans fats and description drew me in.<br /><br />Let's just say this: I took these over to a family party, and none of the kids liked it. NOT ONE. And most of the adults, the best they could say was, 'Eh.' I think two folks had more than one.<br /><br />I'd have to say skip these cookies. They don't make your mouth sing with chocolatey snappy joy. 2
Out of all the commercial grade dog foods, this one is a higher quality, but do not let that fool you. First, the ingredients are listed by weight, not by content so there is not as much chicken in the product as you might think. To make matters worse, there is only chicken and chicken meal in this product for protein. Soy meal is only a filler for dogs so they get no nutritional value out of it. If there were more meats and less fillers I would be more pleased with this product. I have a beagle puppy who chows this product down, however, this really means nothing. Just because your dog eats it doesn't make it good for them. Make sure the first few ingredients are meat, and the product has little to no grain (rice, oats, barley are GOOD; corn, wheat, soy, etc are NOT). 2
DOES NOT LOOK LIKE PICTURE, AND DOES NOT INCLUDE THE SAME ITEMS PICTURED.  DO NOT BUY THIS AS A GIFT, AS RECIPIENT WILL BE DISAPPOINTED. 1
"The Switch" seems to be another take on carbonated fruit drinks. It immediately reminded me of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00094JEUO">Izze</a> line of drinks that I've tried in the past...same size, and same basic idea of just fruit juice and carbonated water. After trying this one sample though, I'd have to say I prefer Izze. The black cherry Switch that I tried had a decent enough flavor (very mild cherry flavor but still pleasant), but it was really sweet, and had even more sugar per can than Izze, which was already pretty high. I think these drinks are a nice alternative to sodas, if you just have to have something with fizz and can't take artificial sweeteners. Definitely a better choice for kids who want something sweet but at least a tad healthier since these are natural sugars with a lower glycemic index. But it's still a simple sugar, and there's a LOT of it in this drink, 33g in 8.3 oz. The price is also pretty hefty, at almost $1 a can. Personally, I think I do just as well getting fruit juice of my choosing and adding some club soda to it for fizz. But when I am in the mood for something sweet to pack for a hike, etc. and just have to have something, I'd probably look for Izze drinks first. 3
I ordered several lifesaver varieties, the cherry stuck together.  This may be a standard problem with cherry, I'm not sure. 3
I ordered this product in hope of obtaining a good chocolate substitute for my toddler to snack on. Unfortunately, beside a lot of sugar these chips are loaded with saturated fats - almost certainly with plenty of trans fats since the oils are listed as being partially-hydrogenated [trans fat content not described on label]. Taste-wise these chips are too sweet for my liking but at least have the basic carob flavor that I remember from chips available in the stores back in the 80s and 90s - albeit a purer carob with less fat content would be most welcomed. 2
I have to say that I liked this combination of chocolate and peanut butter.  Well, truthfully, you can mix chocolate with anything and I will be happy!!!!<br />This has a good chocolate flavor as well as a peanut butter taste.  It's a good combination.<br />I don't like it spead on bread, so I use graham crackers or a butter cookie.  But, with all honesty, I'm a knife dipper!!!! But before you cringe, the whole jar is designated as mine, so I can get away with this.  Plus, if I offer anyone this type of Peanut Butter, I get a new jar for the company!!!<br />I liked it as it was described correctly.  I would have LOVED it if it only taste like chocolate.  Oh, but that's a different product.<br />Thanks, TJ 4
My dogs LOVE these treats! Freeze dried easy to throw some in a zip lock bag and take them with you. Wonderful training treats because they're so easy to put in your pocket. Great deal too! 5
These packets are easy to use.  Loved that.  Used them at a fundraising event.  However, I had no way to gauge how many servings each packet makes.  I would have appreciated some information about that on the Amazon page and on the packets themselves. I ordered 4 boxes and am stuck with 3.5 boxes that cannot be returned. 4
I've been using this "low acid" coffee for a few weeks now and along with the taste, I enjoy not having an "acid stomach", especially the "morning after".  To me, there is no difference in taste between it and regular coffee.<br /><br />I give it 5 stars. 5
This tasted disgusting and bland compared to the canned pumpkin that I usually purchase. The store-brand savings is not worth the sacrifice in flavor. I typically eat pumpkin straight out of the can because it is cheap, convenient and healthy. 3
This is a good syrup for making chocolate milk but is a bit too sweet for making a great mocha.  It's definitely a step up from cheaper store brands, though!<br />If you like a richer, stronger, slightly bitter mocha, I would recommend Torani chocolate syrup instead.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NBWO1E">Torani Original Mocha Sauce, Chocolate, 16.5-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)</a> 3
With two, 5 month old Golden Retriever puppies (and an 8 year old), I was looking for a bag of raw hides at a good price. I realize that the description states 2.5", however the picture makes the bones look like tightly knotted, "normal" sized bones - they are not. They are tiny, almost see-through and take up HALF the length of my palm, and are skinny. The pups devoured the entire bag in less then a week (they were given other treats as well.) I swear when I gave them the first one, they looked at me like "are you kidding??" Lesson learned. If you have a teacup breed, these are the bones for you (that is if teacup breeds even eat raw-hides)!! 3
I used this coffee years ago when it was sold by the A & P grocery stores but I did not like the taste of this particular coffee. 1
I love real chocolate covered almonds, so I was not expecting to like these "cocoa roast almonds". I must say I was pleasantly surprised. They have a nice chocolate flavor, not too sweet, and very crunchy, toasted almonds. For the same calories as regular almonds, that's quite a feat. My only complaint would be they're a little dry. Have a beverage nearby to fully enjoy your snack. I passed them around at work and the consensus was "pretty good!" It's not as good as the real thing, but quite a good substitute! 4
My 3 small dogs loved this flavor, but only one could tolerate it. I think the cherry flavor is too rich for some dogs. Especially if they have a sensitive stomach. Stick to the carrot flavored ones. Otherwise, good, healthy dog treat! 3
This is, hands down, my favorite Haribo candy.  It has a wonderful strawberry flavor and the sweetness is not overpowering. 5
This huge bag of chocolates contained old (white and cracked) chocolates that were completely melted all over the inside of the bag!  Noone at work would even touch them since they looked so sad and gross... what a waste and disappointment!  Will be wary to ever purchase from this seller again 1
I have tried and enjoyed The Switch black cherry flavor, but their kiwi-strawberry left a lot to be desired.  To my palate, the flavor seemed a mix of floral and medicine-y, not very pleasant.  I appreciate the fact that they are trying to push a healthy alternative to soda (basically carbonated water and fruit juice), but they need to get the flavor right. 2
I love SnackMasters' turkey jerky, so I naturally decided to try natural turkey jerky.  This turkey jerky is the same (or better) quality as the regular variety, but too dry.  I would recomend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EZMRRA">SnackMasters Turkey Jerky, Teriyaki</a>, instead 2
This bubble gum does not stick to my partials. I have been chewing this gum for the past 10 years, it is my drug of choice. It relaxes me after a hard day in the office. 4
Product used in carnival-type popper.  Nice to have everything self-contained.  However, so many kernels remain unpopped, you can watch them fly out of popper.  Product is very salty.  But if you're looking for real movie popcorn, this is it. 3
These beans produce a nice tasting brew. However, the beans look old and dry. After opening the bag, I immediately put them into 1 pound bags and froze, hoping to extend the life of the beans. 3
My 1st no/low acid coffee. Not bad at all.  The dark roast was not too heavy but provided balance needed. Tasted like a good quality decaf coffee. I would buy it if I was uable to drink regular coffee! 4
This is a light to medium roast, wish it was slightly stronger, but the flavor is good and I am having it every morning using 2 6 oz. k-cups pumps to make it as strong as possible. 4
I wanted desperately to love, or even like this drink mix, but am not having success doing so. I love mint tea but this tastes all green tea to me. It's too strong a green and too weak a mint flavor for me to enjoy it. Every once in a while I'll try to tolerate a bottle again hoping I change my taste. It's not gross and so clearly is appealing to some people. 2
These sticks definitely don't look like ones in the picture.<br />They are much thinner and IMHO not worth the money. I should have returned it but instead gave my dog (GSD) 5 at a time to keep her busy.<br /><br />I'd stick with the Redbarn or equivalent from another website. 1
Like the title says. There just aren't that many nuts. The picture shows a good amount of almonds,peanuts and cranberry. But the bars are mostly made of oats w/ high maltose corn syrup......Whatever that is. But those are really the first 2 ingredients. Other wise it's actually a pretty good bar. Probably not as healthy as a kind bar. But a lot cheaper. If you have sam's club member ship look into buying these there. You can get a pack of 30- 1.2 oz bars for  $10. 4
Kettle chis are the best ever! These used to be my favorite flavor until I tried their Salt and Pepper kind but I'm sure this is just a personal preference.<br /><br />Crunchy, real potato chips! 5
I used to buy the big bags of these and eat them constantly, then I looked at the back of the bag and saw they used MSG in the cheddar kind, but not in most of the others. I ate chex mix as a healthy alternative to chips and other junk food so them using something like this basically had me switch over to another snack. You can have your own opinions about MSG, but I think it's lazy personally when they don't even have to use it but they do anyways.<br /><br />They did taste great, though. Maybe if more people complain about them using MSG they'll release a new formula without it. And no, I don't mean take mono sodium glutamate off the label and replace it with yeast extract, or autolyzed yeast extract when it's basically just a different name for MSG. I'd buy them again if we got a no MSG formula. 1
Hi, this would be better if it was not as sweet with such an aftertaste, it tastes like saccharin and is a bit overpowering. 2
I bought these for my  grandbabies because they are earths best and organic. They like them,but not as well as the cinnamon ones. I tried them,thought they tasted kind of like dirt. 4
This review is for Zuke's Chicken-Flavored treats.<br /><br />The only problem I have with these treats is their overwhelming smell. It's not pleasant at all, almost like they're on the verge of spoiling. I've left the bag open accidentally and returned to the whole lower level of my house reeking. Even after putting them in a sandwich baggy for training during our walking session, the smell clung to my coat. Basically, anything these things touch, they'll share their smell with.<br /><br />Stench aside, these are fabulous treats. My dog responds more readily to them during our training sessions than any others I've tried so far (guess what disgusts me smells like heaven to him). They're also already the perfect size, which is very convenient.<br /><br />I'll definitely try out some different flavors next time. 4
This is not the original Swiss Muesli that made this company famous and I've found that in a lot of the stores in this area this is now the only Familia Swiss Meusli available.  In my opinion, what they've done is an attempt to make a less costly product ( for them that is} by adding large volume puffed type cereals to the mix. This makes for a lighter product , but with the same size box. The original box weighs 32 ounces, compared to 21 ounces for this new product. Unfortunately, this results in an inferior product, both in taste and nutrition. The real original product is still available in a red box , but I fear they might phase it out if they can get people to go for this cheap imitation. 2
I love Kettle Brand Chips!<br />I've been in love with the Honey Dijon for years and decided to try out their other flavors.<br /><br />Sea Salt & Vinegar Chips are TANGY, SOUR, and make my lips pucker when I eat too many at a time.  I got 12 big bags for a steal from amazon ($11 WHAT?!?).<br /><br />Personally, the flavor is too much for me, but my mom & aunt LOVE them and they hate potato chips. 4
The ingredients in this dog food contain soy and corn which have about the same nutritional value as sawdust. Don't be fooled by the fancy label or celebrity jerks who promote this food. Dogs are not meant to eat grain (a little oatmeal or brown rice is sometimes okay). Typical of Purina dog foods, this is full of artificial dyes and cheap fillers. They get away with it because too many dog owners don't bother to look at the ingredients or educate themselves on dog nutrition. A dog who has constant gas or eats their own filth is not normal. A raw diet is best for dogs, but there is some decent kibble out there like Orijen, Natural Balance, and Merrick. This one is for the trash heap. 1
These anchovies are excellent; nothing like the salty, fishy cousins packed in oil available on a grocers shelf. Instead the taste has depth and character, somewhat like a sardine but with a little more bite. The drawback here is that you must scrape the skin off and "filet" the little fishes, worth the effort in my opinion. 5
I was in Peru some years ago, and brought back 2 boxes of Coca tea.  It was packaged like 100 count boxes of Lipton, (as is the Windsor).  It was much stronger than the teas I have bought on Amazon, and I wonder if the Import Quality print on the box designates a weaker strength than what is available in country. 1
We are glad we found this mix as we make pancakes without eggs for my son who has an allergy.<br />They taste fine for our family- we like them many ways! 4
My kitties love these. Other Goodlife treats are good. Kitties adore these. Beg and plead for them. I think they must be addictive for cats. 5
My husband and I love this product because it is naturally sweet without the taste of artificial sweeteners.  Most peach flavored teas taste like sugar and artificial flavors but not this drink.  It is wonderfully watery to quench any thirst.  I only wish that Amazon would always sell it because we would buy it on a regular basis. 5
Wonderful treat for training!  Perfect cube size for large dog.  Somew crumbling of product once you get to the bottom; spread on their food for a special treat. 5
Recently bought a 24 pack of this new "improved"  stride sweet cinnamon gum.  It tastes more like the Dentyne Spicy Cinnamon gum and gets too soft and sticky in 5 to 10 minutes.  The original stride sweet cinnamon gum is much better and lasts longer. 3
This is a good product.  Starbuck's sugar free is better and I really want to find something organic next, but it's okay. 3
This might be ok for "taco night" for dinner but other than that this is nothing to write home about. I've tasted other chipotle sauces that are much better than this. This definitely needs some work if they want people to buy this on a regular basis. Why some reviewers are raving and giving this 5 star reviews I have no idea why they would praise something like this. 2
I tried both these and just the plain shirataki noodles with zero calories purchased at my local Asian market and I prefer these the best. The plain Shirataki feel like a noodle shaped gummie candy when you eat them...not as hard but too 'slippery'..The House Brand with tofu didn't have that same 'slippery' taste. I didnt find preperation to be that bothersome as a couple of posters have mentioned. I just open them and pour them in a strainer and let the water run over them throughly, flipping them once or twice to get them rinsed well then I toss them in a pan of boiling water for about 15 seconds (they're already cooked) drain and season them however I wish. They have been a great addition to my low calorie diet. I just tried them last night with a packet of seasoning from a box of Suddenly Salad (classic) and I was in heaven...40 calories for the WHOLE bag! 5
Salty snacks are my favorite; however, did not care for this bag of cheddar multigrain skinny sticks.  Really like the crunch! crunch!!  Almost no cheddar flavor in my bag.  Gave 3 stars because maybe if had more cheddar seasoning would have taste better.  Can't say to buy or not but.  It all depends on whether you like extreme cheddar flavor vs. no cheddar taste.  Maybe some of the other flavors will have more flavor??? 3
I am a total sucker for kitchen gadgets, but this just goes too far. The price is insane for what is essentially a glorified ice cube tray, which does not work as well as your basic ice cube tray. It's difficult to get the cubes out of this tray, it has an odd shape that wastes space in your freezer, and it makes 2 ounce servings, which are fine if you know you want 2 ounces, but I prefer to make 1 ounce sizes so that I can combine different flavors, or make just 1 (or 3) ounces if my baby is not as hungry and I don't want any waste. The only reason I gave it any stars at all is because of the lid - that IS handy, I must admit. But you can buy ice cube trays with lids too, that will actually fit in your freezer and stack well. TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY. Okay, it IS cute. I wish it wasn't so cute... 1
I didn't know it will have such a fishy flavor, I think I've wasted my money on this one.<br /><br />I think I was looking for chile/curry paste, I guess I should have looked at the ingredients. 3
I Ordered this for my 2 year old daughter birthday, and it arrived all most of them broked, and realy porely made, whith the animal faces so ugly! i Would not buy this again! 1
I'm a self-proclaimed connoisseur of beef jerky, I have probably eaten a wheelbarrow full of different brands. This "Wild Ride" is the toughest cut I have ever come across. You have to chew, chew, chew, and chew! Couple pieces and your jaw is too sore to complain much. No date on the bag, contacted manufacturer by email, thought maybe I got some old stock...no reply. Great taste, but too tough! 1
Well, I tried them but did not enjoy them.  I like gingerale but I guess I don't like ginger candies.  If you like ginger you may enjoy these. 2
Sometimes, I'd rather have cocoa instead of coffee at work. This meets my cocoa craving. I do not need to add sugar - just add water and brew! 5
While I find this dish to be quite tasty, those with Celiac disease should be aware that Tasty Bite dishes are not gluten free.  There is a warning on the label that the product is manufactured in a place where wheat is also manufactured, and there is no sign of an official GF label.  I personally tried the dish and had a reaction. 4
I've never bought flavored syrups before but wanted to try them. These six flavors are each 25.4 ounces, are sweetened with Splenda and come in plastic bottles.  There is no pump on the bottles, although you can buy one.<br /><br />I think it's generous to call these "syrup" as they are the consistency of water.  But the flavors are bold, and if you're careful pouring they will last a long time.  We've experimented with the vanilla, hazelnut classic, caramel, chocolate and raspberry flavors so far.<br /><br />I've used the vanilla, hazelnut, caramel and chocolate in my morning coffee, and they add a nice flavor without overpowering the coffee.  I'm guessing I added about a tablespoon per cup of coffee.<br /><br />My kids liked the chocolate flavor mixed into hot cocoa.  We mixed some of the raspberry flavor into homemade yogurt, and that was pretty tasty too.  We haven't tried the Irish cream flavor yet, but I've used it in coffee before and I'm sure it will be the same.<br /><br />Overall, this is an expensive indulgence (for me) but one I'm glad I tried. 4
I love having a soup that is healthy and not full of bad ingredients.  I like the chicken noodle better, but the rice is pretty good too. 4
My cat seems to really like these.  As one reviewer said, they will dry out if the bag isn't sealed.  I haven't had any problems with sealing the bag that I purchased. 5
I use treats for obedience and agility classes.  I need a treat that is not crunchy, but chewy and capable of breaking up into small bits.  This product is easily broken up...too easily.  It reminds me of a thin layer of chocolate but does not melt as such. The selling point is the natural dehydration, rather than freeze dried.  I did not find it useful for my purpose. 3
This was the worst order I've ever experienced. The Trolli Gummy Bears sent were not from Trolli. They were some other brand, and they were disgusting! Truly awful. Do not order from Bayside Candy. They will sell you a false product. 1
Please dont be fooled into buying this item, as it cannot be returned!  The box is beatiful the clock is for show does not work, and the items in the box can be found at your local dollar store, and are not as described. Most would think that a description of Victorian Lace Tea, would in fact include Tea, which shows both in the picture and in description..it does not!  It also does not include a porceline picture frame described,and shown in picture but replaced by a plastic photo album. I buy everything from Amazon, and am shocked they would allow this to happen. 1
After reading reviews on this product I was really excited to get it and start taking it, I imagined all the milk I would start producing and how my baby would be guzzling it for months to come.  Unfortunately for me, the only thing that came true from the reviews I read was that I started to smell like maple syrup almost instantly. But I stuck with it, started taking 8 pills a day as opposed to 6 and after 2 weeks still no increase in my milk production. While I'm sure it works for some, if you're just not makig a whole lot of milk to start with, I don't think taking this will increase your supply much if at all. But if you think you'd like to smell like maple syrup then this is the product for you! 1
I love the 34 degree cracked peppercorn, wheat, and other varieties so I thought I would try the caramel, cinnamon, and graham as an alternative to cookies or regular graham crackers. True - you can have a lot of these crackers for little calories/carbs, but the flavor is bland. In terms of satisfaction, they don't quite cut it for me as a snack unless I put peanut butter or something on them. They would probably be good as part of a fruit and cheese dessert platter, along with some peanut butter, fruit spread, honey, or cream cheese. 4
The Torani chocolate & raspberry sugar-free syrups were to die for!  :)  The caramel was pretty bad, I thought.  The others were good but I wouldn't order them again.  I think this is personal preference stuff. 3
I like spice cookies.<br />But these were cloyingly sweet.<br />I threw them away. 2
I have trouble finding falafil mix in my local stores, so I was very happy to see this available on Amazon.  Casbah mix (my favorite) is quicker to prepare -- absorbs water for 10 minutes rather than 30 for Ziyad, but Ziyad seems to make more falafil per package.  It tastes great deep fried, and pretty good baked.  Just spray the baking pan with non-stick spray, then spray the patties and bake at 375 til done.  Much lower in calories and fat, terrific with sesame Tahini and hummus.  The package also contains recipes for low-carb breaded chicken and vegetarian chili using the mix. 4
We use many K cups.This fits in well with the different blends we buy.We ould recommend this K cup for people to try. 4
These used to be my dogs favorite treat till they changed them . They used to have a meaty texture now like most dog treats have a rubbery texture. Id pay more for the old style but wont buy these any longer. 2
These coffee pods ae from Fair Trade farms that are committed to sustainability.  The box is attractive and each of the pods is sealed in its own little packet.  I used them in a Senseo pod coffee maker as well as in the generic Mr. Coffee.  The coffee brewed up nicely and was a pretty dark color.  Unfortunately, the coffee itself was insipid.  It had weak flavor for a medium roast despite the deceptive darkness.  It was not the worst coffe I've ever had kbut not the best.  In fact it was not memorable at all, on a par with the complimentary packets you get in hotel rooms.  There is alot to like about this company but this brew left me cold. 3
This used to be a great food, but they've changed the formula and my dogs have suffered.  Their customer service is very rude.  My dogs showed signs of distress within the first 24 hours of eating the new formula.  Explosive Diaherra, Vomiting, Fur became dull.  Change it back Canidae!!! 1
Customer beware of VitaPlus, Canyon Creek, & waggin Train products, because of many reports in U.S., Canada, & Australia, that dogs are getting sick from these products made in China.  This is especially so in smaller breeds.  Do your research on these products and then make informed decision on whether you really want to fed your pet these foods.  I threw out all these products, and now I buy only made in the USA.  You have to really look at packaging, as Canyon Creek says No. Carolina on back right side and then on left back side it says made in China. 1
Everyone at my house, even my mother-in-law, enjoyed this drink.  It tastes very much like a quality soda, but is made with 100% real juice.  Small cans mean you don't consume a lot of calories at once, because although this is healthier than regular soda, you shouldn't drink too much -- it's still a lot of sugar. 4
My husband wanted to try this energy product. He consumed it right before a race and made the comment of not giving him the energy he was expecting for endurance. Now, the taste was really good. 3
I was surprised how many haters there are for the Lite version. Disclaimer: I've never tried the full fat version and I'm sure it's delicious, but if you're watching your fat intake, there has to be some compromise.  I saw this at the grocery store next to the regular Baconnaise.<br />Lite version: 2.5 grams fat per 2 Tbl.<br />Original version: 9 grams fat per 2 Tbl.<br /><br />I'm used to eating lite variations (though not fat free, yuck) of sour cream, mayo, salad dressing, etc.  So this wasn't a big leap for me. First sandwich, I was not impressed. Second sandwich, meh. By the third sandwich I was hooked. When by bottle ran out I had a hard time going back to plain mayo. I've been eating it so much that I don't even want to try the fattier version b/c then I'll be eating even more, yikes!<br /><br />It may not be a good taste for everyone, and I can understand that. But it's yummy to me :-) 4
I thought this package would have 2 types of rings (smooth and rough), but most only had the rough type. Other than that sameness, my dog likes the product. 3
Hypoallergenic formula was necessary for our daughter's acid reflux.<br /><br />We found out from a friend that most insurance companies will completely cover the cost of hypoallergenic formula, either by reimbursing you what you've spent on it, or if you get it as a prescription through your pediatrician. Ours did!<br /><br />Many doctors don't know this, so they don't know to give a prescription for the formula. Call your insurance company today! 5
This price is a little high.  You can generally buy it in a grocery store for around $1.25 a bottle.<br /><br />For some reason the seller claims they don't like the flavor.  It tastes like ORange Hi-C which I think is good.  Kind of like less sugary Kool Aid.  I love the taste.  Plus, there are 2.5 servings in  each bottle - so each bottle is 125 calories.<br /><br />The product is good.  I think Revive flavor is the best. 3
As far as taste goes, this is the best coconut water I've tasted. I have not tried all the other brands, so I am only comparing this to coconut water ordered at restaurants (which I think is usually sweetened, so it really isn't a fair comparison), Vitacoco, and Amy and Brian's. Vitacoco uses Brazilian coconuts while Taste Nirvana and Amy and Brian's use Thai coconuts. It seems like Taste Nirvana and Amy and Brian's are naturally sweeter than Vitacoco, with Taste Nirvana being the sweetest. This is a good sweet though, since all of these three brands have no sugars added. While I've liked all the coconut water I've tasted, Vitacoco can have a slightly more salty and less sweet taste, while Taste Nirvana has an amazing taste with just the right amount of sweetness. I liked the pulp as well, although some of the pieces seem to be from more mature coconuts rather than the young almost gelatin pulps I'm used to at some restaurants.<br /><br />The only reason I took a star off is due to the price. These 9.5 oz bottles are not the most economical way to buy Taste Nirvana. In fact, at the current price this costs as much as I paid at the coffee shop for individual bottles. For the best bargain on this brand, buy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OW342G">Taste Nirvana Real Coconut Water With Pulp, 16.2-Ounce (Pack of 12)</a>.<br /><br />I wanted to try this brand because a lot of people say Taste Nirvana or Amy and Brian's taste the best, and I'd have to give my vote to Taste Nirvana. Hopefully some day I will taste a fresh coconut and maybe that will get my vote, but if you're like me and don't have any coconut trees nearby, try this out. Enjoy! 4
I use this syrup in tea, coffee and over cut up fruit and ice cream.I buy unflavored creamer and add this to it. Much cheaper alternative to pre-flavored coffee creamer. 5
We are definately coffee addicts and have tried tons of different coffees out there on the internet over the years. We go through a pound of coffee every 5 days. We have ordered from almost every specialty coffee place out there and alot of them were great ones but was always still looking for that certain taste and this one has it!! I am so happy we decided to try this coffee. We are now monthly subscribers. This is also the first review I have ever posted and I have bought quite a bit from Amazon. This coffee is GREAT! 5
It isn't sweet. You are getting 3.5 cups of nonsweet "sweetener?"<br />You are getting 1.5 pounds of nothing. Three heaping teaspoons in a 8 oz. cup of coffee did nothing. I'm throwing it out. Agave isn't calorie free but it is sweet, and non-glycemic, and not artificial and so much cheeper. 1
Product was received on schedule and in good condition. I'm not into the gourmet scene but I am fairly fussy about coffee. For me, this is a very palatable blend, especially after I add half and half. I pretty much alternate days between this blend and a Newman's Own Decaf blend. 4
Once or twice a year for a little variety and that's about enough for my cat of this particular variety.  He likes it for a change from his chicken, turkey and beef, but not very often.  He will eat about 3/4 of the can and then he's had enough. He's not a huge fish fan anyway, but this stuff looks to be about the best out there in the fish varieties.  The chunks are bit sized so if your cat has a small mouth like mine does, it will be easier to chew.  Don't know why my cat doesn't like this type of fish, but he really could care less about it. 3
I ordered these, even though the price was high to see if Necco was still as good, and it's delicious. Beware, however, if you want nice whole wafers...about 1/2 the rolls in the bag contained all/part broken pieces. 4
I'm no "pho" expert, but I've eaten a lot (I really mean a lot) of Vietnamese, Japanese, and Chinese noodles in my lifetime.  And I wasn't really expecting authentic Vietnamese Pho noodles with this item, but it wasn't even remotely close to resembling that or any other Asian noodles.  I guess it's a matter of individual taste and preference with these things.  It didn't taste bad, but it didn't taste good either.  Not a lot of flavor, and what little flavor it did have I wouldn't describe as Vietnamese (or even Asian for that matter).<br /><br />I've also read a few reviews describing the portions as big, but it definitely was not.  Nissin's Cup Noodles taste better, are more filling, and a whole lot cheaper (but probably more unhealthy too). 2
I picked up some of this tea at the grocery store last week. It has some grassy aftertaste that many green teas have but not as much as some brands. I was careful with water temp and how long I let it steep and it wasn't bitter. It tastes somewhat clean and fresh but I like the much less expensive Salada better and I don't have to be careful with it like I do with Stash teas. 3
My dog got horrible diarrhea from it.<br />We mixed it with her old food for about a week and after that gave her just the Canidea food.<br />Too bad, it seemed like a good brand though. 2
Betty Crocker has discontinued its Stickerz line, which we preferred for their bite size format and ease of use.  Although the product photograph suggests that these combo packs will contain Stickerz/Stackerz/Shapes, the six disappointing boxes we bought did not.  References to the discontinued lines have been removed from the packaging, which is now limited to the same Gushers, Fruit by the Foot and Fruit Roll-Ups to be found at any grocery store. 3
Got 58 beans in the 1/2 lbs package which is a great value. They are moist so they are super fresh. Great Find. 5
My three-year-old daughter has been drinking this brand of goat milk for the last 2 years because she is dairy intolerant.  This is a great product. Easy to carry (because it's a powder) and mix it when you need it.  And, this is an awesome price. $10.00 less than I usually pay for three cans. 5
I'm a big fan of Jack Link's beef jerky, especially their flavored jerky's. I hadn't seen this one in the stores so when it went on sale on Amazon I scooped it up. Generally the beef nuggets and tendercuts style jerky's are not my favorite, for some reason the beef gets very rubbery compared to the regular style cuts, but I knew this diving into the bag of jerky.<br /><br />At first the taste was like the beef had been dropped in a pile of debris on a smokehouse floor, smokey, meaty and ashy tasting. I thought maybe it was just the initial taste  and continued to chew. It only worsened as I continued and eventually I swallowed and was met with a disgusting taste left in my mouth.<br /><br />Now that I have all four bags remaining I'm not sure what to do with them. I may give them away as a gag gift for the holidays and literally watch people gag as they try to eat this. 1
I bought this from a brick and mortar baby supply chain, and I was so excited to use it! I peeled, I chopped, I steamed and pureed. I was so happy! Then I realized it took me all day to make one regular sized batch of baby food. Still, it was so easy to just throw it in and walk away, so I kept making my baby food, one tiny batch at a time. Then, the fourth time I tried to use it, it would not steam. The start, stop, and steam buttons do not work. I'd had the machine less than a month. Then I noticed (as I was dumping out my unused water) that there was a bunch of metallic looking crap floating around in the water chamber. Unfortunatly the box had been thrown away otherwise I would have just taken it back to the store. I emailed customer service and about a week later received an email that said "please provide us with a number to reach you". By looking at some more recent reviews I can see I'm not the only one having a problem with their customer service. The idea behind this product is amazing, the product itself is garbage. I don't understand for the life of me why they couldn't make the blender cup bigger than a coffee cup. Even if this product had worked beautifully I would have eventually gotten tired of making tiny batches. I've been using my food processor and steaming on the stove in a pot. It's more to clean up but I can make a large batch of baby food in much less time. I wanted to love this thing, I really did. It's just not worth the money. 2
Barbara's animal cookies used to taste good.  I think they have tried to make them more "healthy" which has resulted in a tasteless, boring cookie. 2
I am becoming one of Goya's biggest fans. I had seen these on the shelves,<br />and they were really inexpensive, but I opted for a test can of Vienna<br />sausages instead. They were so good I went back the next day to get this<br />tin of sardines.<br /><br />They have a great sardine flavor, not fishy or oily at all, and the tomato<br />sauce is thick and rich. I am of the opinion that sardines make everything<br />taste better, and these go great just on a regular saltine. Great for snacks<br />or a pack lunch or road trips. I'll probably edit this review sometime in<br />the next month to give this product 5 stars cause I see addiction ahead. LOL 4
I'll give you three different thoughts on this coffee:<br /><br />1. As a coffee: it's not the world's best cup of coffee. If you're not dealing with the acid issues, you won't find this worth getting for the flavor. The package I had was not bad. It was ok. When I brew coffee, though, I'm looking for a little better than ok.<br /><br />2. As a value: I'm not sure this is good in terms of value. First of all, I typically make coffee in a 4-cup mini brewer, so I only need about half the package size here. Second, most of the time the extra packaging for single-serve raises the cost a little bit. So, it's not a real good value.<br /><br />3. As coffee for someone with heartburn: Here's the kicker: Puroast doesn't claim it's the best coffee in the world. It claims to be a coffee that is processed in a way to reduce acid effects from drinking it. To my senses, it does just that. (They claim to have published research that supports it, so trace their links for science.) Usually I don't drink coffee in the evenings because the acid feel just churns through the night. Not so with the Puroast. It performed for me just as advertised.<br /><br />So: the flavor's not exceptional, but that's what sugar, flavored creamers, or other add-ins can help address. The value's not great, but it is cheaper than a trip to Starbucks. And if you can't have the full-acid of a normal coffee, this one is worth a try. 3
I purchsed this door about a year ago.  I dont know how I lived without it.<br />Since the purchase neither My 8yr old German Sheppard or 5 yr old Husky have<br />made one "mistake" inside. It took less than a minute to train them to use it . The<br />door is transparent yet is tinted to add privacy.<br /><br />I had this professionaly installed / hardwired so I didnt have to fuss with battery charging<br />every month, but do have the battery backup as well.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this 4 Stars , not five is because I have run into just one issue the transmitter<br />collar is prone to snap apart when the dog scratches neck area xtra hard and the foot hits the transmitter<br />cover causing both the cover & battery to fall off. Between the two dogs it has happened only 3x total / in the past year<br /><br />Other than that I have not had one problem.  It is about as attractive as it could be for a dog door.<br />It gives me the freedom as well not having to  rush home knowing my dogs are doing the potty dance.<br /><br />see my 3 customer pictures attatched to item. 4
I purchased this tea for someone who enjoys Trader Joe's white pomegranate tea, and unfortunately it was not a good substitute. Though I haven't tried it myself I was told it had a strong floral taste and aroma which to that particular tea drinker was undesirable.  I am rating 4 stars since this is such a subjective judgement, and I have no doubts about this being a high quality product. 4
These are very tasty and they will crunch without risking damage to any dental work or your teeth in general. A great way to limit sugar intake. I reordered because I liked them so much. 5
I bought this on a crazy deal i think for like $8.00 and it was horrible.  I ended up throwing it away! 1
The honey is a mid amber color. It was good but not the best honey I've had. Sweet and thick. Be warned, you will probably NOT receive the Comvita honey pictured.  Instead I received a generic New Zealand Raw honey. 3
We fed Canidae to our two dogs for almost 5 years--they always ate it eagerly, never had stomach upset, and got raves from the vet for their muscle, weight, and coats.  It *was* a 5-star food.  But last summer we opened a fresh bag of kibble (same exact packaging bought from our usual store) and immediately noticed it was much lighter in color than previous bags, but we fed it anyway. Within a day our Aussie, who has a bulletproof stomach with absolutely no digestive issues, began to have horrible gas, softer stools, and really loud, liquidy gurgling noises in his abdomen.  We continued to feed the entire bag, thinking that he'd adjust to it eventually because our other dog was fine.  Well, our Aussie never did adjust to it; he spent a month having those symptoms, and we dreaded mealtimes because of the stench and sounds he'd create.<br /><br />The kibble in the next bag we bought was the old normal shade of brown, and our Aussie's stomach noises, soft stools, and awful gas went away practically overnight. But by then I was hearing and reading that Canidae had developed a new formula that was making dogs sick. The stories about people whose dogs got *far* sicker than ours, and the dodgy responses that those long-time customers got from Canidae when they called to complain about the unannounced change, made us decide it was time for a new dog food.  We went with Healthwise, a premium kibble made by the same company that makes Innova, California Natural, and Evo.  It's not worth it to continue to be loyal to Canidae and to risk our dogs perhaps getting as sick as many others have.  Read Canidae's new formula horror stories at consumeraffairs.com. 2
Don't get these if you value your teeth. The tartlet filling is very viscous. It will stick to your teeth and you could probably use it to glue pieces of plywood together. 2
These anchovies are first rinsed, then filleted and then melted in olive oil in most cases and used for flavoring dishes such as Pasta Putanesca sauce. If your plan is to just rinse them and fillet them and then down them with a piece of pugliese bread dripping in extra virgin olive oil and a glass of chianti then these will work for you also. Putting them on pizza is not what they are intended for. The variety of their uses is vast if you have any knowledge of Meditteranean cuisine, if not get yourself a good cookbook and learn, the flavors they impart are without comparison, not to mention the aromas they send out floating around the neighborhood. 5
This was a waste of money, the item was late, package was torn up,and the tea was terrible, not a good product in my opinion and bad handling. 1
****<br /><br />This tea is good---it is a meld of green and white teas: White tea, Japanese green tea, Chinese green tea, Assam green tea, Darjeeling green tea, and organic green tea from Sri Lanka. It has a mild and interesting taste, and doesn't appear to be as strong in its caffeine effects as some other green or white teas.<br /><br />I went to Stash's website to find out more about Fusion Green and White and it says that white tea is a very rare and healthful tea, even more so than green tea, containing powerful antioxidants; it is thought that white tea may have the strongest anti-carcinogenic effects of all teas.  White tea is not oxidized, but withered and dried by steaming. It is not clear exactly how much white tea is present in this tea compared to all of the greens---I'm thinking there might be far more green than white. Still, it is a fine tea nonetheless.<br /><br />For a basic green tea, with some extra-healthful white tea added, it is a not-overly-exciting but certainly tasty tea. I would especially recommend it for people new to tea drinking who want to branch out from orange pekoe to something different, and are looking for a gentle introduction to the wide world of teas.<br /><br />Note that this review is for the bulk packaging of six tea boxes, for an incredible Amazon price break!<br /><br />**** 4
I was looking for a taste like the Stash tea Moroccan mint, but with organic ingredients.  This tea is not it.  It just tastes like mint to me- nothing special.  I'm glad it's organic, but I was hoping for a better taste than this. 3
Just tried the Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers Chicken Teriyaki for lunch today. It's easy to prepare. The rice was fine. However, the "sauce", a brown mixture of mushy, small cubes of chicken, and small tidbits of pineapple, was bland, soft, unappealing and fairly flavorless. I wouldn't buy it again. It wasn't bad; it just wasn't tasty, either. At least it's only about 400 calories. 2
Love the Feridies peanuts and pistachios, however, this snack mix is a major disappointment.  Stale tasting, uninteresting and visually unappealing.  Too bad the remaining three cans cannot be returned! 1
None of these instant bowls comes anywhere close to fresh local food, but this one is not bad at all.  Though a bit more fuss to prepare than some, it's worth it, as this bowl definitely tastes better than most I've tried.  Also, the whole bowl is enough to satisfy a man for lunch or a quick dinner. However, high in caloroies and sodium, so I would not eat them too often.  (The package says that a "bowl" is two servings, very misleading, but what can you do? So remember to double those nutritional numbers!)<br /><br />You get enough peanuts to matter and they tasted good.  The sauce was good.  The "cook and rinse with hot water" method they use means the noddles aren't too oily like some I've tried.  And the bits of vegetable, while sparse, help some.<br /><br />Easy to make, noodles are very good, tastes is good, price is fair.  Thumbs up!<br /><br />Update 2012-02-17: These have gone up in price since my review. 4
I have a Wasabi Pea addiction. Its not pretty, but its true.<br /><br />Having tried all kinds of Wasabi Peas, here's my review of these in context:<br /><br />- Hot 7/10<br />- Salty 7/10<br />- Wasabi Flavor 7/10<br />- Crunch<br /><br />Other than my annoyance that these peas have food coloring in them to make them look more Green, and the fact that they do not score the highest on the Flavor scale (meaning "how much does it taste like actual Wasabi...is the flavor well-rounded, etc), they are<br /><br />"PRETTY DARN GOOD." (7/10)<br /><br />The 5Lb bag probably would have been large enough to have let some of them go stale if you didn't divide it up into smaller bags...but I ate them in 1 month, and the flavor did not suffer in that time.<br /><br />Enjoy! 4
okay so this one I did not care for. I HATE packaged banana flavor so this is actually still sitting around with an experation date of Oct 29th.... seems like it can sit for a good while. Not sure how I like that but I'm just weird about food like that. 3
this little plant survived being put though the mail and it survived the trip it took a little work to get this one on its feet, but it made it and is growing I like it and will look forward to seeing it grow thanks Interesing little plant I named this one amazon 2
Anything applesauce-based you can usually get a great deal in the store and combine fruit flavors yourself.  But pears and mangos take just enough extra work that I appreciated the ease of getting this one through Amazon.<br /><br />My twin 10-month olds turned out to be quite cooperative when it came time to eat this flavor brand!  Now I get it by subscription and they'd eat it instead of vegetables if they had a choice.  It is a consistency similar to applesauce, so you have to serve it in a similar way (it's runny).

I have to say the new offerings are great. the french roast and the Italian roast have a nice strong coffee flavor. I would say remember your first cup out of a keurig, the reason you bought a machine, these two flavors remind me of that.<br />Those first few lines are from my review for the Italian roast, they are both excellent. 5
kids love the sauce on many things... great on rice, chicken, spicy & sweet.<br /><br />highly recommend. 5
I love, love, love dark roasted coffee and don't like a acid taste so I thought this would be great,<br /><br />I was pleased with the 'no acid taste," but...I had to use twice as much to get the same flavor I usually like. That wouldn't be a big deal- but it meant I went through the coffee faster than I should have and that can get expensive.<br /><br />This blend was ground very finely so would not be good with a french press. I was able to use it with a pour over. 3
We use the K-caps so that we can re-use our K-cups by refilling them with the coffee we like.  We have lost or given away several of the caps over the 2 years that we've been using them; so I thought I would buy some more K-caps.  It turns out, the prices for them have increased substantially; so I went in search of another alternative that would be less expensive.  I found these and thought I had found the answer; but they don't quite work as well as the original K-cups.  They actually caused the Keurig to spew water in directions other than the intended direction and then allowed enough coffee grounds to escape that the holder for the cups became clogged and had to be disassembled and thoroughly cleaned before it could be used again.  Good idea - but not quite right. 3
I love Newman's products, but my dog hated it.  We purchased a case hoping to feed our dog something that doesn't contain all of the artificial chemicals, but he wanted nothing to do with it!  If you like organic, support Newman's products.  Hopefully your dog will like it better. 1
The flavor is alright. It has a slight, slight taste of Root Beer and ice cream, but that only lasts a few seconds. As I chew the gum longer, it starts to taste like Pepto Bismol the most. It's not the worst gum I've chewed on, but it's not the best either. 3
These tarts were a major disappointment.  Far more pastry than filling and the pastry is tough. Don't waste your money!! 1
I really  like this dental treat and my dogs love them.  They are wheat free which is great for my German short=hair pointer who is wheat intolerant.  Only problem is it is hard to find this product in my local pet stores and on line.  I even contacted the manufacturer, who was not very helpful in locating it and just referred me back to my local pet store who hasn't had this in stock for EVER.  I have since given up on finding it. 5
I don't know how this seller got these, in Italy every box and every single sealed package inside the box has a clearly printed expiration date and these don't. The Plasmon biscuits are the best you can find in the world but not from this seller!! I thought selling babyfood with no expiration date was inlegal and honestly these taste as already expired. Amazon should take action! Stay away 1
When I came across this photo, I was highly disappointed. The set of 9 seasonings should be just $9.00, not $31.56. I've gone to the 99 cent store plenty of times and have seen these spices in their store for a dollar each. Total RIP OFF! 1
If you like your popcorn with a bit of salt as I do, avoid this product. Trust me. It is full of odd ingredents,and completely devoid of flavor. I picked it up at the store two weeks ago, because it was the only item available (*real* popcorn salt has, for some reason, completely disappeared from the shelves).<br /><br />(Amazon - please - allow us to give a ZERO star review.) 1
My daughter and I loved these when they first came out but had been unable to find them locally.  Then I thought, if anyone would have them, Amazon would!<br /><br />So glad to find them - it made a nice addition to her Christmas stocking. 5
World Kitchens Brown Sugar Beef Jerky, 12-Ounce Bag I got three bags of this and it was real good jerky. 4
I ordered 100 DisposaKups.  They came fast and were just what was advertised.  I will definitely be re-ordering.  Thanks alot!! 5
I bought the Kuerig because I love the Dunkin Original and Green Mountain Nantucket Blend.  Rodeo Drive has now become my favorite.  It is very delicious and smooth. 5
I was disappointed with the taste of these chips (regular and barbecue). I can't really taste the potato, so it is almost like eating a badly-flavored foam chip. It tastes like it is stale even though it is fresh, and it also has an odd chemical-like taste. The similar baked lays and pringles chips are very tasty. My kids finally ate the rest of these chips, but only after all of the other chips were gone. 1
Honey Dijon flavor: okay flavor, but both my girlfriend and I thought they left a bad aftertaste. The aftertaste is sort of like old cheese (presumably some folks like this... I'm not a fancy cheese eater), and it lingers for at least an hour. I'd give this flavor a rating of 2 stars out of 5.<br /><br />We have also tried the NY Cheddar flavor (4 stars), which we both liked better, and they didn't leave any long-lingering or bad aftertaste.<br /><br />I'd give the consistency of the chips 4 stars. The chips are crunchy, but also greasy enough that I keep a napkin near or wash my hands after eating Kettle Chips. 3
I bought this same brand at a local health food store.  For 1 oz. it cost $7.99.  So, when I bought this, at 4 oz. it made economic sense. 4
We have a little Pekinese/Shitzu mix, mixed with something else too but we're not sure what. My dog is a bit of a finicky eater there are dog biscuits that's she's refused to eat and dog food that she's raised her nose at. But she really likes these treats, she had a couple then sat by her snack drawer until she got another one. Yes, we spoil her but good healthy treats like these are much better then most of those name products that you get in a grocery store.<br />Two woofs! 4
Love the combo packs for a fraction of the price as compared to a convenience store. These are delicious, portable, and even the pickiest eaters in the family love them. Great protein energy boost any time of day. Just be sure to keep these somewhere cool or the cheese melts. 4
The white and brown rice is much better.  This rice is nothing like I expected... cannot eat without masking the flavor. 2
I've been drinking Green Mountain's Dark Magic and really enjoyed it, however I wanted a change.  After some searching I discovered this coffee and am glad I did.  It's got an excellent deep flavor that I really enjoy.  Strong enough - yet not overpowering.  I recommend you give it a try. 5
Good but not my favorite.........Newman's Own Organics Adult Dog Food Formula, 7-Pound Bag....I now buy my dogs Taste of the Wild Salmon just great stuff buy it on Amazon!~ The less fillers the better not meals for my doggies!~ 2
I thought I was doing the right thing by buying organic and thought Similac was a brand I could trust to be good for baby. That is, until I came across this NY Times article about the sugar they use... [...] Needless to say I'm switching to another brand.<br /><br />From the article:<br /><br />Parents may be buying [Similac Organic] because they believe that organic is healthier, but babies may have a reason of their own for preferring Similac Organic: it is significantly sweeter than other formulas. It is the only major brand of organic formula that is sweetened with cane sugar, or sucrose, which is much sweeter than sugars used in other formulas.<br /><br />No health problems in babies have been associated with Similac Organic. But to pediatricians, there are risks in giving babies cane sugar: Sucrose can harm tooth enamel faster than other sugars; once babies get used to its sweeter taste, they might resist less sweet formulas or solid foods; and some studies suggest that they might overeat, leading to rapid weight gain in the first year, which is often a statistical predictor of childhood obesity. 2
Honestly, I have to admit that I expected a little better. That's not to say that this is bad coffee - in fact it's quite bold without being too acidic, and pretty satisfying overall. I think my main problem is that Wolfgang Puck's name is attached to it, so perhaps it set my expectations a little high. I have a Wolfgang Puck knife set that I adore, and is very high quality for what I paid for it. This coffee was on sale, so it was well worth it also, I just hoped for something that would knock my socks off - which it didn't. I also purchased the Breakfast blend, and Jamaica me crazy at the same time. The breakfast blend was the best, in my opinion, and the jamaican coffee smelled the best, but was the least successful. 4
The coffee is good. However, at least half of these haven't been sealed correctly. When I brew them the edge of the foil pops open and coffee grounds go everywhere. Not fun to clean. It may have just been the batch we got, but I won't be ordering these again. 2
only $13.29 a case on the petco site (Oct 20, 2011) - not worth the .70 cents a can they're charging here. 1
When I ordered this product I was under the impression that there were 5 one gram boxes....In fact, it was stated as so in the first review.<br />When the product came, it was on big plastic clear box with all 5 grams.<br />Let's hope the saffron is good. 3
This is a tasty treat--with a thin layer of sugary jelly in the middle.  No oozing jelly or anything as I have initially thought.  For 16 pcs, I think this item is too expensive and would not buy again. 4
At first, I thought that this product deserves 4 or 5 stars.  What changed my mind?  ADVANTAGES:  (1)Most of the crabmeat in the can is adequate-quality white crabmeat but the top layer of the can is extremely high quality red-colored whole legs of small crabs.  Overall, the quality of the crabmeat in this product is higher than any other non-lump crabmeat product.  Only the very expensive cans of "lump" crabmeat have higher quality contents than this Chicken of the Sea product.  (2)This product can be conveniently opened with a can opener.  No need to worry about splatter.  DISADVANTAGES:  (1)The quantity of crabmeat is just mediocre.  After draining away the water by squeezing the opened can, the crabmeat is only at about 60% of the altitude of the can in this Chicken of the Sea product.  That's better than Roland Consul brand Crab Meat, which goes below 50%, but not as good as other brands of canned crabmeat which can end up at about 70% to 80% of the altitude of the can.  (2)The other disadvantage is that Chicken of the Sea makes the mistake of putting a piece of transparent paper at the bottom of the can which clings to the crabmeat.  Each time I open a can of this product, I first enjoy eating the high quality crabmeat but then I eventually end up suffering the inconvenience of licking the crabmeat off of the paper.  My fingers will end up having lots of crabmeat clinging to it and the bottom of the can will end up with some residual crabmeat which needs to be scraped with a fork or spoon. 3
What a great snack!  I love these crispy, crunchy, treats.  Packaged in a single serve bag, I buy these by the pack of 24 assorted flavors so I have them on hand whenever I feel the urge to snack.<br />Unfortunately my family has discovered how good they are so they are now going faster than I had anticipated.  Time to order some more!  All the different flavors are seasoned just right--not too salty or spicy.  I love Popchips! 5
A friend of mine raved about this tea and I love Bigelow Earl Grey Tea, so I decided to try it. Now I have six boxes of a tea I don't like as much as Bigelow.  It is too candy-like for my taste; I like a bit more tea flavor. So I would definitely recommend trying it before you buy 6 boxes. 4
Product came in a timely manner. However, the product itself was less than fresh. When Rocky Road candy is at it's freshest it will literally melt in your mouth. These were a little chewier.  Kind of disappointing 3
When I bought this food, I saw the image and price and assumed that I would be paying a fair price ($1 less per bag than the grocery store) for low grade cat food. The image and price combination led me to think that I would be paying $45 for 6 18lb+ bags - a good deal. When I received six 3.6lb bags, I thought there had been a mistake. Nope. So, I spend $40+ returning it (I bought three 6 packs - oops) and now Ozbo customer service tells me they take 2-3 weeks processing returns! My kitties need food now, and these people want to sit on my $180 for that long? DO NOT BUY FROM THESE SCAMMERS !!! 1
Wow, this tastes great, sweet and chocolaty! Like a liquid chocolate bar.<br /><br />Plus it is organic!<br /><br />It does contain high-glycemic cane juice, so I don't drink too much. The original and vanilla flavors are sweetened with low-glycemic rice syrup. They have less sugar. All are organic.<br /><br />I don't know why the ingredients here say canola oil. Neither the Good Karma website nor the label on the box has that ingredient. If I verified that this site is correct, and the Good Karma corporate website and the label on the carton are wrong, I would stop using the product. Perhaps this page has outdated ingredient information.<br /><br />This is the richest most milk-like rice beverage and the label on it does not mention canola oil, which contains up to 2% toxic erucic acid and is found in many rice beverages that are fed to children! Canola oil cannot be used by US FDA regulation in infant food. (One research paper found higher levels of erucic acid in red blood cells of autistic children compared to non-autistic children, and there are many other well established toxic effects of erucic acid in humans and animals. Look in the medical journals.)<br /><br />This product is sold in my neighborhood Ralph's (best price), VC discount, and Whole Foods in Los Angeles.<br /><br />The 365 brand (Whole Foods own brand) is also canola-free. It is much cheaper but watery in comparison. I use it for cooking. Only plain and vanilla flavors, though.<br /><br />West Soy Rice beverage is also canola free. It has a more neutral taste and less body. They have a chocolate flavor.<br /><br />Many people find rice milk better tasting than other milk substitutes. I find it to be much easier to digest than soy and nut products. Soy milk, however, has much more protein. Aside from being hard to digest, I don't eat too much soy because of the anti-nutritional components; so I get my protein elsewhere. 4
Somehow failed to blow up the packaging and discover that despite the attractive description of this coffee that it is MILD. Very clear on the front of the box which is only seen if you blow up the picture of the product. 2
My Pug is so picky, she doesn't like the little ones, but loves the bigger ones.  I don't know what the difference in them is, but she does.  So I would not recommend these if your dog is picky, go ahead and get the bigger ones and break them up. 3
This seems like a cross between a regular soda and an energy drink.  Some of energy drinks do taste awful.  The "No Fear" drink taste a lot better but still have the taste of the Taurine type of drinks.  You cannot really compare this with Red Bull or 5-Hour as it is more like in the same league as "Monster".<br /><br />I don't find a lot of difference with other products.  Because of the volume, this caters to those who want to also quench their thirst and not only for the energy boost.  In terms of energy boost, I find a bottle of Gatorade just as good. 3
I have been waiting for Amazon to carry this item. My son LOVES them, and Costco was carrying them in bulk. Now they are not, but they can be purchased at Target for $2.97 a box!! This vendor is ripping people off!!! I love the convenience of shopping with Amazon, but I refuse to pay this ridiculous price!! 1
I did not like the flavor at all.  A bad aftertaste.  Love the other flavors but this is not a favorite 2
When I opened this alot of the tea sacks were broken and the tea emptied out and spilled everywhere. I steeped some inside my cup and noticed that all sorts of the tea leaves had come out (I even took a picture and posted it under customer pics) and when I sipped my drink, tea leave crumbs got inside my mouth! I havent noticed any effect from the tea though but I have only used it for a few days so maybe it takes awhile. However, if they'd be able to keep the sacks closed that would help alot! 2
I read about these on [...] and decided to try them.  I bought the variety pack so as not to get stuck with one flavor if I didn't like them.  I really tried to like these because of the health benefits but I ended up throwing out the whole case after tasting one of each flavor.  If you are looking for these as a substitute for potato chips, forget it.  They really do taste like dissolving cardboard.  Stick with baked Lays! 1
It appears Amazon may have gotten a bad batch, or they are very old.  I was excited to find these as my Husky-Shepard has allergies to Beef & Chicken and these did not contain either.  They are expensive, but I decided to try them.  When I opened them they have all sorts of holes (looks like air holes) in them and the dog (66#) had a hard time chewing through them.  I think she liked the flavor, but biscuits shouldn't be so difficult to eat. I saw several other people with the same comments, so I believe either Amazon or the manufacturer needs to figure out what is happening with these.  Had they been $1.00 a bag I would figure I got what I paid for. 2
I'm a novice rice-roll maker, but I was completely unable to make this rice come out correctly.  I tried a rice maker, on the stove top, tried less water, tried more water, tried less heat, more heat, longer simmering--all a cup of rice at a time.  I'm almost done with the bag and won't buy it again.<br /><br />My rice doesn't soak up enough water.  It's hard in the middle and slimy on the outside.  I bought similar rice at the local grocery store and have had perfect results with it almost every time.<br /><br />Looking at the other reviews makes me think it's something I'm doing wrong, but I have tried every combo of preparing that I can think of. 1
I purchased this hoping that it would taste like Seattle's Best Henry's Blend.  I was very disappointed.  At the time, it was not offered in whole bean form.  After looking all over for Henry's Blend, I finally settled on Ruta Maya -- which requires grinding but is so much better and less expensive than "Level 4." 1
We have purchased these treats several times for our aging Bichon and been well pleased.  She loves them; however, this last batch is tough and really dried out. 3
I have been drinking fine tea for a few years now. I have a couple of favorite Assams that I have enjoyed for some time. Both are graded TGFOP and both are superb: filled with body, complex flavor, malty. But over the years I have become concerned about pesticides used in foods. I have chosen to use as many organic food products as I reasonably can. I recently tried this Stash Premium Organic Assam Tea.<br /><br />This is a very good tea. The pouch is filled with quality loose leaf product. My uneducated guess would be an approximate grade of FOP or perhaps TGFOP.<br /><br />The taste is basic, unadorned Assam. Malty and full of body. It is not as complex as teas from the finest plantations. By complex, think of colors. This tea flavor has maybe one or two colors, where a complex tea from a fine plantation might have 3, 4, or more flavors you can distinctly identify.<br /><br />Still, at a fair price and with an organic grade, this will be a regular choice at my house in the future.<br /><br />I would prefer to see an organic tea packaged in a non-plastic pouch though. 4
This iced tea is terrible. This is the first Stash product that I do not enjoy. It is not iced tea. It tastes more like powdered peppermint leaves. 1
I spent along time and a lot of money looking for a great Earl Grey... to this point its been loose leaf tea i order from another site until my girl friend went to London with her family bring me back a small sample pack of 10 tea bags. i loved it so much i had gotten this 6 pack of 20 count boxes which i have polished off and reordered since then.<br /><br />The tea stays fresh in the foil package each tea bag  which makes it so air and light cant damage the flavor of the tea which is the problem is loose leaf tea's.<br /><br />The flavor of the tea is a nice Bergamot flavor which is smooth no matter how long you leave the tea in. i perfer mine strong and straight up. each sit is as good as the first. i will keep buying this tea and also try other ones by ahmad of London 5
This is IMHO the best instant oatmeal ever. The problem is only one grocery in my area carries this brand and they are erratic in stocking the flavors I like (Apples 'n Cinnamon and Baked Apple). Consequently, I have to order it on line. The only draw back to online ordering is price; it cost me more than 100% more to order on line than to purchase in the store ($0.99 in store vs $2.15 per serving on line). And to make matters worse, Amazon doesn't stock it all the time. Right now I have to sign up to be notified when it will be available again. So, I end up having to go to other suppliers on line to find this product.<br /><br />However, this is still the best instant oatmeal in the world and I will pursue it to the ends of the earth!!!! 4
i'm giving this a solid 5, because my old but healthy cat loves this stuff and it's wicked good for him, but i'll tell you right now that this stuff looks and smells quite gross; as long as i don't have to eat it, it's all good. 5
I bought these to put in my office.  They were exactly what I expected- a retail box of tootsie pops!  My box included banana flavor lollipops, which I could have done without, but otherwise, it was the classic flavors that everyone knows and loves! 4
and has the right amount of protein to serve as an alternative meal or support to eat before or after a work-out. Taste is always an issue with protein bars but this one passes the test 4
They're alright. But not what I expected. I was hoping it would be more like the other brands of dried apples - crispy, but then melt in your mouth. I bought these for my toddler, but the pieces are big, hard, and do not melt in your mouth. I'm afraid they present a bit of a choking hazard for a one year old.<br /><br />On the bright side - they are NOT made in China! I suppose if you're into dried apples for yourself, they should work. 4
Terrible & expensive for what you get. Tiny little kernels, lots of hulls. Stick with the cheap store bought.<br />Bleh what a rip off. 1
It was a hit/miss, and I think I missed on this one.  Tastes a bit different than I had hoped. Not that there's anything wrong with it, just doesn't taste good to me. :( 3
This product is good. However, I feel the carbonation is a little more emphasised over the fruity flavor. Unless of course carbonation is really wanted. I didn't find the juice flavour as good as Juicy Juice. And the cost is ~50% more per ounce for Switch vs. Juicy Juice for my region.<br /><br />I would say that for everyone who is interested in this product... let your taste buds be your guide. 3
NOTE: This review is for the Chili and Lime Flavor Popchip.  Amazon had a separate page for it but then merged the product and its reviews into one.<br /><br />It's hard to objectively review food since everyone's palate and tastes are different.  So what I can say about this particular Popchip flavor that should be useful for most folks out there is that it doesn't really taste like Chili and Lime you're "probably" expecting.  The Chili and Lime most folks probably are expecting if they grew up on Frito Lay products is very sharp and sweet (and of course artificial) - but it's what we liked if we ate more than a bag.<br /><br />The best way I can describe this flavor is that it has a "tomato" like taste to it with a somewhat tangy sour note that is suppose to be the lime component.  Together they turn into an odd combination that registers other flavors in your mind than Chili and Lime - at least it did to me and others who tasted it with me.  If you eat the skin of a green bell pepper, you can kind of get at what Popchips were trying to do with the Chili taste on this version, but I have no idea how some sour salt can be akin to lime.  For myself personally, I thought it tasted like "Tomato and Basil" you would find on Pita chip flavors and baked snacks.<br /><br />Whether or not you agree with my above description of the flavor, I would highly suggest you try to get this in a sample pack and try it out first.  BBQ + Salt & Vinegar Popchips are still my staples for now. 3
This is one great product!  Never again do I have to force a pill or some other disgusting thing down my dogs throat to give her glucosamine.  Both my dogs love the Happy Hips, but chicken is their favorite!  This one is a winner! 5
Ordered through Amazon and supplier could not produce.  Amazon canceled order, supplier never contacted me. 1
Like a number of other reviewers, we use canned pumpkin as a dietary supplement for our dogs. As a result, we go through a lot of it. We usually use the Libby's brand which is readily available in our grocery store, but due to flooding of last year's crop it has been out of stock for a few months. Luckily the organic growers did not have the same problem. I find this product to be more finely pureed than the Libby's so it seems a bit runnier. However, my dogs love it. The only minor disadvantage is the cost. It is more expensive than the Libby's, plus I'm paying to have it shipped now vs. picking it up at the store.<br /><br />A number of other Amazon customers have complained about receiving badly dented cans. Mine arrived 100% intact. This may be a result of the unconventional courier used. It appeared to be some sort of private delivery service though I paid for the standard service. A man hand delivered the item to my house using what appeared to be his ordinary Chrysler Pacifica minivan. I've never seen an item delivered this way by Amazon or anybody before. 4
Kellogg's products are full of GMOs (Genetically Modified Organisms) which are linked to many health problems including infertility, cancer, auto-immune disease etc... Please research GMOs before deciding to purchase any products from Kellogg's. I would NEVER feed this to my family! 1
great coffees & I enjoyed the most when friends come over for coffee, it gives lot of fun to try out all the flovor 4
PROS: cute packaging (albeit somewhat annoying) and true ginger taste.<br />CONS: texture, high price tag, and uppity self-righteousness<br /><br />My brother and I tried them on a whimsy and both quickly came to the conclusion that we wouldn't buy them again.  Their ginger kick is fine and subtle but the texture seriously reminded me of chalky valentine candy hearts (you know, the ones that people can't seem to get rid of fast enough). The inside of the tin was also full of blatant feel-goodness. I hate that kind of talk on organic/all-natural products. If you have a good product that's also good for the environment, it should speak for itself.<br /><br />p.s. altoids are pretty gluten-free too and nut-free too (though they may be processed in a plant that also processes other products). 2
I purchased this product as a gift for my mom who simply loves this cocoa.  When the local supermarket where she purchased the cocoa stopped stocking it she figured that was the end of it.  Ha!  Little did she know that I would find a way to track it down on line.  And on Amazon!  She was surprised and pleased.  The price is good, as is the cocoa.  I would only be more happy if I could get an assortment. 5
This is a tasty drink with pale pink/purplishcolor. With its carbonation one could call it a drink with bite. For me the taste was good but not outstanding. The aromatic bouquet of Switch is fabulous, but the actual taste, unfortunately, doesn't measure up to that mesmerizing scent.<br /><br />The can's diminutive size lends itself to a quick refresher, not a slake for a heavy duty thirst. It's a good size for a pocket, lunch bag, or purse. 3
I've made butter chicken and keemah (lean grounded turkey) w/ peas and this paste is great. For the keemah dish, I use half packet just to give flavor. Aside adding a little chili and onions, you don't need anything else. 4
i like this soup, it is a little salty for me, but still makes a quick meal when i don't feel like cooking. 3
Loved the distinct flavor of Stash Organic Chai Black and Green Tea and, when I could not find it, finally purchased the Earl Grey Black and Green.  Found it okay, but nothing unusual or extremely tasty.  Will not repurchase and will continue to locally watch for the Organic Chai Black and Green Tea. 3
I've been buying antlers from Chasing Our Tails for a while now and never had a problem with the size -- that is, until now. I purchased a 5-7 inch antler and the one I received was like 4 inches. And darker than the other ones. My puggle chewed it down in two days. I'm disappointed of the size and quality of the one I just received. I'm going to buy another one -- 7-10 inch -- and if the quality is the same and small I will not buy from Chasing Our Tails Again. They're expensive. 1
I read a great review of the product in The Whole Dog Journal but when I received the product it didn't look anything like the quality one shown in the magazine.  What I received actually looked like the kind of rolls shown that you would not buy.(One that has a nice outer layer but is scrunchd in the center)  A good quality U.S. raised cattle roll is made from a single sheet of fresh, thick, natural rawhide which is what I thought I was getting.  I do commend the seller for the quick service! 2
Satin Ice is more plyable and better tasting (for fondant0 than the Wilton boxed fondant at Michael's and WalMart. If you need colors, they are vibrant and strong--their blank and read are the best.<br />While I have used Satin Ice many times, I will say that whatever fondant is used and marketed as the "Duff" brand (from Ace of Cakes) is a MUCH better product than even Satin Ice. You can re-rool and stretch it to fit like nothing I have ever seen. It really is the easiest fondant I have ever worked with--worth waiting for the 40% off coupons from the large chain craft store and buying the Duff brand.<br />You can find Satin Ice elsewhere on the Internet cheaper than here, but at least you know Amazon is pretty dependable. 3
These were tasty noodles, but easy to overcook. Followed package directions exactly, but ended up with a mass of overly soft rice noodles. Managed to make them work when I mixed them into the sauce, but would recommend undercooking them prior to use to maintain the integrity of the noodle.<br /><br />Also, they were a thinner cut than I was expecting - I was hoping to get a wider noodle.<br /><br />Was able to make a delicious dinner with a mix of asian sauce ingredients, so this was a winner in my book. Family was happy - so all is good! 4
...But these are pretty good! I generally steer clear of Oatmeal and Nuts in my Cookies (Give me a good old Chocolate Chip Cookie any day!), but these have a very nice Chocolate Chip taste, the Oatmeal taste is there, but it's not overpowering, and the Almonds didn't bother me very much. My only real complaint is in the packaging: The large box only contains 6 moderately-sized Cookies, which are individually-wrapped. The individual wrapping is good if you want to take a Cookie or two on the road with you, but when I saw the box my first thought was "With a box that size, I'd expect more than six Cookies." 4
I couldn't believe how bad this tastes.  It doesn't even rate 1 star, but that appears to be the lowest rating possible.  I tried it with a couple different brands of ice cream, but it was always terrible.  The first impression is you wonder if someone tampered with it and put some kind of caustic chemical in the syrup.  Very, very bad taste. My bottle was labeled "BB 10 2011" 1
This is a great snack item. It's delicious and even better when warmed. Perfect with that morning cup of coffee. It's just like a pastry. 4
I looked deeper into the description of these and found this:<br /><br />***ZICO 11 oz. tetra cartons are produced in Brazil and deliver a light, refreshing taste.<br /><br />One-liter cartons are produced in Thailand for a more nutty flavor profile, similar to fresh green Thai coconuts from the grocery store.<br /><br />And 14 oz. bottles are a nutty blend of Brazilian, Thai and Indonesian coconuts.***<br /><br />So you might not be liking the taste of the coconuts from Thai and Indonesia instead of it being the plastic bottle.<br /><br />I'll be staying with the original formula since I bought some from Trader Joe's and really like it but it is the Brazilian coconuts only.<br /><br />Mystery solved?  Let me know what you think. 3
I have been looking for a good, organic tea but I just did not like the taste of this one.  It feels like it leaves a film in your mouth. 2
Brand Buds is one of the few cereals that is high in fiber and somewhat low in sugar yet has a decent amount of vitamins. This is a good tasting cereal with plenty of crunch. If you like your cereal chewey,just microwave with one teaspoon of water for 30 to 40 seconds and the crunch is gone,add cold milk and enjoy! 4
Nice storage drawer..matches nicely in my kitchen...only drawback is I can't store it under the coffee maker due to not be able to open the keurig dispenser so I store it under my toaster.  Other than that it's really nice. 4
There are many reasons to reconsider the first foods we give to babies.  The jars and the plastic containers for processed baby food are often difficult to recycle.  The processed food and the dried cereals (wheat, rice, etc.) are nothing more than empty carbs for a society facing a massive problem with the rise of type II diabetes.  Is this anything to give to a 4 month old baby?<br />To complicate matters, the World Health Organization is now recommending that babies feed on only breastmilk or formula until baby is 6 months.  The reason is that baby's small intestines cannot process the iron out of other foods until baby is six months.  As any parent can tell you, by four months of age, most babies are wanting to try other foods.<br />Nurturme baby food can help with all of this.  Each packet makes up about 2.75 oz of baby food, the same amount in a standard baby food container.  The freeze dried food is combined with breastmilk or formula, so baby can try new foods like peas, apples, squash or sweet potatoes and still get iron a form they can use, while eating a nutritious veggie instead of a starchy carb.  I know carbs are important, but they hardly seem like the best foods to introduce when energy can be supplied from formula or breastmilk.<br />The different foods can be combined to make up baby food, for example apples and sweet potatoes together.  Another versatility option is to add a little bit of nurturme to babies bottle, sort of like a baby food smoothy.<br />The freeze dried packets are super convenient.  They are easier to carry around and store than regular baby food.  After baby is six months, if a parent wanted to add water rather than milk or formula, they can.<br />The baby food tastes good, too.  Normal baby food peas tastes like horrible canned peas.  If you ever wondered why baby wouldn't eat peas, try tasting that nasty food.  The nurturme peas actually taste like fresh peas (yes, i tried them for myself). I tried all four foods in this pack, and they all tasted like fresh food.  I think that having good tasting, healthy food would be much better to introduce than nasty tasting food.  I am trying to develop good eating habits in my child, after all. 5
Popchips are ok.  However, these snacks are made from potato flakes, similar to "Pringles".  If you have ever eaten "Funyuns" the onion flavored rings made by Frito Lay you have already tasted pretty much what Popchips taste like, just without the onion flavoring.  If your not concerned with calories, but simply want the best potato chip you can buy, try "Grandma Utz" potato chips, a true potato chip. 2
I have long, fine hair, shoulder-length+.<br />If dry it can break when combed/brushed.<br /><br />Before CLEAR, I used shampoos/conditioners by Paul Mitchell [[ASIN:B002N5MI8C Paul Mitchell Extra Body Daily Shampoo, 33.8-Ounce Bottle] and Pantene [[ASIN:B001F51V3E Pantene Pro-V 2-in-1 Shampoo and Conditioner, Classic Care, Packaging May Vary, 25.4 -Ounce (Pack of 2)]. They give my hair shine and satisfactory body. And less breaking. I'd hoped to have it look even better, be tougher with CLEAR. So I took a shot.<br /><br />CLEAR Scalp and Hair Therapy/Nourishing Shampoo with its sales pitch of 'nourishing<br />the scalp' seemed believable, like stimulating/nourishing the scalp. Oops; not-so.<br /><br />Terse instructions say "when using shampoo and conditioner" "apply to wet hair, gently massage into scalp, lather and rinse." (Two statements, connected by an asterisk) Seemed<br />unclear.<br /><br />Before rinsing, CLEAR's goopy consistency made me doubt its sticky white lather could get past the hair (not really a lather; no frothy bubbles). The consistency is like a women's facial creme. I took pictures of my frothy Gorgon-Head scary-odd hair. Pretty funny, kinda scary.<br /><br />I tried finger tips to rub the glop into my scalp. Maybe some got through my hair, but its heavy-consistency turned hair follicles into slimy protrusions like bright white heavy meringue; sticky and thick like tooth paste; both funny and weird. I tried rubbing it into my scalp; it just glopped together in my hair. Afterwards I had to wash my hands twice. The white stuff that couldn't get past hair covered my fingers, palms.<br /><br />My hair doesn't have observably more volume; after drying, the hair seemed sort of frizzed; literally less shiny, healthy. I repeated the treatment a week later, just<br />to be sure. Same effects, problems. And there's more:<br /><br />The label said an ingredients list was on the label's back.'Just peel it<br />off'. And it was, evidently rushed to market, upside down and backwards.<br /><br />Last shot at CLEAR: The plastic bottle has an flat oval top. The container came in a fitted, sealed plastic sleeve inside a padded Amazon mailer. Shipping shakes evidently poked the flat top and inside the sleeve was slopped with the gooey white glop.<br /><br />Back to the lab, CLEAR Marketeers. I'll stick with Paul Mitchell and Pantene. 1
My son is on a restricted diet due to allergies and he is very picky. It was hard to find things that he would even try. After tasting one of these cookies he was hooked. Now this is a favorite snack of his. 5
Packing was not appropriate. The cardboard box was torn in several places. Cans were dented. One can had broken and leaked over at least 4 other cans causing a smelly mess. It was quite unpleasant. 2
Perfect for those lazy nights.  My boyfriend, who is Italian and likes authentic Italian food (the food snob), really loves this.  And honestly, it's so hard to mess the dish up.  I've put more water than necessary, left it on for longer than necessary, and both times it was absolutely perfect. 4
Pineapple is hands down my favorite flavor of Vita Coco! It not only serves a great electrolyte replenishing beverage (aka the PERFECT hangover cure) but it can also be made into a pinacolada if you just add some rum :) 5
Wolfgang Puck makes the BEST coffee! The package arrived on time and in perfect condition! I would definitely order this again. 5
This is a great on the go breakfast or snack. It tastes so good and easy to carry around. I would recommend this to anyone! 4
I drink too much soda. I've started looking for alternatives and one of the things I've tried is switch. I first tried it because while it's like an orange soda, it's really carbonated juice.<br /><br />I like:<br />-The carbonation<br />-The flavor<br />-all juice<br />-no added sugar, no high fructose corn syrup<br />-no artificial flavors or colors<br /><br />I don't like:<br />-The small can (8oz)<br />-The flavor took a can to get used to it. It's a mixture of orange, apple, tangarene, grape, and Acerola juice. (Acerola is a fruit high in vitamin C, so I assume that's why it's used.) If you don't expect exactly orange soda, the flavor grows on you quickly.<br /><br />If I really want a cola, Switch isn't good enough to be my replacement. But it's a very easy replacement for an orange soda. I can't wait to try some of the other flavors. I usually really like black cherry drinks and I'm interested in seeing what fruit juices they use in that one! 5
I think this was starting to work but it made my daughter spit up all the time.  More MIlk Plus from Mother Love worked much better for me and for her. 3
My Chow Chow loves this dog food and eats it ridiculously fast.  However, after reading about the ingredients in it, I wonder if it is a healthy option for dogs.  I think I will just mix it with her other dog food for now, so she can have some variety.  This food might be a nice change for your dog every now and again, but I do not think it should be his or her main dog food.  Definitely do some research first! 3
There is very little meat in this food and there are toxic chemicals.<br /><br />Various Meat By Products--lower quality than whole meat or meals and harder to digest than actual meat.  Lamb is listed after various by-products, indicating that most of the protein a pet will be exposed to in eating this food is not lamb and thus not easy on the stomach as lamb is stated to be.<br /><br />Caramel coloring is only necessary when there is not enough meat.  Caramel color may be carcinogenic.<br /><br />"Liquid Top Sirloin flavor"  "Grilled chicken flavor"--  Flavoring is only necessary when the product has insufficient meat.  Top Sirloin flavoring is made from manure of cattle.<br /><br />Carageenan causes cancer, including breast cancer.  Read an interview with Joanne Tobacman, MD, professor of internal medicine, University of Iowa at [...]<br /><br />There are no vegetables in this food.<br /><br />Cesar has repeatedly stated that his entire goal in coming to the United States was to go to Hollywood and be famous.  I think that that focus on fame (and money) is apparent in his approach to dog food:  Give crummy food nice packaging and an appealing name.<br /><br />That one's dog will eat it is no advertisement.  First, the only thing one really has to do to sell dog food is make it so the dogs will eat it.  That the dog will eat it is no measure of the quality or benefit of the food.  Dogs eat anything--including manure, which is part of this food as the meat flavoring. 1
This is not true balsamic, it contains caramel, wine vinegar (not just must) and antioxidants. I don't know how I'll use this all up, maybe reduce it for marinade or something. Doesn't taste good. 1
I'm really sad about this. I was so excited to get this particular brand since it was so well received by everyone else. I went w/salt instead of oil so it would keep better and the whole bit about truffle oil not even containing real truffles. I was going to savor every last black bit of ambrosia in this little container. Alas, it was not to be. The aroma is definitely there, but after I put it on steaks, chicken, fries, burgers, pastas, etc, the truffle didn't come through. To get enough truffle flavor, I basically had to oversalt my food with this.<br /><br />Maybe I just got a bad batch. Maybe the seal went awry and the heat during shipping caused an irreversible chemical process whereby the truffle aromatic ringed compounds left my jar. I'm not sure. I'm just sad. And without truffle goodness. 2
Very disappointed...cookies arrived stale.  This is the only time I have had a problem like this. Perhaps there should be more attention when this product is shipped. 2
We've tried many different thinkThin bars and the white chocolate chip bars are the best!  They can be a bit rich, but I really like the taste and texture.  The best part is that they don't make my blood sugar spike and then drop, so these make a great snack and excellent lunch on days that I don't have time to stop and eat. 4
First found this marmalade at an Irish trade show. Loved it then, love it now. 5
We have played this with three adults.  fun game that does not take too long to play.  makes you think and plan only to have someone else mess up your plans. 5
I thought for sure I was going to love this tea. I love licorice and I like my teas sweet. I was so disappointed in the flavor of this product! It has very little licorice taste and an almost sickening after taste and smell. I added sugar to it as I did not find it very sweet. I ordered the 6 box pack of this so I guess I have 5 boxes of it to give away 2
I really was waiting to capture a number of gophers before rating this product.  However, after about 20 settings I have caught 1 mole.  Most the time, no matter what technique I try to use, I come up with a hole full of dirt... 50% of the time the trap is snapped, 50% not.  I am going to try the more substantial cinch traps next, as I don't want to miss the 50% of critters that do snap the trap and still get away. 3
Using this dinner kit really doesn't save you any time in the kitchen. In the same amount of time or less, you could make a simple, delicious and healthy meal from scratch for less money. But since you're actually considering this, I'll tell you that it doesn't taste half bad. You can't really go wrong with all that cheese (or whatever it is) in there. 3
I have been happy with the quality of this food as well as delivery time & speed. The cats tried tearing into this bag before their old food is gone yet. They really like this food. 4
This is a great tasting product!! Both me and my wife love it. I don't know how they did it but it is wonderful. 5
I don't think I've ever eaten anything drier than these cookie bars, ever in my life. They taste okay, but I just can't choke them down, even with coffee. 1
In my search to find the perfect food for my two mini-dachshunds I discovered the world of "breed specific" dog food, which intrigued me because of the unique health concerns for the breed.  The two I found for dachshunds were Eukanuba and Royal Canin.  Both received moderate ratings on other websites [...]).  I opted to try Eukanuba because of the price - granted it is still pricey but cheaper than Royal Canin.  Both dogs eat it without a fuss and have had no apparent digestive issues with this food.  I would recommend it.  The only drawback is the price of the product. 4
I used to buy this from the store when it was still called 'Damn good chili'. Someone must have complained about the name, but its one of the best.<br />Just to make it last longer, I add ground beef, onion, tomatoes, beans, cheese and some extra seasoning (chili powder, cumin) and its amazing.<br />Although by itself its still pretty 'darn good' 4
This is a product I know I want for my dog ; and not all pet stores carry it. I also like to buy large quantities that are difficult to carry.<br />This vendor sent exactly what I wanted, in the quantity I wanted, and delivered it to the door limiting my need to carry the large bags.<br />The cost of shipping was a price I was willing to pay; particularly because I was able to shop on the net for the best price.zx 4
I love the strong but not burnt taste of the Jet Fuel K-cup coffee.  However, about every 3rd or 4th K-cup has an undetectable manufacturing defect. My husband works in manufacturing and compared a proper K-cup with a defective Jet Fuel by dissecting both.  The K-cups have an internal filter but the defective Jet Fuel ones the interior filter is torn around the top edge which then allows a great quantity of coffee grounds to dispense in your cup. Then there is the mess of grounds to clean up in the Keurig coffee maker not to mention that drinking grounds is an experience you want to avoid. It's impossible to tell which Jet Fuel K-cups are fine and which are defective. It's a lovely strong coffee and was actually one of my favorites but I won't be purchasing any more of them because of the defect problem. 2
My son purchased this product for me with his Amazon Prime, which allowed him super quick shipping.  It came today, nice and fresh.  It is horrible.  It is made with dried potatoes instead of fresh, vegetable shortening instead of butter and sorbic acid as a preservative.  I took a bite and spit it out right away.  If you've ever had the real deal, homemade, this is NOT it.  I told my son to contact Amazon and get his money back.<br /><br />No matter how bad a cook you are, you could not mess up a recipe of this, so I suggest you go out and purchase a cookbook with a recipe for lefse in it.  Oh god, this is awful! 1
The bonsai came in a very cramped and shoddy package, and was dead on arrival. The pot was way too small for the tree as well. It is hard to tell whether a bonsai is dead or not, as they often do not turn brown until months after they have died, but a trained eye could tell. Spare yourself the waste of money and spend a little more on a more legitimate seller. 1
Poor product.<br /><br />What was I thinking, looking for mail-order seafood at Amazon.<br /><br />Buy locally! 1
I gave this a try when it was on special and I totally Love this product Iam as fussy coffee drinker this product is just a lovely as those higher priced coffee's that tend to break my bank account ..GIVE it a TRY 5
I love calypso lemonades, especially the strawberry and ocean blue but I would have to be a fool to order them for 60+ dollars when I can buy the same 12 pack at the corner gas station for $20.  I went on line hoping to find a better price than the $1.69 I was paying.  This is not a good deal unless you are paying $5.12 a bottle 5
I have been looking for a site to order Snow's Corn Chowder.  Formerly a New Englander and now living in Florida, I cannot find my favorite chowder anywhere.  My whole family loves Snow's Corn Chowder and I promise to share with them if I can order a case.  Would some one please look around and see if you can find one.  The Florida Fredericks would be most appreciative. 5
This cereal was just okay. It tasted a little like plastic. I liked Kellogg's other new cereal in this same genre, but this one just didn't quite cut it for me. It was boring and waxy. I wasn't impressed. 3
First of all, this product claims to be "Black Cherry" flavor.  Yes, it is made from 100% juice, but cherry juice is well down the list of ingredients.  The drink has mostly apple and grape juice, and that is what I tasted more than anything else.  There is just enough cherry juice in there to give it a hint of cherry behind the apple and grape flavors.  For a cherry lover like myself, this drink was a disappointment.  Further, I think this drink is tremendously overpriced, considering it is just a little over 8 ounces of mostly apple and grape juice with some carbonation added.  If you can do without the carbonation, buy yourself some apple juice or grape juice.  It is much cheaper ounce per ounce.  You may not look as hip as you will look with this fancy can, but it is no longer fashionable to waste money anyway. 1
I was really looking forward to trying this espresso blend and was very disappointed, the beans were very dry, unlike most espresso lenses we h ave purchased before. Usually the beans look oily or wet and have a nice crema on top where this blend did not. We won't purchase this brand again. 1
Delicate ground hazelnut cookies for a Ladies tea, NOT for children or most men! Appreciated only by sophisticated palates, because they are neither cloyingly sweet or fatty. Set these aside for unexpected guests you'd like to impress. 1
I tested this product out on two dogs and a cat. Daisy, my neighbor's border collie, went "absolutely ape" for it, in the words of her owner. I saw this myself; the dog would "walk" for twenty feet if you held the treat up just out of her reach and started walking away. My girlfriend's dachshund Monkey had a similar reaction. Monkey would snatch up the treat and run into the next room away from everyone else, and scarf it down in the corner. The treats were a bit large for her to swallow whole (about the size of Kennedy half-dollars and about half an inch thick), so I started breaking them up for her so she wouldn't choke in her enthusiasm.<br /><br />Speaking of breaking them up, they become very crumbly, so make sure you either break them over the counter or be prepared to sweep.<br /><br />The crumbs actually worked to my advantage with my girlfriend's cat Cleo. She would not eat the treat by itself, even when broken up. However, when I broke it up in her food, she ate it, though she gave no indication that it was any different from her normal food.<br /><br />The Raw Boost Bites package get bonus points for being irresistible to canines and having healthy ingredients. Since it's advertised as a cat treat as well, I can't give it five stars since Cleo was apathetic toward it, but I know what I'm buying the dogs from now on. 4
This is really the way to go. Add some creamer to further enhance the flavor of this blend. I signed up for a subscription to have this delivered every month. I drink some every morning at work. Works great with the B&D Home Cafe system. 5
I did not realize when I had these sent to me that they were for a pod brewer.  I am glad that is that case, however.  It gave me a chance to test these out in several ways.<br /><br />1. Single Cup Pod Brewer- made weak coffee and it just didn't taste very good,  Tasted burned, weak and unimpressive - the price is outrageous for this quality of coffee.<br /><br />2.  Opened bags and used four of them to brew an 8 cup load in the Bunn Phase Brew 8 Cup coffee maker with the Bunn filter.  The result?  A FANTASTIC cup of coffee.  A medium roast coffee, there is a smoothness with a slightly grassy flavor and almost touch of flowery finish.  This is clearly a low-acid coffee which again was very enjoyable.  This made the perfect strength coffee and we all enjoyed it very much.<br /><br />3.  Aerobie Coffee Press- again made excellent smooth coffee very similar to the flavor of the Bunn brewed cup - with even more silky smooth texture.  I used one pod for one cup of coffee, but I opened it first and used it with the Aerobie Espresso Coffee Press.  Using one pod (opened up and used loose) makes a good small cup of coffee, but to make it stronger, two pods were necessary.<br /><br />There are about 3 Tablespoons of ground coffee per bag.<br /><br />All in all, when used loose, this is a really wonderful cup of coffee.  At the price that it is, however, it is ridiculously expensive.  If they took the Marley name off of it, perhaps they could lower the price down and sell it in loose foil bags, better pods of coffee, or un-ground beans foil packed.<br /><br />As dumb as this may sound, there is not one bit of information about this coffee on the box or the foil envelopes.  There are no instructions whatsoever. If someone had never used a pod coffee maker or heard of one, they might not understand this process at all.  Surely they should have SOMETHING on the box and packets saying that these are only to be used with pod coffee makers.<br /><br />Again, it might sound fussy, but not everyone knows everything, and it would help to avoid mistaken purchases for someone who has no idea what a pod is for coffee.  As you can see from some reviews, the tea style bag is easily misunderstood and used in a fashion like making tea. 3
We purchased a Keurig last Christmas holiday, and have been very pleased with the purchase.  It came with a sampler of different coffees, teas, and chocolate milk.  And for the most part, I enjoyed most of the sample options.  The chocolate milk in the sampler (which was not Cafe Escapes) left me disappointed.  It was a rather water-down version of chocolate milk, with very little flavor.  Unfortunatley, I had bought a whole box of that same chocolate milk in the store before I had a chance to try it.  After some research, I came across the Cafe Escapes brand, which makes a chocolate milk for the Keurig, and in my opinion, is the best of the chocolate milks available for the Keurig.  It has a creamy taste, like chocolate milk made with milk, even though you're using water to create it.  It's full of flavor and in my opinion, what a good chocolate milk should taste like.  Now I've read opinions where people think it has an after taste, which I didn't perceive, but to each their own.  I thought the flavor was amazing.  My only regret about Cafe Escapes is that it's seems to be harder to find and is sold out a lot, although I've consistently been able to get it through Amazon. 4
Amazon normally does a fantastic job getting product out to me in great shape and on-time, but, I guess this is one product that they can not.<br /><br />Several jars had compromised seals and so we had to immediately throw them out.  I wish I could order this by mail but it seems this is one item we'll need to go to the grocery store for. 2
My kids love these, and we've ordered them often - but as was the case with at least one other reviewer, this batch came in with some mold. (I freeze them as soon as they arrive, so had the have been moldy upon arrival.)<br /><br />too bad - but at this price, won't run the risk of having to toss out product. 2
was surprised, it was very good. it doesnt stay slushy very long but the taste is wonderful just cold too. 4
These noodles made me gag. That is not an expression. It's the truth. I spat them out and poured the remainder into the garbage disposal. I will continue to use spaghetti squash as a pasta substitute. 1
I won't pretend to be an expert on olive oils;  but I will attest to being a family cook and consumer of olive oils and this one did not strike me as quite what I was expecting. The first whiff gives a hint of stale and when blind-taste-tested in my home kitchen by my husband, my ten year old and me- dipping crusty sourdough bread-straight-up, no herbs, no garlic no other flavors- 2 out of 3 of us selected the OTHER first-cold-pressed, Virgin Olive Oil from Italy;  we were trying to buy more American stuffs but will stick with our imported Italian olive oils for now. OK,  for me, this one is fine for sauteeing- just not the best fresh flavor for dipping or dressings. In case it it matters substantially-  the bottle indicates: 'Harvested  Fall '07 and Bottled 6-21-08' 2
These are tasty, but after I'd eat a bag, my heart would practically seize. I looked at the packaging and it was 275mg of sodium. I threw the rest away. What a bummer. So tasty, but way way way way way too much salt! 2
When I returned to work my supply really went down. I was afraid I would not be able to continue breastfeeding. Just one cup of tea a day has increased my supply so much that I have to wear nursing pads again! However, my baby does not like this tea. Whenever I nurse her after drinking this tea she screams like she is in severe pain. I don't want her to hurt, so I have discontinued use of this tea. 2
Was hesitant at first to buy this coffee but I couldn't pass up the deal.  My husband and I drink med/bold coffee and are pretty snobbish when it comes to coffee.  I have had better coffee than Emeril's but it's up there in the "good" coffee category.  I would definitely buy again for the cost that it was. 4
We have five cats - one an elderly cat of 15 years, the other four in the 9-11 year range.  The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.<br /><br />Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.<br /><br />I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.<br /><br />Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck. 1
These Lipton iced-tea packets are a great concept. Essentially, you can take these little packets anywhere, pour it into a (standard 16.9 fl. oz.) bottle of water, and enjoy some tea. It's quick and easy, but unfortunately these Tea & Honey packets don't seem to actually work very well.<br /><br />The box warns, "Tea takes longer to dissolve so SHAKE WELL." This, however, is a pretty big understatement in my experience. After pouring the powder in, I shook the bottle a couple times and found that the powder clumped together immediately. I shook and shook and shook, but to no avail. Certainly, it flavored the water, but there were also big sugar-particles floating around my bottle. I tried it once more but to the same result.<br /><br />It's really a shame because the taste is quite good, much like a pomegranate flavored-water. But along with this good taste, your mouth is filled with an unpleasant amount of sugar clumps. Of course, it would be possible to filter these out with a strainer of some kind, although that would totally defeat the convenience aspect of the product. It's unfortunate. 2
The coffee's OK, but the little pod gets stuck up in the machine. It's not impossible to get out, but takes effort and patience - I bought these as a gift for my brother who LOVES coffee, and his Keurig machine, but definitely doesn't have the patience to work with the stuck pod - too bad, too, because I really loved the idea of putting a lot less plastic into the landfills! 3
these peppercorns are fresh and spicy.  they are<br />just what i wanted.  Nice size and i think they are<br />are great value. 5
These are so awesome I almost don't want to share them with my kids ;)<br />I  had to order a couple more at this price also 5
I really liked this drink. It has a strong ginger flavor with just enough lemon that it doesn't overpower the drink.<br /><br />The only reason that this product didn't get five stars is that it's very high in sugar. The ingredient list is "Ginger, Glucose, Sucrose, Honey and Fructose". Four out of the give ingredients are sugars! I'm diabetic, so this could only be an occasional indulgence for me. 4
We have purchased this popcorn twice. It's just the right amount for our popcorn popper as we have a 4 oz kettle on the stand up machine. About 95% of the corn pops so expect to lose a little but this is normal with an automatic paper as occasionally a popped grain of corn will take an unpopped grain of corn with it as it leaves the kettle. The oil in the packages in the first batch stayed firm however the oil in the second order is completely melted. We have not yet figured out the reasons as storage condition for each were exactly the same. This is a good product however you are paying a lot more than bulk ingredients when it comes prepackaged like this. 3
I was looking forward to this product, as my wife and I both like Earl Grey tea, and decaf lets us drink it at night.  We drink a variety of tea, so we don't go through individual tea very quickly, so I was looking forward to the resealable packets.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this tea just doesn't taste good initially and has a particularly unpleasant aftertaste.  I definitely would not recommend buying this tea. 1
I suppose this is a new formula since Quaker is marketing this as 'heart healthy' and whole grain.<br /><br />To me, it tastes as good as any other Quaker Instant Oatmeal that I've tried in the past so I do not hesitate to recommend this one.<br /><br />That said, I am not an oatmeal connoisseur; if you are very picky about your oatmeal, then your mileage may vary so to speak. I do like less fattening and more healthy foods so would probably purchase this one over a less healthy version. 4
The ingredients are great but my cat's litter box smelled HORRENDOUS all the time that she was on this food.  I know diet changes sometimes cause a temporary issue, so I kept on giving it to her hoping it would resolve itself after her digestive system had time to get used to the new food, but it was equally stinky all the way to the end of the bag.<br /><br />She was on another high quality grain free food (Wellness Core) before this, I just wanted to try something different so she'd have some variety, but unfortunately this won't work.  Maybe it's just my kitty and maybe it'll work for some other cat.  The ingredients seem really good.  Good luck! 2
Amazon is listing "nutritional info" such as protein, calories, etc., but omitting the actual list of ingredients in these supplements.  I would like to see what I will actually be eating should I use these, and that info is not available here.<br /><br />Note: the "1 star" awarded in this review does not reflect on this specific product, of which I have no firsthand knowledge.  It's just that I couldn't post this review without choosing 1 to 5 stars. 1
A nice case of chips that are quite tasty. I definitely enjoy the Kettle Sea Salt and Black Pepper. I just wish they were bigger bags :) 5
I received the two "Mission Pack Space Food Sampler with Astronaut Ice Cream and Space Food Sticks" packs I purchased in the mail today. I initially panicked when I saw them - both were packaged in "Astronaut Mission Pack" boxes that said they contained "3 Assorted Freeze-Dried Space Foods." This is not the packaging shown in the picture, and there is nothing on the box about Space Food Sticks (I wasn't too concerned about the magnet). The Space Food Sticks were the whole reason I ordered these samplers, as a surprise gift of nostalgia for a friend. When I finally opened the boxes, I saw that 2 Space Food Sticks and a magnet had been added each, so I DID receive the product that was promised. However, I still feel a bit cheated and deceived - I was expecting a fun gift box to present to my friend, as shown in the picture, and the boxes had some tears on them, perhaps from being opened to add the additional Space Food Sticks and magnet.<br /><br />In terms of the food items themselves - pretty much what I expected and I'm happy with them(and definitely what I was prepared for based on what other reviewers said).<br /><br />On a side note - because many of the older reviews for this product refer to additional items that are no longer included, it would be nice if they were updated or removed. I was sort of bummed to learn that this product used to come with freeze-dried food (that many reviewers seemed to love!) that are no longer included.<br /><br />Overall, I'm OK with the product - I got the food items I was expecting and most wanted - but the product picture needs to be updated, and the reviews should match the product currently available. 3
I got this to hold us over because our usual supplier was sold out right when we needed more Himalayan salt. The quality is good, but the salt is most certainly NOT finely ground. The crystals are the same size as previous Himalayan salt that we purchased in the past, which is coarser than regular table salt. When described as finely ground, I was expecting smaller sized crystals. Our usual supplier is in stock again, so I probably won't be purchasing this brand again if not necessary. But the price is pretty good and the quality seems fine, so I would recommend this to people who are looking to try Himalayan salt. 4
Good Earth made the very bad decision to alter their perfectly formulated Caffeine Free Original Sweet & Spicy Herbal Tea and the new formula is not even as good as the average Decaf Chai Black Tea from Celestial Seasonings. This used to be the best tea on the market for quality and flavor but is now not even in the top twenty. I can no longer recommend this product. I wrote to the company and received no response. The complaint is as follows.<br /><br />Dear Good Earth Representative, I am certain you have received hundreds of this precise complaint but I felt the need, after so many times checking back in stores and purchasing a box of your Original Sweet and Spicy Herbal Tea only to find that the taste is well below the average taste of any cheap store brand chai, to ask that your company, please, reconsider the decision to switch to this newer formula/recipe for the Herbal Sweet and Spicy tea. It has been so long since I or anyone I know has had your wonderful tea because you replaced it, a year ago or more at this point, with a tea that no one, and I mean no one, that I know was willing to continue drinking. At least 8 women at work stopped drinking it right along with me and the reviews on Amazon of your new recipe are consistently terrible. I used to have great appreciation for your company and a great love for your product. If you wanted to offer a separate Ginseng-free formula, your company could have simply introduced a night-time ginseng-free herbal. The orgininal formula did not have to be retired in order to facilitate this change. Please pass this sentiment along to your superiors on behalf of myself and many of my relatives, coworkers and companions. None of us purchase your products anymore and we would come back to your company as loyal and daily drinkers of the old formula of the Good Earth Sweet and Spicy Herbal Tea if you would only revive the old formula and resume manufacture and sale of this lost and missed product. Thank you for your time. 1
DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT OR ANY CHICKEN JERKY TREAT PRODUCT FROM CANYON CREEK RANCH OR ANY OTHER DISTRIBUTOR OF PRODUCTS FROM CHINA UNTIL THE FDA ADVISES THE PRODUCTS ARE SAFE AGAIN. Last month the FDA issued a warning advising people not to buy chicken jerky treats made in China [...]. Unfortunately I didn't hear of the warning until it was too late. I gave both my dogs one Yam-Good each for about a month and the result was they almost died from vomiting and bloody stool. Despite their American sounding name, Canyon Creek Ranch IS MADE IN CHINA AND SAYS SO ON THE PACKAGE. Even worse, no where on their website or on Amazon does it mention the FDA warning or that the product is toxic. These lovely little treats nearly cost me the lives of both my dogs, as well as over $500 in vet bills and time off of work. 1
I'm a crunchaholic! I have to have something during the day to crunch! All other chips are so high in fat or sodium that it makes it very difficult to be eating healthy and still get my crunch on. PopChips is the answer and the individual bags are a great way to control your calories too! I highly recommend them all, but the salt and pepper are my least favorite! 4
If one reads this products ingredients they will find that the first ingredient is cows milk, then SUGAR (diabetic maker), then milk, again. The fourth ingredient is sunflower oil, fifth ingredient is maltodextrin which is starch produced from grain containing the sugars maltose and dextrin, with the seventh ingredient being, get this, tuna fish oil. They even feature vitamin D3, which is animal derived. There are four different sugar sources in it and some artificial flavor for good measure. If we really think about what we are feeding our babies, would we use this product? I know I wouldn't. Know your food sources. 1
A single can of this super energy drink is good for 2 servings.  Each serving has 130 calories, which means if you drink this all at once you will have twice as many calories.  Some of the active ingredients listed are: caffeine, taurine, L-carnotone and arginine.  There is plenty of corn syrup in this drink.  It is bubbly drink with ginseng and grape flavor and my can had beverage in reddish color.  This drink will definitely keep you up, but I am not sure that calorie count is worth it. 3
Even though there is no added sugar, this small can packs in 130 calories and 33 grams of sugars via fruit juices.  That's the down side.  The plus is the flavor - it tastes of cherry with some fizz, but not too much.  If you've ever had Knudsen's Cherry Cider, that's what this tastes like, with some carbonation.<br /><br />While I like the taste, the high calorie and sugar count for 8 oz. is why I gave it three stars.  If you don't have to worry about sugar and calories, this is a tasty treat. 3
These bags had a lot of overcooked brown pieces. also felt very greasy. Had to keep wiping my fingers on a napkin. 3
I have bought these for a long time and felt better about the product because I believed them to be of American origin.  I purchased several bags (strips, wrapped apples, etc) and now realize the country of origin is CHINA.  With all the FDA regulations about packaging, it's about time it was mandated that country of origin be prominently displayed (like in 20 font type - not microscopic writing no one notices!!!) ON THE FRONT OF THE PACKAGE!!!  As a result, I will no longer purchase Dogswell products.  As an aside, rawhide is an even worse offender, since the dog can get a much higher dose of any toxins used in curing the hide (and you can bet there are plenty!).  I even picked up a package of a brand named (something like) "U.S.A. Rawhide" and on the back, in fine print, was "Made in China."  Why aren't our legislators doing something productive and cracking down on this?  It's sneaky at best and intentionally deceptive at worst!  Amazon, please find us products for our "furry kids" that won't make them sick or kill them! 2
Years ago, they used to sell packaged brownies at the dollar store, dime stores, etc. They came 12 or so to a flat. They were the cheapest treat you could buy in the store, at about a nickle each. That's what these brownies remind me of and that's not a good thing. These things are very dense, not in a GOOD "chewy-chocolaty-moist and gooey" kind of way, but more along the lines of "grainy-gummy-rubbery and nasty. The is very little flavor and no distinction between the cream filling and the chocolate shell. These are not terrible, but for the name Oreo and the steep price point, I expected much, much, much more! 2
The makers of Taco Bell Home Originals Bold and Creamy Chiptole Sauce did get the "creamy" part right - though there is no cream anywhere to be found in this bottle, just copious amounts of soybean oil.  This is why this sauce has a whopping 110 calories per 2 tablespoon serving, on par with most regular salad dressings.<br /><br />Unfortunately (or more unfortunately) the "bold" part of the name is an extreme misrepresentation.  Oh, there is some chipotle puree way down on the ingredient list (listed under the label "contains less than 2% of"), but it only lends a hint of chipotle flavor to the sauce.  It's more akin to mayonnaise with a few dashes of pepper added than to a real chipotle sauce - nothing "bold" here at all.<br /><br />As it does have a somewhat pleasant (though overwhelmingly bland) taste, I'll give this Taco Bell sauce a bit of credit.  But I suspect that it would be much better and healthier with a bit less oil and a lot more kick.<br /><br />Note - since people have varying responses to spicy foods, I'll let you know that when I'm at a Taco Bell the "Fire" sauce is my usual choice, and I consider "Medium" and "Mild" to be about as spicy as ketchup.  Perhaps those more sensitive than I to spicy heat will have a better opinion of this sauce than I do. 3
This product stains fingers. Much different than expected- I didn't even know what crisps were-now I know. They stick my teeth too! I gave them away to a neighbor...not for me! 1
Last night they predicted an ice storm and I was going to have the day off for MLK, so I knew that this was the day to make soup.  This one is excellent!  My only addition to the recipe was a ham bone and about a cup of rice.  It made a great, satisfying supper.  Pat 5
These were inexpensive and delivered promptly. Don't buy 'em, though, unless you know for a fact you already like this brand/flavor. No amount of seasoning, butter, or even intoxicants are likely to make these edible. 2
My baby isn't born yet so I haven't used this for baby food yet, but I HAVE used it for freezing homemade chicken stock. I just filled the 2 ounce cups, popped it into the freezer and then stuck the frozen segments into a ziplock and then repeated. It makes the perfect-sized little portions and is extremely easy to use. I love how flexible the silicone is and am looking forward to finding other uses for this. I would highly recommend this to anyone, not just those wanting to use it for baby food.<br /><br />As another reviewer stated, it is not airtight so it could get freezer burn. But I have never had this issue and you can avoid it as well by simply transferring the portions to a freezer bag once it's frozen. If you are looking for a container to hold what you make in the freezer indefinitely, this is not the product for you.<br /><br />I like this so much, in fact, I would have purchased a second or even third one for convenience if it weren't for the price. Once my baby is old enough, I have a feeling I will be investing in another though. 5
I had a really difficult time choking these down. It'd be great if they made noodle 1/2 from this and 1/2 from a grain. Still b half the calories and actually edible. i guess if your desperate and not too picky of an eater these could work for you. 2
While the chip is still light and crispy the flavor is off. It does have a nice little kick to it, but to me it tasted more like pickle than jalope&ntilde;o. I think they should be called "pickle chips" 3
Taco Bell's Chipotle Sauce is tasty, lending a smoky zing to whatever you happen to use it with.  The list of ingredients, however, is quite extensive, so don't anticipate that what comes out of the bottle is anything remotely akin to healthy.  Good for an occasional foray into the decandent and fatty world of fast-food-type condiments. 3
By now I've eaten half the bag so I know what's in here. Sure, their beef jerky is pretty tender. But for some reason they decided to throw in an insane amount of salt. I've had store-bought beef jerky and I've had quality Amazon beef jerky and this is definitely the saltiest by at least double. The first time I ate this, I could only handle 2 strips before I had to put it down again. My friend made a disgusted face and refused to have another bite. Luckily I am a salt lover so I can at least tolerate the extreme saltiness. But it's still too salty.<br /><br />Next up is the gristle. Sometimes amidst the generally tender bites there will be a mat of unchewable mass that I pretty much have to spit out or swallow whole. It happens more often than other brands and definitely more than I care for. Secondly, I don't know if it's the salt playing tricks on me, but the texture and taste is a bit worse than other brands, like they use lower quality jerky.<br /><br />Overall I believe that Wild Ride is less quality than most other brands, even when you factor in the low price. There are similarly priced brands that are of higher quality and lower sodium content. I don't know why they sell so well. Personally my next bulk order beef jerky will be with someone else. 2
WE loved this for our dog, at first. Unfortunately after a few uses, his abdomen became distended, he became flatulent (and very stanky, yes STANKY), and had loose stools. Not exactly something you want in a large dog. Peanut butter will be on our shopping list from now on; it's cheaper and works so much better. 2
THE Brine it self is great ,BUT  what you do not find out & there is NO way TO KNOW THAT it is NOT inside this product  after you open the package, you find out, is that you need a LARGE Brine BAG to soak the whole thing in for the 24- 48 hours before baking, so then you get this2 days before Christmas day & now it is to late to order a Brine bag to use with this, & NO place in this add to order did it say it was no included?? IT would BE so helpfull to know ahead of time that this is not all you will need to do the brine ,  I know IT also will not come with a turkey, BUT you would think for the price it would have a bag,<br /> BUT the truth of this is , THAT it is still great Brine  JUST hard to use IF you do not know what you will need,<br />  Thank YOU for ASKING&lt; A GRANDMA THAT FOUND another way TO SOAK THIS BIRD,when you do not have a BAG!!!! 3
The product I received was for "mature" cats, not "senior," and there is a difference...my cats won't eat the mature mix.<br /><br />Amazon however did refund my money, but when I called the description changed to dog food! There are real problems with the listing of this product.<br /><br />In the end Amazon receives 5 stars for their service 1
We drink a multitude of beverages in our house.  Everything from soda, coffee, tea, hot chocolate and flavored water, so we always enjoy giving new beverages a try.  Lipton To Go Stix Decaf Iced Green Tea Mix is a blend of tea, honey and strawberry acai that comes in a 10-Count box with each powdered package producing a 16 ounce drink.  Here are my thoughts;<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />+ Easy to make, just add water, stir/shake and you're done.<br /><br />+ Convenient for travel.<br /><br />+ Good way to add flavor to water.<br /><br />+ 5 calories per 8 ounce serving.  One packet makes a 16 ounce serving.<br /><br />+ No aspartame.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- Contains sucralose.<br /><br />- Doesn't really taste like tea.  Tasted more like strawberry Kool-Aid or Jell-O to me.<br /><br />- May be a bit too sweet for some.<br /><br />Powdered "On-The-Go" drink mixes always seem to be hit or miss in our house.  Most of the time they taste terribly artificial or too tart/sweet for our tastes.  Lipton To Go Stix Decaf Iced Green Tea Mix was no exception.  It tasted very little like any flavored tea I've ever tried.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing if you're looking for a sweet and refreshing drink.  However, I think many people will have difficulty equating the flavor of this drink mix with tea. 3
I just cancelled my subscription after learning that 1 pack (5.5oz) contain 135mg of sodium. Way too high for 13 months old child! Its like feeding her cheetos for dinner 2
We might not be a gourmet club, but we know when something looks and tastes like wall paper paste. (And please don't get us started on the strange smell!)<br /><br />I have used Hamburger Helper for years (admittedly not that often) but had never before used the Stroganoff variety. Well... we will never, ever use it again. What a waste of perfectly good beef. And, FYI, I thoroughly followed the directions, and used fresh, lean hamburger purchased only an hour before. (Honest!)<br /><br />Gross. 1
The nuts were very tasty and if you don't mind the artificial sweeteners, they may be for you.  If you are expecting chocolate covered almonds, you'll be disappointed.  They are what they say however; "cocoa roasted".  They have a modest cocoa flavor with a bit of sweetness.<br /><br />The reason I gave them only 2 stars is because they fail to disclose on the front label that they contain not only one but two artificial sweeteners.  This annoys me because 1) artificial sweeteners bother my stomach and 2) many people don't want to eat artificial sweeteners or give them to their kids.  It irks me when manufacturers try to pawn their wares as a "healthy" snack yet omit the fact that they contain artificial sweeteners or ingredients.<br /><br />One used to be able to spot artificial sweeteners easily by "sugar free" or "NutraSweet" clearly printed on the label but for some reason, the FSA allows products to contain sucralose (a.k.a. Splenda) without any clear labeling at all.  You must read the ingredients to learn these nuts contain both sucralose and acesulfame potassium, two artificial sweeteners.  Shame on you Emerald! 2
I had never tried this type of product before and got it because I was curious after reading the reviews.  I am not an Expresso drinker and I think I was in for a bit of a shock with the taste.  It had a 'pop' to it, but I found it to be bitter for my tastebuds.  I tried it room temperature and chilled, but neither one really appealed to me.  I would not say it was distasteful by any means, and for the person who enjoys this type of drink, it most probably would be quite good.  I did not experience an unpleasant aftertaste, but I did experience a lingering one.  For me, a person who enjoys a mild cup of coffee with raw brown sugar and cream, no :) 4
Nifty hot chocolate discs added to your warm milk or milk alternative is simply yum! Made in Ireland so you know the chocolate is high quality.<br /><br />Ingredients for those that desire it (I think it should be a requirement on any listing):<br />Milk chocolate 29% (sugar, whole milk powder, cocoa butter, cocoa mass, emulsifier:soya lecithin, flavouring: natural<br />vanilla), Cocoa mass 25%, Invert sugar syrup, Sugar syrup, sugar, water, preservtive:sorbic acid), Sweetened condensed<br />milk (milk, sugar). Milk chocolate contains 32% cocoa, solids minimum, 20% milk solids minimum.<br /><br />Shelf life is about 18 months. 4
Perfect size sea salt for the table or the picnic basket.  We love it. Shakes well, no clumping and flows freely. 5
I love Hunt's sugar free vanilla snack packs.  I frequently take a cup of raspberries or sliced strawberries and mix them with a pudding cup for a tasty, low calorie snack that keeps me satisfied between meals.  The cup itself is 60 calories and when paired with a cup of fruit you are looking at a 100-120 calorie snack. Each cup also has the equivalent of 10% of your daily calcium. It doesn't get much better than that.<br /><br />Eaten alone, the flavor of the no-sugar added cups is not as intense as the regular Hunt's pudding cups.  With my preferred way of eating the no sugar added cups, I don't even notice.<br /><br />I like that these are shelf stable and can be left in an office drawer when the need for a snack hits.  They are a good treat for those who enjoy pudding and don't mind a flavor that is a little less intense than the regular Hunt's pudding cups.<br /><br />It should be noted that most grocery stores carry the Hunt's snack packs for the equivalent of .25 a cup. 4
It has been no problem to use it but there are not any date of production or expire.<br />Amazon sent me them again but still no date.<br />I can not understand. I just gave up... 2
An average formula.  I would compare it to the same quality as other Store brands on the market.  It mixed well, and my son did not have any adverse reactions to it. I would buy it again, at the right price.  I paid $7.00 for it. 4
I have used this in coffee, oatmeal and yogurt and it has a good toffee flavor.  However, it is not as sweet as other stevia products; I find myself using a squirt of it instead of "just a few drops" as it says in the description.  I would still recommend it though because it is a lot less expensive than other stevia flavorings I have found. 4
First off, these cashews are huge -- the biggest I've seen. And they taste good. What bothers me is that, for this much money, I want absolute perfection and they fail in that regard. For the price a lot of broken nuts and "nut dust" just aren't acceptable and that is what I've seen in three cans (I wasn't hasty in my judgement). For a similar price-per-ounce I can buy smaller but always-whole-never-smashed nuts locally that taste just as good and that is what I'm going to do from now on. 3
This is good as it doesnt have any sugars added. However i found young brand coconut juice better, it does have sugars added though. 3
I ordered this product knowing that my cat loves Newman's Organic Turkey formula.  However, he refuses to eat it, and I am concerned that there is something wrong with this batch. I have offered it to him over a several week period thinking he would change his mind, but no luck.  I usualy have good luck ordering from Amazon, but this time I am totally frustrated not being able to speak to anyone.  I would donate the case to an animal shelter, but I am afraid that it could hurt the animals.  You see....I unknowingly fed another pet bad canned food a number of years ago, and there was eventually a recall.  Later she had health problems, and I believe it damaged her kidneys.  It was, in fact, a high quality pet food, so one never knows. 1
I bought 3 bags of this tea and found each to be just as bad as the last.  This tea has a very weak/poor flavour.  I tried to brew it very stong but it still ends up tasting bad. 1
This tea is strong and has a smoky flavor - you can feel the leafy greenness though. It's not very bitter. I think it's a bit expensive for it is - but I haven't found a replacement. I guess we're paying for the fancy packaging, which in my opinion is a real waste, especially when you go through 3-4 cups a day like I do. Ahmed's Gunpowder green tea is stronger and is pretty good, but is available for cheaper than Dilmah's in the local Indian stores. 4
The taste is better than Captain Crunch because it is not soooooo sweet, however, this cereal gets really soggy.  I know it doesn't boast that it stays crunchy even in milk, but it gets soggy as soon as you pour the milk, and I am not exaggerating. 2
I bought this cat food at Tractor Supply. My cats hate this food. They won't eat it.<br />It is so hard my cat's have a hard time trying to eat it. My cats are very unhappy with this food. I would not buy again. 1
Since a lot of allergy issues stem from what dogs are being fed, this is an excellent treat for your allergy prone dog.  You'll know them by their skin and ear issues.  While most dog treats remind me of beef jerky, these actually remind me of wheat granola bars.  They are medium sized bars that are scored in the middle so you can break them in half.  I have 3 dogs of all sizes:  110lb Chocolate Lab, 15lb Miniature Pinscher, 1lb Chihuahua.  All three dogs love this treat.  I give the whole piece to the Lab and then break another in half and give 1 half to the MinPin and the other half to the Chihuahua.  The first two devour this treat in seconds but it takes the Chihuahua half a day to make it through the treat.  I think that's good.  It gives him something to do and it'll clean his teeth too.  The treat is very crumbly if they break it apart.  My dogs always clean up the crumbs afterwards, but probably shouldn't feed this treat to them on the carpet.  All in all - I would highly recommend this product as a good, healthy, tasty treat for dogs that is hypoallergenic and can help break the tartar off their teeth.  It smells very clean and fresh, like a granola bar and the dogs love it! 5
These sugar pearls are used for makign Belgian "steet waffles" common in the 18th century, (and now resurrected by foodies).  The waffles are properly called "Gaufre Liege" and are made using this type of beet-based sugar pearls which melt and carmelize using a dough recipe.<br /><br />The more common gooey batter Belgian Waffle recipe is called the "Bruxelles" type, and it would be very odd to use these sugar pearls when preparing them.  Ordinary Belgian "Bruxelles" waffle batter can be made perfectly using common cane sugar. 2
These haven't been available at the stores near here, so I took a chance ordering them. I'm glad I did. When I just want a little chocolate flavor, this is a crunchy and tasty alternative. And they're really good with peanut butter sandwiches--just sweet enough but not overpowering. 3
I bought this thinking some of the reviews were old and must have changed the formula by now.  Wrong!!  I don't like the taste and probably will throw two full bottles away - I was using the DaVinci Original sugar free and that was very good, will go back to that brand and buy it at Sam's Club. 2
After finishing off a box of these over Labor Day weekend on the road, my husband and I agree that these are tasty snacks.  I will buy these again.<br /><br />I'd categorize these as soft and crumbly after the first bite.  It's predominantly an oatmeal-chocolate-coconut taste although I will admit I thought the chocolate felt more like raisins the first time.  These are not so heavily sweet, either as many standard granola bars are. Best of all, there's no chalky aftertaste.<br /><br />Each bar has 180 calories, a nice pick-me-up after my morning cappuccino. 5
These are good, but a bit skimpy on the candy coating. The ones I get at my supermarket have a thicker layer of "yogurt" coating, but the store doesn't carry them that often. So I keep these on hand just in case the urge strikes and my local store is out.  I love the combination of crispy/salty pretzel with creamy yogurt-flavored candy coating. 4
I love walnuts so I thought I would save some money and buy them here in bulk. But what an unpleasant surprise. These were horribly stale and had a very distinctive bad bad bad BAD taste. I had been told that Emerald nuts were very good and maybe I just got a bad batch(of 6 canisters?? unlikely). But I will definitely never buy these again nor will I ever recommend them to anyone. 1
I tried to like these, but they were just COVERED with salt and mostly pepper, way, way, too much.  I ended up using them in stir-fry and didn't have to add any salt and pepper to the dish!!  I don't recommend them at all unless you REALLY like lots of seasoning (and I THOUGHT I liked salt!). 2
This is one of those matcha that you will want to have around for the kids, their friends, and when you want to make smoothies, or have a sweet treat. Its not my favorite from Red Leaf but its not bad at all it just reminds me of circus peanuts. Do you remember those things? Sort of like slightly hardened dried out marshmallow like candies. We used to get them at the dime store. Remember when we had "dime stores" ... haha anyway I do enjoy this tea - takes me back to the good ol days, and really where they all THAT good? Oh well the point is - this is some good stuff and I do like it but its more of a banana candy like flavor rather than fresh ripe banana but at the same time I just don't know how natural of a banana flavor one could possibly get - I don't know if I have ever had a better banana flavor in a tea or anything else for that matter that was not a banana itself. I think that banana flavored things always tend to have that slightly strange flavor to it.<br />Now, this is where things get really good ... I mixed my banana matcha with macadamia nut matcha to make a banana nut like matcha and it was excellent! Made a smoothie out of it that way too! It was QUITE yummy! 5
I thought for sure that our dog was going to inhale this food.  He will pretty much gobble up just about anything you put in front of him so I fully expected Chef Michael's Gilled Sirloin to be a hit with him especially after seeing so many reviews saying that their dog loved this food.  I was shocked when I gave it to our dog and after chewing the first bite he actually spit it out.  I tried getting him to eat more of it but he wasn't having it.  I guess there is something out there that he won't eat. 1
I've always enjoyed the original Zico coconut water, but thought I'd give some of the other flavors a try. The mango flavor really jumped out at me because I love mangoes and thought coconut and mangoes would perfectly compliment each other. Unfortunately, the Zico drinks with "natural mango flavor" taste like someone dropped a mango flavored hard candy into my Zico drink. It's not terrible, but that's definitely NOT the refreshing flavor I was hoping for, especially after a hard workout! I think I can manage to power through the remaining 11 drink boxes I bought, but I won't be wasting my money on this drink again. 3
Since airplane meals are monopoly priced with a 90% probability of nasty, these 'energy' bars have become something akin to an MRE for the coach traveler. The varieties are endless and variably convenient and satisfying. These are quite good by comparison. Far more chocolaty then most, they are a bit disturbing in appearance resulting in the 4 stars but certainly a good choice. If the child that might sit beside you were to ask "what are eating?" the answer could determine the balance of the flight because the child will have a predictable child-like perspective. 4
I've tried a bunch of them and the taste of this product is outstanding.  Even the folks behind the counter at my gym commented on it and they sell a competing product.  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed. 5
It's really, really sweet, as are most Stevia-based sodas.  I'm not a fan of sugary stuff in the first place, and this just ruins it.  It does taste like root beer, but like I said, way too sweet.  Diet A&W is much better. 3
When I received my latest order, the bag said "36 count" but there are only 12 K-cups inside.  That makes this very very expensive coffee. 1
First, I love Spry gum...high % of xylitol per serving, no gross/weird ingredients, great flavor. The flavor may fade a little faster than some conventional chewing gums, but it's better than consuming the carcinogenic, disgusting artificial ingredients they use. Also, this is an amazing value for Spry gum...previously I was ordering the 100 pc. tubs from a popular online herb store; that worked out to about $1.10 more per 100 pieces. At local health food stores, a 100 piece tub is even more expensive at about $7-7.5 each before tax! This is a good value anyway, as I have seen tubs of conventional chewing gum cost more than this per 100 pcs. The only thing is, I can not tolerate the cinnamon flavor for some reason! I can eat cinnamon no problem in other foods, but this gum triggers canker sores for me. I keep forgetting that and order it now and then because I like cinnamon gum, but it's really a bad idea for me :( 3
I honestly don't care for the taste of the white cheddar. It was too bland and chalky for me (not smooth and creamy). My husband is finishing the case for me since he is not picky about food as long as it is made for him. The shells were yummy and when cooked long enough I found them to have a nice consistency and were tasty without the white cheddar sauce. Don't forget to mix the power and the milk together before adding the pasta, I know it is on the box but who takes the time to read the box? 3
There is nothing but a strong clove flavor to this tea.  I have had better chai teas with more subtle flavoring.  The Yogi brand is a good one.  If you love clove, then this is your tea.  Unfortunately, I don't. 2
Rosamonte Especial can never let you down. Tastes fresh and strong. I smell Argentina in every sip. Yerba mate is going through an increase in prices, almost double..crazy. But it's worth the value. I will never change Rosamonte ESPECIAL! 5
I wanted to try a flavored coffee pod for my Senseo machine.  I purchased hazelnut and was disappointed that I couldn't taste any hazelnut flavor at all!  It doesn't taste bad, but it tastes just like regular coffee with no hint of hazelnut.  What's with that? 2
This coffee doesn't smell like butter toffee, it just smells like "flavored coffee" which to me all smells very similar no matter what it's supposed to smell like--pecan praline, blueberry cream, amaretto, even "Norseman Grog" which is a combination of vanilla, rum and caramel.  They all smell pretty much the same to me, even different brands.  I was hoping this one would be different because of the high reviews, but it isn't.  I gave it two stars because the coffee itself is good and not bitter like some. 2
I saw the name "Chips Ahoy!" and thought of delicious, crispy chocolate chippy goodness. Alas, these don't live up to the brand name.<br /><br />I rarely buy storebought cookies, honestly, so I really looked forward to trying these as a treat. Here's my two cents:<br /><br />1. The allegedly mega fudge filling is not very noticeable except as a faintly chemical, chocolate-like slime. Minifudge filling would have been more accurate. The last two days were quite warm and the cookies became almost liquid on contact with warm fingers. Quite a mess, especially with kids. In short, the gooey filling seems to me a gimmick.<br /><br />2. The cookie part tasted like fake chocolate, which was a turnoff for me. I love chocolate like nobody's business, but it has to be GOOD chocolate (which this was definitely NOT.) A chocolate candy bar of almost any kind would have been more satisfying.<br /><br />If I want a tender cookie, I can make better ones myself from scratch. If I'm going to buy a chocolate chip cookie, I'll stick with the original crispy Chips Ahoy. 2
This taste of the wild mountain feline formula is available at the local Tractor Supply company here.  I usually get my cat food and bird seed there, and decided on my last trip to give my kitty a treat with something special.  It's expensive as wet cat food goes, but I figured how could I go wrong with something with a name like this and a lion on the can.  I picked up three of them.  Unfortunately, my cat was not impressed by the price, or the label, for she sure didn't care for it to say the least.  I was really surprised actually, for unless we're talking about the very cheapest store brand of wet food, she usually isn't all that finicky a cat.  But this stuff didn't cut it with her at all.  Even after giving it to her again a couple of days later, and then leaving it out.  I ended up giving it to my neighbor who has three cats.  They ate it, but according to my neighbor they didn't act like it was exactly fine cuisine either. They ended up eating about half of it over a couple of days. I realize that a test with only 4 cats isn't all that comprehensive, but the consensus was the same nonetheless.  None of them liked it.  I suggest if you favor the idea of this stuff that you either try your local Tractor Supply and buy just one can, or better yet, forget it.  For the price you pay and test results around here, in my opinion it's nothing more than overpriced substandard fare in a flashy can... 2
I really love these.  They are fruity and tasty.  I received them fresh.  The only problem with buying such a big bag, is that you must put them in something to keep them fresh if you are not going to eat them right away.  These are also nice to fill canning jars and put a bow on them to give as inexpensive gifts. 4
I actually purchased a pack of NongShim Spicy Chicken bowls (pk of 12) from a local warehouse in my area.  Ever since college I've been a fan of these "cup of noodles" style meals during late Autumn and Winter.  Makes for quick alternative meal that warms you up.  How does Nongshim's spicy chicken version stand up against other brands I've had?<br /><br />Pretty good actually!  Each bowl contains a fairly large amount of noodles, compared to the cup variety.  The noodles are your typical standard dried Ramen noodle.  I am not a big fan of microwaving these products so I make mine by boiling water.  Just put some water up to boil, open the package and add the "flavor pouch" or Soup Base, add boiling water to the fill line and wait 3 minutes.  Instant hot soup with noodles.  While the noodles are standard , the broth is really good.  It has a lot of flavor to it and a good spicy kick to it.  Put the two of them together and you get a very satisfying meal that will fill you up, and wake you up.<br /><br />Despite having a good spicy broth and making for a  filling meal... This product does have some CONS I am wary of.  For one the product contains almost 1800mg of sodium for a single bowl.  This is insane!  Most of these cup/bowl of noodles are overloaded with sodium to begin with, but it still needs to be pointed out.  The fat content is a bit high also, at 14g for an entire bowl.  Another problem I have is that most of the products I've tried usually come in a sturdy container for your product.  Nongshim's Spicy Chicken Bowls come in a flimsy plastic bowl.  It works fine but once prepared I would definitely suggest carrying with two hands, as it has a very cheap feel to the bowl.  The price per bowl is also a bit expensive.  At the warehouse I purchased this, I paid $9 for 12 bowls.  I could of paid $6.50 for 24 cup of noodle varieties.  Compared to the cup variety, you are paying a premium for these; And while the bowl produced better quality broth, I don't see it being worth the price increase. (12 bowls = 24 servings.. $9 for 24 servings.  the cups were $6.50 for 24 servings.. so basically $2.50 more for bowls vs cups)<br /><br />OVERALL I would give this product 4 stars.  Despite having a flimsy bowl, and incredibly high amount of sodium the product makes up for it in the overall quality of its taste and sheer volume of noodles.  You get a big meal here that will both fill you, and warm you up.  It has a really nice spicy kick to the broth that lingers without becoming annoying(see NOTE).  I've always enjoyed spicy foods so having a few of these laying around the house helps if I just want a quick meal.  I would not recommend eating these everyday, in fact maybe I tend to aim for one a week.  Products like this are not exactly the healthiest alternative meal for you, but if you need a quick emergency meal these are a good alternative.<br /><br />NOTE: The product contains chicken but I really wouldn't call it chicken.  You might find a few tiny little bits of re-hydrated chicken<br />NOTE: I do not use the entire flavor/soup base packet.  The amount of sodium it contains is ridiculous!  I use no more than 3/4 of the packet.  I tried using the entire packet once and it made the broth start to taste far too salty, as well as making the spice in the broth overpower rather than compliment.  Don't be afraid to use less of the packet... 4
I always stock a variety of items on my kitchen shelves that might be used as an instant lunch in times when I'm in a hurry and don't have any time to prepare things. One of my long-time favorites is the Maruchan Instant Lunch cups and I presently have the beef flavor. They also come in several other flavors. The cost is minimal. They're real easy to prepare real. Just peel back the top, add hot water and let it set for about three minutes. Have a few things like cheese, fruits, meat along with your noodle soup and, viola, an instant lunch. Works real well and is tasty. My only reservation is the very high salt (sodium) content. It's listed at 1,200mg, which is about 50% of the daily recommendation. In one serving! Wow! It's an easy and quick lunch, but you'd better watch your other salt intake.<br /><br />Gary Peterson 3
I've tried a few different Kitchens of Indian packets, but this was my first time trying the Pav Bhaji.  The curry itself is just a thick, chunky paste with mashed veggies in it, so I added some frozen carrot medallions and peas to bulk it up a bit.  I also added about 1/3 can of vegetable broth to help cook the carrots and peas.  Finally, I sprinkled in a pinch of red pepper flakes to give it a kick.  After about 20 minutes of simmering, the curry had cooked back down to its original consistency and the carrots were softened.<br /><br />I ate it over Basmati rice and it was delicious.  The curry is very buttery, and the added ingredients gave it a good kick and some extra flavor.  Overall, I would recommend it if you're willing to add some of your own ingredients. 4
I have tried Herrs, UTZ, wise, pringles, lays etc....but Kettle tasted the best. The quantity of salt used is the optimum which is required.<br /><br />Although they say serving size 1 ounce, you will finish the whole packet in no time. Total calories is 300 for 2 ounce bag. This is slightly on the higher side. But still it is ok, as they have not compromised on the taste.<br /><br />Only issue was that all packets have some burnt chips, which taste bad. Kettle should take care when packing to ensure no burnt chips are there.<br /><br />Thanks to Amazon to get 24 bags for just 12 bucks with free shipping using their coupon. 5
These are not awful if eaten with a cup of tea, coffee or milk -- but they are very dry if eaten plain.  I do like how they have less sugar than most granola bars and are not a choking hazard for toddlers like hard snacks can sometimes be.  I am a fan of the oatmeal raisin mini cookies, and of the regular size EB cookies, but this flavor tastes very fruity to me and not very chocolaty.  I think the double choc cherry tastes better than these.  Happy to have them for last resort snack-on-the-go needs, but not my favorite. 3
Both my wife and I have been using this product for well over a year. We love it! It is one of seven or eight varieties made by this producer. Recently, each of the other flavors have been available at our local markets, but, for some reason, these markets have been unable to obtain this flavor. I was excited to find it on Amazon.com, and obtain a generous supply with no hassle, and with convenient shipping direct to my home. Comparable products don't seem to have the same flavor or consistency, and this one, mixes well with any number of cheeses and/or jellies/jams at snack time. 5
To be honest, although I've always enjoyed anything with Paul Newman's name on it and have always reordered things, this time I would not. I really like coffee. This reminded me of instant. 1
A very interesting and fun way to spend an evening. The tablet itself has a somewhat tart flavor, we sampled everything from cottage cheese to beers to fruits to salt and vinegar chips to warheads. Some differences were astounding, some not so much, great little adventure for your mouth. 5
I have to completely disagree with a previous poster who said that Earth's Best has an unappealing smell and taste compared to Similac Organic. Similac Organic tastes terrible, and smells like spoiled milk when mixed. If you're wanting a quality organic formula, go with Earth's Best. My baby has terrible gas on Similac Organic, and the only reason we buy this, is when we've run out of Earth's Best and have to order more and are in a pinch. Furthermore, Similac Organic doesn't dissolve and leaves a very nasty residue on the inside of the bottle and nipple. It's gross if you ask me. I gave it more than two stars only because it's tolerable. 2
This tea brews very easily in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002LVU9D4">Oster BVST-TM23 2-1/2-Quart Iced-Tea Maker, Black</a> tea maker.  The brew is strong and the flavor is good.  The blueberry isn't my favorite flavor of tea, but that's just my personal opinion.  The tea itself comes in nice big brew bags and smells amazingly good. 4
Let me preface this review by saying that in the gluten-free world, baked goods tend to be a bit on the crumbly side because they are missing the "glue" (gluten) that holds them together.  Taking this into consideration, Nana's gluten free cookie bars are one of the tastiest gluten-free treats and one of the only brands sweetened with fruit juice instead of sugar.<br /><br />At only 130 calories, 4.5 grams of fat, and 7 grams of sugar (natural fruit sugar), the Nana Banana flavor of cookie bars makes a great treat for kids and adults.  The amount of banana is just right, and you even get a few tiny bits of crunchy banana inside.<br /><br />Each cookie measures approximately 3.5 inches long by 1.5 inches wide...perfect for a light snack or dessert, especially for kids.  Amazon has the best price around on Nana's Cookie Bars, so rest assured that you are getting a good deal, even though they are pricier than "regular" cookies made with corn syrup and sugar.<br /><br />Good cookies aren't cheap, and cheap cookies aren't good!  Give Nana's banana cookies a try.  (No, I don't work for Nana's but am a happy, loyal customer!) 5
I was drawn in by the Spartan graphics, but,I<br />like this product much better than the more well known competitors.<br />No overpowering "sweettart" smell or taste.<br />Good balance of sweet and sour. No after taste.<br />Doesnt leave your stomach upset.<br />Only requet is for a no calorie version. Great job!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004RBG322">Spartan Energy Drink</a> 4
I purchased this popcorn because, as a Chicago native, I've been craving great Chicago-style popcorn. It's good for packaged popcorn, but it's not up to the quality of Nuts on Clark or Garrett's, the quintessential Chicago brands (both of which sell their popcorn via mail-order). On the plus side, this popcorn does have a long shelf-life, it's crunchy and isn't greasy. It is moderately cheesy, but it's not as cheesy as the classics -- you won't find your fingers coated with yellow cheese-dust after eating it -- and it's actually less cheesy than a commonplace grocery-store brand like Smartfood. It's certainly edible, but I won't be buying any more, and I would recommend looking at other brands instead if you've got a cheese-corn craving. 3
Have a 6-month old black labrador.  She destroyed toy in less than a week.  When the container broke, it was very sharp. 1
Being new to the K-cup world, this variety was a good introduction to the flavors out there.  However, my husband uses it mostly, gravitating to the strong flavors and there are no decaf drinkers in the house - so we are waiting for guests to comment on those. 3
I think it tastes too dark.  I prefer Donut Shop Coffee from Coffee People.  Medium color and bold.  This stuff tastes burnt to me. 2
These noodles are not made in Thailand as the website, states, but in China! I advised Amazon of this, but they have yet to change the advertising, so buyer beware. If you prefer not to eat rice products from China, do not purchase these noodles. 1
As advertised, Crunchy Nut smells and tastes like peanuts -- something I don't find very appetizing when mixed with milk and ingested in the morning. I eat peanuts with beer at bars, not at breakfast. I'm guessing that the honey is supposed to cut the flavor of the peanuts, but it is hardly detectable.<br /><br />People will of course disagree with my thoughts on peanuts in the morning, but let's take a look at the side of the box.<br /><br />To keep the calories per serving at 100 (without milk), Kellogg's has shrunk the serving size to 3/4 of a cup. That means with milk, a bowl of Crunchy Nut is going to be 300 calories or slightly more. So if you go back for a second bowl, that's a pretty high caloric breakfast. Further, the base ingredient is yellow corn meal, which doesn't have much nutritional value.<br /><br />While there are certainly much more unhealthy cereals out there, in this day and age I'd like to see a more healthy, lower caloric cereal. 1
If you have recently been on a lower carb eating plan such as The New York Body Plan <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002FL5FD4">The Ultimate New York Body Plan: Just 2 weeks to a total transformation</a>and found you really feel better eating less starches than you had in the past, finding healthier carb choices to add back to your diet can be a challenge.  I really am grateful Kashi makes this bar.  It has 19 g of carb, 7g pro, 4 g fiber, 5 g fat (mostly from nuts and seeds).  It's fairly balanced, has no artificial ingredients or sugar alcohols, and really hits the spot.  I've tried all the Kashi varieties, and this remains my favorite.  My mother agrees.  If you're looking for a sweeter treat, this is not the Kashi for you, however. My brother thinks they taste like cardboard.  In any rate, the Amazon price is still higher than the grocery store price.  I'm hoping it will drop soon. 5
OK, you may have tried the regular Shirataki noodles.  They have a texture nothing like a noodle.<br /><br />These Tofu noodles are excellent!!  I purchased them and have used them with tomato sauce, Asian dressing in a cold noodle salad, and also in a fritata with eggs and sauteed veggies.<br /><br />Just rinse under cold water for 2-3 minutes, then microwave for 2 minutes, pat dry and go for it.<br /><br />Amazing! 5
This is not real beef broth, It is vegan. (the label says so)<br />I TBS (table spoon) contains 250 mg Sodium ! although beef bouillon is probably the same.<br />Maltodextrin is listed twice, as the first ingredient and as the fourth. maybe a typo?<br />It doesn't say what TYPE of maltodextrin (wheat,rye,oat,rice) so it probably contains GLUTEN.<br />Also contains SOY. Soy is a poor substitute for beef.<br />Contains Hydrolyzed Plant Protein! which contains MSG! even tho the label says no MSG!<br />Not a bad price for cheep soy broth tho, If you don't mind MSG.<br />If they would label the type of maltodextrin and drop the Hydrolyzed Plant Protein then it would be a good (but cheep)product. As it is I cant tell if I'm allergic to the malto or not, and I don't like MSG. I wont be buying this again.<br /><br />To be perfectly honest I can get MSG laden Mexican bouillon at Walmart for 65 cents!<br />In four different flavors! Beef,Chicken,Ham,Chicken and Tomato!<br /><br />Updated 03/29/11 3
I was trying to increase my consumption of coconut products without increasing my intake of sugar.<br />Unfortunately this pina colada mixer has ~ 22 grams of sugar (sorry I don't have it<br />in front of me, but it was way over what I allow in a day), so I won't be buying it<br />again! 2
This tastes terrible. Even the powdered hot cocoa mixes where you can pour hot water taste a lot better (and cheaper)! 1
I bought a case of jalapeno chips as I love that flavor. This product is good but does not taste like the other jalapeno chips on the market (Lays, Ms.Vickie). I am now used to this flavor and eat it as it is healthy but wish it had that addicting jalapeno flavor that the other ones on the market have. 4
Very good waffle mix.  Simple and turns out the same every time.  Healthy and comparable to any more expensive mixes.  Just follow the easy instructions and enjoy the results. 4
I purchased this item when it was on sale.  I wasn't certain if I'd like it but I've read so much about the health benefits of green tea I wanted to try it.  This is a nice, pleasant beverage. The flavor isn't too strong.  I add a packet of Splenda to make it a bit sweeter.  The powder dissolves easily in cold water.  The flavor is natural not fake.  I was impressed enough with it that I have signed up for auto-delivery. 4
I'm recently widowed so have to learn to fix for a single person. I hoped this microwaveable bowl of "Beefaroni" would provide a tasty lunch. To my surprise, I found that it was nearly all macaroni, with some tomato sauce and a very small amount of beef. The taste was OK if you like macaroni and a rather strong tomato sauce, but I expected more beef. Also, as with so many canned food these days, be prepared for a high dose of sodium -- salt, that is -- 31% of average daily requirement in one small serving. Overall, no so good. 2
This is basically candy masquerading as a "healthy" snack. They taste good - because they have three different kinds of sugar in them! Blue Diamond  wants you to think that eating sugar is a healthy snack - c'mon!<br /><br />I purchased these thinking they were sweetened with stevia. Yeah, there's a miniscule amount of stevia (very last ingredient) - but sugars are the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th ingredient listed. These have corn maltodextrin - the worst thing there is on the glycemic index (can you say fat formation?). Now I'm stuck with 3 containers of this sugar snack. 2
I do enjoy most of the Popchip flavours.  This one has a nice balance and I don't get tired too quickly of this flavor.  Better than the jalape&ntilde;o flavor, but I still prefer the multi-pack. 4
I'm a fan of Larabars and the peanut ones are my second favorite.  All of them have only a few ingredients (less is better) and no preservatives or additives. Although I was quite surprised by the price of a box of 16, which pretty much equals over two bucks a bar.  My local grocery store sells them for one dollar, thirty-nine cents.  The health food store sells them for a dollar fifty-nine. That can mean a lot of savings. 4
Chips Ahoy, chewy oatmeal cookies are so moist that it is difficult to separate a single cookie from the package without it breaking into pieces.  My tastebuds say they are too sweet, not cooked enough, lack ample chocolate chips and oatmeal flakes.  If you like cookie dough, you most likely will enjoy these.  I'll stick with a crunchy, less sweet cookie. 2
This product had live insect larva inside the nuts.  The nuts broke to pieces when squeezed with the fingers.  I do not recommend this product.  I have filed a claim for my refund as Frontier has not returned my messages. 1
I'm a noodle lover. Can't live without noodles at least once a day. I have more than a dozen different types of noodles stocked in my pantry & I love trying new ones too. I've a subscription to 30 packets of Nong Shim's Gourmet Spicy noodles & was expecting this to be much better. Really, the taste is great. Same type of noodles, texture, etc..same spicy flavor packet but there is another packet of soup seasoning included. There's no dried vegetables packet like the Gourmet Spicy flavor has. No dried vegetables flakes & no beef chunks like the description stated, thus false marketing. The price is too much for this. If this is the new & improved Gourmet Spicy noodles, I'd give it 4 stars. I took off 2 stars because of the unworthy price tag & another star because of the false marketing. I read a comment reply in another review here - A Korean reviewer... I agree entirely. Big hype & price tag but disappoints. I'll stick to the Gourmet Spicy if I were you. Worth the try but not 24 packets!<br /><br />Edit: Not false marketing since it seems like only the very first packet had no dried beef & vegetable so I changed the rating to a 3 star. However, the beef "chunks" are just flakes. Not enough flakes to notice. There are also dried mushrooms. Now, the mushroom pieces are bigger than the ones in the Spicy Gourmet vegetable sachet. Still, not impressed. 1/29/2012 3
I ordered a 12 pack for $24. Pretty expensive considering its a bulk order.<br /><br />I rolled the dice on this flavor. I dont care for it at all and its only 20% coconut water (from concentrate)<br />Maybe the other flavors are better, but I wont be paying another $24 to find out. 2
Not bad, and perfectly drinkable, but bland with no liqueur. Not as bitter as some Columbians I have had, but that, unfortunately, goes back to the 'bland' bit. 3
I have ordered this gold-bears with another bag of raspberries, both are 5lb bags. When they arrived, the gold-bears bag was taped together with a clear tape. I had originally thought it was just a random piece of tape. When I looked closely, I saw the bag was cut open and the tape was sort of holding all the bears in. The bag must've accidentally got cut opened at some point and taped together before it was even packed for shipping. I was disappointed. The shipping package was not damaged at all. So it looks like some one in the Amazon packing department decided that this is safe to ship this to the customer. I contacted the customer department and they were easy to work with. I needed the candy for kids' party, they offered to ship one-day but I didn't want to risk for another damaged bag. Maybe next time I'll think twice about buying a big bag. 3
Not only does this flour have the advantage of being organic (which is of questionable significance) but it has made my pizza dough and waffle batter much better than with previous flours. I am not sure if it justifies the high cost and I am not sure I will continue to use this flour due to the cost, but for now I am enjoying the benefits. 4
I ordered this product with the expectation of receiving a fresh product. There were clumps in the individual cups that didn't dissolve in the hot water coming from the machine. Other K-Cups that I've purchased are all powder, but the Cafe Vanilla had problems that you could hear when you shook the cup. With the clumps not dissolving in the water, the flavor is more watered-down than it should be. I have used other products from this same line of K-Cups, but this was sub-par to any other K-Cup I've ever purchased. 2
I like Special K, but this product loses its crunch very quickly. It turns starchy and is like eating sweet mush. I won't be ordering this again. In fact, I will probably throw away the few cups I have remaining. 2
I've been gluten-free for a little over a year and I've struggled with finding tasty and affordable alternatives to my favorite foods. The great thing about this mix is that it's really easy to make, affordable, and the pancakes are so tasty, my children do not object to eating them--saving me the time of making two batches of pancakes. If they didn't see me eating them, I don't even think my kids would notice that they are eating gluten-free pancakes. 5
Is not bad but is not that good neither, for me it taste like a cherry juice, the taste of the black cherry is strong very strong sometimes taste like fermented cherry I didn't like the flavor. 2
happy to find this product available<br />shipping was prompt but shipping package came open in transit and1/4 of shipment was lost 3
I was expecting something that tasted more like the traditional CHIPS AHOY brand cookie.....This is something akin to a Frankensteinian mishmash of SOFT BATCH cookies and semi-hard fudge. The cookie itself isn't bad, but it's amazingly crumbly. The few packages I tried were practically all crumbs, with very few whole cookies in them. The fudge center was FAR from "Gooey", it was more like a melted piece of hard fudge. The concept is nice, but the execution is terrible...... 2
Before my husband retired, he would bring these alfajores back for me when he went on business trips to South America.  I would, however, request the box that contains only the chocolate-covered ones.  The meringue-coated alfajor has a shorter shelf life and dries out more quickly.  (The "mixto" box featured here on Amazon has 6 chocolate and 6 meringue.)<br /><br />Besides beautiful architecture, irrigation systems, science, mathematics and medicine, another great contribution the Moors made to Spain (and hence to Latin America) was the "alfajor".  It's a sandwich cookie like no other.  The cookie itself is flaky, soft and delicious and the filling is "dulce de leche", a yummy, soft, spreadable caramel.<br /><br />Of those alfajores I have purchased, Havanna's are the best and when I say this I am referring to the chocolate-covered ones.  Unfortunately, the price here is exorbitant for a box of 12 cookies but, of course, that's a great reason not to eat too many at 375 calories each.<br /><br />The chocolate-covered Havanna alfajores are a 5-star treat.  I gave this lower rating to the Amazon offering because this is the assortment box which is only half chocolate and also because of that high price. 3
The thing I like most about this brand of hot chocolate is that once I remove it from the keurig, it doesn't leak all over the place.  For some reason, all the hot chocolates I've purchased before leak all over when you remove them from the coffee pot.  My coffee doesn't do that so not sure why that is.  This is a great deal for the amount you get as well, and taste yummy! 5
I order the 192 box of these every month.  I'll get them the same time of the month for a couple of months and then they send me an email that they have canceled my order due to payment problem and I have to reorder and loose a month.  I don't understand since I havent changed my address, card number or anything. Does anyone else have this problem? 5
I had such a hard time with this fondant.  I have used Wilton for years and have done many good things with it so I decided to "step it up".  Boy am I sorry I did.  I had a 4 tiered anniversary cake to do in ivory.  I HATE coloring fondant so I figured this was as good a time as any to try a new fondant that was already colored so I ordered Satin Ice (...or SATAN Ice as I now call it).  I took it out of the tub and set it on the counter.  My 9 year old twins both said WHAT is that?!  I said "It's fondant!"  Having seen me work with fondant for many years, they both said "It looks too GOOEY to be fondant!!".  Boy... even at 9 they are VERY observant.  It was very easy to roll out, but getting it ON the cake was a different story.  When I picked it up to put it on the cake it fell apart in my hands.  I attempted this 4 times.  Finally I put wax paper underneath it, rolled it out and flipped it onto the cake.  Easy enough.....or so I thought until I saw all the wrinkles transferred from the wax paper...back to the drawing board.  I ended up putting wax paper underneath, rolling it out, putting wax paper on top, flipping it over, THEN putting it on the cake....only to find that it still tore in the process.  UGH.  I'm exhausted!!  Never again. 1
The local auto shop offers this free to it customers. I've tried it twice and liked it both times. Perhaps, if I had to pay for it, I might not love the price, but I would still enjoy the flavor. 4
After finding the right way to brew this coffee - as strong as I like it - , I realized that there was nothing extraordinary about the flavor.  It's not completely bland, it just doesn't have anything special that would make me want to buy it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Organic<br />- Part of the money goes to a good cause<br />Cons:<br />- Nothing special in the type of roast.<br />- Too high price.<br /><br />I'd rather stick to other brands that I like better than buy Marley coffee. 3
I've tried many kinds of protein bars and these are by far the worse tasting.  I'd never buy them again. 1
Bought this for my boyfriend after he had to have more. It was better cost-wise to buy this for him. He loves them.<br /><br />Only drawback, we've already found several wrappers that are sealed, but with nothing inside. Sort of disappointing, but I suppose it happens on occasion. One bag alone with several is a little upsetting. 4
I use baking soda for a LOT of household things (cleaning, cooking, personal care, etc).  I was first tempted by this seemingly economized 12 pound bag.  However, when I compared to the smaller containers at my local grocery store - I realized this was not the best way to purchase baking soda.<br /><br />Right now for 12lbs of the generic brand (12, 16 oz. boxes) I would pay just 10.68 (13.08 regular).<br /><br />For the A&H brand I could buy 12lbs in the following ways:<br />12, 16 oz. boxes for 13.80<br />6, 32 oz. boxes for 10.62<br />3, 64 oz. boxes for 8.97<br /><br />That's nearly ten dollars less for the same amount of the same product.  Although the bag is probably more convenient than 3-12 boxes - the boxes are recyclable and the bag is not.  Just some things to think about! 3
regular Spam is awful. almost inedible. I would give it 1 out of 10. tastes like filthy animal flesh. you KNOW what I mean; you fellow Spam haters.<br /><br />Turkey Spam is pretty good; not great. I'd give it 7 out of 10. it's worth a try if you haven't. 3
These chips are good. Not the best thing I've ever tasted, but pretty good. The first couple bites are confusing and strange but it gets better. They get really good after the first ten. I got my box of chips yesterday and I've already eaten two bags. They are yummy. Much better for you than regular chips. I don't feel guilty at all for eating so many. The bags are a little small though. I'm still debating on whether or not twelve small bags of chips are worth $25. 4
I wasn't crazy about the Chicken and Broccoli Skillets Dinner Kit, but mostly because it only had a tiny amount of broccoli. I added a package of frozen broccoli, and that improved things considerably. I wish it had a bit less sodium and whole-grain pasta, but it isn't bad the way it is. The Velveeta that was included did improve the overall palatability of the dinner. 2
At my house, I am known as the Cookie Monster. I love cookies and bake cookies, too. Chips Ahoy! (original) are one of my favorites.<br /><br />However, these are quite disappointing. The packaging size and pictures are very misleading. The cookies themselves are scarcely bigger than those "toy" cookies you get at McDonald's. See my customer images.<br /><br />As far as chewy and gooey, I would call them more like soggy. The "fudge" was a not-too-sweet and not-too-flavorful layer of filling in the middle which simply tears apart. See my customer image. They seem to be rather crumbly and mostly held together by their oiliness.  Compared to the Chocofudge variety, this Megafudge looks better but really doesn't taste any better.  In fact, I'd give a slight edge to the Chocofudge.<br /><br />Finally, a serving size is a laughable 2 cookies. These are so tiny, I easily ate four of them which is two servings at 150 calories an 7 grams of fat each serving. For a rather unsatisfying 300 calories and 22% of the USRDA of fat intake, I could definitely do better.<br /><br />I hope you found my review and customer images useful. 2
Buttons were much smaller than expected and did not receive before St Patrick's Day even when I requested priority delivery and was willing to pay for faster service.  No response from seller when asked if shipment could be rushed. 3
I ordered six jars of these. The taste disappointed me. Two of the jars arrived broken and I was give a refund for the two jars. I guess with the taste problems I'll try a different product. 2
I have tried a couple of the Switch drinks now and as far as I'm concerned they have a great flavor. It is important to serve them ice cold. One of the cans I drank sat out of the fridge for a while before I cracked it open. It was still cool, but there was a distinct difference in the flavor from the ice cold version and not for the better. The carbonation is subtle and the sweetness is light and appropriate for the drink. I took off one star for the value of the drink. They are a little pricey for the size of the cans. 4
Salt tastes fine, cant say about the health claims. 3 stars is because of the packaging. The grinder top is too large for a comfortable grind. I have fairly large/strong hands and have a hard time turning the grinder. For me, when the grinder is mostly vertical to 45deg, it is difficult/impossible to grind directly onto food. Works fine if cap is left on & held in a horizontal position & them remove cap & use. The grind gives a nice fine grind (better than my OXO I also got at Amazon). 3
I bough this as a stocking stuffer gift for Christmas. Was very disappointed in how tiny the item actually was. Felt item had been overpriced once received. Also felt item's shipping cost was overpriced for an item that was so small and shipped in a small envelope. 2
I was ver disappointed when I opened this to fine that I paid almost $10 for a container of grits that normally cost no more than $3  plus the package didn't have a invoice or return label. 1
Stuff inside is good. But olive oil containers should be dark to block sunlight. And I prefer glass containers to plastic. 3
This is not what I was wanting. I am looking for old original Chicken Noodle soup. It had thin vermicelli noodles and chives chopped up in it. This needs a lot added to it to make taste like it should. 2
If you're looking at this you probably already know you like these chips.<br />This is a great deal and I have not had any problems with them going stale.<br />The 1oz bags are a great size for a snack and help avoid over-eating. 5
My Dog loves Dogswell Happy Hips duck breast strips.  I put a couple in his kong ball and he plays and plays.  One of his favorite treats.  good for him and not fattening. 5
I love this stuff!  This is my favorite of the flavors I have tried.  I do feel like I have to add quite a bit of chocolate powder to get it to the flavor that I like, but that is okay.  I'd take this over any of the other stuff any day.  Swiss Miss is for the kids and this stuff is for me.  My husband loved the milk chocolate...until he tried the amaretto.  I just stick with this because I haven't found that I like the others as much.  Even though I don't like the others as much, all of the Stephen's cocoa that I have tried is the richest out there.  It doesn't taste like I mixed it with water at all. 5
Popped and tasted fine.  The corn is smaller that traditional yellow, so they tend to fly out of an air popper quite a bit.  The shipping and handling is what makes this a less than desirable deal.  Not worth $10 for 2 pounds of this popcorn. 3
i have enjoyed this product for quite some time.  however, i am disgusted by the fact that the price keeps increasing!  at $35 per case, customers are paying more than $4 per box for 5 small cookie bars - ridiculous!  i will find a healthier, more reasonably priced snack to munch on. shame on nana and amazon. . . 1
I had been feeding them Pro Plan for years, but when they were both diagnosed with dental fissures a couple of months ago, I started researching brands that would be easier for them to eat.  This kibble is made smaller and breaks apart easier than the other brand, and they both love it!  I had tried high end brands like Wellness, Core, and a few others in the past, but they wouldn't go near them.  I do feed them canned also.  I think that a combination is best for them.  The vet couldn't believe that they're 15 years old, so I must be doing something right! 5
Let me say I like a medium roast coffee.. and this is NOT a medium roast coffee. I would call this Light or very LIGHT.<br />This comes as indicated in the description in single coffee pods for use with Single pod coffee makers.<br /> I notice when I opened the package the coffee smell was missing.. Now I don't know if that is particular to this type coffee or if my package had a little age on it.. I even opened a 2nd package to see if my first didn't get punctured accidentally.. but sadly it wasn't..<br />  I even brewed this in my  single serve coffee maker on BOLD setting.. but it just didn't do anything to improve it.<br /><br /> I do support the concept of this coffee company but this particular type of coffee is not to my taste.But saying that  everyone has their own taste when it comes to coffee and tea so this is just my PERSONAL OPINION AND TASTE.. Just to be fair I am a regular Dunkin donuts whole bean user so that is what I am comparing this coffee.<br /><br />Sadly I won't be ordering more of this particular version but will see what other flavors they may be selling at this company But if you like your coffee LIGHT this might be a version you would enjoy, it just didn't do it for me. 2
The price certainly is right but for our two dog's (Lab and German Short Hair) chew treat experience nearly half of the chews are too large and much too thick. In competitor's products there are always some of the large/thick chews that I need to cut in half using a tin shears. With Green Cow many chews are so thick they will have to be sawed. We will use them up eventually but I have cancelled my subscription for periodic repeat orders. Just didn't work out for us!! 3
The Buffalo Bills "Honey Pepper Beef Jerky" is a very tender and good tasting snack. The honey flavor is not overpowering and the pepper adds a nice "bite".<br /><br />My only issue is that it does contain MSG (which I didn't notice until ater I ate it), so be advised if that is an issue for you.<br /><br />A very good tasing, high quality jerky! Recommended. 4
My rating of 1 Star does not reflect my opinion of Peppadew peppers, it is intended to cause Amazom (and Divina) to edit their ads for the 70 oz. package to identify this 70 oz. package of Peppadews as either mild or hot. This is important, if not critical information to the customer when deciding whether or not to purchase this item. 1
I LOVE this stuff for grilling steak!! Pat the steak dry and then lightly spray it with bourbon. Sprinkle the seasoning to your taste - I like lots of seasoning, remember you will lose some while grilling. Flip the steak and do the other side. Let it soak while lighting the grill. Just before grilling, lightly brush the steak with melted butter - be careful to not remove the seasoning! Make sure the grill is REALLY hot! Sear the outside and spray it again with a bit of bourbon. Flip the steak and do the other side. Flavor is similar to the Bourbon Street Steak at Applebees. My opinion is mine is a little better . . . It may take you 2-3 times to get it down pat but it is SO worth it!!! 5
This would be a great value, but the coffee isn't very good.  It has a nice high roast but it does nothing to enhance a not very good bean.<br /><br />I suspect the cause is the freshness of the beans.  They have oil but their flavor is odd and unpleasant.  You can create a coffee that smells fabulous when high roasted, but high roasting won't cover up an unfresh or not good bean. 2
if you are a fan of lime this is the tea for you. a really bright flavored tea, very very good! 4
These crispy squares are lamb lung.  Our older golden retriever doesn't care what they are, he likes them so much he actually dances around when we get them out!  Even the cat loves them and comes running for a few crumbs when we open the bag.  Our dog is a somewhat picky eater so sometimes I shave bits of these treats over his dry dog food and he loves it. 5
In the box you get yer dried elbow macaroni, an envelope of "seasoning," and an envelope of squishy Velveeta "cheese sauce."<br /><br />The box is a bit of a deception, as the contents easily would fit in a smaller box.  A bigger box conveys the expectation of a bigger end-product, right?  And of course a bigger box stands out better on the store shelf and offers a lot more copy space for that crucial moment when you have to engage and convince the consumer.  Mmmmm, pretty golden-yellow colors, and red cursive-y lettering, with a photo of noodles as big as my fingers...<br /><br />I followed the on-box instructions explicitly.  Well, okay, I admit it, I used 1.37 pounds of hamburger instead of the stated 1 pound.  All glory and praise to Odin that there were no adverse effects!  It all turned out just fine, basically just like the photo on the front of the box, neither watery/runny nor dry; everything glommed together just right.  The stated "makes about 5 one-cup servings" is about right.  Now, Kraft came out with the "family size" <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019RLJV2">macaroni n' cheez</a> kit way back when, and I'd argue that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5RRA">Velveeta</a> (a Kraft brand) would want to do the same thing, and it might even help actually fill up this oversized/underutilized box.<br /><br />I didn't add anything to the recipe, as this was the first time with the product, and I was cooking with this review in mind.  As for taste, it was just fine.  Nothing special, but not bad.  Now, did this taste like "ultimate cheeseburger?"  No, not at all.  That's because there was no bun, mayonnaise, pickles, mustard, or grill-charred meat with a slick slab of melted cheez atop, all of the things I put on a cheezburger.  I did go with the "customize it!" advice on the back of the box and had some chopped onions, diced tomatoes and chopped lettuce on hand, which was a nice addition to the product, more than anything lending it some crunch, and a nicer range of flavor.  One could really go nuts and drop some salsa into the mix, or even saute' some fresh broccoli or carrots with the hamburger.  Now we're talking a meat n' cheez dinner creation that's a lot more interesting and certainly more tasty.<br /><br />If I were to use this product again--and this might be a good thing to put in the copy on the package--I'd cook some diced onions with the hamburger, and/or some chopped mushrooms.  This would bulk up the servings somewhat, and definitely yield more depth of flavor.  I added no spices to the product, and it was accordingly bland.  If I were to cook this again, I'd add salt, pepper, some caraway seeds, maybe a bit of rosemary and most definitely some garlic and a little bit of red pepper.<br /><br />Yes, it was ready in about twenty minutes, as the box copy promised.<br /><br />Yes, I'd use this product again, but I can't say I'm going to go out of my way at the store to find it and buy it.<br /><br />I do like the TV ads for this product, though, funny and original.  Let the smiting continue!<br /><br />Bottom Line: this is another offering in the great American <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4IQ6">Hamburger Helper</a> tradition.  It's a one-pan dinner that's really easy to make and takes little time.  Following the instructions yields a passable main dish that while not bad, isn't really that interesting and offers some nutritional value.  The kit does offer, however, a foundation upon which one can experiment and improvise to create more varied mealtime indulgences. 3
this coffee has a very funny taste to it not good you would think wolfgang it would be good dont buy this coffee this is a review of 6 people there are 6 people in my shop we all hate it not good 1
like eating soft plastic . we pored them in a big pile in the back yard under the trees. the squeals wont eat them! 1
This brownie mix doesn't bake at 7000 feet altitude, but it works super well as chocolate/chocolate chip cookies. Makes 24. 5
So if you read the reviews, you'll see that some people thing these things are great. Many otehres cant get over the texture, and the initial smell is ... bad. I was able to wash out the smell pretty well, leaving a very mild fishy mildewy aftertaste. The texture... awful. Nasty. Chewy fishy pasta. The only good thing I can say about this stuff is the individual bags it comes in are really small -- about single serving size. So I've got a bunch I can inflict on my friends if I can trick them into trying it. 1
Few things are as enjoyable in life as freshly popped pork rinds.  Modern technology has enabled us to produce the epitome of snack foods in a hot, fresh version.  I will be relegated no more to the listless depths of popped corn.  Pork rinds are the ultimate man chips. Very similar to microwaved popcorn, you just shake the bag and put em in your microwave for about 2 min and voila, hot fresh pork rinds.  When you pop them you have to get accustomed to the fact that they don't "pop" like popcorn - they just crackle a bit.  So it is a bit hard to tell when they are done and usually through trial and error you will get the perfect time depending upon the type of microwave oven you use.  Mine is 900W and takes just under 2 min. A couple of pieces will get burnt, or as I affectionately refer to as char. The bag will inflate slightly.  When they are done, you open it up and you are greeted with an aroma that is bacon heaven.  Put one in your mouth right away and it will stick to your tongue like a live octopus.  They are a bit salty so they make the perfect accompaniment to a nice cold beer.  I didn't find them too spicy, just enough.  If you want to be creative, you can throw em in a bowl right after they are done popping and throw some salsa verde or any other kind of salsa you have.  You will be greeted with a chorus of wonderful snaps like getting sizzling rice soup at a Chinese restaurant.  Throw on some shredded cheese and the result is "man nachos".  My wife thinks that it is utterly disgusting, even though that hasn't stopped her from eating them.  Trust me, they are delicious, but don't let em sit too long or they get soggy. 5
I was so excited thinking they had my favorite discontinued Kettle flavor, but was disappointed when I opened the box and found this substitution. I am keeping them but would not have ordered 15 bags of this flavor. It is a very good bbq chip but I could get this flavor at the grocery store. Why oh why do my favorite food items always get discontinued??? The one star is for the substitution. The country bbq is a 4 start chip, but not the chip I longed for. 1
When I ordered this I wanted whole chia seeds.  There was nothing in the description indicating that I was ordering anything other than whole chia seeds. The product that arrived at my house was milled chia seeds.  This was not what I ordered and not what I wanted. 2
I had never had Mallomars before so I couldn't resist tasting them.  These are definately delicious cookies.  The cookie part is sort of like a chocolate chip cookie without the chips and then there is marshmallow and chocolate coating.  Very good.  But they are fairly fragile cookies.  They fall apart a bit when you take a bite and since these were shipped to me, half were already falling apart before I could take any bites. 4
My dog loves these snacks and they don't have artificial ingredients.<br /><br />They come in a resealable bag which is good - they do get a bit hard if they are not kept sealed up. 5
Sent this to my mom for Mothers Day - she got a limp 3-color arrangement that was far from the photo! I won't do that again! 1
With a variety pack I received about 7 of these k-cups. I tried the first one and it was very bitter. I let my mother in-law to try it separately without knowing my feelings about it and she said to me the same think.<br /><br />I tried over 50 different varieties of k-cups but this one definitely take the 1st place of the worst taste and the most bitter flavor.<br /><br />This is the first time I write a negative review and it is disappointing but my hope is that maybe they can do something to fix that problem with their coffee. 1
great product! wish they were still available in bars,pubs,and stores.have given cans to several of my golf buddies and they agree with me. i'm just glad they are still available on line. 5
We really like Tully's Kona Blend in the K-Cups!  It's hard to find inexpensive 100% Kona coffee anywhere, so I usually order the K-Cup blends that are available either on Amazon, or at our local commissary, because I really love the unique flavor and aroma of Kona.<br /><br />I think that Tully's is a quality brand of coffee in general, but the Kona is my favorite.  It's delicious: rich, smooth, nutty, the flavor and aroma make a great start to my day.<br /><br />Definitely recommend! 4
What's to say about Oreos?  The originals are still the best & I don't get them often because gluttony overcomes me.  One, two, or even a few isn't possible for me. 5
Piece of artificially flavored garbage. Good teas are made by celestial seasonings and tazo. Not bigelow.<br />It does not taste like raspberry 1
I really like Earth's Best Baby Foods and Amazon, but these jars were packaged so that glass touches glass... this may not be worth the good price.<br /> The jars arrived all wrapped up in bubble wrap, but 2 of the 8 jars were broken inside.  It was a big mess to clean up the broken glass and baby food.  Also, per the amazon return policy, grocery items are not returnable. 2
I also tried the Cherry Chocolate and Peanut Butter Cup flavors and they are amazing!  So thick and creamy, especially if you make it with a little milk!  What I really like is that they aren't overly sweet, and that it mixed together very well, unlike most brands that just clump up and stick to the spoon.  Definitely my favorite hot chocolate!  The cider flavors are great too! 5
The Emerald Cocoa dusted almonds were tasty.  The cocoa did not overwhelm the nuts and make them sweet, but rather added just a bit of background interest and flavor.  The almond taste still came through and continued to have the appropriate amount of saltiness.<br /><br />Although the taste was wonderful, you did have to get by the fact that they looked liked "dirty nuts".  Knowing what they were before you ate them helped.  I would not buy these on a day to day basis as they are fairly pricey. I do, however think they would be a hit if placed out on a party tray.  They were excellent with the red wine that we tried them with! 4
I'm somewhat of a foodie/food snob and this ghee is excellent as well as containing all the health benefits that ghee should contain.  The cows are grassfed which means more of the fat burning, cancer fighting CLA, they use non-homogenized milk (which is linked to heart disease) and tastes amazing!  I'll be buying more of this! 5
Ads a very pleasant taste to my stir fry experience. As tasty in my home cooking , comparable to that in a chinese restaurant. A product that I will always keep on hand for my cooking pleasure. 1
I like these peanuts. What impressed me most was that there was an oxygen scavenger inside the tins thereby maintaining the freshness. Also, the manufacturer recommends storing the peanuts in a refrigerator which I think is a good recommendation especially since peanuts are prone to becoming rancid.<br />However, I would like to add that since these are lightly salted peanuts and if you are used to eating the regular salted peanuts, there is a marked difference in taste.<br />A beautiful package too. Recommended! 5
recently tried the choc raspberry k cups.  I am not fond of the flavor.  It smells delish, but, definately not enough chocolate flavor for me.  I find that by combining a hot chocolate k cup, along with a bold coffee, I get the desired flavor that I enjoy.  For someone who enjoys a hint of flavor, the VH chocolate raspberry truffle k cups would be excellent. Thank you. 3
My first impression of Wheatena was that it tasted like coffee grounds. But then I realized that if they were more filling I would in fact enjoy eating coffee grounds. Wheatena is clearly an acquired taste. Furthermore, the claims of this product being healthy are somewhat neutralized by California's claims that roasted grains cause cancer. Wheatena is a nice change from oatmeal, but it is not as wonderful as the reviews of Wheatena devotees would have you believe. 3
I gave this product two stars because it did seem to keep unpleasant odors at bay. However, the actual scent of this deodorant was unpleasant itself. It was just an odd smell on the skin. In the applicator, it was fine, but on a few different people ( who rubbed it on their forearms to test), the scent was not a good one. I did not like the way it reacted with me. It also gave me an itchy rash so I had to give up on it. One person said it smelled like urine,not good at all! But I didn't give it one star only because it seemed to do its job by keeping away the BO, I think. 2
This product is indeed fabulous and you can get it at many grocery stores for a lesser price.  Overall a great product and makes awesome red sauce!  TO SQUISM:  I find it very disturbing that you casually refer to hitting your wife, even if you are joking, this is not the place for that sort of behavior!!!!  If you really hit your wife your a punk coward.  Domestic abuse IS NOT a laughing matter and I was personally offended by your review.  Try to maintain some amount of class when posting on here.  I am sure that is something you are incapable of doing, judging by your disgusting and classless review. 5
I am so totally satisfied by Hodgson Mill products & I probably have purchased > 100 loaves at this point.  I used some as a present to my brother with good results, too.<br /><br />Never have I seen "old" smelling mix nor have I ever had a yeast failure.  Their taste & texture is wonderful. Never have I had a "slicing failure" where you can't get a slice to hold together long enough to lay it down. The different types lend themselves well to adding ingredients such as Chopped Nuts or Sesame Seeds or Millet Seed or - - use your own imagination.  Coming in nice units of 6 loaves makes pantry storage easy, and once opened, the carton yields 6 boxes with "Best By" dates easily accessible on each so rotating your shelf stock is almost "goof-proofed".<br /><br />Next time you walk a grocery store, note the prices there! Here again, I think you really can't beat the quality with a really fair price that Hodgson provides.  It seems to me that they have expended great effort to have the best product they can produce & the best shipping available for their customers.<br /><br />Buy with great confidence based on my experiences with them during the last 2-3 years.  I hope this helps decision making. 5
I've tried ever single brand of K-cup hot chocolate and this is absolutely the best one. It is the only one that actually tastes like the real stuff. 5
I am a long-distance runner and a belly dancer.  My back objects to the dancing and my knees object to the running.  I was having a lot of trouble managing my pain and still doing my activities with ibuprofen alone.  I read about tart cherry juice in my running magazine, and I decided to give it a try after reading some of the other reviews here on Amazon.<br /><br />I am simply blown away by the difference!  My body really reacts to this stuff.  My knee pain has disappeared, and my back only hurts during really deep back bends.  I had same-day relief, too.  I can definitely tell the difference on days where I forget to take this!  As an added bonus, I have noted a marked decrease in how sore my muscles are, as well.  I wish I had heard about this sooner!<br /><br />I follow what it says on the bottle, 1 once twice daily.  At first, I was just using a tablespoon and licking it out of the tablespoon (2TBS=1 oz.), which I still do in the mornings, but good lord this stuff is tart!  The first one isn't too bad, I think mostly because your taste buds are in shock.  The second one really gets me, though!  Lately, I've been mixing my ounce into a cup of orange juice at dinner, which looks disgusting but tastes, surprisingly, really good.<br /><br />I really hope this product comes back in stock soon, I don't think I could go without it and I'm hesitant to switch to a different brand. 5
These things are awesome. Period. I started replacing one of my floss filters with this medium per one of the girls at my local pet store, trying to remove tannins from my driftwood. This does so much more, and is super efficient. For tank critters with super clean water requirements, these are a must. Only wish they weren't so expensive. 4
The flour is amazing but the customer service sucks. I have emailed and called the company numerous times with no response. 3
I purchased this storage drawer so that I could better organize my mass of K-Cups. It currently sits underneath my Keurig. It looks very nice and does what it is supposed to. It is a simple design and while it doesn't save a lot of room, it doesn't take up much room either. 4
I picked up a bag of these in NYC and ate them on the train home. I liked the flavor a lot, and the fact that they have less guilt in them than other options like potato chips. When I got home, I could not find these in CT, so I bought a case on Amazon. I have shared several of the bags with friends and everyone loves them. I highly recommend these chips (if you must have chips, that is!!!) 4
I love this tea although I haven't had it for a while now.  After a few days of having the decaf tea with breakfast, I was getting a headache that couldn't be knocked out with Tylenol (my go-to-headache reliever).  I stopped drinking the tea and haven't had a headache since. According to the website, chemicals aren't used in the decaf process,so, I doubt it is the decaf.  The orange flavoring is natural,so maybe it's the artificial cinnamon flavoring??? I don't know, but I will experiment with it again when I don't mind having a headache!  It sure is good tasting tea, tho, and the shipment was on time & well-packaged.  I'd buy it again, if it didn't give me headaches!! Maybe I should try the tea with caffiene ???!! 4
someone had made a comment that you could not taste the chocolate due to the overwhelming clove. this is a good tea. i only gave it 4 stars because you do taste the clove pretty strongly. however, i happen to like this and think the tea tastes great. i am only posting this to say: if i do not add sweetner i only taste spice. ***but if i add a little sweetner, i notice that it brings out the chocolate flavor more. ***  happy national tea month!  enjoy! ~ jane 4
looking for an edamame product to try ... this is NOT the one ... cardboard would have more taste, and it is in no way crunchy with the consistency being similar to "puffed" cereal products ... I'd still like to find a edamame product that is more than just attractively packaged 2
I discovered this item from a segment on the local news.  I decided to give it a try.  Firstly, they didn't prepare me for the fishy smell once you open the package.  I had to rinse it several times to get rid of the smell.  Also, be aware that the texture is definitely different than egg noodles and they have no taste.<br /><br />I boiled them in hot water, added some beef base, and the noodles were fine.  The noodles absorbed the taste of the beef base, but use whatever you want with them. 4
Probably 60% of the bags I popped in the microwave did this thing where the popcorn would stick together in the middle  of the bag and burn all but the outer edges.  Not planning to buy this ever again. 2
Of all the sugerless stuff in the world, this hard candy is a miracle in taste. Can't work out why so many outlets have stopped carrying it, but it is worth more than a casual glance. 4
This coffee is not a true medium roast like Caribou French Roast, Donut House, etc. there was not much coffee flavor at all. I found it to be so weak in flavor that not only did I have to go down a brew size, but I also have to add less milk just too drink it. I will never buy it again. Wish I didn't have 45 more cups to go thru! 2
I am having probs with the cooking. They come out all fluffy and in 20 seconds suck back into themselves and get all hard. I've tried less time, more time and cooking them out of the bag on a paper towel... Dunno what I am doing wrong, and the company doesn't have any contact info. As for the taste..they're Alright..Waay salty and I'm a salt-a-holic!<br /><br />I wouldn't buy again :( 2
The Coffee maker is o.k.  but we are annoyed to find that the only way to get refills in on-line.<br />Calls to Nescafe's customer service assure us we can get them at Walmart - NOPE! 2
This is an instant powder that you mix with hot water.  The strongest flavor by far is ginger, which has a nice, powerful bite to it.  Behind that, I can taste some lemon and honey flavors, and the aftertaste is mostly lemon and honey.  The lemon and honey has a little bit of an "artificial" taste to it, but not terrible.<br /><br />This would clear your sinuses well, and if a drink made from a lot of ginger and a little lemon and honey sounds good to you, you will probably enjoy it.  Still, I think that I could do better with real ginger (either grated or jarred), lemon juice, and honey. 3
I want to start  by saying that if I was reviewing the food alone, it would get 5 stars easily.  It's a quality product and my picky eater cat (as in, he would literally rather go hungry for days on end than be coaxed into eating something he doesn't like) loves it.<br /><br />Having said that, I won't buy this (or any other canned product for that matter) from Amazon.com anymore, unless they were to significantly change their packaging method. Normally I only review a product all on its own because other factors are incidental, but this time it seemed fitting to comment on shipping too because it drastically affected the overall quality of the product and is an unavoidable part of getting it to any customer.<br /><br />The product arrives in a small cardboard flat with 2 layers of 12 cans each, then the whole thing is shrink-wrapped in plastic.  Then they put it in a shipping box and put 3 air pillows on top.  Exactly 1/2 of the cans arrived dented (the entire bottom tier of the flat), many of them so badly that it looked like they had been run over by a car.<br /><br />Amazon.com customer service is great and responsive - they shipped the replacement out with complimentary next-day shipping... and it arrived in exactly the same condition.  In the end, I got everything I paid for, but 1. do I want to go through this every time I order it? No.  And 2. it's hugely wasteful because of course the dented cans are unusable because the seal could be compromised, offering the perfect breeding ground for botulism.<br /><br />I can fairly say that this is typcial for canned products in general from Amazon, too.  I've gotten black beans, kidney beans, chick peas, tomato sauce, and tomato paste from them, and there wasn't one order among them that didn't have the same problem.  Again, customer service was great and sent quick replacements (again with a high damage rate), but it's not worth the hassle and waste.  If it ever occurs to them to pad the entire order and not just the top of it, I'll return to using them because the free shipping and convenience of subscription auto-order (and subsequent additional savings) really are nice. 2
I have always used Giorgio Mushrooms, one cause they were a product of the USA!  I ordered the organic ones for the first time & they are just as good!  Will continue buying Giorgio's products! 5
I love Cashews, but this product SUCKED! It had too much Pepper. I washed them off and put them in the toaster oven to freshen them up. Now they are semi descent. 1
Great old time soda I drank as a kid that is no longer sold in Massachusetts. Was great to find it at a good price! 5
This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. 1
This took over a week to receive so if you have an ill cat choose another source. This one is too slow. 1
Oh my gosh, these are gross. I bought them because of Hungry Girl's glowing recommendation...and I gotta say, she steered me wrong this time. These are SUPER salty, and they taste like what I imagine dog kibbles would taste like. 1
I have always enjoyed Newman's Own products including the doggy treats but this chocolate didn't do it for me. Could be my aging taste buds but we all taste differently and this didn't excite me. Wasn't a bad taste just kinda bland, not exciting. 3
I bought these from a large chain pet store. after reading the reviews I checked the bag... made in China. I threw the whole bag away. I wish I would have read the reviews first! 1
Sure, I could have gone on a food crusade at the local grocery to find a similar product. But I don't think I would have found a product as good and tasty as Dr. McDougall. The noodles are quick and easy to prepare and above all else tasty enough to satisfy my appetite. I was surprised that there were enough peanuts in every bite just like at a Thai food restaurant. Overall, I'm pleased with my order and the quality of the product. 4
I cannot say how much I love Kettle brand potato chips. Kettle brand has a large variety of unique flavors, and the quality of the chips themselves blows all other potato chips out of the water. The ingredients list is printed on each bag and the only thing really bad for it is the oil they are frying the chips in. I love that these aren't filled with nasty chemicals. I ordered the cheddar and sour cream krinkle cut ones which are great but I was torn between the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048IFUSC">Kettle Brand Potato Chips Fully Loaded Baked Potato, 2-Ounce (Pack of 24)</a> and the Jalapeno flavor. While I know the jalapeno flavor is good but this is way better. They include liquid smoke instead of actual bacon which I'm fine with since I've a vegetarian. I ordered this to give to guests coming from out of town for my wedding this spring and I can't guarantee how many I will have left. My fiance and I love these. The packaging is perfect for anyone who is giving these to kids to take for school lunches, or handing out in gift bags, even just for portion control. 5
I have a 10 pound Yorkie who admittedly destroys most toys we give him.  I thought this toy would be an exception based upon other reviews.  He has a ball that he rolls around that dispenses food and seems to enjoy it and it has lasted longer than most of the other toys.  For this reason I thought he would love this toy.  Less than 36 hours later he became so frustrated in not being able to get the treats that he tore the rope in two. 1
These K-cups are good when they don't explode - but a lot of them have exploded during brewing and made a mess all over my kitchen. 1
These K cups are wonderful! We were pleasantly surprised with the low acidity and smooth flavor! The Rodeo Drive K cups are on our top five K Cup list! 5
This is the best-tasting brown rice I have ever had.  Kind of a nutty flavor.  This is the only rice I have ever had that tastes great all by itself. 5
I purchased these and once home ate them and experienced a severe gluten reaction.  On the bag in small print at the bottom it said they were manufactured in a facility with wheat and dairy.  The label also stated that routine testing occurs only to maintain gluten free label status.  Our bag tested positive for gluten which caused severe bleeding.<br /><br />Please be careful when buying this brand as the statement is for CYA and labeling purposes only.  That way they can charge more for the product. 1
Although the cereal is a great tasting cereal I gave this one star because the price of $41.50 that they are selling it for here on Amazon is rediculous!!! That's almost $7 a box. I don't know about you but I know I've never paid $7 for a box of cereal. Wal-Mart sells the 21 oz. (6 pack) of Life Cinnamon cereal for $19.68. Just make sure you shop around because when you see a deal that you think may be to good to be true, it probably is NOT a good deal. 1
These are greasy and not very good.  I suppose some people may like it but I  left them in our work break room so others would take them down.  They are beef and not a pork mixture so that's good for people who don't eat pork. 2
This is a delicious, easy, no-mess way to enjoy a "tea."  Great for on-the-go, as all you'll need is warm water.  I made the packet with 6 ounces of water, which produced a tea with pleasant sweetness and a definite ginger bite to it. The lemon is there, but a bit overpowered by the ginger.  If you like less of a bite, use 8 ounces of water. 4
After trying the Chocolate Peanut Butter flavored Arctic Zero which was pretty good, the Cookies and Cream flavor was a huge disappointment. As previously noted it is a strange color and the taste is absolutely nothing like Cookies and Cream. It is really sweet but in the worst way possible and I will not be purchasing this pricey product again. 2
I must be a bit of a wuss, because this soup tastes to me how I imagine fire might taste. Typically I like spicy food if it has a good flavor.  I don't find this to be the case with this soup. Any flavor is killed off by the burn. 2
Key lime pie is one of my all-time favorite desserts. When I heard about this gum I was definitely a skeptic, I figured it'd taste more like just a standard, citrus-y/mint gum. I was wrong! This definitely tastes like real key-lime pie filling: actual key-lime flavor with a milk-sweet taste that's not too overpowering. The flavor actually lasts for quite a while too (though it's much more powerful within the first 5 minutes). Try it! 5
Best mix on the market for making cafe mocha lattes, and we've tried them all 5
This coffee is great for the first cup, but quickly becomes bitter when left on the warming plate. I have liked other coffee from this supplier, just not this particular one. 2
I like keeping dry soups on hand on the pantry shelf.  I like soups a lot.  I also make my own soups.  But this soup is neither one I have had previously nor one I would have thought of making.  Always game to try a good soup, I ordered it.  It was a mistake.  It is not inexpensive and packaging suggests that one add mushrooms and further suggests that adding ground beef is a good alternative.  So I did ground beef and mushrooms (sauteed in my own butter per package).  The barley is not pearl barley, it is barley flakes, reminded me of oatmeal as it poured out of packing.  It was just a strange soup, nothing like anything I have ever eaten.  I think I will probably give the other three packages to the food bank.  If I don't, then the packages will next be tried as an ingredient in homemade meatloaf or meatballs which also is what I think the food bank would do with them.<br /><br />Two stars because the soup did fill me for lunch.  I threw the rest of it away. 2
I tried many gluten free breads. Flavor-wise, this bread is good. But the real issue I had with this bread is that it caused me quite a lot of discomfort because of bloating and gas. Yes, it's awkward to admit that, but I wanted to warn others from potential painful symptoms.<br /><br />I have celiac as well as ulcerative colitis, so my digestive system is sensitive. I bought the 6-pack from amazon, and with the first loaf I baked I thought the symptoms might be related to something else I ate. By the second loaf my suspicion grew stronger. With the third, I decided to do a little experiment and just eat the bread by itself and see if it's really the source of the discomfort/gas. The answer is yes.<br /><br />I should note that I did not have these symptoms with Bob's red mill<br />gluten free bread (which is also tasty). There is definitely something in Pam's bread mix that the digestive system of some people might disagree with.<br /><br />Hope it help, 1
These are delicious crackers which stay nice and crispy even in humid weather. Unfortunately this particular packaging seems very prone to breaking in transit. They still taste good but I think I will order them in the different packaging where they seem to transport better. 4
This is a very good cereal.  I like having an organic alternative to shredded wheat.  I like the texture and size of the biscuits and that it is lightly sweetened throughout.  What I don't care for as much is that this Kashi cereal is too "cinnamony" for me.  I don't fault the cereal since it is called "Cinnamon Harvest", after all.  However, I would prefer a more subtle cinnamon taste.  I like Kashi Autumn Harvest better. 4
I bought this as a birthday gift for my dog.  The plastic is pretty thin.  He loves tennis balls and playing fetch, so I thought it would be a great brain teaser.  He figured out how to lift the doors to get at the tennis ball, but when he goes to grab it, it ends up rolling back into the trunk and over to another hole.  Then he just gets irritated.  It slides easily on the hardwood floor, so he ends up pushing it around the room trying to get the ball out.  We put it on a rug to keep it from sliding around and then the doors don't open as easily.  I'm going to try to put some rubber slip grip stuff on the bottom to see if that helps keep it in place on the hardwood floor better.  He tries to dig the tennis ball out of the top opening since the doors don't work too well and then he ends up knocking the whole top portion off. 3
I went online to find the Zico Passion Fruit coconut water and found that amazon had it for the cheapest price. afte trying the regular, passion fruit and mango I would have to say the regular is my favorite, mango second and the passion fruit last. the passion fruit just didnt taste very good to me and had a defining artificial taste. 3
I did not find this drink anything special in terms of taste; the black cherry juice infused with carbonation gave an odd taste. Black Cherries are not favorite fruit; however I tried this drink but did not make any positive impression on me. The juice is quite acidic and you don't feel that there is 100% fruit juice. The drink comes in cans rather than glass bottle which would have helped the drink maintain the juicy taste longer. It does not have any preservatives and it is gluten free, no sugar and no artificial flavors. This drink doesn't have any special features and it doesn't stand out well in a market crowded with many drinks.<br /><br />1. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q3ECXM">Minute Maid Mixed Berry Juice, 24 - 10 fl oz Bottles, 240 fl oz</a><br />2.

I've been giving my daughter Gerber fruits, veggies, and meat as everyday-meals since she was 6 months old, thinking that she's got enough vitamins and prebiotics. However, she developed digestive problem and chronic constipation; she almost stopped gaining weight since she was 9 months old. I took her to GI and she told me that those packed fruits are all cooked! And there are additives to keep them fresh for long period of time! I started to puree fruits and veggies using Vitamix, and only use Gerber fruits&veggies when we are out and about. Now, after half a year of probiotics and wholesome food, she's slowly getting better and opens her mouth to food.<br />Now, think about this: if you puree an apple and leave it alone for 5 minutes, it'll change color due to oxidation. So, how can Gerber's apple puree keep the same color for so long a time? 1
After years of brandy-soaked Twinkies, I just tried one of these tonight.  Wow!  These are good.  My wife was right:  They're good.  But not so good you go crazy and eat the entire box.  It may be the whopping 3 grams of fiber in these tiny little things.  I think it's actually my stomach screaming, "NO MORE!  I CAN'T TAKE ANY MORE FIBER!  I'M GONNA BLOW!"<br /><br />They remind me of the homemade wholegrain hippy Eucharist from the late 70's and early 80's.  Heavy, moist, whole-grain goodness.  Takes me back to my Catholic school days.  They used to let us kids eat all the leftover homemade wholegrain hippy Jesus after a mass.  Good times. 5
It's not great plain, but it's wonderful mixed with other herbs.  It can be a little bland if you don't put anything but the rosehips in the infuser.  Hibiscus goes great with it, though.  It's a great tea for children because it's mild and fruity, for adults add it to something else.<br />Also, you can eat the rosehips after they've been brewed, sounds weird but they are great, they taste a little bit like an apple and have lots of vitamin C.  Watch out for the pith (that's the best word I can think of for the little hairlike thorns that surround the seeds), though, if you decide to eat the hips.  Every once in a while you find one that hasn't been de-pithed properly, hence you need to avoid the pith if you eat the brewed hips. 4
This is something I was looking for the office. They were affordable and great taste! They arrive on time too! 5
I am posting this because unfortunately Amazon does not show the label, ingredients on many items.  Since you can not see it, many would assume that this is just dried fruit.  It is not.  It is fruit dried with sulpher.  For some this may not be an issue (but you should know that it is there nonetheless).  I have developed sulphur allergies over the years (you develop allergies via exposure) and with more and more mass produced bulk items containing sulphur, likely many more people will too.  I have had some pretty serious health consequences of same.<br />We can get these locally very inexpensively (I am in Hawaii) and would never purchase this particular brand because of the sulphur.  I did buy it once without thinking, and they tasted bitter, acrid, nowhere near as good as we get in local shops, health food stores.  I realize that tropical fruit is not easy to get everywhere, but there are good healthy alternatives.  Consider, for example: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HN5O3C">Woodstock Farms Mango Slices, Unsulphured, 8.5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a><br />i was browsing here, hoping to get better prices (and access) on bulk dried fruit, but can see that the lack of labeling info is going to cause me a problem :(  I guess my only alternative until other customers specify what is on the label, is to buy things specifically labeled "unsulphured".<br />If you do not have allergiews or sulphur related health problems (yet) maybe consider comparing the 2.  Sulphured fruit is bitter, leaves a chemical aftertaste and is overdried making it taste a lot less fresh (which it generally is) and tougher.  In my experience, this particular product is the worst offender (at least that I have encountered).  It is heavvily sulphured and really tastes off. 2
Why would I sign up for drinks in the mail?  Twice now the containers were leaking.  Once more and I'll cancel this bloody subscription.  I don't even know who to complain to... 1
This is a good product, especially for iced coffee, but why is it twice the price as it is in stores?  This isn't a fluke--within the past two months I've bought it for $5 a jar in Seattle and in Nevada, so it just looks like good old-fashioned gouging.  Try harder Amazon. 1
I feel that the picture misrepresents the product that I received.<br />Approx.80% were black and 5% each of the other colors.Not good value.<br />Seller does not disclose % of each color so no recourse. 2
Let me start by saying that I have purchased Popchips for several years. I was even on Amazon autoship for 2 boxes every 2 months because we enjoyed them so much. That being said, I have been very disappointed with the last 2 shipments received. The barbeque had little to no seasoning on both boxes of both shipments. Not to.mention that the bags are now half filled with air. The bad thing about this is that both shipments came from different plants. I was so dissapointed with this last batch that I attempted to return them, but Amazon does not accept food returns. I have canceled both autoships and I won't buy them again until I am assured that this problem has been corrected. LISTEN UP POPCHIPS: YOUR LOYAL CUSTOMERS WANT THE PRODUCT THAT WE ARE ACCUSTOMED TO CONSUMMING. IF I WANTED ORIGINAL FLAVOR CHIPS I WOULD HAVE ORDERED THEM. I WANT MY BARBEQUE CHIPS TO TASTE LIKE BARBEQUE. YOU HAVE LOST A VERY LOYAL CUSTOMER WITH YOUR COST CUTTING EFFORTS :( 1
I was expecting a bit better after reading other reviews. This is about the same as any other hot chocolate made with water. I prefer making it with milk as the flavor and texture is much better. Adding milk didn't help much. I guess Mom spoiled me (good). 2
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AWBL82">Jack Link's Smokehouse Beef Jerky Strips, Wood Smoke, 30-Count Jar</a> These are the real deal when it comes to jerky. The whole family loves them. When the grandkids come over they wipe me out. The 2 year old looks for the container sitting on the microwave and says Paw Paw, Stick. These come once a month via the Amazon Subscribe and Save. Just another great quality Jack Link's product. One of the few companies that got big, but never sacrificed quality in the process! 5
I picked a can of this up on a whim at Big Lots for $1.30 and it is SO easy. I used one of those graham cracker pie shells, opened a can of this filling, and put it in the fridge. In four hours I added some lime zest and whipped cream...my friends did not believe how good it was for coming out of a can! I went back the next day and bought what they had left on the shelf. Highly recommended!! 5
This coffee was far from the worst I have ever had, but it was not very good.  It was more bitter than most coffee, and it had an acrid, thin taste to it.  At $12.25/lb (26.96 for 2.2 lbs) it is simply not worth the price. I can buy Peet's at the grocery store or online for $10/lb and it is superior in every way. 2
i have 3 cats here at home and they need to dosome grazing so i baught  this to see if they like it :) even though its just out grass lol 5
I had very high expectation with this product, but the first cup I gave my son, he got sick with the taste and then developed aversion towards all chocolate products. I am consuming this product for the family now. 3
You should monitor your dog very carefully if you give him/her these chews. One of our dogs died as a result of eating these chews, and the other three were very ill for two days. This product is very difficult for dogs to digest and can result in blocked intestines and infection. Since the package did not contain any warnings, we thought they were harmless. Be very careful if you buy these for your dog. 1
Packing for shipment was shoddy...  wrapping glass containers in bubble wrap is good.. but the bubble wrap should encircle the entire container...  don't leave the top and bottom unprotected... especially if you pack them in nice and tight to the corners of the box.. one good hit on the end of the box and you shatter the containers inside...  guess how I know this? 3
I have to admit, I'm no stranger to dog treats.  I've had about forty years worth of dogs, and they've all gotten one sort of biscuit or another, and I've tasted the varieties.  With only two exceptions I've not been able to discern any of the advertised flavors.  Neither peanut butter, nor liver, nor any of the assorted others.  The best biscuit I've tasted was given out at a neighborhood coffee spot.  The waitress brought it out to the table I was sharing with my good dog Sam, and asked me if I'd like to give it to him.  It looked an awful lot like the scone I had on my own plate, so I said yes, and waited for her to leave.  Once she was out of sight I tasted it, and if it wasn't the same as my scone it was darn close.  Since I had my own, Sam got his, but I have considered going back for coffee and a doggy treat sans doggie.  The other biscuit whose flavoring I could taste was baked by my wife and it was something like an over-baked crust of bread.  My good dog Shalako ate 'em up - I passed on future offerings.<br /><br />On to Newman's Own.  I'm a sucker for anything Newman's Own - not that I like everything the company puts out, but I appreciate the altruism - so I jumped at the chance to review Newman's Own Organics Lamb and Barley etc's.  Upon opening the package I was hit with an aroma.  Nothing that got my mouth watering, but very few dog biscuits have an aroma, so that was a good sign.  The biscuits were a good color - standard brown, but they didn't look dyed.  Another good sign.  What also surprised me was how solid they were.  Not at all crumbly, and it took a bit of effort to break it in half, even though each biscuit is scored for breaking.<br /><br />I put the first biscuit behind my back and changed hands a few times, spreading the aroma.  When I held my closed fists out for Sam to choose the one with the biscuit he sniffed both but fixated on the correct one right away.  It was that good aroma.  When I gave it to him I think he was as surprised as I with its hearty texture.  I could see it was a good tooth cleaner, and as Sam never gets animal bones, a good thing to have.  The next test was for him to choose from hands that each held a biscuit, one with Newman's, the other with another brand.  The strong aroma didn't work to Newman's advantage this time, and Sam went for the hand with his old familiar treat.  But as soon as he downed it he was sniffing around for the Newman's Own that I still held out in front of me.<br /><br />I don't know if these tests prove anything.  I skipped the human taste test as the biscuits are so durable I was afraid I'd crack an implant.<br /><br />I'd buy Newman's if I saw them, but not for myself.  I'd get them for Sam.  He's a dog who deserves a good treat. 4
I am a big tea drinker and LOVE Ginger tea b/c it works great for stomach sickness, queasiness, and overall digestive health.  I like the flavor of this b/c it's got a strong lemon flavor and it also smells wonderful, however, the b/c it's in powder form it leaves a little bit of a weird after taste and kind of coating in your mouth.  Overall, I would choose ginger lemon tea over this b/c tea has a cleaner texture and doesn't leave a coating in your mouth like this powder version. 3
fantastic!you can not beat this taste and you can not resist to it only one if you are spice lover 5
I purchased these for my wedding favors and they were a huge hit! The candied almonds were not too sweet and the mint green color is gorgeous. It was a whole lot cheaper to buy these on Amazon. 5
This is a nice big bag, well-priced, of flat rawhides.  If that's what your dog likes, these are perfect.  I'd given my dogs rawhide bones and twists before and they like them...but for some reason these flat rawhides aren't nearly as popular with them.  I have to put some peanut butter on them to get them to chew on them for any amount of time.  It's going to take us a really long time to get through this bag. 3
DE is a very good coffee.  I ordered this as my father-in-law raved about it, and the whole bean aroma rood is indeed a good coffee.  It tastes like a medium coffee with a particular spice feel to it.  Very unique and very tasty.  I tend to make my coffee very bold even if it is a 'medium' coffee, and even bold this is up there with some of my favorite coffees.<br /><br />If you are a coffee fan, this is worth a shot, pun intended.<br /><br />Enjoy. 4
I guess if I had no other taco sauce to flavor up a taco, I'd be okay reaching for this bottle, but it wouldn't be my top choice at all.  As a taco sauce, it tastes too much like Catalina salad dressing, but spicier, which makes me think I might have liked this better, had it been presented to me as a salad dressing instead of a taco sauce.  I don't love it, I don't hate it, but I wouldn't buy it for my Tex-Mex dining pleasure. 3
I love these noodles.  They are really great for a midnight snack.  It's not really something that will fill you up for a dinner.  If you do eat it for dinner, you will be hungry later.  Maybe some people wouldn't!!!!  But, it just doesn't stick to my ribs.  I love them though and Amazon has a really good price. 5
I have bought this pasta several times. The spirals fall apart every time. It ends up being just tiny noodle pieces. I will not buy them again. 2
Well, lets say that I wish that I had heeded the warning of other reviewers. Since there were so many great and so many bad reviews, I didn't know what to make of it all - thought that possibly this was a fair cup of coffee, but that other reviewers had above average tastes in coffee. Nope. They're just regular old coffee drinkers like me that just don't want a funky taste, and funkier aftertaste. Not too much to ask from a finely brewed cup of coffee. I bought the French Roast...reviews of Fog Chaser were worse stating it tasted like dishwater, ashtray, etc.<br /><br />Let me start by saying, other reviewers are correct that once you open the sealed bag, you must contain them in something else because it will not stay fresh. I just put mine in an empty coffee container because I am just lazy with my coffee...that is afterall why I own a Keurig...ease of use and a quality cup of coffee. Once I opened the outer sealed bag, I couldn't help but think it smelled like something that may have washed ashore on the San Francisco Bay!! I did approach it with an open mind, however, and brewed a cup of coffee.<br /><br />It is easy to use just like traditional k-cups, despite the uniquely different design. I did get coffee grounds in my cup (really just a few), and that has happened to me before so I did not want to fault the product for that. As for the taste...that's where I fault the product itself!!! I gave this two stars because it is drinkable. Barely. I will fight my way though this pack, and never order again!! Let me put into this context for you...the coffee that I have drank at work from the old, stained coffee maker with some cheap store brand grounds thrown in tastes way better than this.<br /><br />There are other ways to save a buck with your machine...there's that giant gray bullet looking filter contraption, there's a small red plastic version, there's the snap on lids, and then there's the aluminum foil that someone recently introduced me to. So here goes...I'll give you a break down of all that I've listed.<br />Giant Gray Bullet Filter - Does NOT taste anything like a traditional k-cup brewed cup of coffee, but by FAR better than this coffee here! The downside with this is that you have to push out the inner part of the machine that the k-cup usually rests in. Dishwasher safe though.<br /><br />Small Red plastic and metal mesh filter - tastes closer to a traditional k-cup, and no popping out the machines inner parts. Have to dump grinds into garbage, but it is dishwasher safe. Good option. Also sold on Amazon.<br /><br />Snap on lids - Amazon sells snap on metal or plastic lids. I have the metal ones. With these, you have to peel the foil off of your k-cup after first use and dump out grounds, and clean them out. Sounds like a hassle, but I guess that I've gotten used to it. Put two scoops of any coffee grounds that you like, snap the lid on, put it in your machine and brew as usual. Out comes a good quality cup of coffee that tastes the same as the traditional k-cup. Possibly because the filter and the cup are what you are reusing. Now someone recently told me that you can reuse the same k-cup over and over again, until the filter gives out. Haven't tried yet.<br /><br />Aluminum Foil - first of all why didn't I think of that!! A k-cup only has a small piece of foil on top that the machine pierces. Really. So obvious that I can't believe that I never thought of it. Tried it the other day. Here's the scoop...still have to empty out a k-cup as you would with the above methods, add coffee grinds, etc. Tore off a small piece of foil, tried to get it just right around the lip because you can't just slap foil over it and have it fit in the machine with all of the excess foil...so it started to feel like a bit of a craft project. Once I got it to fit, I brewed a cup of coffee that tasted like what I have come to expect from a Keurig machine. There were a few grounds that fell into the coffee, but no more than with this crappy coffee!! I will perfect this aluminum foil method...measure, and pre-cut circles one day when I have time.<br /><br />Truly, I have no spare time, which is why I RARELY review a product, but I felt strongly enough about this terrible product, that I should save someone else the palatal distress! Not worth the money! Not worth feeling like you wasted your money when you throw them away! Not worth having to endure 36 cups of sub-standard coffee!! Again I'm no no connoisseur...just a regular coffee drinker! 2
These Kitchen of Indian meals are great for a quick and easy meal. They are not as good as going to a very good Indian restaurant, but they are close enough to give you a satisfying fix if you love Indian food and flavors as I do. Just make a few servings of rice to go along with this and you're all set.<br /><br />One of my local grocery stores actually sells these a little cheaper, but they never have carried the Navratan Korma flavor, so that's why I get them from Amazon. I also really like the Rajma Masala (with the red kidney beans) and the Palek Paneer (with the spinach and cottage cheese) flavors.<br /><br />Whether you already love Indian food or just want to try something new, spicy and flavorful, I can heartily recommend this brand. 4
The product is advertised as "6-7 Inch" bones.  Printed beneath the UPC code on the bags is "8 PK 6-7" Bone".  But I could immediately see without opening a bag that the bones were not the advertised size.  The real size range was 5 to 5-1/2 inches (to confirm my visual estimation, I grabbed my tape measure and measured their lengths).  Not ONE single bone was 7, or 6-1/2, or 6 inches.<br /><br />When you have a large dog, the size of their dog chews determines how long they will last.  I hate being lied to - no matter what a "deal" this product may be for others.<br /><br />If you want true-to-size 7" rawhide bones, get "Healthy Hide" brand beefhide treats.  They're made from free-range, grass-fed beef, and are HACCP & ISO certified.  And you also won't be ripped-off by deceptive marketing. 2
This is what I was looking for and was missing it. The taste is exactly the taste as the one made in India so just loved it and remember my days back in India. Definitely recommend it. 5
We enjoyed this coffee very much, smooth and rich taste gets us off to a good start in the morning! I'll be purchasing this brand often. 4
I've eaten a few of these, and while they tasted interesting at first, I can't bite into one now without gagging.  I'm not a vegetarian, but I was looking for some high-protein snacks so I picked these up.  A vegetarian friend of mine tried one and instantly hated them, calling the taste "disgusting" and the texture "too much like meat."  The taste is not something that grows on you and I can not recommend these to anyone, especially at this price. 1
The bag was smaller than I expected, but that's probably just me being bad at estimating things.  The salt seems good, however, I was a little disappointed that the photo showed the salt to be much more vibrantly colored than they actually are.  I mean, they are pink, just not so bright pink as it shows.  The salt has a good flavor though.  I'd say it was worth the price. 4
I was really hopeful when I ordered these Fruit Slices.  It had been a long time since I had eaten any Fruit Slices, and was hoping to spark a delicious memory from my childhoood!  BUT, I was so disappointed when I ate my first slice - yes, I ate the entire piece, HOPING that the flavor would get better, but alas, the flavor did not improve.  The slice I tasted was supposedly watermelon, but all I could taste was a bitter, sour fruit.  I took one bite tastes of the other flavors, and couldn't tell much difference in any of the flavors, other than a bitter, sour fruit taste.  So - save your money, and look for a different brand of fruit slices to buy! 1
I like Special K, so I figured I'd give Special K Red Berries a shot. Huge mistake. The consistency of the berries after they've been in milk for just a minute or so is disgusting. They get slimy and disintegrate. I won't try these again. I had hoped it would be similar to Newman's Own berries cereal, but I was wrong. The berries in Newman's Own held up just fine. Kellogg's has something to learn from Newman's Own. 1
Bought these Jack Link's Beef Sticks a second time because I was so pleased the first time I purchased them. This time the quality had gone down significantly, they were much greasier tasting and less flavorful. Then, they began to get moldy... within two weeks of receipt! Needless to say, I was not happy with this purchase. 1
Out of the several brands of canned refried beans I have tried, this is my least favorite.  They become more palatable if one adds granulated garlic and finely diced onions. 2
It is not real macha.<br />I'm kinda disappointed with that.<br />I expect that is green, but actually it is dark. 3
When our third child, and first son was born, we sent our oldest to school (Kindergarten) with these for her friends to celebrate. It really made her feel important at school, and helped her celebrate the birth of our little boy. She loved doing it, and her friends enjoyed them too. BTW- teachers, we did clear it with the teachers at school first, so no hate mail please! 5
As someone who drinks green tea every day at work, I thought this would be a good selection. It seemed to have everything I like: green tea, mango, honey. It does, but unfortunately, it also includes some non-desirables. For me, Sucralose is an unproven benefit and I generally avoid it if possible.<br /><br />It is too bad Lipton adds it to this tea. It over-sweetens the tea and adds the undesirable ingredient. I am used to the slightly bitter green tea taste and think covering it up takes away from the overall appeal. I would prefer a little more honey instead, but even then, I think unsweetened green tea is sellable as is. The mango flavor is about right, while I did not detect much, if any, pineapple flavor.<br /><br />Half a sachet is sufficient flavoring for a pint of water. Adding the entire sachet is excessive for my taste. 3
We have a very picky cat. He turns his nose up to well-loved kitty delights such as Fancy Feast, Friskies, or anything too low-brow for his tastes. He LOVES these treats, which says a lot. You never can predict what your cat's taste buds will enjoy, but I'd recommend these treats on the basis that a) a picky kitty likes them; and b) they don't stink to high hell. 5
Great taste with no saturated or trans fat.  A little high priced though, but well worth it for controlling cholesterol. 4
I expected this product to be similar to those sold by Mrs. May's. What a disappointment! They are very salty. Imagine taste combination of salt and sugar. The bag is going back to Costco. I would not eat another piece, even if it is free. 1
If you don't like ginger then don't pick up a ginger drink, but if you like ginger then I do suggest Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger & Lemon Beverage. It has a very intense ginger taste to it, much stronger ginger flavor then I was expecting and a very very mellow lemon flavor that is so mellow because the ginger just takes everything over.<br /><br />The smell of the drink when you first open the package it ginger overload, to me smelled like a gingerbread cookie with some lemon on top. Getting your drink just right is very easy, just open and pour your contents into a cup and add your choice of water and stir. Easy as 1 2 3 and your done. No need to sweeten your drink as it is already sweet with honey already inside.<br /><br />Can be served two different ways: hot & cold but I have to say I would prefer the hot way as it is very soothing to drink. Ginger is a wonderful way to settle your upset stomach and the fact that this drink mix is caffeine free is another bonus for that means I can drink it at any time and not have to worry about it keeping me up at night.<br /><br />If you like ginger check it out, for as a fan of ginger drinks/teas I have to say this has to be one of the better ones that I have tried. 4
This product is very good.  It goes a long way.  But quite as good as the one at DD.  Good product not the less. 4
This sounded so good in the write up, but I found it watery, and couldn't taste the lime or much coconut.  I ended up giving both cases to a friend. 2
The tea was okay.  However, the picture and description of these tea bags led me to believe that each bag would be in an individual paper wrap. Instead, the bags were simply all stuffed together in the box----many without strings. 2
This is one of the best choices, in my opinion.  I also adore Amazon, but they need to negotiate a better price for their Tassimo Disks.  These are available at BedBath & Beyond for $10. and I always get 20% off which brings it down to $8.00 --- they were $7.50 (before the 20% off readily available coupons) until about 3 months ago.  Again, this is an excellent blend with full flavor - not bitter - I think it's my favorite. 5
My Bichons love the food.  And, the price cannot be beat.  But, when I previously wrote about a can that came without a label, I never heard back.  I have also had a problem with dented cans.  Of course, if air gets into the cans, the food will not be safe to eat.  Makes me wonder if they are selling "seconds."  Would account for the great price.  Would have liked to have heard back from them. 3
I ordered these because I wanted to try something new due to me being on a low carb diet.  I love slim jims, but these nach flavored ones are not for everyone.  Every time you take a bite, a burst of gooey, greasy cheese explodes in your mouth.  Not a sensation I enjoy.  Slim jims are greasy enough without having that extra "oomph" packed in.<br /><br />Ill give it an extra star  due to being able to bite around the cheese and eat the tasty slim jim w/ out the cheese. 2
Horrendous texture and even worse taste!  Bar was waxy, dense and bland tasting with NO semblence of pecan pie flavor whatsoever.  My expectations were reasonable considering that this is a nutritional product rather than an actual slice of pecan pie, but it was so awful I had to throw it away after 2 bites, followed by a thorough rinse-and-spit session with a glass of cold water.  Blah!  Sorry Larabar,  I tried to like you... 1
I like the sparking refreshing taste of Kiwi in combination with Strawberry but I probably would not sacrifice my thirst for the traditional diet free soda drinks that I got used to. 4
Causes intense cramping and diarria. But I was sorry that they will not let me return other 4 boxes out of the 5 I recieved.  I thought it was a great item and did taste great but it has very bad affect on those senstive to artifcal sweetner as this has in it. 1
I was originally looking for Keurig coffee on Amazon and stumbled across this gem.  I bought it for work to centralize my coffee "stuff" and it has been perfect - k-cups, stirrers, sweetener packets, all fit nicely in one place...right below my Keurig!  The only thing that would make this product better would be if the dividers in the drawer were solid so stirrers didn't have a chance to roll around, but since I can tell it was originally designed to only hold k-cups I can't complain.  Great for saving space and looks nicer than the tall, spice rack looking k-cup holders out there - would def recommend. 5
This gardenia tree looked so cute online and we love gardenias. It arrived with a note to hurry and purchase a tray to go under the pretty pot which has 2 draining holes. It was a surprise this was not included. The plant did however come complete with ectoparasites (something like green scales clinging to the branches) and white flies. It was also not as mature as shown in photo - more like 3 branches with scant green and yellow leaves. 1
I got this wasabi soy flavor a few weeks ago. Tastes all right. But last week I got up out of bed and I was dizzy. I thought, "hey that happens, no big deal..." A few days ago I was running and I got really light headed. I thought, "hey that happens, it's hot out..." But yesterday I ate a few of these and I realized, "hey these are really salty" Now I don't know if all these things are related, but if there's one thing i'm sure of - it's that these are pretty salty. 3
I love these Barbecue flavored Pop Chips. They're crunchy, loaded with spicy Barbecue flavor, and highly addicting. Beware... you're going to want more! After trying these you'll find it hard to believe they're pretty healthy. Go to their website and see for yourself (not every product page lists ingredients, it's worth checking it out). I'll definitely be buying more of these.<br /><br />4 stars instead of 5 because although they're absolutely delicious, they're also inconsistent. One bag has different textured chips (and coating variances, mainly color difference) from another. That's fine with me but it's just a a little off putting. 4
Not enough flavor, murky brown color, lacking in aroma. I enjoy other varieties from this line but prefer a different brand of rose hip tea. I'd drink it over regular black tea though. 3
I have two cats, one who eats wet food as a last resort (mostly she licks up the gravy), and one who has food allergies (grains) and is incredibly picky (won't eat any grain free cat treats i've found so far--greenies, the tasty junk food ones, wellness cat jerky bits, shaved salmon, etc-- doesn't like catnip, and turns his nose up at anything that costs less than $1.29 a can it seems, to include spots stew; authority; organix; most flavors of avo-derm, holistic select, and innova; max cat; and natural choice).<br /><br />she still licks up the gravy, and eats about half her bowl. He eats his portion and finishes hers, with no vomiting or retching (so nice!). He also wakes me up in the morning if it's breakfast time and i haven't gotten the memo yet, and looks at me like i just kicked his grandma cat when i've run out.<br /><br />this has quite a bit of juice in it, which is good since most cats don't drink enough water anyway.<br /><br />as for me, i love this food b/c it doesn't smell to high heaven, and i haven't died from litterbox duty as of yet. ;) (get it? duty--dooty? hehe) 5
I don't know why everyone loves these chips. They are healthy but taste disgusting. Only the original flavor tasted good, so getting the variety pack was a very bad idea. I would not buy this again and would rather go with baked chips than these. Pirate's Booty makes popped chips that are way better. 2
This simple yet tasteless product did what it said it would, thicken gravy and soups. This product in my opinion should be used in the morning before work or people who are studing late nights as Chia makes you energized. 3
This is a very tasty, powdered instant decaf chai tea mix. It blends easily and well and tastes delicious. i like to take a few packets when I travel 4
This is a good idea, and they dissolve quickly for babies new to food. But if a partially slobbered on one falls out of the baby's mouth and onto clothing it leaves a stain that proves impossible to remove. The puffs have a bit of an orange coating on them, it must contain food coloring. I've tried organic puffs and they don't leave any stains. 2
I drink alot of coffee and love hazelnut coffee, this brand has the best flavor I have ever tasted. I have bought several different brands and this one is the BEST! It may be a few dollars more but it is worth it. I absolutely love and enjoy it every morning. 5
If you are looking for the secret ingredient in Robitussin I believe I have found it.  I got this in addition to the Root Beer Extract I ordered (which was good) and made some cherry soda.  The flavor is very medicinal. 2
I bought this product for my son who is in grad school. He said Emeril's K-cups were the best tasting ones he has tried so far. I will definitely buy them for him again. 5
Alvita changed their lea licorice tea not the same - but my daughter likes it.  She normally uses tea in her tea but she said she does not use tea in licorice tea - it is sweet enough. 4
Either I got 15 tubes that came from a bad batch lot or they are not selling the right Harissa. I bought 15 tubes thru Amazon from Parthenon Foods and used 4 of them so far and after putting the whole tube it still isn't spicy at all. Normally a whole tube would get you to sweat a bit!!!!! This seems to be a case of false representation. I buy these tubes in Canada at the grocery store all the time when I am up there and they provide a nice kick and spice (as they should). What's up with dat? 1
This thing might be 5"-7" however the fact that its the size of a pencil round is beyond ridiculous. I spent $6 more on one for my larger dog and that was well worth the money, this little thing was worth about half I paid. Buyer beware, the photos shown are of their larger bones, they just use them with the smaller ones to make it seem like your getting your moneys worth!! There is no way a 40lb dog would get real use out of this, maybe a 5lb dog!! What a joke!! 1
UPDATE: KEEP YOUR RECEIPT.<br />The product is guaranteed...but the process to get a refund is onerous (in my opinion).<br /><br />"I am sorry that you were not satisfied with our "XXXX".  Please send a proof of purchase, a note with the expiration date of the product and an explanation as to why you were not satisfied to the address below and we will gladly refund your money.  Thank you and again, my apologies."<br /><br />Walden Farms<br />1209 W St Georges Ave<br />Linden, NJ 07036<br /><br />I spread this on Wasa sourdough crisp as part of an HCG Very Low Calorie diet. I thought it was tasty..and very peanut-like for ZERO CALORIES. It is thin. Goes well with Walden Farms blueberry fruit spread.<br /><br />NOW if you are NOT looking for ZERO calories..look elsewhere. If you can spare a few calories try PB2...it is a powdered peanut butter with fat removed. (I have not tried it..but I expect it will be better...when I get to phase 3...I'll try it).  But right now I'm on a low complex carb, low carb, Very low calorie and no sugar diet. THIS is not a lifestyle change diet..it is a rapid weight loss diet.....then you slowly introduce carbs, a little sugar and flavor.<br /><br />Walden farms fits in HCG diet Phase 2, when you are restricted to 500 calories  a day. (Some HCG folks allow 600-800 calories).<br /><br />IN a very low calorie diet phase..Walden Farms products are great.  BUT TRUST me..don't even think about Walden farms ZERO calorie products unless you are on an extreme diet....<br /><br />I don't think I'd enjoy the sourdough crisps without something..so I view the Walden farms spreads as a nice treat. If you are on a HCG diet, buy it.<br /><br />Just found a recipe. 1 T. peanut butter. 2 T.  ground flax seed and 1/4 cup water (or splurge and replace some water with zero calorie vanilla, butterscotch or caramel flavoring). Heat water to boiling & pour over flax seed & "peanut butter". 75 calories.<br />Some eat this as a "cereal". I cut up apples and used as a dip.  It was actually more than I wanted for one apple. You can half the recipe.<br /><br />Hope this helps folks. 3
I love this cereal.  It has good crunch and blueberry flavor.  However, I have sampled a few Kashi's and have a strong preference for their crunchy cereals that are like rice puffs.  This cereal is flakes.  So I mix the flakes with the crunchy puffs!  Pretty good. 4
I am not sure what has changed about this food, but my poor dog has been nothing but sick on this food, and she used to do well on it. I have noticed whenever I feed it to her, her stomach growls, she gets sick, and then she has uncontrollable diarrhea. I would not recommend it, get a better food. After I started looking around, it sounds like this food has caused a lot of illness and sometimes deaths in dogs. 1
Way to powdery tasting and bad aftertaste.  Plus the price I could not believe for this junk!  Skip and stay with Countrytime Lemonade!<br /><br />Yuck! 2
This is an great product. The taste is great, and it works exactly as described. Superb natural sleep aid. AMAZING! 5
Maybe my doggie is just not smart enough for this product?? I'm not sure. It comes packaged like "Tussy" Deodorant from the old days. You roll it around and the flavor is on the ball and as your dog licks it, the flavor keeps returning. Ok, what did MY dog do? Try to take the whole bottle. No way was he going to just "lick" it... he wanted the container. I obviously couldn't give him the whole thing because he would chew it and the liquid would squirt all over. Very strange "treat". If your dog is used to taking treats from you and chewing them up, getting them to just lick might be a trick. Not for Gus. 2
I ordered this as a christmas present for my Daughter and Son in law. He tried it the day after Christmas and gave it 2 thumbs up. 5
They're not as sweet as I expected.  They are very good corn flakes but don't buy them thinking they'll be a frosted flakes kind of substitute because they are not sugary at all.  And that's not necessarily bad, I like regular corn flakes, it's just that the "Honey'd" part of the product name is a bit misleading in that respect. 4
Red Mill Gluten Free Oat Bran fulfilled my expectations. It is an excellent product and I shall definitely order again.... 5
A friend's doctor recommended this to her for weight loss after having a baby.  It is good, better with a little artificial sweetener added.  Note:  Be sure to drink some of the water out of your bottle, when you add the drink mix, it will fizz up some. 3
I bought two of these for Christmas to give to my husband.  The chocolates on the inside were Ghirardelli's typical high quality individually wrapped chocolates.  The problem was with the ornament.  It was extremely hard to open.  I wouldn't suggest this as a gift idea for anyone who has trouble opening containers, like grandmas and grandpas with arthritis.  It's about the size of a softball so it does make nice decoration for people who can utilize all the muscles in their hands and are up to the task of trying to open the thing. 4
I don't usually like domestic lagers especially from large brewing companies.  This however is a wonderful example of the fuller European style, something akin to a full bodied Belgian Lager.  So easy to make. I recommend getting the full kit which has appropriate malts and sugars and the carbonation drops!  I live in New Hampshire and I brewed this in January when it was very cold.  After the initial fermentation it's been sitting in the bottle at around 50 degrees for a couple of months. The larger yeasts can survive at these cold temps where an ale yeast couldn't.<br /><br />This is so good I think I'm going to have to brew another batch so it will be ready for summer! 4
This peanut butter is what one would expect for the brand: good peanut flavor and nice creamy texture. However, upon reading the ingredients list I noticed it had hydrogenated oils so I don't think in this day and age one should consume that. There are plenty of other peanut butter options out there just as good but without funny ingredients. 2
The pancakes taste great without any recipe adjustments for my son's egg allergy.  It's also great for camping or any time you'd like to be able to make pancakes without having fresh eggs available. 5
This product is great as you will see an increase in your milk supply probably btw 1-3 days after taking these pills BUT what I did notice 3/4wks into taking it that all of a sudden I was eating like I was pregnant (increased appetite) and needless to say looking very swollen and gaining extra weight.  It wasnt until almost more than half of the bottle done I decided to do more research and found out that this was the reason why all of a sudden I was noticeably gaining weight :(.  I will stop taking it starting TODAY!  but will con't pumping while at work and nursing even if I have to wake up in the middle of the night to keep my flow going.  I hope to stick with Blessed Thistle and Mothers Milk Tea Bags hopefully there are no more unwanted surprises. 3
I ordered this unit and loved it initially.  After about 8 purees, I noticed little bits of hard, clear plastic in my dish rack and realized that they had broken off of the bottom of the Baby Brezza unit.  These small bits of plastic hold the drive shaft in place.  The unit can still be operated but it is very difficult and frustrating.  It is very hard to mount the unit and have the lid stay on without the drive shaft being properly supported.  I have contacted the company and hope to get a replacement unit soon.  How discouraging though that this happened after just a few uses.  I have never used the dish washer to clean it either, so that I could just leave the drive shaft in place.  I will also comment that pulling the blade out of the unit in order to clean it is difficult which is probably what led to the plastic pieces breaking off.  Had the item not broken so quickly I would have rated this 4 or 5 stars.  I love the recipe booklet that comes with it.  My son loves the variety of purees that I have made him.  The idea of steaming and blending in one step is so convenient.  Hopefully my next unit will not break. 2
The noodles have to be cooked for 10 minutes, and the sauce must have sauteed meat added (according to the package) and would be improved with the addition of some vegetation (according to me).  Therefore this item is neither quick nor complete.  If the sauce was REALLY great, that might make it worthwhile- but it isn't, its just OK. 1
I'm a bit fickle with Chicken. If it tastes even a little bit off I can lose my appetite for it. This paste makes a sauce that is quick and easy to make. Most of all, I like how the recipe makes sure the Chicken is COOKED by bringing it to a boil twice. And it tastes great over rice. I can't give it 5 stars because it doesn't measure up to the best curry I've ever tasted, but it's good enough that I have bought a couple 6-packs so far. 4
Living a rural area, I have a hard time finding any version of polenta.  This was a lifesaver!  The reasons I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it does tend to be a little mushier than traditional polenta, and although labeled as microwaveable, boiled over every time! 4
I tried Zico in the plastic bottle, never in the tetra pack.<br /><br />Zico in the plastic bottle tastes like watery skim milk with a really really slight hint of coconut flavor. If you ever tried Taste Nirvana coconut water before, Zico pales in comparison. Zico is less sweet and saltier version of Taste Nirvana coconut water. I've also tried VitaCoco. Compared to VitaCoco, Zico tastes creamier than VitaCoco and doesn't have that sour taste.<br /><br />However, in all honesty, Zico tastes like skim milk and nothing like real coconut water from a fresh coconut. 3
While this is reasonably spicy, it somehow seemed less satisfying than the Java curry I had last year. And on occasion it left me with a bloated feeling, but it probably was just my system or the vegetables I used. I would go with House's Java or Vermont curry next time. 3
SHORT VERSION: Get the 2" version instead, but these are great!<br /><br />--------------------------<br />Preface: I'm a *HUGE* sour gummi worm lover.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-Actually SOUR (they use that "sour patch kid" sour powder)<br />-9 lbs for $10..<br /><br />CONS:<br />-4" Worms are too big/thick<br />-Jaw hurts from chewing :x<br /><br />I would definitely buy these again, but next time I will buy the 2" versions instead. Everybody loves these, esp that they are actually sour, but the worms are so thick/big that your jaw starts to hurt from the chewing them. 3
My dogs didn't like these as well as other Smokehouse products.  They much prefer the chicken tenders or the duck and sweet potato treats.  They still liked them, but just didn't appear as excited as they do with the others 3
I paid over $13.00 for "expedited" delivery and the product still took FIVE days to arrive. Would not buy from them again. 2
it came with a pack leaking, wet the whole box. the product is good, but to pay this much money and only able to enjoy 5 pack that you actually paid for 6 is not a good deal. 3
Met expectations--filling, flavorful, one bag is very generous portion, non-greasy.  Flavors are not very distinctive.  BBQ was best, but not well distributed.  Six adults tried them and Six adults liked them. 4
This Whole Wheat Pasta is a wonderful addition to so many dishes.  In addition to the fact that it tastes so good, it also adds few nutritionally sound calories to a dish and is so satisfying! 5
Purchased this product at a local store in NY and my kids and i love it. Its a quick easy meal. You can put in a toaster oven on toast for 6 min. and its ready to eat.<br />strongly recommend 5
I am not sure why the 2 speciality stores in my area stopped carrying these as they were usually sold out. The cakes are 18 calories, crunchy and good--not like the cardboard taste of thicker rice cakes. Excellent as a base for PB&J, or to make an open face sandwich, or to use in pieces like a chip for dips, etc. Good price on the 12 pack with a 10 month expiration use date. 5
This popcorn tastes good, just do not add all the salt if you are sensitive.  It is not soft/fluffy popcorn.  The kernels all pop (using 1/2 of the 8 oz pack in a Westbend StirCrazy popper), but they are not light and fluffy kernels and they pop very small. 3
I ordered this product for cocoa-antioxidants that do body good. To my surprize when I received the order, the product's cans indicated that this cocoa's antioxidants were fewer than its cousin product-Hershey's Cocoa, Natural, Unsweetened. Had this fact been described in the promotion ad, I would not have ordered Hershey's Cocoa, Special Dark. 3
It's not entirely obvious from the photos here on Amazon but these 7 ounce packages aren't like normal pasta, they're basically "precooked" noodles that are in bags filled with water so the actual quantity of noodles is maybe a small scoop per pricey bag. The noodles themselves have a texture that's (naturally) better suited to asian style noodle dishes (i.e. a ramen bowl) and upon initially opening the package there is definitely a vaguely fish-like scent-it's not a horrible pungent scent but more reminiscent of noodles just cooked in fish soup (really hard to describe to be honest). Thankfully this does go away nicely after rinsing and blanching per the instructions, and even when eaten with just red pasta sauce there weren't any weird flavors but the textures just didn't really feel at home here.<br />Honestly these noodles would feel most at home in making a low carb ramen noodle bowl or something similar, but the real reason I'm not going to buy these again is simply that the price is insane for the quantity you get. 3
Might be me, but I am sorry I bought so many packages/how I'm going to eat this is still a mystery. Perhaps cutting the product up in 1 inch pieces. Unless You have razor teeth, this is impossible to chew. Made a batch that has been sitting in tomatoes, and still like rubber bands. I was raised on 'scratch' cooking,might be a personal issue.<br /><br />Reporting back: I used a new pair of scissors and cut noodles up in 1/2 inch pieces. The solution is to swallow the bits w/o chewing. I couldn't throw product on compost heap as I believe the MIRACLE noodle would not break down.<br /><br /> The Miracle in the product name is-if you can get them down without the noodles wrapping around your tonsils,it's a miracle. My father said a hungry man will eat anything,if he is hungry enough/ first time my father was wrong. I also have a sneaking feeling that there might be paid reviewers for this company. Also, I haven't watched a Doctor Oz show since. 1
I keep a case of these in my office and always have at least a tin or two on my desk for visitors to help themselves to. Some folks stop by just to grab some mints and others pop them like candy while we meet. When I find someone who keeps coming back for more I just give them their own tin! One co-worker asked me to save the tins for her so she could use them as pillboxes and safety pin boxes. Like I said, theyre a real hit. Since I wouldn't be able to keep my hands off a candy dish, this is a good alternative to have around and it's nice to have them around if I have garlic for lunch! I gave the item 4 stars because they aren't as tasty as the sugar version of the mints  but what sugar free item is as good as it's full sugar counterpart?) and because of the fact that each tin is wrapped in plastic which seems like a waste and is irritating to remove (although I totally get why they wrap it - it still doesn't make it easy to deal with). 4
I drink this tea every day (I'm 7 months pregnant), and have done so since I found out I was pregnant.  I love that it's organic and contains all the herbs that support a healthy pregnancy.  I don't notice anything dramatic when I drink it or don't drink it, but I will say I feel nourished when I drink it, and have had NO PREGNANCY COMPLICATIONS WHATSOEVER.  I'm 36, this is my first pregnancy, and I have been exceptionally healthy throughout.  I highly recommend this for any pregnant woman--at least a cup a day! 5
Although the coffee had no reached the expiration date, I felt this coffee was borderline stale.  I'm not sure how far out these products are packed to the expiration date, but wished it would have been fresher.  As these little packets are somewhat expensive, I was hoping for more. 2
I have three cats... have had cats for years, this food smells better than most, my cats like it, the ingredients appear to be better than the average cat food. So far, so good! i'll continue to use it for my cats 5
As is unfortunately the case more often than not, if a food tastes really yummy then it's probably not very good for you. These crackers have a nice, creamy taste to them and they pack 7 grams of fat per serving. Yes, that is fewer grams than potato chips, but for a cracker I think that's pretty high in fat content. The taste, however, is very good and these would make a good snack if consumed in moderation. One concern for me was the state of the crackers I received. I tasted these as part of the Vine program and the box I received was very smashed up and the crackers were partially obliterated. If I were buying these crackers, I would have been upset about their smashed-up condition. Perhaps it would not be a good idea to buy these in bulk until you can verify that shipping of these crackers won't damage the product. 3
This Tug-a-Jug turned out to be the perfect thing for our black lab puppy. We put his evening kibble inside and let him roll it around to get his dinner. The jug keeps him occupied for anywhere between 25 minutes to an hour.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Good mental stimulation. Dinner isn't just available to wolf down. It requires some work and is totally worth the reward!<br />2. Sturdy construction. It's held up against the chewy habit of the pup. I do not let him chew on it outside of meal times in order to keep his focus mainly on the food and not the jug.<br />3. The rope seems to be very enjoyable to our pup. He likes to stop and chew on it for a minute before starting to roll and spin the jug again. I'm guessing that has something to do with teething. It's also replaceable (if you can find replacement rope).<br />4. Easy to clean. The bottom screws on/off and the inside can be wiped down.<br />5. Mouth of the jug has a nice texture which helps our pup hold on with his paws. His spin and push control (with his paws) has increased drastically since we started feeding him one meal a day from it!<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Sturdy construction also means it breaks anything fragile in its path. The rope makes it easy to swing around. I would keep the dog and jug away from small pets and children.<br />2. Can't use it with raw food unless you want to make a horrible mess all over the place.<br />3. Loud if you keep it on a linoleum floor like we do. Our pup loves to bang the jug around, spin it with his paws and push it with his nose. It makes quite a racket. It's fairly quiet on the carpet.<br />4. If your dog is really smart, he might figure this one out quickly. I'd recommend pairing this with one of the other Busy Buddy feeding products and switching between them often to keep your dog on his toes. 4
I generally buy the Blue Dog bakery dog treats, but I thought I'd try these out. Overall, I like them, and so do my canine family members.<br /><br />Pro:<br />- The dogs really like them.<br />- They are thick and crunchy - the dogs chewed on them for a while, unlike most treats where they were consumed more quickly. I think this is better for their teeth.<br />- Resealable pouch is a nice touch.<br />- Treats have no odor to them, even after handling them to break apart.<br /><br />Con:<br />- The package was a bit difficult to open - it has an indentation to tear, but the first side I tore did not open the bag. I was more careful on the other side, and tore it towards the zipper opening.<br />- The treat come in bunches of two, and since they are pretty thick (over 1/4 inch or so) I found it difficult to split them into individual services. Two would be too much for small dogs. However, if you have a larger animal they might be more appropriate.<br /><br />Summary: A good choice for dog treats. Recommended. 5
We love Gnu Bars, and have tried almost all the flavors now (but one).<br />But this one needs to go back to the kitchen for a rework!!<br /><br />One word description: YUCK!<br /><br />We all love coffee flavored items, so really, I thought this one might be a favorite.<br />However, it doesn't taste like coffee liquid. It tastes like someone poured the old coffee<br />grounds from a pot into the bars!<br />Seriously, it was that bad.<br /><br />Three people who like coffee gave it double thumbs-down.<br />Seriously iffy texture, and the taste of licking a paper cone<br />full of coffee grounds. NOT good!<br /><br />FYI since it isn't in the listing - Espresso Chip Bar<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br />Gnu High Fiber Blend (whole rolled oats, organic whole wheat flour, wheat bran, organic kamut, psyllium, flax, millet)<br />chicory root inulin, fruit juices, rice dextrins, canola oil, cocoa powder, plums, rice, ground coffee beans,<br />chocolate chips (sugar, chocolate flavor, cocoa butter, dextrose, lecithin), natural flavors, wheat protein isolate, baking power.<br /><br />NUTRITION:<br />Serving size - 1 bar<br />Calories - 140<br />Total fat - 4g<br />Cholestrol - 0 mg<br />Sodium - 35 mg<br />Total Carb - 30g<br />Protein - 4g 1
This was my first time ordering something from the Vine that I could not really review myself.  And our dog, Lucky, can't speak...English.  I do, however, understand a little Dog speak.  When first presented with one of Newman's Own Lamb and Barley NZ Style Dog Treats, he snarfed it down just as expected, just as he does with all treats.  But the next day, as he  saw me go for the bag a second time - he went ballistic.  When I gave him the treat, he retreated into the den with it as if it were a bone.  Same thing happened the third time. Conclusion:  Lucky says "Big Yum! to Newman's Treats.<br /><br />JMT 5
It's all organic and it's on PETA's (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) list of "CRUELTY-FREE" brands.  Did you know that the leading brands of dog foods conduct horrible and cruel tests on laboratory dogs?  Plus it is delivered to my door and no shipping charge (Super Saver Shipping), and costs less than the product I used to buy, saving me time and money. Oh yeah, and my dogs love it!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00139TT72">Newman's Own Organics Adult Dog Food Formula, 12.5-Pound Bag</a> 5
These are California dates. Sweet yet not very fleshy, rather tough and dry. The ones I purchased came in a plastic bag with a ziplock.<br /><br />If you are used to the wonderful medjool dates, which are the perfect snacking date because of their large size, soft flesh and delightful sweetness, you will probably not like these ones.<br /><br />However, for cooking/baking these are fine. 3
If the container wasn't so loud and we could find the correct size/shaped treats to put in it this product would get 5 stars. It keeps our Pit/Lab mix busy and gets her thinking which let me tell you is amazing since she's quite "thick" in the head... I've found a few smaller sized treats at Petco and put a handful in at a time. Make sure to put different sized treats in it too or else the dog will dump them all out and then fill up way too fast. The plastic has held up fine on our tile floor except for the teeth marks but I'm not too worried about it breaking like other people have posted. 4
It is my 7 yr old lab/basenji mix's favorite food, which we mix 1/3 can together with her dried food, making a single can last a week as a special treat.  However, after shipping, it is cheaper to go to my local pet store 5
I was going to buy the 3 pack Torani Sugar Free Caramel Syrup offer from Amazon, but decided to try one bottle first, from my local grocery store. Glad I did. The reviews are right, not sure how to put it, but the taste is "off". Kinda makes my coffee taste like ther're is a chemical in it. Kinda bummed, but glad I did not get 3 bottles! Stick with the sugar free vanilla, it is very good. Ill give another flavor a chance in the future, but Sugar Free Caramel is off the table for me. 1
I'm a sucker for caramel anything.........love the flavor, the aroma, and most important the taste.  I honestly do not like flavored coffees in the morning, but I have made an exception for this one! 5
The Good: The Marley Coffee One Love coffee pods are simple to use and even simpler to clean up.  Just remove the pod from the basket and throw away.  At $10 a box, the price per cup is not bad, either.<br /><br />The Bad:  The coffee is weak tasting.  I tried several pods with differing amounts of water and the coffee still tasted weak.  My pods were "Exotic Floral and Berry" flavored and this flavoring gave the coffee a strong, unpleasant aftertaste.  It didn't seem too bad the first few sips, but the aftertaste became more and more unpleasant as I drank the coffee.  I could not finish a full cup.  My daughter and my sister also tried the coffee and they thought it had an unpleasant taste.  Part of the problem could be that I am not fond of flavored coffees.  I believe that Marley Coffee comes in an espresso flavor and that might be better.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this coffee. 2
I bought this for my boyfriend as a Valentines Day gift and he absolutely loved it! Its an amazing size and includes all the essentials for a starter kit. It arrived extremely quickly even though i chose standard shipping. It arrived in a medium sized box and alot of packing peanuts which kept the tree stable and safe throughout shipping. Overall, i will definitely chose to order from joebonsai again because i was satisfied and absolutely love it! 5
Of all the flavors Vita Coco produces, the Pineapple combination is by far the best - it has just enough flavor to keep it interesting but not overpowering. 5
Dogs loved it, but they freed it and ate it in minutes.  Turns out to be a dollar a minute for the dogs' enjoyment.  Might as well have been a milk bone. 2
Third time I've bought this brand,,,it is STALE,,not gonna bother to return it,,,no second chances, will find another brand. I'm sure another brand offers the same size. To be clear, the first boxes were fresh. Take your best shot. 2
My two cats must not be interested in grass, because it grew but they ignored it. Had no problems growing it. 5
I don't know how this got so highly rated, I do not like it that much... It's way too puffy for me, I personally prefer even chips from Walmart. Yeah it's with less calories, but after having it I feel like eating something else because it just worked up my appetite. 2
Tasted a bit stale.  Not nearly as good as the "waffle" cookies that I loved in Europe, but maybe the product was just not as fresh? 3
Far from a "perfect mix" of flavors, Cruchy Nut cereal is basically your average sugary cereal.  Sadly, the sugar is about all you taste, there is no distinct honey or nut flavor, just sugar and crunch.<br /><br />I can't imagine this is any healthier than Captain Crunch or Lucky Charms, and with those cereals, you actually have distinctive flavors.  As an attempt to invade the Honey Nut Cheerios market, this is entirely a failure. 2
Our pup, Banjo, loves these treats but they crumble and make a bit of a mess on the carpet as he chews on them. He did not experience an upset stomach or belly issues like some of the other reviewers. 3
I was pleasantly surprised to find this item had been delivered the day after my order, my speediest delivery to date. It probably helps my location is near. Everything looks just as described and pictured and I'm very happy to have done business with this seller. The Gingerbread house was carefully packaged as not to harm the fragile pieces inside. I'm excited to give this item as a gift. 5
This food has worked fairly well for my two not quite senior feral rescues, one of whom has CRF and one of whom has IBD (eating pigeons and food left on the ground apparently isn't so good for young kitties' digestive systems and other internal organs, I guess).  It is a lower protein and phosphorus food, but the first ingredient is real chicken (unlike some renal foods that are made with mostly by-products).  It also doesn't cost an arm and a leg, compared to other special foods, and my CRF kitty, who often rejects a perfectly delicious food once she has tasted it in reverse, has been willing to keep eating this even though she's been sick on it more than once. 5
I purchased the White Cheddar flavor based on the good reviews and really wanted to like it, but the salt in the product is too much for my taste. Thank you 3
The Alvita tea is not very tasty. But it does pack a punch of benefits. It is priced well. Billberry is healthy for you. I gave it a 3 only because of taste. 3
I've used maybe half a dozen bags of this tea in the last year and it is a delicious, consistently good quality black tea. Mainly I use it and several other Numi teas in my tea blends for making kombucha. 5
I don't know if I got a bad bag or what from the good reviews I have read but these were the toughest gummi bears I have ever had.  They were hard to chew to the point where your mouth would begin to hurt.  I still have about four pounds remaining after a couple months now since they aren't enjoyable to eat.  The taste isn't the greatest either unless you let them set in you mouth for a while but the toughness just makes them very unenjoyable.  Maybe its just a bad bag but I have no reason to say these are good if they weren't and that is my experience so far. 1
I adore these K-Cups! On a keto diet, it can be hard to find pre-made drinks that aren't loaded with sugar. With these guys, I can control the sugar content but still enjoy that perfect glass of iced tea. 5
Before I bought this product I read several reviews saying that this stuff was amazing, that it made everything super sweet. So I thought I would try it out, and it is pretty cool, but not worth the outrageous price. About one minute after I sucked the tab I tried eating numerous things like limes, lemons, and oranges, just to name a few. It did make everything that's sour sweet. Not to the point of "oh my god, it's amazing" but it did work. So to sum this up, this stuff was good for a one time deal, but after doing it a few times it lost it's appeal. 4
I really liked the illy Cappuccino coffee drink I previously tried, so I thought I would enjoy this caffe' Italian Espresso style coffee drink as well. While this is less calories (50 per can) and has a really bold flavor, it is a bit too strong for my liking. Now if you are a regular espresso drinker, you will most likely enjoy this very much. I tend to go for my drinks on the sweeter side. I also felt this drink was a bit on the "watery" side. I would have liked it to bit creamier, but obviously that would mean more calories. I also believe espresso tends to be stronger in general. So lesson here: I should have known better because I am not a HUGE fan of espresso. Now that being said, it still was good enough that I would enjoy it occasionally as a mid-day pick me up drink because it certainly helped get me through a mid-day slump! It wasn't all that bad, just not something I, myself would drink everyday. 3
I don't think any gummi bears are really better than others. I just wanted to note that this product is listed under "Vegetarian" foods, but they are not vegetarian because they contain gelatin.<br /><br />Just a note. Now, back to your regularly-scheduled Amazon shopping. 3
I read an article rating this the best instant Risotto, but I actually prefer the flavor of the plain saffron one. 3
With Subscribe and Save, these are about the same price as they are at the local Family Dollar so I went ahead and ordered a pack of 4 for myself and friends I have over for the holidays.<br /><br />These are just average. I thought there'd be more to them. Very small layer of cheese but I guess that's about how everything is nowadays. But these are just average. I won't be purchasing them again.<br /><br />They aren't bad if you used them in dip. 3
The ad says 30 regular greenies, but the package I received says<br />27 greenies. 2
I like this product, and will order it online again since it is a much better price than the grocery store.  I wish the box was a bit bigger, but it will do.  It is plain, but it makes a light and fluffy pancake.  You can add flavor with vanilla extract, cinamon, or blueberries.  I liked the texture of the biscuit recipe, but it came out more like a muffin.  I'm going to make it in a muffin pan next time and put cranberries in it.  I made my biscuits with butter.  If you are creative with the use of add ins, I think it would make good quickbreads, but not the rising type. 4
I want to make my own black sesame ice cream because I don't trust store bought ice cream.  These bags were priced well and arrived without any seeds in the Amazon box.<br /><br />Sesame paste requires toasting cleaned and dried seeds on medium and then grinding it into a paste either with or without sugar.<br /><br />gdz 3
I tried this coffee on a half dozen quests this weekend and they all loved it.  For those that like their coffee mild, I brewed 7 oz cups.  For those of us that like it bold, I brewed 5 oz cups.<br /><br />As an earlier posted noted, it does have a slightly flavored quality to the taste that makes it stand out from other coffees.  The taste isn't obvious enough to turn off drinkers who want their coffee "regular and black" but strong enough to note for those of us that pay attention.<br /><br />I plan on trying all of Wolfgang's line.  Wish he'd offer a variety pack. 5
This tea is the most awful stuff I've ever put in my mouth.  It has a chemical taste.  I tried adding sugar and it didn't help. I enjoy the Arizona Pomegranate Gree Tea and would highly recomment it. 1
We love the big bold flavors we typically find in the dark roast coffees available for the Keurig.  However, my family and I found this one a bit too bitter.  The flavors are strong and this is definitely a bold coffee, but the lingering flavor was not as smooth as some of our more favorites.<br /><br />We've tried this on two occasions, once from a sample pack and another time from a box of 24.  We all consistently agreed across the two times.  So I feel pretty confident in our assessment.  Perhaps others will like this if they put more sugar or cream in it to knock a bit of the bitterness off.  Since I use no cream and only a little sweetener, this is just a bit too strong for us. 4
I don't use energy shots often but wanted to have some around just in case.  So I've bought a pack of this stuff and two months later the results have usually been hit or miss. Sometimes I feel it, sometimes I forget I've taken it and go about my business.  So I won't be going into details on the performance.<br /><br />The price was great and flavor was good with no strong after taste or anything.<br /><br />My issue with this product is that 90% of the time I open a bottle it, it has brown residue around the rim of the bottle. I see this after peeling off perforated cap band and unscrewing the cap.  I think that if the band were not there the caps would eventually come loose and all of the liquid would spill out.  I do not fear that the bottles have been tampered with but it's a bit unsettling.  Before anyone says it's due to how long I've had it, it's only been two months and I store them in my kitchen cabinets and my desk drawer at work.<br /><br />I believe Red Rain competitors have a small foil seal under the caps which prevent leakage.  Perhaps the lack of this enables them to cut the cost of the product?  At the moment, i will not be buying this item again, if however this issue was corrected I may consider buying Red Rain again. 3
I purchased this as I wanted to give my baby an organic alternative to cereal found in supermarkets. I thought is was such  great idea to have multigrain cereal just like what I eat.<br />BIG MISTAKE.<br />This gave my baby the most horrible gas and it took me months to realize it was the cereal causing this. Only when my mother-in-law said "Boy, if I eat whole grain cereal in the evening, i act like a trumpet all night" did I think. "Waou, maybe it's the cereal".<br />I've stopped giving her this and no more crying, arching and farting! 1
As Chef Tom says, 'Don't be afraid of curry!'.  There's a light but distinct curry scent to this mix that works beautifully on shrimp, scallops, and white fish (catfish, orange roughy, red snapper).<br /><br />For those of you who who don't like the 'burn' curries can impart, no worries - the bark is definitely stronger than the bite in this case. It fades to practically non-existence on more distinctly flavorful 'red' fish such as salmon and tuna.  It's too weak for pork, let alone beef. (To be fair though, it wasn't really designed for these types of meat).<br /><br />This spice isn't quite as good as the two knockouts in Chef Tom's collection: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5TTHI">Chef Tom Douglas Rub With Love Salmon Rub</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5TTL4">Chef Tom Douglas Rub With Love Chicken Rub</a>  - but it is yummy.  I suggest drizzling this into your potato or pasta salad instead of paprika to give things an exotic punch! 3
It was a bit of a risk to order this, I mean what are you going to do with 2 boxes of kcups that taste terrible? But this was delish, the flavor was really good, and it was still awesome after it had cooled down. It has a coconutty, vanilla flavor, very nice!! 5
The order of three different plants arrived as advertised.  They were packed well.  Unfortunately, they didn't last a week. i contacted the seller and wrote him it was my first experience at growing plants and requested a refund.  He e-mailed and wrote he preferred to send replacements and asked questions, as well as, pointed out the plants go into hibernation around Sept. and last some months.  Over this weekend, i decided to scope out other plant sites. i decided no refund and no replacements. Lesson learned. 3
there is very little taste, from the herring or the lemon...but there is a hot pepper kick. the fish meat is whitish, soft and flaky. it is not firm nor does it have the fish flavor as in the other kipper product we bought.<br /><br />it just seems that they used whatever was left over , the broken and the flakes....added some lemon and pepper to make it have an appeal to a buyer. a good way to use otherwise less valuable parts of the fish?<br /><br />this will not be re-ordered by us.<br /><br />we buy a LOT of such fish product at amazon and rate each one, this gets our lowest rating. 1
I really like Blue Mountain coffee the best..Great flavor acid profile is great, and I grade others based on that.  I like breakfast style most, high caffeine light roasts. I will drink almost any good coffee.  Dark Sumatra's ,, medium roasts, I will drink them and if I don't love them they are still ok to pretty good.  Then we get to this coffee. West coast coffee is on my least liked list, although I drink Starbucks with no problem.  This coffee smells bad to me.  It's organic, and I like organic, but it's like too organic.  makes me think they got some organic compounds from the fields in the mix.  Must just be too strong for me.  After mixing my cup well there is a heavy precipitate on the bottom of the cup that looks like chocolate syrup.  I don't like to waste stuff I buy but I find myself grimacing when I think of drinking a cup. 2
These cookies are amazing. They taste as good as if not better than the original brands. I only wish local stores would catch on and carry this cookie. 5
it is WONDERFUL, never had a flower yet, i just LOVE the leaves! May 2012 i accidentally dropped it... broke 2 of its good leaves as it hit the floor! BUT it grew right back, this is what makes me so happy, i was so scared it would die on me! But no, this beauty came up with 2 more leaves. LOL!!!!! Love it, just awesome plant, you need fertilizer and good soil for these kinds of plants, it all depends on what you have as a soil/starting stuff... 5
i ordered this in the past and was extremely disappointed. they are unlike truffles that i know of. they were hard like a huge seed, had no truffle aroma. i threw all contents out. will never order them again 1
I used to get these from Sam's Wholesale Club, but with this economy, I have not renewed my membership .. so long story short, I bought BumbleBee canned clams and they were HORRIBLE .. so then I bought Geisha Baby Clams and they were not as horrible, but I certainly would not put them in MY clam chowder, so I returned all the unopened cans of BumbleBee and Geisha and am never ever gonna buy them again ... oh, you go right ahead and try those other brands if you don't mind eating POOP .. 'cause that's about all you get .. Clam Juice, and Clam Poop.  Doxee Snow's Clams are ALL CLAMS and CLAM JUICE no clam poop. 5
This was a good value for what I paid. It fit my kurig fine however it was stronger than I like and left grounds in the cups. I am assuming that is because it has a net instead of a cup. 3
This is a GREAT waffle mix! I have allergies to preservatives and to find food in general that is great tasting without the preservatives is a huge challenge. I have tried several other mixes and this one is by far the best. I totally don't understand the reviews about the bad taste and "all the chemicals"--read labels of other mixes and you will see this one is not full of all those ingredients. There are certain kinds of ingredients that these mixes need, such as levening, and when you use REAL butter, NOT the "tub" butter that contains water and other nasty stuff, these are THE BEST WAFFLES EVER! 5
I srewed the top off the bottle without removing the hard plastic pull ring. Makes me wonder if it's safe to use. There is not other covering and I put the cap back on and it looks like it's never been opened! Since it's a powered supplement this doesnt look safe. I gave it a two because of the seal and the fact that I'll probably have to return it. 2
I purchased a box of these and 30% of them leak when I use them.  I couldn't figure out what was happening, but after examining the cups, I realized that the foil seal on top was not sealed properly and was tearing when the coffee brewed.  There was water and coffee all over my machine and my counter.<br /><br />May have been a fluke, but no other K-Cup has ever leaked on me. I will never purchase these again.  Back to Jet Fuel for me! 1
I could not finish this drink, it is like drinking orange syrup. It may not have any added sugar in it but one can of 8.3 ounces has 34 sugar grams and 36 carbs. I'll stick to water when I want to quench my thirst! 1
I bought these for my two year old who has many food allergies.  I bought these, hoping that he would like them and stop sneaking the other kids cheerios, but he seems to prefer the cheerios over these.  He has wheat, peanut, dairy, egg, soy, and oat allergies.  The taste is ok. Not bad. I didn't notice any aftertaste, so that's good.  They are a good quick snack for the car.  He tends to like corn flakes over these though. 3
I'm actually doing what I am critical of others for doing. . . I am rating downward a star because of Amazon's price, not the product. The Lifesavers are wonderful.  Period.  Especially the pineapple! However, the price at Amazon is .12 an ounce higher than Wal-Mart (as of this date). A 41 oz. package of these at Wal-Mart was $6.98, or .17 an ounce and from Amazon they are .29 an ounce. I wish I'd gone to Wal-Mart before ordering these. . . Though I am still the most devoted of Amazon customers, the prices are definitely trending upward and no longer is Amazon automatically the least expensive option. I will have to do due diligence in the future. 3
The color is deep brown; almost black as it should be with  espresso-type coffee. It taste like a good cup of strong coffee and not as acidic or bitter as I expect espresso to taste.  The flavor is very smooth.  Each 6.8 ounce serving is 50 calories. There are only four ingredients - coffee, sugar, potassium bicarbonate, and potassium citrate. Each serving has 155 mg of caffeine which is about the same as is in a cup of drip coffee (115 - 175 mg).<br /><br />My boyfriend really loved this drink (he shared it with me) and would rate it 5 stars because it has a strong flavor and a good caffeine content; although he does consider this expensive. 4
Happy Hips are one of my little monster's favorite treats.  She is a very finicky eater but she will obey and be sweet for a chance at these chip like treats.<br /><br />This product was recommended to me by another dog owner as a healthy treat because it contains no fillers, byproducts, antibiotics, or added hormones. It also has vitamins and minerals to maintain healthy joints, which for a French Bulldog that has problems with hips and joints, is a plus.  I feel better about giving the little critter a healthy treat instead of the garbage contained in brand name treats on the market.<br /><br />One huge red flag is they are made in China, which certainly gives me pause, but I will keep buying them.<br />I have only tried the beef liver variety and will stick with it since my little creature likes them so much. 4
i received a bar in my influenster summer voxbox for review purposes and i liked it a lot!<br />most likely, i'll purchase a box of these myself... and perhaps try a few other flavors..<br /><br />one busy day at work, i didn't have time to stop for lunch and this bar gave me the energy to continue on with my day. luckily i had stowed the bar i received from influenster in my purse the day i got my voxbox! 4
This is my 2nd order from them, my 1st was the italian roast espresso which was pretty good. I like the french roast a bit more as it does not have any of the charred taste that the espresso did. It's oily and very aromatic, brews wonderfully in my french press & I recommend! 4
I love this product, it helps keep things moving!  I use it twice a day afternoon and evening while dieting.  A great product for helping maintain your weight. 4
It tastes the same as the first original "International Instant Coffee". With a little sugar, it tastes ok but it's not smooth enough to call it cappaccino. Mostly I taste the powdered creamer. It would be ok to use as a base flavor to add other flavors in; especially if you added the same spices you use to make chai latte. A grocer around here would charge about $3.50 a can for it. I have to say that it tastes better than the House Blend they make for single cup coffee makers. I wouldn't buy this again though, and I'm not interested in finishing the can. 2
When I gave this to my dog he instantly went to town. As I sat and watched him I noticed the white t-rex had cut my dog's mouth from the sharp edges. He is an aggressive chewer and didn't want to see it go, but it really required too much supervision than I felt comfortable with. 1
I ordered these as a gift in June. They tasted great! They did not arrive in picture perfect condition due to the heat but I was contacted by the company to see what they could do for me.  The strength of a company is not found in things that go correctly but rather in the things that go wrong and what they do about them.  I would recommend them highly 5
I thought I would change up my dogs food from Newmans organic to this product but it was terrible my dog refused and when i put cooked chicken in it and the dog at it the dog had massive diarreha. I threw it away. 1
I love the Green Mountain Nantucket coffee. It is every thing I hoped it would be.The taste and aroma is awesome. I certainly will purchase it again and again. Try it. You just might love it as I do. I get my coffee through Amazon and it is so easy and delivery is quick.  Pamela Hebert 5
There isn't much to say other than the delivery was great and the candy was fresh and chewy. Eating alone the bag lasted me 2 months. Great for the price and I'd order again!!! 5
I Recently bought a 3 pack of this coffee at Bed Bath and Beyond. As its brewing, it smells great (if you like coconut).  The taste isn't bad, but for me, it has that artificial after taste that many flavored coffees have. I gave it 3 stars because it's not terrible. But I wouldn't buy this coffee again. If you're sensitive to after taste, I wouldn't recommend. I'd Grab a dark roast and throw some fresh coconut in there instead if you want a coconut coffee. 3
I was initially delighted with this gum for I thought I'd found something I could<br />chew without the attendant gas and GI upset.<br /><br />It wasn't too long though before I noteced that I really sort of craved the gum and it<br />sort of turned into an addiction I'd say.<br /><br />The craving, and chewing continued until a sensation of intraoral ulcers developed which took about a week to resolve. I'm off the gum now but still crave it.<br /><br />Interesting.<br /><br />Probably just me. 3
I had really high hopes for these, but I tasted them and so did another family member, and have come to the conclusion that these are horrible tasting.  Not the texture I expected at all... just tiny little flakes with little, but bad, flavor in it.  I am not fussy at all with my foods, I'll eat about anything but these, I need to give away or feed to the birds.  Sorry,1 star.  I would still be up to trying other varieties though... 1
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SATIBO">Davidson's Tea Bulk, Earl Grey, 16-Ounce Bag</a><br />When received outer box was fine. However, package inside was open and tea was spilled. Attention to packaging is required. 3
I love these things.  Unlike other products, this actually tastes really good.  I would recommend this to my family and friends. 5
I grew up in New England.  We had Cake Mate sprinkles or jimmies.  They are made in Florida by Signature Foods. I still get them when I go back as they are in the grocery stores.  The CK ones are okay, and I thought they would be quite similar -- same bad hydrogenated oils and the reviews.  These are certainly fine for a cupcake.  But for ice cream or the occasional spoonful of sprinkles, you need the Cake Mate.  These are available in 32 oz. from spiceworld online.  They are listed on Amazon but not as currently available.  I plan to get some soon. 3
I bought this thinking it would be a lot like regular whipped cream. Just tried it and the taste is nothing like it. Not what I expected it tastes really bad 1
We bought two from Williams Sonoma.  I loved them so much that when I saw them listed on Amazon, I bought another one.  They are perfect for making baby food and for freezing small portions of often used items like tomato paste.  I also froze 1 Tbsp portions to use when I cook.  Love this product! 5
Pros: Easy to use. Plug it in, set your levels and go! Works well with Condenser Mics. Has 48v Phantom Power. Runs solely off USB (No need for a wall wart).<br /><br />Cons: Very plastic. Feels like it could snap with the slightest bit of rough handling! I wouldn't try to plug it directly into a mic. Use an XLR cable. No headphone monitoring jack and quite a bit of latency when monitoring with a separate interface. I would not recommend it for Dynamic mics. I tried it with my Rode Procaster Dynamic Mic and could not get high enough levels without practically yelling into the mic. I also tried it with an old V-Tech handheld stage mic and levels were a little better, so dynamics with a higher line output might work better with it.<br /><br />Overall, it does what it's supposed to, but it could be a lot better. For about $30-40 more, you can get better interfaces with 2 mic inputs, but this one is nice for situations where running off of USB power is a must. 4
I bought this puzzle toy for my mini aussie pup.  While he was able to figure this one out rather quickly, he still gets excited when I put it on the floor.  I love that it's plastic and easy to clean.  I have several other interactive treat toys that I use mainly for feeding purposes: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KV7ZGQ">Premier Busy Buddy Tug-A-Jug, Medium/Large</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002I0RLW">Premier Pet Busy Buddy Twist 'N Treat Dog Toy, Small</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ALMW0M">Kong Wobbler Dog Toy</a>,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ARUKU0">Smarter Toys 3-Inch IQ Treat Ball Dog Toy</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JVDV30">KONG Genius Leo Dog Toy, Extra Large (Colors vary)</a>, and other assorted Kong toys.  One might say that this pup is spoiled, but he's got so many toys to explore that he seldom gets into puppy mischief. 4
I buy these through the ship-and-save program because they are a staple of my breakfast and midday snack routine.<br />Light, flavorful, and full of vitamins, these only take 20-25 minutes to bake with minimal extras. I am vegan so I use egg substitutes  (3 tbsps flax seed in place of the eggs with 9 Tbs water) and they still bake perfectly. 5
I was hoping to enjoy a raspberry iced mocha with this but, it tastes like cough medicine. Stick with Monin and Torani if you want to enjoy your flavoured mochas. 2
I received the K-cups on time and in execellant condition. I usually drink coffee, but at night the Hot cocoa is good with a snack, just before bed. 5
IF YOU HAVE REALLY SENSITIVE SKIN AND IS IRRITATED EASILY BY HARSH PRODUCTS THEN THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT FOR YOU..IT BURNED INSTANTLY ON CONTACT WITH MY SKIN...IT BURNED LIKE HELL..SO UNLESS YOU ARE WILLING TO TOLERATE THE BURN TILL YOUR SKIN COOLS DOWN AND THAT TAKES A WHILE..I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT...IT WAS SUCH A WASTE OF MY MONEY..I'M JUST GONNA GIVE IT AWAY..DONT BE FOOLED BY ALL THE "GOOD INGREDIENTS"..ITS VERRRY IRRITATING.. 2
well it was nice that they showed up early but they were all broken into itty bitty pieces. i didnt order pieces of cookies i ordered whole cookies. 2
I purchased this as a Christmas present for my father. It arrived quickly, but the expiration date was too soon. For someone used to complete, just add water mixes, I thought this might be a nice change. With such a short expiration date, he didn't feel he would get the time to make this special breakfast before the mix expired. It was a waste of money. I wonder how long this sat on the shelf before it was shipped out. 1
There is an image displaying 20 different K cups, you do not get that in this package. Beware of the Fine Print. I received Doubles of 10 different brands.  Some of the brands I received were shown in the picture and some were not.  We were hoping to try the Starbucks blonde brand and that one was not in the box, but it is featured in the picture to the bottom right. I would not buy this product again. 1
I tried this product solely for the fact it has Wolfgang's name on it.  I should have stuck with Timothy's brand.  This was way too strong to be labeled a breakfast coffee, more like a dinner coffee.  I will not be buying this again, also way too expensive compared to the others. 2
The crab meat layer on top is about a 1/4" (I'm being generous in my measurement)w/ the rest being tuna and a substantial share of broth. Of course my cats loved it and each devoured a whole can. I felt it was quite overpriced for tuna and will not purchase again. I think it's much more cost-effective to buy a can of Phillip's crab meat from the grocery store so my cats and I can both enjoy it. 2
I tried this, just one can, and am glad I had not bought more.  I do admire the company for coming up with an alternative to typical soft drinks but it's not for me.  I'd describe it as a sickeningly sweet syrup with very little carbonation added.  Plenty of carbonation is essential to a soft drink, it makes it sparkly and refreshing, plus it counteracts the sweetness.  As I said I'm glad it was just one can, my only regret is that I wasted 1.5 ounces of perfectly good vodka trying to make it more palatable and it didn't. 1
Unfortunately, Good Earth now contains artificial flavoring - it is confirmed on the box in front of me and on their website - [...]<br />I am hoping that if many consumers raise their voices, we can have them go back to using original flavors - their Facebook site is at [...]and they can be called at 1-888-625-8227  Mon - Fri: 8:00AM - 8:00PM EST<br /><br />I LOVE Good Earth Tea - lets keep it good by having them stop including artificial flavoring 1
I really like this cappuccino.  It is very tasty.  We add a little Torani flavoring to ours.  The only reason for the 4 stars and not 5 is because the Skinny version is better, less calories.<br /><br />This cappuccino is better than any K-Cup.  It's like going to Starbucks, but at home. 4
I ... like so many others who observe Thanksgiving, think that the holiday simply isn't complete without a slice of pumpkin pie.  And while it is one of the healthier desserts out there (well, I like to think it is, anyway, because of the pumpkin), it is still not at all what I'd consider healthy or low fat or low calorie.<br /><br />But ... this is the perfect alternative to those who feel guilty after indulging in a slice of pumpkin pie.  THIS is pumpkin pie without the guilt!  It has the flavor of Matcha in it (of course), but also the sweet, delicious, rich and savory taste of pumpkin, a touch of cinnamon, and the buttery taste of pastry in there.  So yummy!<br /><br />I recommend trying this one as a latte.  I used a 1:1 ratio here, using 1 part hot water to 1 part warmed milk.  This helped bring out the creaminess of the pumpkin pie, and also brought out the pastry notes as I had a hard time tasting them without the milk.<br /><br />Scrumptious! 4
The bottle I was unlucky enough to sample was imported by Moet Hennesy. I'm curious if the importer swapped the contents of the bottle. It must be that or Ardbeg has the best hype machine on the planet.<br /><br />The initial aroma is that of rubbing alcohol with a hint of fusel alcohol, although my friend likes the aroma. On tasting, it doesn't have much flavor. The aftertaste is another story entirely. It's hard to describe. Initially it's just a hint of medicine that progresses to a NyQuil type flavor and then on to.... something.<br /><br />I've had peaty flavored scotch but I cannot recommend... whatever that was. 1
Received the shipment promptly but to my dismay, it did not contain the mini treats I had ordered, but "small", which were not that small.  I have very small dogs and I really wanted the minis. I contacted the seller (Petco) and after several days, they responded that I could return them but if I reordered minis, they would still send the small because Amazon had the item numbers wrong and they don't have minis. They said the simplest thing would be to return them for credit. This did not seem economically feasible, so I am breaking each one into small pieces which is very inconvenient. 3
My dog loves these and everyone I have shared with agrees it's a great snack. Why feed grains and "dog bones" when you can offer a high protein healthy snack that promotes good health! 5
I should have known when the product told me to rinse it for several minutes to get rid of the putrid smell - smells like they shipped dead fish heads to me. These are awful and I can't imagine anyone liking this crap. The taste is just as bad too. 1
These bars are simply delicious. They dont have that "gluten-free-I'm-missing-something" feeling like most bars that are GF.<br />They have the perfect amount of chocolate and coconut,etc. Im hooked. 5
I AM TRYING TO FIND THE PERFECT COFFEE FOR MY TASTE.  THIS COFFEE IS GOOD, BUT WOULD NOT BE MY FIRST CHOICE. 3
After buying bags one at a time (at a hefty markup) at nearby stores, I decided to try bulk ordering some snack foods on Amazon. I was very pleased with the price and the products.<br /><br />These jalapeno kettle chips are not overly spicy; they have a slow-building spice that starts very subtly a grows if you eat the whole bag, which I'm embarrassed to say I did quite a few times.<br /><br />The chips arrived well-packed and fresh. They had nearly a year of time before they expired, which is pretty impressive for chips.<br /><br />Most importantly, the price-per-bag was much, MUCH better than any local store could do, although I live near an expensive city, so that may play a role in the price difference.<br /><br />I wouldn't hesitate to order another box of these once I run out. 5
I've tried other conditioners in the Clear line and for some reason this one was a little lackluster. I figured with the addition of Shea butter, this conditioner would have even more moisturizing power, but it was just average. My hair was soft, but it didn't feel completely moisturized. I had to use a leave-in to achieve the desired results. I was also a little disappointed in the scent. It didn't have the wow factor of the other conditioners and seemed bland. Overall, this was product was average. 3
I like the taste of this dressing, but realized that it contains the additive mono sodium gluconate. This chemical gives me migraines, which is very difficult to tolerate. I am sorry to say that I will no longer purchase this dressing unless they remove this flavor enhancer. 1
I buy these cookies for company.  I opened one and the chocolate was melted to the wrapper and the cookies were broken in three places.  I am not serving this to my company.  Not happy with the way they arrived.  That's okay I only have 25 to get rid of.  They should know their product and that it wouldn't be good to send it to Nevada in 104 degree weather.  I don't know what to say about the pieces they showed up in.  ASfter putting them in the freezer the chocolate was still stuck to the wrapper.  People in the SW don't buy these cookies in the summer. 2
I have been struggling to find them in the shops nearby.<br />Much more convenient to order them through Amazon (slightly more expensive, but I save the gas and the burden). 4
I recieved this item the other day and while the packaging looks really nice, It was much smaller than expected, although the "brews 60 cups" is right, only if you use the super tiny 6oz cups that are on your coffee maker or like your coffee pretty weak.<br /><br />I would say that these bags are pretty small and you "might" get 3 coffee maker uses per bag if you're lucky, probably more like 2 uses per bag as they are much smaller than expected.  The quality of the product is VERY good however and I'm sure my brother in law will love this gift since he usually drinks awful folgers!<br /><br />Shipped fast and I would order from them again for gift purposes! 4
This was the best pancake/waffle mix ever! Wonderful for breakfast or dinner. It was a great price and worth it! My husband and boys kept complimenting the waffles I made and ate them fast--I could hardly keep up. Definitely recommend Stonewall Kitchen Farmhouse pancake and waffle mix! You do have to add a few ingredients, but it is well worth the effort. 5
This is a great, yummy snack! It's healthy and easy to grab on the go AND still tastes great. I would recommend it to anyone, especially if you love Banana Nut Bread... it tastes just like the real thing. 4
I have been buying Green Mountain Dark Magic for a long time....not only did my recent shipment have different packing inside, but the coffee too has changed, and not for the better....it is much weaker, and I am sorely dissapointed....I even emailed Green Mountain regarding this change, and they did not even have the courtesy to respond! I will not be buying Green Mountain anymore. 2
My dog wasn't too crazy about these, but more importantly, the contents didn't seem especially healthy and his poop was runny. Of course, dogs vary, but for my dog at least I'll stick with the dental chews. 3
I always drink one cup of coffee on the way to work.  Emerils coffee is bold and full of flavor and with a little vanilla creamer added it's the perfect way to get my day started. 5
This beverage is best consumed hot in late afternoon, especially after a meal or snack.  The ginger is energizing but calming to the stomach.  It is sweetened with crystallized honey, which gives it a natural sweetness much more pleasant than beverages sweetened with sugar or artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />I shared a hot cup of this beverage with my roommate who had a sour stomach.  The ginger soothed his stomach.  As for me, I enjoy a hot cup of this just for its strong ginger flavor and clean taste.  It's easy to mix and enjoy, and I don't have to wait for it to steep, nor do I have to add sweetener; I simply mix it with hot water and enjoy.<br /><br />I recommend this product for anyone who has indigestion after meals, wants an invigorating drink without the caffeine, or likes the flavor of ginger. 4
I like to have the boxed meals that don't require refrigeration handy in my office for quick lunches. I have tried the Hornel and taco bell meals but they tend to be dry and very processed tasting. Healthy choice does take a little more preperation but it's worth the time because they taste better. The rice and pasta taste and feel more like the natural kind. 4
Jamaica Me Crazy is an awesome smooth coffee, Light Coconut/Vanilla flavorful taste.<br />a good coffee if you don't like real strong coffee.Highly recommend. 5
I have tried many "energy drinks" and try to use them sparingly, but with everyone's overloaded schedules these days, it's easy to see why people buckle under for some "magic" pick me up sometimes. This particular drink is one of, if not the worst I've ever tried! It's so sweet that you will wince while swallowing this stuff. It also has a terrible taste(whatever flavor it is?)that will not leave you wanting more, but will leave a "I can't wait until it's over" sensation. If you want a good one that doesn't effect your stomach(like me, if I drink three cups of coffe, my stomach is wrenched!) try Celcius, it's very low carb and doesn't make you run out of gas. Like all of these drinks, it's easy to become addicted to them, use only when you just need a boost and not just because you like to ZING! ha-ha! ....Oh yeah and you all know the "magic" is caffeine... right? ;-b 1
I was so excited to get these.  After WLS it's hard to find a savory snack with protien. Sooo I open the package and they are SUPER SALTY!! I like salt but these are runner up to a hamsters salt lick. Also a very strange texture.  If I were you I'd pass on these.  I gave it two stars for effort.  But I have a box of 15 left if anyone wants 'em. 2
I am a FULL-ON tea drinker.  I drink green tea and black tea all day long and when it comes to my breakfast tea, it HAS to be a one-two punch or I'll revert back to my bad coffee habit.  I quit about a year ago but I do still ache for that incomparable aroma that only coffee can give!!  I am having a pretty good go of my Twinings Breakfast Tea and TAZO's Awake still does it for me but I'm always on the look-out for a stronger breakfast tea and TAYLOR's is NOT IT!  I wan't the equivalent of starbucks for my black tea so sometimes I double-up on the tea bags.  I could have dumped the entire box of Taylor's in my cup and it still would have been too meek and mild for me.  So, if you enjoy a cup of flavored water with a tinge of black food coloring, this is just the tea for you :) 2
Ok So I saw a Video of this online and I was like Dang I really want to make this at home. So I bought it and Wow the shipping is fast.  I've bought things from different countries and this shipping is fast considering that it's from japan. Well let me tell you about my experience with this candy.  Making it is fun it takes about 10-15 mins. to make it and you can get the instructions in English from [...]. The best part was making the fish eggs. The texture of the fish eggs is cool because it is like a skin around the egg and liquid in the center.  The rice smells like Sour apple and the fish eggs were sweet. The taste of the Fish gelatin (Red colored Gelatin) and the egg gelatin (The Yellow Colored Gelatin) was not too tasty.  It felt weird and not normal in my mouth and wouldn't eat it again.<br />I consider  this to be a fun little gift for a young teen or a kid that likes to make food. 4
My local store was running a special on these, so I decided to give them a try.  They were ok, but I don't think I'd be getting them again if faced with the choice between these and another brand.  A good flavor was quickly followed up by a bad after-taste.<br /><br />The barbecue on this was the sweet smoky type of barbecue.  And it was good, a very addicting flavor.  The problem was the aftertaste that started a few seconds after the barbecue flavor melted away.  To me it tasted of straight rice flour, which is a very acquired taste and one that I've never been able to acquire.  It didn't help that these chips had the texture of Styrofoam either.  Between that and the rice flour taste I just couldn't enjoy them fully.<br /><br />The ingredients, however, are very good in this chip.  They're made of potato, use sunflower and safflower oils and the seasoning even has everything I can pronounce.  Although I am always suspicious when the designation "spices" is used without spelling out what those spices are.  And there was some rice flour in the mix which explains the aftertaste, but it was the last ingredient in the listing, meaning there shouldn't have been too much.  But I could still taste it.<br /><br />.8 oz is 100 calories for these chips, and it's a fair serving of the chips.  Enough for a small snack.  The bag boasts that they are all natural, and they are gluten free.  And there's no preservatives.  Sodium is about 7% of the daily value, which isn't outrageously high either.  All in all, they aren't extremely great for a person on a diet, but they aren't the worst thing you can eat, especially if you want a bag of chips.<br /><br />Maybe with a different flavor if they eliminated the rice flour I could bring myself to eat these again.  But since for now it's still there, I'll be steering clear.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012 3
I ordered these just to have a lot of gummies. I did wait till after the summer so I didn't worry about them being melted. They arrived nice and quick no issues there. Started eating them and they are stale hard to chew. Not the soft chewy funniest I was hoping for. It is my fault for not ever trying to return them. Oh well stick with buying from a store locally then you don't spend so much on them and the shipping. 2
After drinking some most excellent coffee in Hungary, I discovered it was Douwe Egberts coffee, so I ordered some from Amazon.  After paying almost as much in postage as the package of coffee cost, I was extremely disappointed in the coffee itself.  The package I received was stale and flavorless.  I can buy Tully's French Roast at the supermarket for about $7 per 12 ounces, and it is far better coffee, fresh, with a rich aroma, full bodied flavor and no harshness or bitterness. 1
Do not buy these for your dog! I made the mistake of not researching Greenies Dental Chews online before buying these. If you Google the Greenies and how sick it may make your dog you will be shocked these are still on the market. Dogs have died eating this deadly poisonous treat.<br /><br />I saw the reviews on this product and I bought the teenies for my Yorkshire Terrier and gave it to him at night after his dinner. I figured since its for 5-15 lb dogs and his first time, I'll give him just half of the teenie. The next morning he didn't eat and he threw up bile and some of the food he ate from the night before. And remember I only gave him 1/2 a piece; imagine if I gave him an entire piece, it might get obstructed in his intestines.<br /><br />I complained to Amazon and they wanted to send me a replacement. Seriously? Like after all that for making my dog sick, you think that I should try it again? Plus they wanted the Greenies back. For what? To resell this poison? They wouldn't even mail me a box to return it. Eventually they just decided to send me a refund and that I can discard the Greenies.<br /><br />I just want to warn pet owners of this danger. There are plenty of similar complaints on this product if you research online. Please take care of your pets! 1
At first I was thinking, "cheese flavored chips?"  But I love them.  The herbs they used are just delicious.  The cheese is not overpowering.  They are yummy and crispy!! 5
Definitely not extra bold...medium roast at best.  Not particularly memorable...doesn't have a good coffee aroma...but it's pretty decent tasting.  At this point I'm not sure if I would reorder. 4
I bought this food back in February and the bag is still sitting in the pantry almost completely full. The dog simply will not eat it. I tried everything I could think of to get him to eat it: mixed in a little olive oil (which usually does the trick for him with other food; didn't work), mixed it with grated cheese (somehow the dog managed to eat just the cheese), mixed it with yogurt (he begs for anything that's dairy; no dice), mixed it turkey grease after browning ground turkey (he ate 2 bites, and that was it). I even ate a kibble of it myself just to see, and honestly it didn't taste that bad, kind of like very bland, grainy-vegetable granola. So, I figured that when he got hungry enough, he'd eat it. For 3 days he ate nothing, and finally on day 4, I broke down and bought other food. 1
the true test is that our cats really loves the grass we grow from these seeds! and they grew very easily in pots, too. 5
This coffee isn't bad but it's nowhere near as good as the Gavalia Morning Roast.  It has a decent flavor and is fine if you don't like a strong coffee.  If I couldn't get the Gavalia Morning Roast, I would buy this coffee again but it would not be my first choice. 3
I love drinking hot tea and some of my favorites have lots of lemon. Figuring the ginger would be an interesting addition I thought I would give this a try. The drink dissolved completely into a dark yellow brew but the ginger flavor was way to powerful and I couldn't taste any lemon at all. I used 8 oz of water and when that was too strong I watered it down but that did nothing to diminish the ginger. In fact the tea even had a "hot" taste as if there was chili in it. I'll pass on this one. 2
While I knew that the product was small and expensive I also knew my dog would love it. Here's the problem as I see it. The elk rack is realy an excellent product in and of it self, but when you add the cost o f the product and the shipping it is way too expensive. So I checked around both on line and off-line. I found many other sites and places which have the same produc at a much more reasonable cost. So much for believing that Amazon offered a good value. Hope you find this informative. 2
Our retriever, Elvis, tried to open the package himself.  After a little assistance from opposable thumbs, he stuck his snout into the bag and retrieved one.  It didn't last long.<br /><br />This is indeed an all-organic product, according to the label, and this company has enough integrity that it's not in doubt.  Barley, lamb, carrots, apples, palm oil, and molasses, all listed as certified organic by Oregon Tilth.  Low fat (4%), crunchy, about the size and shape of a Fig Newton.<br /><br />I used to joke about organic foods.  Having read up on the subject, I find that it's verifiably (not just anecdotally) healthier for humans to avoid preservatives and other artificial additives.  Natural foods are more easily and fully digested, and don't tax the system as much as the cheaper products with long lists of additives.  It stands to reason your dog's system is the same.<br /><br />Elvis will have a hunk o' hunk o' organic Newman treats, please.  While he WILL eat anything but okra (no joke), he's not always this enthusiastic about it.  Mr. Newman, keep up the good work. 5
I bought this product for the fiber in prune juice to aid in my son's constipation. Compared to regular prune juice which has about 1.5 g fiber in 4 oz this juice has 0 g fiber in the same volume. The ingredients just list apple and prune juice but don't list how much of each. Clearly it's more apple than prune. If your kid likes to drink apple and prune juice then this product is fine but if you're looking for something to help with constipation you should look elsewhere.  What a waste. 1
These taste good and are edible but I am only giving 1 star to let people know that this product tastes like Pistachios to me, not almonds. I don't know why. If I wanted Pistachios I would've bought them. I had a craving for almonds and these just don't do the trick. They also contain a weird ingredient; CORN MALODEXTRIN. WHY?! They are ALMONDS! All you need is almonds and salt, maybe oil! So much for being "All natural". 1
I thought I would be getting some outstanding popcorn for $7.50 for a small bag of popcorn but what I received is stale, chewy popcorn. I am appalled. 1
You might want to see a video on how to open this bottle before you order it.  There is an instruction on how to open this bottle but their hard to see due to small words.  Taste like Seven Up.  Quantity is very small. 1
The noodles are cracked and brittle when you mix in the hot water. Taste was fine but I couldn't get over the inconsistent texture of the noodles. 2
If you're looking for a great grain free alternative to beef or chicken, this is it. My two girls loved it. We used to put some in their Kongs, then put in dry food and then seal the end with more wet food and put it in the freezer so that dinner would become more of a challenge. The only con with this food is that it can be pricey, as are most Wellness products. You could probably get the same results you're looking for from a grain free food with something like Taste of the Wild, which is what we've gone to because of cost. 4
My baby likes the mac n cheese in the jars. So, when I couldn't find the jars at the store I was at, I tried these mac n cheeses thinking they were the same. They are not. She doesn't like these. Maybe it is a texture issue mainly as these are much runnier than the jar kind. Looking for more mac n cheese jars. 2
As our household attempts to eat better quality products, we've taken to trying to do the same for our favorite four-legged friends...unfortunately, the dogs seem to prefer hot-dogs over organic treats every time. We've tried local home-made peanut butter ones that seemed to rank one wag and a yawn. We tried another major brand organic treats that resulted in a look like "are you kidding?". We even tried a different Newmand's that ended up getting tossed - the dogs literally wouldn't touch them and acted outright offended at the suggestion this was their "treat". On the other hand, these were a hit. Rather than acting offended, they actually seemed to enjoy these. Bottom line - pooch approved. 5
I have been drinking hibiscus tea off and on since 1984.  When I went to Germany in 1984, my mother told me that it is quite popular there for blood pressure issues, so every day while I was there I drank it.  When I came back to the US I found it and drank it for a number of years.<br /><br />About a year ago my husband's blood pressure became elevated because of health problems he is experieincing.  So, I went to the local co-op and got some hibiscus tea.  Ever since he started drinking it his blood pressure has been in the normal range -- well under 120/80. 5
These chips remind me of a long obsolete brand of chips we could get in middle school. They are by far the tastiest chips I've had and it's impossible to walk past the aisle without picking up the trademark blue bag and then putting the bag clip on the bag! 5
I am currently deployed so getting good coffe like we can easily access back at home isn't always readily available. But this canister has still lasted us quite a bit and everyone loves the taste. and considering our location, it got here within a reasonable amount of time. 5
I bought these based on all the great reviews but I did not like them at all. The chocolate cookie is not too bad but the filling was not good at all. Had a strange aftertaste. My child likes them so at least someone does and I do not have to throw them out. I will not be ordering again! 2
I bought 2 cases of these chips because I heard nothing but great things about this brand and this flavor of chip in particular. However, upon receiving them today, I saw that although they state NO MSG, they DO contain Yeast Extract which acts exactly as MSG does and therefore I cannot eat them. Unfortunately ALL Kettle chips contain this ingredient so I am unable to eat any of them. I don't think I can return them but I got them at a cheap price so I will donate them or see if Amazon can let me return them since the description was a bit misleading. These chips are MUCH healthier than many other brands, so if you are not MSG sensitive, I say dig in! 3
I like all halo products but this canned cat food is just a little too soupy.  My cats look at me with "What's this?" .<br />They like a little something to chew on. 3
Got these with a one-day shipping delay, but still very quickly with Amazon Prime.  The taste is quite good, perhaps a little on the sweet side - especially when you hit a pocket of white chocolate.  The big problem is the condition of the product when it arrives.  I opened my first 2-pack and the granola bars were crushed into nuggets and powder.  Strangely, the box wasn't in bad shape, just the bars.  A few days later, I opened the other box of granola bars, which was in better shape than the first one, and the first pack I tried again contained smashed fragments of granola bars.  These are no fun to eat, as you can't really open the pack and pour it into your mouth (I tried), and if you pick out the big chunks you get fragments and powder sticking to your fingers, and on your clothes (and in your beard).  I'll eat the rest, maybe out of a bowl with a spoon or something (with some fava beans and a nice chianti...), but I won't be ordering any more crunched Clif Crunch bars. 2
My love affair with miso, the flavorful paste made from fermented soybeans, started when I lived in Tokyo several years ago.  So, since then, being the miso snob that I am, it has been unimaginable to me to try any instant variety.  But I have to say that when I finally did break down and try Kikkoman Instant Tofu Miso Soup, I was amazed to find that it was practically indistinguishable in flavor and consistency from miso soup made from the actual paste.  While I would still choose the actual product whenever time permits, I would now not hesitate to substitute this great product when I am on the run. 3
This gravy is great!  1/4 cup has only 50 calories and 6 grams of carbs, which has helped my husband loose over 20 pounds.  How?  Well the low carbs helped, but the main feature that makes low-cal/low-carbs part of the formula work, is the great taste.  This gravy has got a peppery tang that makes it just right for spicing up eggs or chicken or anything else you might through a white pepper gravy over.<br /><br />And I don't know if you have tried other packaged sauces, but I have, and generally they aren't very good even when freshly made.  Worse, these sauces tend to get 'strange' in the fridge overnight.  (Oddly watery, or jell-like... yuck)  This S&M Gravy mix doesn't do that, which means that it's good for several meals.<br /><br />Highly recommended for the gravy-challenged.  My southern reared husband is a content... and thin.<br /><br />Pam T~<br />mom, reviewer at large, and wife to gravy lover 5
i have been clean and sober almost 23 yrs. and never got into energy drinks but the local wal mart was giving free samples, small cups so i took one, i felt kind of tired but after drinking just a small cup, felt 'great' body and mind so, i bought a 3 pack. 4.88, they only have grape and i've never liked grape, anything but it was o.k. but kind of expensive for 3 drinks but i figured if that tiny cup made me feel, 'that' good, each tube would last me a while.  i gave 4 stars because in my experience, when it gets too 'hot', the tube,  on two occasions, i put one in my pocket, pulled it out later to pour into a cold bottle of water and even though i poured some of the water out of the bottle, it FIZZED UP AND OUT and made a mess, i think the GOOD STUFF gets lost when this happens, has only happened when it was hot and i did not feel ANYthing after, NO ZIPP, like it all came out.  i am going to try just drinking the amount i drank in the 'sample cup' maybe drinking the whole tube, is too much for me becasue i noticed i get almost wired and that's something i don't want to be, any more, just feel 'good' 4
We really have to limit additives and sugar for our son with Autism. Switch Orange Tangerine really fills the bill. He feels like he's getting "real" fizzy soda, and mommy is happy it's not loaded with chemicals and additives and actually has real juice in it. A total win-win. 5
I was not very happy when i recieved my order. All the cookies were melted. Very good product. Word of advise. Don't buy any products in the summer time that will melt. 3
coffee maker is okay, but does not make a full cup of coffee, even when you select the larger cup. Kind of dissapointing. 3
As you can see by my name, I am a green, organic mom blogger, and always try to shop accordingly.  I was already a big fan of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5DZU2">Zoe Extra Virgin Olive Oil, 1-Liter Tins (Pack of 2)</a> and was glad to see an organic version.  Unfortunately, though how much we tried to like this, the organic Zoe Organic EVOO just doesn't taste anywhere near as good as the non-organic variety.  This organic one definitely tastes like it's made from a whole different variety of olives, leaving it with a pronounced sharper, greener flavor with a bit of a bite.  It's very distinct, and totally overpowers my cooking.  The non-organic Zoe EVOO doesn't do this; it blends in perfectly as a marinade, for dipping bread, drizzling as a final touch on cooked dishes, etc.  So, unfortunately, in this case, go with the non-organic, which I have on Subscribe & Save reorder, and is a pantry staple in our house. 3
PROS<br />-great to start as finger foods (easier than cheerios to pick up and eat)<br />-dissolves quickly (less of a choking hazard)<br />-baby loves them!<br /><br />CONS<br />-stains!  As the baby drools on his hands or loses a half-eaten puff, it leaves a bright orange stain on clothing, rugs, etc.  Not easy to get out, and a lot of the other flavors are more neutral colored and do not stain as much as the sweet potato.  The last thing I want to do is have to wash his highchair cover and straps, rugs, clothes, etc because of bright orange stains all around.<br />-cheaper versions available (ie, at Target they have their own brands)<br />-does have sugar (I wish they can make a low or non-sugar version, because I'm pretty sure the baby will still eat them.  Why add unnecessary sugar into everything?)<br /><br />I started with the Gerber sweet potato, but I'll be sticking to the Target blueberry (because it's cheaper and doesn't stain) 2
The dark chocolate flavor of this NEWMAN'S OWN ORGANICS DARK CHOCOLATE BAR is mild, compared to dark chocolate bars manufactured by specialty candy makers (for example, See's Candies).  But the flavor is quite good, especially for a "commercial" candy bar designed for general sale in grocery stores.  Unlike many health food store "organic" products, this "organic" chocolate bar leaves no unpleasant aftertaste.<br /><br />The bar (approximately 2.5" x 4.5") breaks into six large snack pieces. One bar (one serving) weighs 64 grams, has 330 calories (200 fat calories), and 22 grams total fat.  There are 5 grams sodium, 37 grams carbohydrates, 4 grams fiber, 28 grams sugar, and 3 grams protein.<br /><br />The label warns that the bar is manufactured on equipment that may have been used to process other products containing peanuts, other nuts, milk powder, wheat, soy and egg (although the bar itself contains none of these).  The bar is 54% cocoa (Rainforest Alliance Certified).<br /><br />Because I'm a big fan of "Newman's Own" products, I was eager to try this offering from the "Newman's Own Organics" line.  It did not disappoint. 4
I'm torn. I love these strips. They feel like the real thing and they taste great (even my dog loves it...he doesn't care if it's veggie), but they're so moist. They're marinating inside the package, and I understand that it probably needs to stay that way to keep the flavor, but it just doesn't feel like real beef jerky because it isn't dry. I've had thoughts about buying a dehydrator and laying these things inside for a few minutes. I've laid them out on napkins to dry them out, and that worked fine, but...bits of napkin get left behind and they aren't as tasty.<br /><br />I'm giving these 3 stars because they're good, and I do like them, but I really feel like they're just too moist to be considered jerky. 3
I was really looking forward to having this little snack arrive.  However, when I tried it for the first time, I tasted an unexpected flavor.  After trying it a few times and then disecting it, I realized that there were raisins in it.  Unfortunately, no one in my family likes raisins.  After checking the list of ingredients on the website and the product package, there is no mention of raisins. Putting all of that aside, I think this product would be tasty to those of you who like raisins.  I must warn you that I think the presence of the raisins make this Pecan Honey Crunch more like Pecan Honey Chewy.<br /><br />Amazon's cutomer service was quick to respond and helped me fix the problem.  Thanks, Amazon! 2
THESE TREATS ARE THE ONLY ONES MY 14 YEAR OLD DOG WILL EAT. SHE LOVES THEM. 5
I don't understand all the hype over this product! It's o.k., but Top Ramen is so much less! 3
I was not expecting this coffee to actually be shipped from Jamaica, so I was pleasantly surprised to find a FedEx International package at my door.  One cannot argue that it didn't come from Jamaica! I assumed it would be shipped via a distributor in the US.  I guess that just proves what they say about assuming...<br /><br />The coffee is real smooth and enjoyable.  Unlike other "Jamaica grown" products I tried during my youth - this one you can proudly admit you really did inhale the sweet aroma!<br /><br />It comes packed in a burlap bag with the sealed coffee bag inside, just like the picture.  It arrived fresh.<br /><br />As with any of these boutique coffees, you pay a premium - like the Hawaiian Kona coffees - so it's really a matter of taste and the depth of your pocketbook if you think they are worth the price. 5
My cat and my neighbor's cats would not eat this food. I wound up giving the case to the cat rescue organization. 1
This is the strangest thing I've ever seen.  Imagine your roll on deodorant container  being filled with some bacon flavored  gravy and then allowing your dog to lick from it for his daily treat!  Are you kidding me?  This idea is gross and unsanitary and how do you get a dog to understand the concept that they are only supposed to take a few licks and that's their treat.  My dog kept trying to grab the container, she thought I was trying to tease her with it.  Finally I started rolling it on the dry milk bone type treats that she's not crazy about to get her to eat them.  If they called it "Dog Bone Icing" it might sell better  and make more sense. 1
This is my first time trying Wabash Valley Farms Amish Country Baby White.<br /><br />Pros: It's okay with a nice mild nutty flavor. The hulls are more pronounced than with some other Amish "Baby White."<br /><br />Cons: It tends not to briskly pop up. In fact, we've burned several pans because popping it is tricky. We found that the microwave often works better than pan popping. And as mentioned above, the hulls are much more noticeable than with other Amish "Baby White" brands.<br /><br />We purchased these 6 bags and we'll use them up but won't be ordering any more. Next time we'll drive the long distance to our nearest Amish store. 3
I love these chips. They are excellent! On the Weight Watchers plan they are only 2 points per bag which is GREAT for potatoe chips. LOVE the single serving bags for portion control. Also love Amazon.com for selling them. Can't find them in the stores. I will be ordering these forever. Great product.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RVFDOO">Popchips 6-Flavor Variety Pack of 24 [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>] 5
This is my absolute favorite gluten free baking mix. You "must" add in the suggested "extras" to make the best brownies: 1/2 c sour cream, 1/2 c chocolate chips or chunks. Sometimes takes longer to bake also, so dont overbake, but worth the time/wait! Those who can eat gluten fight over these brownies with me! :-) 5
These plugs were popular with the birds, but they were too small in diameter to stay in the log feeder and, when I tried to knead them into a more usable shape, they just crumbled.  Too much fill and not enough suet? 2
Had this been labeled "green tea with a touch of pomegranate and raspberry essence" I might have rated this higher.  However, the name is pomegranate raspberry and I therefore expected those vary flavors.  The overall taste is mild and muddled.  I except a greater sweetness.  The tea's second ingredient, chamomile, has a distinctive presence.  While I didn't find the flavor to be unpleasant, there is nothing about it that would make me reach for it over one of my other teas. 3
I was disappointed in this product.  Too vinegary.  I was expecting fresh asparagus stored in water.  Gave all of these away as we didnt care for the taste. 1
I do love Stash Honeybush but the tea bag version.  I thought I'll give the lose tea a try.  The tea leaves are cut TOO SMALL!  The sediment is everywhere.  I have to strain it 3 times.  I'm definitely not getting this again. 1
Buy the 2.2-lb. container; you will get much more per dollar.  As noted in the product description, "One 1.25 pound container will cover approximately 50 square feet."  That's basically a 7-foot square.<br /><br />The ingredients do seem to be effective, based on the use of one 1.25-pound container, which kept my neighbor's dog out of a small area for about two days.  This product is an alternative to the several dog repellents, such as Hartz "Stay Off", that use methyl nonyl ketone.  It works about as well but, ounce for ounce, it is much more expensive. 3
My dogs eat this product every day, and I rather other the pack of three because I have 4 dogs.  Thanks again Amazon. 5
I am not a huge fan of canned coffee drinks, but I am always looking for easy coffee. This drink tasted just okay. It had a weird aftertaste that I can't quite describe. The size of the can is adequate. I definitely will not be purchasing this again in the future. If you like convenient, ok tasting coffee to go, this is it. 3
I don't really have much confidence in any commercial pet food,  but the  ingredient list for Newmans's seems better than most. 3
I tried integrating this into my German Shepherd puppy's food.  He is currently on California Natural Lamb and Rice puppy formula, but I have a hard time finding it - so I thought I would switch to this Royal Canin.  He loved it.  But then he started getting diarrhea.  The diarrhea may have been from something he ate in the yard and not the Royal Canin.  Regardless, I donated the Royal Canin to a dog shelter.  This is after I read reviews on it, and discovered it has some bad reviews.  It has lots of fillers in it.  I prefer a more natural, healthier dog food (this is my opinion after what I've read).  There are good websites to compare pet foods and read professional reviews on them. 2
Don't buy this treats unless you want to clean up vomit all day.  These made my mini poodle sick.  :-( 1
I love Cheez-Its, and it makes sense to get multiple boxes instead of one big box because they stay fresher longer. I used to have a Subscribe-and-Save subscription to this item when it was 4 boxes, but then it dropped to 3 boxes and the price stayed the same. Now it's just not worth it to buy here. 1
I must be one of the unlucky ones: mine arrived pulverized!  Bubble wrap on the top only, with no second, outer box. 3
I liked the convenience of this product and the quality was very good, however, you have to be label-savvy to realize that the bowl holds two servings (although it looks like a single-serve package).  So just be prepared to multiply those calories per serving by two (unless you're sharing with a friend). 4
I've been looking all over for this sauce to make my fried rice. I am a little disappointed in the flavor. I used to use LaChoy, but I can no longer find it. It had a wonderful flavor and made my fried rice real authentic tasting. 3
The taste is definately not my thing.  For me it started out bland and as the chill wore off it went downhill from there.  I had to force myself to finish the container.  I did not think that the listed health benefits of the drink made it any better than other drinks of the electrolyte replenishing variety on the market today.  I do like the design of the container and although I was tempted to suggest a straw would be nice it is not absolutely necessary and would just add to the landfills. 1
I'm now on a low sodium diet, and trying to find foods I can still eat.  I love sardines with crackers and cheese, so thought I'd give these Brunswick Lemon & Cracked Pepper Seafood Snacks a try.  At 220 mg of sodium per serving, it's pretty low compared to fish in mustard or hot sauce.  Pretty much what I expected from this...a nice lemon pepper fishy flavor.  Made a nice sandwich, would be great with crackers too.  I'm pretty much a cheapskate, so I don't spend more than $1-$2 a can for sardines or fish steaks.  The price was right for these as well! 4
You would think that something as simple as yellow mustard would be impossible to ruin, but this company seemed to do so. I will never buy this again what a waste of 27$ for subscribe and save. I don't know one guy seemed to this it, It tastes bad to me. 1
Kashi does it again; tasty healthy snack to fill you up and tide you over! 4
Walker's Highlanders are my favorite purchased cookie, so it was great to find them pre-packaged into 2 biscuits. Keeps them fresh longer and limits my snacking! 5
My teens loved it, my husband and I did not. The younger ones liked the extra crunchy peanut taste. Of course what they liked the most was the sweetness. My son felt it had more of a honey taste than sugary and I would agree. They commented that they would like it more as a snack out of the box then in cereal. They still felt that Honey Nut Cheerios was much better tasting with less aftertaste.<br />I thought I was eating caramel corn which I can only tolerate once in a great while and in small doses.  What I was hoping for was that Kellogg's would of listened to all the latest media hype about too much sugar. They didn't. This is way too sweet. I also wish they had used almonds or walnuts in this cereal. The protein to this cereal is only 2g per 3/4 cup. My teens may purchase this on their own but I will not be. I will continue to eat plain Cheerios, adding our own nuts to get some breakfast protein. 3
I just ordered this product for the first time and I was really bummed when I got it yesterday. 7 cans out of 12 were dented pretty good.  Amazon was nice and gave me a full refund. Really sucks the can were damaged i was looking forward to making some organic pumpkin pie. 1
My cats love this brand of food, especially the salmon and turkey flavors. However, they leave the peas and carrots behind. Which makes me feel like I'm not getting my money's worth! However, I've started squishing the carrots into the food, and they seem to be leaving less in their bowls. After trying many brands of canned foods, this is one of the few that they eagerly eat, and it doesn't smell as bad as some. 4
When I bought this I was hoping it would be like peanut butter but almond flavor.  Its not close.  I suppose if you can't eat peanuts this might be an alternative but I would look at other nut butters. 1
Kellogg's is hiding the truth about GMO's , Genetically Modified Organisms. Kellogg's is using the American public as a science experiment. If you really want your mind blown away do some research on GMO's. I will not consume any product which is made with an EPA registered pesticide. 1
I have to admit, I was a sucker for the large quantity, 12 oz, when shopping for hot sauces ...but now seeing the size of the bottle, it reminds of wing-sauce bottle sizes.  Plastic bottle.  It does have a convenient squirt top.  But overall, not very hot or tasty, and made mostly from jalape&ntilde;os.  If I had seen the ingredients list I would not have bought it:<br />Jalapenos<br />Water<br />Vinegar<br />Brown Sugar<br />Lime Juice<br />Fish Sauce<br />Cilantro<br />Habanero<br />Garlic<br />Spice Blend<br />Salt<br />Potassium Sorbate<br />Xanthan Gum 2
If eating delicious cheese were a sin, then consuming these little dry nuggets tastes like the penance for that sin.<br /><br />I wanted to like this product. I bought a box of 16 packets and could not bring myself to finish one. 1
This is Zevia's version of Dr. Pepper.  Does it taste EXACTLY like Dr. Pepper?  No, but when you pretty much stop drinking soda of all kinds, an occasional Dr. Zevia tastes pretty good.  Given it's a healthier alternative, I don't mind the sacrifice in taste.  Amazon has a really good price too (as of this review) compared to what I can buy it for locally in the health food stores/grocers.  I would recommend someone who is a Dr. Pepper or Mr. Pibb addict and interested in an alternative, healthier version to try this brand and flavor. 4
I was very pleased with the Himalayan salt. It really does taste much better than ordinary salt and you can actually taste some of the other minerals in it. I would describe it like licking a salty rock, but in a good way. Very pleased and will be buying more. 5
these edible diamonds did not look shiny like the pictures shown they looked more like molded jello. I would not recommend this product if you want the diamonds to look real. 1
This is an edit so I was unable to change my star rating.  At first I was happy with this canned cat food until the trouble began.  It has caused severe diarrhea in both of my cats who were eating it.  Now I'm in the process of trying to get things back on track.  As anyone who has been in this situation knows, the negative impacts of the situation affect the entire household, not just the poor cats who are suffering from it. 4
I love Haribo gummy bears and although 5 lbs may be alot I love to put them into little snack bags and store them at work, in the car, and in my bookbag when I need to study. I got it at a great price for $11.50 but I did see a 3 lb bag at Target for $6 which is a little cheaper and you don't have to buy so much at a time. 4
I live in a small city in Illinois and it is very hard to find certain products. I was so pleased to see this product. I watch so many programs on the food network..Neely's being one. I wanted this product to make their rub. When it arrived..quickly I may add..you could smell the powerful scent through the package. It was wonderful..strong aroma,color and flavor..This is the perfect product in a perfect size. I once found a small bottle in a specialty store and paid almost 8 dollars for 4oz...I'm not sure how many ounces is in this 6 inch bottle, but it is way more than 4oz.. I also got a great deal on the shipping..I paid 7.95 for the first item and the rest was shipped free...can't beat that! I love this product!!! 5
I recently went gluten free and this is one of my favorite mixes.  I used it for biscuits and pancakes and it's very good.  You can also use it for pizza dough and to make fried chicken - it's about average for that. 5
This is the worst beef jerky I have ever had. It is uneatable. It is impossible to chew -- even my dogs gagged on it! Stick with quality U.S. products and not this cheap South American imported junk. The seller, Wild Bill, doesn't even put any contact information on the packaging to complain to. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RBGEOW">Wild Ride Beef Jerky Cowboy Strips, Original, 16-Ounce Bag</a>. This product is a total waste of money. 1
I wasn't sure about these chips, but thought I would give them a try. These are tasty, crispy chips - and only 100 calories a bag! I like all the flavors included in the variety pack. I definitely will buy again. 5
I got this at a local discount store for $6. It has an excellent flavor and the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead if 5 was personal preference. 4
They sent the wrong size..Didnt even notice until I look at what I bought..New User thats for sure ..Love the product... Drink it every day.. 1
These are definitely not the best taste breadsticks I have ever tried. I wouldnt buy them again. Altough, we also have different tastes.... 3
Bacon Salt isn't a terrible food additive standing alone.  To my mind, however, nothing that costs over two dollars -- I paid $5 for a little bottle -- should contain both corn syrup *and* trans fats.  (Why does a spice need fat?)  I probably shouldn't have paid for it, but I heard rave reviews and was sucked in by the prospect of making my spinach salad taste like hot, salty, fatty pork.  For the money, I can't say it's worth the price.<br /><br />Also, it's a major "caker."  Don't use it for a month, and you've got a brick of barbecue potato chip seasoning. 2
If you put a bowl of this in front of my dog, he will gobble the whole thing up - he really likes, it.  I'm not too sure that is a good thing as, for example, he usually is a self-regulated eater and eats when he is hungry vs. sitting down to what I would compare in human terms of a bowl of buttery popcorn.  I am now only giving him a small portion of this food as a "treat" every now and then and have put him back on his normal, healthier dog food. 3
I don't like the after-taste of the "Butter Flavored Popcorn Topping".....<br /><br />I prefer "Mor Gold" Premium Butter Topping it has a far superior taste and "Mor Gold" is also more creamy and more theater like buttery taste than "Butter Flavored Popcorn Topping".<br /><br />If you haven't tried Mor Gold - then you really can't say...I've tried them all and Mor Gold taste is just like in the movie theaters...I too use to work in a movie theater and I know that butter popcorn taste like the back of my hand, I love it and Mor Gold has it hands down....<br /><br />Also if you can find the Coconut oil in the 1/4 lb. sticks, this also helps make it more like the movies But it's not really necessary, Mor Gold will do the job well all by itself....The salt is really just up to you....I tried the "fine grain popcorn salt" but I think regular house salt from your pantry is just as good or even better...Try It & Enjoy! 2
Although my dog loved this, it was really nothing but a canine snack.  The ingredients are appalling, although there are a few  nutrients.  I compromised and gave this a 3-star rating because a) my dog really enjoyed it and b) the lack of nutrients cost this product 2 stars.<br /><br />Even so, while I am glad my dog liked this product, it is doubtful I will get it again as it does not appear to be all that nutritious. 3
Have purchased these in the past , we're not bad . This last order was not as good , the chestnuts were an ugly color pale brown , not too apitising to look at . 2
This coffee I would not purchase again.  It just did not tickle my taste buds.  It had a flavor and strength I did not find to my liking.  I am very fickled when it comes to my morning coffee, and this one just did not do it for me. 2
Good stuff, take it easy if your not used to it. it improves taste of food, better breathing, better circulation, helps with arthritis a bit 5
Chef Michael's Sirloin Steak dog food is candy for dogs. They, mine included, seem to snarf it up like kids love junk food.  The problem is that it IS junk food. It's filled with ingredients that should be avoided but are likely to be highly palatable to dogs and may also be appealing to their owners. Doesn't Grilled Sirloin Steak sound yummy?<br /><br />Let's start with the easy part, price. I feed my dog dry Eukanuba. To compare,  Chef Michel's costs 14 cents an ounce vs. 9.4 cents an ounce for Eukanuba. It is even more expensive considering that it contains 2% more moisture than Eukanuba.<br /><br />Now, what's the problem with the ingredients in Chef Michael's?  Here's the list of what's in it:<br /><br />Beef,  soybean meal,  soy flour,  animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), brewers rice,  soy protein concentrate,  corn gluten meal,  ground yellow corn, glycerin,  poultry by-product meal, ground wheat, animal digest, pearled barley, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, salt, grilled sirloin steak flavor, dried green beans, dried potatoes, sulfur, Vitamin E supplement, choline chloride, zinc sulfate, ferrous sulfate, added color (Red 40, Blue 2, Yellow 5, Yellow 6), niacin, wheat flour, potassium chloride, L-Lysine monohydrochloride, manganese sulfate, Vitamin A supplement, calcium pantothenate, thiamine mononitrate, copper sulfate, riboflavin supplement, Vitamin B-12 supplement, pyridoxine hydrochloride, garlic oil, Vitamin D-3 supplement, folic acid, calcium iodate, menadione sodium bisulfite complex (source of Vitamin K activity), biotin, sodium selenite.<br />Here are the questionable ingredients, in order of volume in contents:<br /><br />Soybean Meal and Soy Flour: the second and third largest ingredients in Chef Michael's. After removing most of the oil from soybeans by a solvent or mechanical extraction process, grinding the remaining flakes gives you "soybean meal." "Soy flour" is another byproduct of soybean processing. These are cheap sources of protein filler used to boost the protein content of dog foods. This type of protein does not provide the dog with as much usable protein as does fish, chicken, lamb, beef or other meats. All proteins are not equal in value to the dog.<br /><br />Animal Fat: the fourth largest ingredient, according to the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO), animal fat in dog food is obtained from the tissues of mammals and/or poultry in the commercial processes of rendering or extracting. This means ANY animals, including the "4-D animals" (dead, diseased, disabled, or dying prior to slaughter), goats, pigs, horses, rats, roadkill, animals euthanized at shelters and restaurant and supermarket refuse. This is NOT a quality ingredient.<br /><br />Brewers Rice: the fifth ingredient, is the small milled fragments of rice kernels left after milling whole rice.  Although it has calories, it has little nutritional value.<br /><br />Soy Protein Concentrate: what remains of soybeans after removing the water soluble carbohydrates from the beans.  Similar to soybean meal and flour, this is an inexpensive way to boost protein, but contains a very low quality of protein.<br /><br />Corn Gluten Meal: yet, another plant-based protein booster. Gluten is the residue remaining after corn has had most of its starchy carbohydrate washed out of it.  It has little nutritional value, and is used mainly as a filler and binder.<br /><br />Corn: an inexpensive filler with little nutritional value for the dog.<br /><br />Poultry Byproduct Meal: a dry rendered product of slaughterhouse waste made from what's left of slaughtered poultry after all the prime cuts have been removed.  This includes almost anything left after the actual meat has been removed: organs (the nourishing part), feet, beaks, undeveloped eggs -- anything except quality skeletal muscle (real meat). Although, by-product meals are meat concentrates and contain nearly 300% more protein than fresh poultry, they are less digestible than chicken meat. Also, there is absolutely no control over the quality and consistency of poultry and other meat byproducts.<br /><br />Wheat: See the comments for corn, above.<br /><br />Animal Digest: a broth made of animal by-products that is usually sprayed onto the dry kibble to improve its taste.  Although it cannot contain hair, horns, teeth, hooves and feathers, except in such trace amounts as might occur unavoidably in good factory practice, it is made of unspecified parts of unspecified animals. As with animal fat, there is no control over quality or contamination and may include "4-D animals" (dead, diseased, disabled, or dying prior to slaughter), goats, pigs, horses, rats, roadkill, animals euthanized at shelters and restaurant and supermarket refuse.<br /><br />Artificial Colorings: solely to appeal to the dog owner. These ingredients are of no nutritional value and are controversial.<br /><br />Menadione: a controversial form of vitamin K linked to liver toxicity, allergies and the abnormal break-down of red blood cells.  It is unnecessary in dog food. 1
Dogswell jerky treat come China.  They are not safe.  I've had a subscribe and save subscription for the product, but I've calcelled after reading this story from September 15, 2012.  (Just search for the article's title, which is the same as my review.)<br />----<br />The FDA now says 350 dogs and one cat have died in the last 18 months, reportedly after eating chicken jerky treats made in China.<br /><br />An FDA report released this week says they've received 2,200 reports of illnesses linked to the treats - the deaths are included in that number. There is no geographic pattern to the illnesses and deaths - cases have been reported from all 50 states and 6 Canadian provinces.<br /><br />The FDA says the majority of complaints involve chicken jerky (treats, tenders, and strips), but others include duck, sweet potato, and treats where chicken or duck jerky is wrapped around dried fruits, sweet potatoes, or yams.<br /><br />The report goes on to say that in the past 10 years, there has been a dramatic increase in importation of pet food from China. It is estimated that nearly 86 million pounds of pet food came from China in 2011. Pet treats, including jerky pet treats, are currently considered the fastest growing segment in the pet food market.<br /><br />The FDA has been investigating the reports of illnesses, but no definitive cause has been determined.<br /><br />"The ongoing global investigation is complex, multifaceted and includes a wide variety of experts at the FDA including toxicologists, epidemiologists, veterinary researchers, forensic chemists, microbiologists, field investigators and senior agency officials," the report says.<br /><br />The FDA says product samples have been tested for contaminants known to cause the symptoms and illnesses reported in pets, and they are now expanding testing to include irradiation byproducts and they are consulting with NASA experts about it.<br /><br />In their report, the FDA says jerky treats are not necessary for pets to have a balanced diet - basically advising people not to feed them to their pets. But if you choose to give your pet the treats,  watch them closely for any or all of the following signs that may occur within hours to days of feeding the products: decreased appetite; decreased activity; vomiting; diarrhea, sometimes with blood; increased water consumption and/or increased urination. 1
I was hoping for a tasty soft licorice rope.  However, that is not what I received.<br /><br />the licorice was too tough. 1
the popcorn tastes ok when your lucky enough to get handfull of it thats not stale its kinda sad 24 packs of stale popcorn and many unpoped kernals 3
This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. 1
This coffee brews very weak - like a light roast.  W.P. Chef's reserve pods are just over half full.  Put pod on scale and it's 15% less coffee wgt than normal pods.  Stick with normal pods or extra bold if you like coffee that taste like coffee. 2
I have been purchasing this product for over a year and lately my jerky is hard as a rock. I have been feeling like my over $30.00 per month is wasted:(. i have recommended this product to many people, but now I feel bad. 2
This is my #1 favorite coffee. Blending of hazelnut and coconut are perfect.  Thank you!!<br /><br />Question:  why was I charged postage on this brand when I have never paid on any other brand of K-Cups from Amazon 5
Maybe I got a bad bag but... the flavor of the vanilla blueberry was unpalatable. I love granola and was looking forward to trying this healthy version but it tasted old, almost as if it had "turned." If it weren't so expensive, I would try it again. I love the idea of including flax seeds in the granola. 2
This was not what I thought that I had ordered.  When I read "24 oz. Jar" I assumed that these were shelled and in a brine liquid.  These were just dried fava beans and required a lot of work to prepare.  I must say that if the dried beans were what you were looking for, they were good. 3
The pops arrived when quoted and was fresh.  I sealed them and refrigerated until I need them.  Good price and available when I needed them. 4
Doesn't taste like real coconut water.  They may have used extremely young coconuts (that are are not desirable) or some second-rate coconut crop. 2
The dogs eat it up. The nuggets are small and heavy. A bit expensive. Made in canada. 4
I use this in and on meats, fish, poultry, vegies, all purpose dip et al. It's cheap and very very special. I gave big bottles to family/friends at Xmas years ago and they are all  hooked. You won't be sorry you brought this sauce into your kitchen. 5
A very very strong candied cherry flavor, almost like the Cherry flavored Sucrets.  You probably would not eat Cherry flavored Sucrets on their own for dessert, but these Luxardo cherries cook very nicely in desserts.  Still, the flavor was a little "flourescent" and unnatural in the baked goods.<br /><br />Probably better left for drinks.  The texture of the cherry is far superior to a normal store bought Maraschino cherry. Very firm. 3
I love Smores, the combination of chocolate, marshmallows and graham crackers are outstanding. I also love Emerald nuts, so when I saw this at my local grocer, I had to try them.  Right away, the biggest problem with this snack is the marshmallows, if you can even call them that.  The marshmallows look like erasers from a pencil, and they are as hard as a rock.  I am not exagerrating, I nearly broke a tooth the first time I tried to bite one.  Are they stale?  Expiration date says September of 2012. I am not sure, maybe I got a bad package of these.  I am hesitant to buy another box.  The rest of the snack mix is fine, the cocoa walnuts, honey roasted peanuts, m&ms, graham chunks and oat clusters all tasted as they should.  But the most important part of the "smores", the marshmallows, was a major letdown. 2
After 2 mins of chewing all flavor is gone. In the older days you could chew it for hours and still have flavor.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EEK4OO">Black Jack Chewing Gum 20-5</a> 2
If you Like Cough Syrup you will Like this Garbage, it Tastes just like Cough Syrup and Not at all like Root Beer. 1
A co-worker of mine went to Jamaica for vacation in Feb. and bought me a 1lb. bag of the ground.  It's expiration date was March.  I brewed it as soon as I got home.  To me it tasted like cheap coffee that had been left out in the open air for a week.  I wonder if it was due to the expiration date, or does this coffee really taste like this.  If so, I will never buy again.  From all the hype, I was expecting much more. 1
Well, I'll begin by saying that I was really looking forward to this product. I tried TruVia's erythritol/stevia sweetener when I ran out of the stevia sweetener that I used before and wanted to get something instead of plain sugar. I figured that I liked the mix and wanted to try this powder because I had already ordered stevia from amazon. When it got here I used it right away, and did not taste the difference. I was very conservative in adding this to my coffee because I didnt know how sweet it was. After adding 3 large spoonfuls into my coffee I gave up, and I usually add 1 spoonful of sugar to my cup. if you want a sugar free sweetener that you can even make at home, get stevia. I have used it from local health food stores and always ended up with that funny aftertaste from stevia. the one I ordered from amazon, sweetleaf vanilla creme didnt have that aftertaste, and I used 12 drops in my coffee looking for it, typically I only use 4 drops in my coffee. 1
I thought I was purchasing Keebler cookies, but I received a box of Murray cookies. I just tried one pack of the Murray cookies, didn't like it at all. I will never order these cookies again. I recommend that you buy Oreo sugar free cookies if you are craving a chocolate sandwich; they are so good! Don't buy them online, since it's about 65% more expensive than your local grocery store. 1
I like to make my own blends of beans, preferring a strong but not bitter dark roast.  This is good coffee and so far the roasts have been pretty much consistent.  The price is very reasonable.  The only risk is of seeing the quality go down as the coffee gets old.  To buy in this larger quantity you need to be using it up fairly quickly.  That said it is very good coffee. 4
I love Italian roast coffee.  While this is not the "best" cup of coffee I've ever had it is very good for a Keurig cup.  The roast is nice and dark, but no bitter aftertaste, and does not have the almost burnt taste of some dark roast K-cups I've had.  It still has a robust flavor when you use it to brew the largest size.  This is a good cup of coffee. 4
I thought the coffee tasted fine.  It was not strong enough for my husband.  Several of the pods burst during brewing.  I probably won't purchase this again. 3
When I eat junk food, I'd like to enjoy it, the guilty pleasure it is.<br /><br />These cookies are neither healthy or tasty.  Stick to Chewy Chocolate Chip cookies. 1
I love dark roast coffee, served with or without cream/sugar, and this Sumatran k-cup is most assuredly a dark roast, but I found the flavor and aroma of this product to register as slightly bitter/burnt.  It did not overwhelm my senses, and it was easily alleviated and made better with the use of creamer, but it still wasn't my favorite of the K-Cups that are available.  I thought it was "okay".<br /><br />My husband didn't enjoy the Starbucks version of Sumatra, stating that he felt it had a somewhat chemical-like aftertaste even with cream and sugar.  We used over half of the box, to make sure that our opinion wasn't perhaps based on a faulty serving or two, but ended up giving the remainder to our neighbors; unfortunately, this Sumatra just didn't work for us. 3
Quite often macadamia nuts are salted. These, instead, are raw, natural, with nothing added: just delicious macadamia nuts, as they come out of their shell.<br />If you are a fan of macadamias, you have found the right seller! 5
This is one of the best dried organic crackers around. Highly recommend them compared to other available types of similar products. 5
I bought this to attempt to replace Morning Edition which is no longer available. DH and Mom say it's too bitter to drink. I think it's just okay for a medium roast. I wouldn't buy it again. 3
I ordered these because they came up in a search for K-Cups for my Keurig coffee maker.  Then I realized they do NOT work in my machine and they are NOT returnable! 1
Lowrey's Bacon Curls Microwave Pork Rinds, Hot & Spicy, 1.75-Ounce Packages (Pack of 18).<br />Pork Rinds are great with beer. Love it! 5
when i recieve this item, the jub was split down the middle and ketchup was all over inside the package it came it. 2
lots of junks in it, many fats, lots of chicken wastes and mix with spices. only the spices is good, but i don't taste much beef in it. 2
Consider buying this from Bell Plantations it's much cheaper, about $3.99 a jar.  Amazon is riping people off with this product, shame on them! 3
This soup is very very sweet.  They left out the salt but it is full of sugar.  There is 14 grams of sugar per serving with two servings in a can.  Too sweet for me.  Also there is dairy butter in it so it is not vegan or for someone with dairy allergies. 1
These used to come in four tightly wrapped tubes so that few if any of the cookies got broken.  Now they're just laid in rows.  1/4 to 1/5 of them were broken and many were just crumbs.  Too bad. 1
I tried 'em, I liked 'em.  I'm not normally a big consumer of cookies or similar products, but these are most definitely worth a try.  They are a curious cross between a graham cracker, both in taste and texture, and an oatmeal-raisin cookie, but with figs instead of raisins.  The result is decidedly yummy.  They're kind of on the dry and brittle side, so you'll want to munch these with a glass of milk close at hand.  Not a whole lot of nutritional content, but not particularly bad for you, either.<br /><br />My only problem with them is that the fig bits are more than a little annoying.  They tend to be excessively firm and chewy in that "stick to your teeth like hard candy" kind of way, and in one instance I bit into what felt like a piece of pit.  I shrugged that off and kept munching away with great delight.  I vacillated between three and four stars, but opted for three due to the figgy mischief already described. 3
What can i say??  They are wonderful, and the highlight of each weekend.  OHHHhhh  - use soda water for the liquid !  even better !!! 5
I do not like the flavor, minty and tea do not go well together, This is my opinion it taste strange to have a minty tea flavor, not the best flavor to get. Some people may like it. The quality is a great but I prefer the other flavors by rishi tea. 3
I like the fact that this product is all organic and tastes OK but is very salty.  If you use this product, you pretty much can't add anymore salt to your dish.  I prefer the taste of Seitenbacher's vegetable broth powder over this - it has more flavor and is far less salty.  Don't get me wrong, this is a fine product but if you want more flavor, less salt, go for Seitenbacher (I wrote a more in depth review on that product's page). 4
It is fascinating to watch these tea bulbs open.... bloom. Has a nice fragrance and delicate taste. One bulb makes a pot of 6 cups.<br />More exciting brewed in a clear glass teapot with candle underneath to light-up the tea at night! Mmmmmmmmm Calming 4
I like sticky rice and couldn't find it in local stores. This rice is nothing like the sticky rice in the restaurants. It's very small rice that is so sticky it clumps together in blobs.  It literally bonds to the utensils and dinnerware and is difficult to wash off.  Big Disappointment, will not buy it again. 3
Use this powdered peanut butter in smoothies.  Easy way to use for this purpose.  No messy clean up.  Saw the Hungry Girl use it and decided to give it a try. 4
I got 1 pack of these from my local grocery store and tasted them for the first time. To me, they taste just like corn nuts. They are quite hard, so I wouldn't recommend to anyone who doesn't like hard foods. They are crispy and delicious snacks tho. Will buy more. :D 5
First of all, I am aware that this is made for the gun, however after reading the reviews I purchased it and let me say I have never been more dissapointed. In the picture the gold is brilliant, bold, and intense. When I got this product it was oily in appearance and looked like vinegar in color. I used a paintbrush as I read in a previous review. The color is a yellow, maybe a copper tone---nothing like gold. I used part of this for an anniversary cake--I had to drive to the arts and crafts store to purchase Wiltons Gold shimmer to attempt to cover this disaster. I thought $15 was pretty expensive in the first place, but after using the product I am sure it is not worth a single cent. I cannot believe how grotesque this color is. If I wanted a copper/yellow tone I would have just used edible dye---I sure would have saved the money for something else. I bake hundreds of cakes each year, and I am confident to say that this is the worst item I have ever used. Garbage. I have another bottle that should be arriving in the mail in a couple days for the silver color, I will be sending it right back and getting my money back for sure! 1
This just did not smell or taste like real olive oil.  And the smoke point was lower than it should have been.  Perhaps it was a bad batch, diluted with some other oil, but I'll never use it again. 2
My 4 month old kitten usually eats another variety of Whiskas Temptations (Chicken Flavor Dentabites, which he LOVES!), but he's gotten into the habit of eating my hair that I've shed and that's fallen on the floor(gross, I know), so I decided to get him this hairball control variety of Whiskas Temptations.  The fine print on the package says that it should not be used on kittens less than 6 months of age.  I didn't notice this until after I bought and opened the package.  Hopefully, they'll stay fresh for another 2 months. 3
There is something in the jelly which makes it harden to the point it can't be spread on toast, just won't come off the knife. 1
I rescued my dog a year ago. Ever since then, I've been feeding him Newman's. I like that the main ingredient is a form of meat and there isn't a lot of grain type of ingredients. All of the ingredients are organic, so it's really good for my dog. I've tried several other brands with my dog. But I don't think he's really allergic to anything or has a distaste for anything in particular. And since this is one of the cheaper brands out there that is still nutritious, I decided to stick to this brand. Ordering it on Amazon is very convenient because I can use the Subscribe & Save feature and set the schedule of when I want the dog food delivered. I never have to worry about running out of dog food! 5
I like the soups for my daughter, but as a stage 3 food I was hoping for a little more of a thicker consistency.  You can really use this in stage 2 if you wanted because it is pretty thin.  I love Earths best products though and would recommend them. 4
I really enjoy this product. I had such a hard time finding it affordable in the store. Once I found it I look no further, it's the only sugar I use.  Thanks so much. 5
Came quickly and good value for the price. Product was fresh and of decent quality, I would  order this again. 5
It's a little runny, but could not taste better.  I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a wonderful alternative to the cheap, unnatural crap they sell in grocery stores (Mrs. Butterworth, I'm looking at you). 5
I really did not know what to expect.  They appeared a bit strange.  In fact, they did not look like a food product.  However, after just two minutes on high, I got a treat.  The rinds were better than I ever had.  Once cooled, they were perfect.  If hot, they were soggy.  I enjoyed them; my son, who is extremely fussy, enjoyed them.  I would absolutely buy them again.  I recommend them highly. 4
This gluten-free starch  is used to thicken soups and gravies.  Its main advantage over other starch thickeners is that it's a permitted ingredient for Passover, unlike cornstarch and other grain-based foods. Liquids thickened with potato starch should never be boiled.  Supermarkets often stock it among the Kosher products. I have used this in cakes and in some gentle sauces.  There is no taste that comes from this so just the flavor of the ingredients comes through.  It is very silky and fine.  Remember you do not want to let your sauce boil with this starch.  Those who are on a gluten free diet may be able to use this. 5
I expected better. Flavor is o.k. But half of the rinds do not puff up no matter what the timing in the microwave. 2
Ok, I've been drinking a variety of hot teas usually with cream & a tad of sugar since the late 1970's... before that iced tea...<br /><br />Amazon did sell this at an excellent price 'IF' you subscribe & it arrived promptly with a VERY FRESH date... expiration in 2013 for best flavor (bought in August 2011).<br /><br />Unfortunately, this tea is too weak & too smooth... I have to use 3 tea bags per 10-11oz cup of water to get some strength infused into it for 10 minutes! I recommend Lifeboat Tea (also from UK) over this or Scottish Breakfast if you want even more strength & full flavors.<br /><br />If you don't want strong Full Flavors or Sophistication, then this tea is a buy for smooth & subtle drinking... good for a tea party... to eat little cakes & scones with it. Better it be Lifeboat or Scottish Breakfast, imo, for my tea parties. :-)<br /><br />Right now, my ideal blend would be a combination blend of Scottish Breakfast AND Lifeboat... Lifeboat needs a tiny kick of strength & flavor from the Scottish tea... that's my perfect cuppa tea...<br /><br />If you know a better stronger blend that can top that combo taste, then please comment to this post... and Thanks!!! 3
If you want delicious Organic Vegan gummy bears go for the Surf Sweets "Fruity Bears" instead they are delicious. These are hard and fairly tasteless in comparison 2
Tasted good. Spicy. Those that don't like spicy should stay away from this. For the price paid, very good buy. 5
I have been eating healthy and using products with Splenda instead of sugar in them for many years. I have been using Aspen Mulling Spices even longer than that. As soon as there is the tiniest hint of cold in the air I start mixing this in to every drink I have. This year, for the first time, I decided to order the sugar-free version and I was extremely disappointed. First off.. while it isn't obvious anywhere in the Amazon ad, it is only 2oz compared to 5.65oz of the original. So nearly 1/3 the amount but for the same price (or even higher). I get if this was 10+ years ago and Splenda was still new and magical and a fad, but there are few other products out there anymore that charge more simply because they're made with Splenda. And to make it even worse, looking on the packaging where it gives you recommended amounts to use for different drinks, some of the amounts it suggests are now higher. For example: 1.5tbsp for Brandy on the original, but 2tbsp for sugar-free. So you'll also be going through this faster. And finally, to me, the taste just isn't the same. I'm not talking about Splenda vs sugar, I don't use real sugar in anything. But the actual product seems to be different. It is an extremely fine powder, closer to the consistency of powdered sugar, whereas the original is more like regular sugar or salt in consistency. Whatever they have done has completely changed the flavor profile to me. And again I'm talking about the taste of cinnamon, of cloves, etc, not how sweet it is. I have been shopping on Amazon for a long long time and this is the first product I have actually reviewed. If you want this healthy-nuts opinion... just order the original and use it in moderation. Just like anything else. 2
I have actually ordered two cases of this twice, and will probably order another two cases some time soon. It is the only quick cooking rice blend that includes wild, red and brown rice. It is very tasty, easy to make, and I make it often.<br /><br />I do not follow their cooking directions, however. I brown the rice mixture in butter before adding the water.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it does contain white rice. I would prefer not to eat white rice. I would like it even better if it were organic. 4
The first time I tried this I thought, wow, this is great! It's as satisfying as eating regular potato chips, but sweeter and presumably healthier. So had I written the review then I would have given it 5 stars. The reason I hesitated was that I took it with me to work, and the more I tried it, the more I began to question the sweetness. There's no question that sweet potatoes are slightly sweet, but I felt it only fair to let readers know that they might find this product to be TOO sweet. Hence the reason for the 4 stars. It is still quite good, but if you find sweetness to be cloying, you might not like this product for long. But all in all, I would still recommend it. 4
Hi, coffee doesn't smell or taste great. I recommend Senseo Vienna. Still have packages of "Paris" and nobody wanna drink it. Guess I just have to throw it away. 1
I really like this protein drink. I'm pregnant and trying to increase protein in my diet without adding a whole lot of extra calories or fat. This is the perfect solution. I usually mix it with a combination of 1/2 plain almond milk and half water. I also usually add a little more liquid than it says in the directions, otherwise I find it too sweet. The nice thing is that it is sweetened with stevia instead of a calorie-filled sugar of some sort. I prefer egg protein to other proteins because soy is often GMO and not recommended in high doses in pregnancy (or for anyone actually), and whey protein is a dairy product, which I generally don't tolerate well. Egg protein is perfect for my needs. 5
My labs like to play with this toy-- which is good.  I don't put treats inside it and they still will play with it and fight over it.It seems durable and it seems safe.  The problems are two fold.  If the dogs play with it on a hard surface, like a concrete patio or a wooden deck, it makes a lot of noise as they drag the bottle end around and bounce it off of objects. Also my Labs will grab this thing by the rope end and swing it around in the air and it becomes a weapon of mass destruction whacking fixed objects or another dog while being whirled around. Nothing is perfect. I let the dogs have play time with it regardless of the negatives. 3
Love this, dont use too much because it is strong, but it tastes great.  Makes even mediocre salmon taste great. 5
Great flavor and love the texture too, but don't overpay.... $8.99 is crazy. The product can be found for much less. 5
This is based on the Donut House base coffee flavor with a supposedly chocolate donut taste. The base Donut House coffee flavor is mild/smooth with a strong bitter aftertaste. It smells great while breaing, like you're in a donut shop but that's where the similarity ends.  The "chocolate donut" flavoring doesn't really come through in the coffee except that the strong bitter aftertaste becomes a strong bittersweet aftertaste.<br /><br />I tried this on both 10oz and 8oz sizes thinking the flavor was being diluted but it only made the flavors more intense... It didn't change the taste of the coffee.<br /><br />If you like the Donut House coffee flavor you might want to give this a try but if you dislike the Donut House coffee I don't think you'll find this any better. 3
I purchase a lot of baby food in bulk through Amazon.  This is the first food that I've found that not only would my little one not eat, he literally gagged on it.  I tried it myself and found that it tastes terrible.  There's something in it I can't quite put my finger on, but it is wretched.  In an attempt to see if it was just us, I gave the remaining case to a friend of mine whose daughter is 3 weeks younger than my son.  He also said she gagged on it and wouldn't eat it.  It 20 pouches ended up in the trash.  I wouldn't recommend this unless you've purchased just one and know that your little one will eat it. 1
These gave me a headache, too much sugar, and other ingredients that didn't sit well.  I would not recommend to someone trying to eat healthier. 1
I was finding that every time I got a Frappuccino from Fivebucks..err..Starbucks, I was spending about, well, five bucks.  I thought I'd give these "Caffe D'Vita" powders a try.  So far, I've only tried the Java Chip mix, and found it to be "OK".  I think that even including milk and ice, I'm still probably spending only about 75 cents a cup, so it's a great deal.<br /><br />If, like me, you find the Caffe D'Vita flavors to be not quite up to snuff, you might try making your own Frappuccinos.  I found a recipe online.  The secret ingredient can be found right here on Amazon: xanthan Gum!  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0040DWCXG">Xanthan Gum 1lb Powder USP FCC Food Grade (Buy 5 get $15 off)</a> 4
If you are looking for a practically "no calorie" filler to your meal, this is the product for you.  There is no flavor and the texture is kinda slimy[sp]well like flavorless jelly.  I applaud the<br />idea and I have eaten a lot of it.  I just add a lot of seasoning, vegetables, including garlic, mushrooms and<br />onions and I generally top it with shrimp and parmissan cheese.  It is shipped promptly and in good condition.  I plan to try a new variation on this product made from spinach. 3
There is nothing too good or too bad about these chips. If you like plain potato chips, you'd like these. They are thicker than most brands, fresh out of box, very crunchy and not too salty (for me). One bag has a lot, I generally cannot finish it by myself. Part of the reason is that they are too oily (some chips almost look transparent, if you know what I mean). The taste of oil is a bit too overwhelming for me. If you are used to more spicy chips you may not like these since they do not have any spice, except salt, as the name says. I don't think I'll buy these again. The "best by" date on my bags are March 2011 and I ordered them at the end of October. 2
I love this product, and I wish it was easier to find in the stores.  For some reason, I can never find it. Our local stores will order it, but they won't call and let you know it came in.  By the time I get there, it's already all been sold.<br /><br />This is a great side dish with a piece of chicken or a green salad.  I love it with vine ripened tomatoes, but my favorite way is to substitute Del Monte brand Italian Style Stewed Tomatoes. It amps up the spicy factor by quite a lot, but it's not hot spicy, just very flavorful.  Try it this way during the winter months when decent tomatoes cannot be found. 4
This is NOT equal to doughnut shop coffee.<br />This is a STRONG coffee. Not to my likeing!!!!<br />I would NOT recommend it... 1
These almonds are very tasty and popular at my workplace. If you've had wasabi peas, you'll probably like these too. "BOLD" is a bit of an overstatement, as these almonds are not as intense as the peas with the nasal burn, but still do have a bit of kick. I wouldn't say the soy sauce flavor is that apparent, though, but I'm not counting that against the product.<br /><br />Most wasabi-flavored snacks really contain horseradish because it is a cheaper substitute. Wasabi is notoriously difficult to cultivate and the chemicals that give it its characteristic pungency are volatile.<br /><br />I like these a whole lot and routinely buy several cans of them from my drugstore whenever they are on sale. My mom's factory wo-workers like these too. However, I took this to a baseball game and it was almost universally hated. Go figure! 4
This is a good tasting K-cup from a guy who drinks coffee black and prefers a bold, full flavored taste. I would recommend. 4
The item itself is in a squeeze pack and that does not work very well with peanut butter. The instructions say to knead the individual package before opening... whatever that means?  I did move the content of the package around before opening.  But so much of it remained in the package when I tried to use it. Effectively I got about a spoon full out of the package and could not squeeze the rest out.  So I opened the package and licked the insides to enjoy the rest.  It got quite messy.  The taste was okay, but not great, and no funny aftertaste of anything. If I tasted it in the store, I would not have purchased it.  I will eat the rest of the squeeze packs, but I have no plans to order them again or recommend them. To others that feel the need to eat this stuff, I would recommend a bottle and specifically not the squeeze pouches.  I also believe it would be too difficult for a child to use at school, even a middle school child.  With normal items such as juice/toothpaste in a squeeze pack, when you squeeze the contents move away and your fingers come very close to each other.  With peanut butter, you squeeze your fingers but the peanut butter does not move towards the top. So it just does not work well.  I wanted to love this stuff -- oh well.<br />---<br />A month later I have come back to re-rate this product.  I have about 13 packs left out of the initial 20.  I hate eating them, it makes a mess, it is hard to use, and the taste is not that great.  I will likely be throwing them out soon.  I do not recommend this product.  And I LOVE chocolate!!!!!!!!!!! 1
Low Sodium, Low in Cholesterol. Less empty calories than candy & can make a quick decent breakfast. I would buy them again. 5
Canidae has changed the formula of their ALS recipes.  Many, many dogs have become ill after eating the new formula.  The web is full of complaints from dog owners whose dogs are experiencing the same awful symptoms (Diarrhea, vomiting, itching, hot spots and even seizures).  Do your homework before buying this product.  The company changed the formula without notifying the public.  Would give zero stars if possible. 1
I have used these on fondant and on royal icing.  They have worked for me every time.  I have read a lot of reviews about the ink running out, but they haven't on me.  I have used the same package of pens and they have decorated over 100 cookies so far and they are still going!  I'll post a couple pictures of cookies I have actually detailed with this product.<br /><br />Only caution is that they can be wet, so you have to be quick and precise with your writing.  And use light pressure.  If you need to repeatedly go back over your lines, you'll have issues. 4
Monsters drinks are awesome but i can get it cheaper here in NYC Flushing for 1.99 each at the Chinese super market. (that's with tax included) i can get it faster and dont have to pay the shipping charges. It's an awesome product but the price are steep. only good if you're buying for someone else far away 3
I expected more with this chef's name on this product, but the flavor was blah. I even thought the first cup I tasted was a little fishy in its flavor. Tastes like a cup I would expect from Folgers and other common brands. 2
We've tried Newman's Own dog treats before, and our 26 lb. French Bulldog loves them. When I saw this new flavor (at least new to us), I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting the treat to be so big, but that was my fault for not reading the package. My dog was a bit overwhelmed by the size at first, but quickly grew to love the treat. Of course, I never sampled the product myself, but I can only assume from my dog's reaction that both the flavor and texture are good. I would definitely purchase these treats for him again. 5
pros:<br />+ resistant to overbrewing (getting bitter) when left to steep for long periods of time<br /><br />cons:<br />- very little smell or taste<br />- cannot re-brew, even once; a good green tea can be re-brewed twice for a total of three brews<br />- about twice as expensive as my previous green tea, which is far superior in every way except for the overbrewing issue noted above<br /><br />i'm going back to my previous tea:<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Yamamotoyama-Loose-Sencha-Green-7-Ounce/dp/B003XUL1MK/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1331447807&sr=8-5 2
I am a big fan of most of the freeze dried fruit and veggies, they are crunchy and flavorful and have NOTHING added.  The tomato fragments are extremely dry and tough, more like old sun dried, and for me they are only good when used in cooked dishes.  I do appreciate that these are organic! 3
Nature's Recipe is now a division of that mega company Del Monte Foods.<br /><br />The Test<br /><br />The neat thing about this food is that it really does look like the photograph on the bag. It consists of smallish kibble with pieces of dried carrots and peas mixed in. When the bag was first opened the girls ate small amounts of Farm Selects unmixed and readily took to it. Since then they've been eating it mixed with their Blue food.<br /><br />I thought Evie and Piper might fuss with the dried vegetables in there, but they don't specifically target the vegetables to leave behind.<br /><br />The quality of this food is obvious to one who reads the ingredient list. Only one ingredient, that animal digest, makes me cringe a little. The girls don't mind it a bit. For goodness alone I can heartily recommend this natural food, but the price on it is relatively high. Rachel Ray's dry dog food, for example, is about half the price of Farm Stands Selects, and Buffalo Blue is about the same price. For a household like ours with three dogs, the Farm Stands Selects is too pricey  to feed the girls exclusively. We'd feel obliged to mix another good, but less expensive food with it. For those with one pet and for whom money is not an issue, I say you can't go wrong with Farm Selects. 4
tastes great at first.. then the after taste starts...yyuuukk. I think it is the cranberries. My friend spit it out. 1
This is my favorite coffee candy.<br />The quality is good and it is small and low calorie, a little bit expensive here though! 2
We bought two of these machines. The first one was put into action without running the flushing cycle, so understandably it gave off the plastic taste. But you would think that after a few months, the taste would go away.<br /><br />A few months later, the second unit was bought. This time we meticulously ran it through the flushing cycle. The plastic taste was minimized, but still there. Now after about one month of usage, the coffee it makes still tastes bad.<br /><br />We use the Green Mountain Keurig cups, so I doubt it's the coffee itself. For comparison, I went out and bought McDonald's black coffee (they use Newman's Own), and added sugar and creamer myself. The McDonald's coffee tasted much better, just pure and clean.<br /><br />For another reference point, we used to have a different model of Keurig, and that machine definitely made better coffee than this one. I wouldn't say it made great coffee, but it did not impart plastic taste.<br /><br />I have since resorted to buying my own coffee whenever possible, so it's difficult for me to give this more than one star. 1
I really like Nantucket Blend.  I drink way too much!  So I thought I would buy the 96 ct. pack.  What a mistake.  I ordered 2 weeks ago, but the product has not arrived.  I checked my Amazon account and it said the product would ship between July and August.  Three to four months for shipping?  How very ridiculous.  I must say that this is my fault.  It clearly says that in the product listing.  However, I usually get everything I order from Amazon.com within a couple or three days, so I didn't even think to look.  Buy this coffee from another vendor, please. 1
I didn't like these.<br />I guess it's my fault for not liking them, because I actually have never tried wasabi, but I like asian flavors in food and adore all of Blue Diamond's bold flavors, so when I saw this in the store, I was like hey why not.<br /><br />Now I know why not. These nuts were horrific...they had this...harsh acerbic taste to them that I just could not enjoy. I ended up wiping most of the flavoring off and chopping the nuts up to put in stuff like salads. The nuts themselves are high quality and always taste fresh, so at least I was able to get some use from them. However, I would never  buy these again and if you are not experienced with wasabi, you may want to think twice before buying them lol. 2
I absolutely love Cafe Altura Columbian Dark.  I buy about 8 pounds a month.  I saw the Peruvian and decided to try it.  I thought that it was awful.  I made one pot and will probably throw the rest of it away. 1
I am always looking for good tasting vegan products.  Although I enjoy other Dr. McDougall soups, I didn't care much for the White Bean & Pasta soup. I would not buy it again. 2
Decent tea.  I think the ginger overpowers a little.  Average to slightly above average herbal tea. 3
I was so looking forward to enjoy this tea and was imagining how wonderful it would be to have a cup of hot sweet ginger tea in the coming winter....unfortunately my stomach was not up to the `task'.  I have a sensitive stomach and get heartburn and acid reflux if I drink coffee or most of the over-the-counter orange juice.  I thought it's safe to drink this ginger tea but I ended up having mild heartburn every time after I drank the tea (even use just half bag of the powder).  And the same condition occurred after all three attempts, so I had to give up...  I did find out that I am ok with drinking the home-made ginger tea (three slices of ginger in boiling water and some sugar).  I would still recommend this to people with no stomach problems!! 3
I REALLY like this coffee! so nice, bold, and full body.  The coffee is great for making expresso, it smeels so good and there is no aftertaste! I enjoyed the first cup in the morning, so robust.  I can only say that the price is a bit high for what I would like to pay.  It was great to enjoy a good cup of coffee without heartburn.  I would love to buy more if the price goes down a bit.  Overall, really good. 4
I absolutely love the tartness of cranberries, so I tend to lean towards Gluten Free products that contain them.  This bar is decent, however the texture problem could be addressed to make this product better. 3
As a confirmed chocoholic, I am always on the lookout for something chocolate that might legitimately be eaten as a breakfast food.  When I found Nature's Path Love Crunch Premium Organic Granola, Dark Chocolate and Red Berries, I thought I had reached the end of my quest.<br /><br />The granola portion of this cereal is excellent - it is flavorful and tastes good.  However, the red berries - which appear to be dried strawberries - were lacking in flavor and added little more than some color to the cereal.  I found the tiny chocolate squares to be grainy.<br /><br />This product would be excellent used as a basis for a cheesecake crust or as a layer in a dessert parfait.  It might work well as an addition in basic chocolate chip cookie dough as a substitute for oatmeal and chocolate chips.  It is a granola that allows you to use your imagination andd to enjoy it in multiple forms. 4
This is NO innocent product - my dog got one of those stuck on his throat and is now almost dying - esophageal surgery, aspiration pneumonia and other complications - and now I just hope he makes it and I can afford it - I already spent over $3,000 - and all because of a treat that claims to be highly digestible and natural. 1
I was dissapointed in this one. The only way to get the treats out is to tug it on the ground but the rope encourages the dog to carry it around, throw it around etc... You have to fill it up to get the treats to come out and sorry but I don't want to give my dog 2 days worth of food. Maybe I would have been better off buying the smaller one. 3
Taste is a personal thing, isn't it.  So I'll just tell you(as a gauge) my all time favorite K-cup is Timothy's Midnight Magic a "california roast" (which is dark). I'm partial to dark roasts and probably would not have even bothered with this Sorrento, but a friend had it, so I tried it, and lo and behold - I'm very glad I did. I find this blend even better than Puck's "Kopei Ray" which is his dark roast. There's a whole lot of good flavor here - the word "luscious" comes to mind. This one's not available every where and comes at a slight cost premium. I say it's worth it. These will be a regular for me. PS: A suggestion (which seems apparent); as with any k-cup, when you try a new blend, use the plain old 1 cup setting to check it out undiluted the first time. 5
I LOVE dark chocolate so when I saw the reviews of this kind I figured I'd give it a try.  Now taste is a matter of individuality so I'll give you the difference in this Belgian Dark Chocolate by Stephen's and my usual Nestle Rich Chocolate:<br /><br />Belgian:150 calories per serving,  serving is 3Tlb mix and only 3/4 cup water or milk.<br />vs<br />Nestle: 80 calories w/water per serving, serving is 2Tlb mix and a WHOLE cup of water.<br /><br />Belgian: Total Fat 3.5g,  Sodium 240mg, Total Carbs 27g, Sugars 22g, Protein 2g<br /><br />Nestle: Total Fat 3g, Sodium 170mg, Total Carbs 15g, Sugars 12g, Protein 1g<br /><br />I first mixed the Belgian mix as directed but couldn't finish it due to the fact that it was just too sweet for me.  It IS creamy, but just too sweet.  When I use the Nestle I only use 1/2Tlb and a squirt of dark choc. syrup and I'm happy with that.  So I then mixed the Belgian as I do with the Nestle and it's ok.  I can't rave about it due to the fact that it's higher in sugars and sodium than the Nestle and if you are trying to watch those things you might want to take that into consideration.<br />To me dark chocolate shouldn't be as sweet(or sweeter) as milk chocolate, I'm sure that's why I prefer dark chocolate.  I'll even add some unsweetened chocolate powder to my mix at times.<br /><br />But as I've said it's all in your individual taste, I just wish they would have listed the Nutrient Facts along with their ingredients.<br />Not bad, just not all that great if you don't like REALLY sweet hot chocolate. 3
What a rip off ... Kuerig should ban this stuff.  It is basically instant coffee in a plastic shell.  There is no filter, it's just hot water pouring through chunks of busted up freeze dried crystals.  Don't waste your money.  The cheap price got me hooked.  If I wanted instant coffee I would have bought Sanka.  Stick with COFFEE PEOPLE brand ... now that some good stuff! 1
Love the products, both the sugar free and the regular are great. Feel refreshed, absolutely no crash. no after taste. stopped drinking Monster and Full Throttle and started drinking Exclusive! 5
Great, I bought the 6 pack of these things, not realizing how awful they taste!!  The reviews gave me the impression they'd be good, but trust me, these are nasty!!  They are not sweet enough, and have a weird after taste.  Sort of like a peanut shell aftertaste or something.  Not very pleasant.  Not a lot of chewy-ness to these either, just big pieces of rice and very little chewy texture.  The berry variety of these seem to have great reviews, stick with those ones if you HAVE to try the Crispy Rice Bars!!!! 1
Amazon.com packed this product very well and the package was not damaged during shipment.<br /><br />The Vito Coco product I ordered and received (as titled) was not as good condition.  On 4 of the 34 oz boxes, the seals were broke slightly.  All 4 with broken seals were dripping very slightly - very noticeable as I held onto them.  The slight pressure used to hold them caused the dripping out of the seal before ever removing the seal. Two of the containers was smashed on the top - both of which were 2 of the 4 with broken seals. When I opened some of the shipping packages of these products, it smelled moldy.<br /><br />The seal for the opening is flimsy and could easily be damaged. Some of the seals were far too easy to remove - not the kind of seal you want to use for this heavy weight - 34 oz product.<br /><br />I only have one other coconut water to compare this product to, and that is the brand O.N.E.  Compared to O.N.E., the taste of this product was off - a taste of decay or mold. Some tasted moldier than others. I drank them all anyway (with no apparent ill affects), except for 3 of the 4 in which the seals were broken.  3 of the 4 with broken seals, I poured down the drain.<br /><br />The price of the 34 oz 6 pack product of Vita Coco is excellent in comparison to other coconut water brands on the market, but is it worth it?  Not to me.  I will not be buying this product again unless they improve IF the price remains the same. 2
We have two dogs and after a few weeks of switching to the Beneful Healthy Weight we've noticed very unpleasant results. They whine to go outside much more than they ever have and actually had bowel movements right in front of us if we don't get them outside in time.  Our dogs have gone from needing to go outside a few times a day to 6 or 7 times daily to handle the number of bowel movements they have. My theory is this dog food just goes right through the dog and not much of it actually is being utilized by the body. Which makes me wonder how many nutrients my dogs are actually receiving.  Poor dog food in my opinion and should only be used if your dog needs a laxative. I will most likely be going back to Purina One. 1
I really like the pineapple shortcakes sold here. Unlike some of the mass-production pineapple shortcakes that use artificial flavoring, Tasselfield's pineapple shortcakes use real pineapples and it makes the whole world difference. You can even taste the fibers from pineapple.<br /><br />I opted for the traditional pineapple this time. I will be interested in trying out the Longan or mango variety next time. 4
Cotechino is a staple on italian dinner tables, especially on or around New Year's Day when it's traditionally served with lentils. Parmacotto is a popular brand in Italy and the cotechino did not disappoint, but the price ($25.00 plus $7.99) was ridiculously high -- the typical cotechino sold in Italy is usually at least twice as big as this one.<br /><br />As cotechino seems to be very hard to find in the US outside of a few metro areas with big italian communities (NY or SF), this may be your only option to try it but be aware that you'll be paying a lot of dough for a pretty small sausage. 4
I fed this to my Golden Retriever and he hated it.  He wouldn't eat it, and when he did, it gave him terrible diarrhea.  We will not be buying this again.  It's also super expensive. 1
This review pertains specifically to the Chunky Peanut Butter flavor of thinkThin bars.  I haven't tried any of the other flavors.<br /><br />It's always interesting when a product receives such disparate reviews.  Some people here think these bars taste great, and others found them so horrible that they threw them away.  Count me among those those think these taste good.  I didn't notice any chemical flavor, just a nice chocolate and peanut butter mixture.  Probably most impressive about this bar versus other brands with a similar flavor and nutritional makeup (Clif Builder's, Pure Protein) is that the thinkThin bar is more moist and soft.  I actually like the creamier mouth feel of the thinkThin bar, though it does mean it's easier to eat and feels less substantial than the drier brands.  The Pure Protein bar is more similar nutritionally since it also uses sugar alcohols; the Clif Builder's Bar has more actual sugar in it.<br /><br />I did a quick cost comparison with the two other brands cited, based on Amazon's current subscription price.  The thinkThin brand costs more per ounce than the others (approximately 7 cents per ounce more than the Pure Protein and 15 cents more per ounce than Clif), but the cost per gram of protein delivered is more similar, with Pure Protein being the least expensive at about 5 cents per ounce of protein, Clif's being about 6 cents per ounce of protein, and thinkThin being just shy of 7 cents per ounce of protein. 4
Okay, I admit that I'm a bit of a coffee snob. Enough so that I roast my own beans and grind them fresh before each cup and I look down a bit on Starbucks and Peet's. Still, just like I believe wine in a bag or box could be good if you actually use good wine - better, maybe, depending on the wine and what you intend to use it for - I also believe that using good beans and processing them properly you could, maybe, get an excellent cup of coffee in a can.<br /><br />Normally I wouldn't be trying coffee in a can simply because it usually seems to have milk in it and I don't consume any dairy, but this illy issimo contains just coffee, sugar, potassium bicarbonate, and potassium citrate. I'm not sure what the last two ingredients are for, but wikipedia says they both impart a slightly salty taste and are used to regulate ph...so maybe it's either of those or both. The can says "100% natural arabica". Not sure what the "natural" part is supposed to mean - maybe it's just a way to sneak "natural" onto the label - it's a term that's not really regulated so it's slapped on a lot of stuff without really meaning anything. Not too impressed with the "arabica" part...75% of all coffee produced is arabica and some of it is pretty nasty dross. Still, illy is supposed to have a good reputation, so despite the meaningless hype on the can I have tentative high hopes for it.<br /><br />These cans are kind of small, closer to a Red Bull than your traditional can of soda. I put my can in the fridge to chill it, then opened it and took a sip. Well, blech...I did not like that at all, but then I normally don't like coffee and sugar without any (non-dairy) milk, so not really a surprise. I put four ice cubes in a glass and then the coffee and it filled my glass most of the way. The rest of the glass I filled with one of my two favorite soy milks, Sunrich Naturals (which is the one they use at Blue Bottle) gave a little stir and sipped again. This time, it actually tasted good! Good enough to drink the entire thing, even though really I'd had my coffee for the day. Oh yeah, and better than an iced latte from Peet's or Starbucks!<br /><br />Would I drink this again? Yes, actually I would. The main thing stopping me would be that I'd only want to drink it if I had access to a glass with ice and some soy (or other non-dairy) milk, which certainly could happen but if I'm at home I might just as well roast and grind my own beans and if I'm not at home all of a sudden the whole ice/glass/soymilk thing requires some pre-planning. They should make illy issimo canned coffee drinks with soymilk right in the can...then I bet I could think of lots of reasons to keep a case of it on hand. 3
My dogs like these.  The only drawback is that the bite sized morsels tend to disintegrate, leaving you with about 1/3 bag of crumbs.  You can give the crumbs to the dogs, but its kind of a pain. 3
If you love chestnuts like my family does then these are the ones for you.  The wonderful thing about this product is you can get it all year round.  We LOVE them and they make a filling healthy snack anytime, anywhere.  I highly recommend them to chestnut lovers.  No roasting or peeling, they are just the heart of the nut and ready to eat. 5
I am an avid eater of Thai Food, so I was curious to see how this Pad Thai in a box would taste. Considering the price, I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />Ease of cooking: 3 stars. It's a tough trick to gauge when the noodles have been soaked long enough to get the perfect firmness. Also, you have to use and wash multiple pots to make this. One pot to boil the water for the noodles. And a frying pan to stir fry the noodles in.<br /><br />Taste: It's in a box. How much can you expect? Albeit, taste might have been better if I added some fresh bean sprouts, basil leaves, and shrimp or chicken.<br /><br />Price: Not bad considering it's a third of what  you would pay for compared to take out.<br /><br />All in all, I give it 3 stars. This is like the cup o noodle of Pad Thai. Decent enough to consume if you really run out of food, but not something you'll be craving during lunch hour. 3
I actually like this tea, but I did give it three stars for a couple of reasons. The tea, in my opinion, is average... nothing really to set it apart... three stars is average... The tea is not organic, no really high points, no really bad points... again... average. The biggest negative for me is the price... at the supermarket they usually have sales on tea that would make this a lot cheaper if bought there. 3
When i got it, was in amazing condition, only problem is it died due to the fact bugs { nats & flies } Love this for some odd reason. But all n all, love the plant! Will buy from seller again. 4
I like to make hot cocoa from scratch using Hershey's cocoa, milk and 2 tablespoons of sugar (sometimes with a pinch of salt and vanilla). But I was falling asleep about 15 to 20 minutes after drinking the cocoa, regardless of how much sleep I had the night before.  I had this problem years ago when I used to eat cereal for breakfast, switched to eggs or other non sugary breakfasts. I'm not a diabetic, but sugar sometimes makes me sleepy. As an experiment I bought this Agave Nectar and used it to sweeten my hot cocoa every night for the past week or so. I have not fallen asleep once. So, based on my results, it would seem that this is indeed low glycemic and does not trigger an insulin surge. I'll use it to sweeten Oatmeal from now on. I also used it to sweeten a Latte today and it was great. In the past I've used a small amount mixed with an once of filtered water, 100% Agave Tequila, and fresh squeezed Lime Juice to make an excellent Margarita (without Triple Sec, which is garbage). 4
I bought this flour because I thought it would be low carb.  It is 43 net carbs per 2 oz serving.  This product this not suitable for diabetics or those on a low glycemic diet.  The first ingredient is white rice flour, coconut flour is the forth ingredient.  Also, to use this flour in gluten free recipes, you need xanthan gum.  All of this should have been in the product description. 1
I bought this tea because I loved Numi's Chocolate Puerh tea in teabag form. Having tried it loose I think I'd recommend getting it in bags unless you are considering making this one of your staple teas.<br /><br />The tea settles in shipping so it's hard to get a proper mix of ingredients when you are brewing a cup. I really enjoy this tea... when I can get the right ratio of leaves and spices. 3
I am very happy with Amazon service including the speedy shipment. I am also very happy the product Amazon is carrying. This product is only available in selected specialty stores in the area. And tend to be expensive. Sometime they only carry small selection in store. You have to wait long time for a special order. Amazon is making the product available with a wide selection of variaty and affortable. Thanks. 5
Fantastic cocoa.  All the flavors are excellent but my personal favorite is the dark chocolate.  I received my Keurig as a Christmas present and I am loving cocoa at the end of the work day...no mixing, no microwave and positively no pot on the stove...just warm, chocolatey goodness on demand. Will order this product again 5
I've made other Bear Creek soups and liked them. The chicken noodle was on special at a local grocer, so I tried it.  It tasted fine. Although 'chicken' is listed in the ingredients, there is no discernible meat in the mix. 3
After black licorice Turkish Delight is my favorite candy. Unfortunately, this batch I bought arrived stale, very tough. The flavor was good otherwise, so if you can get some that is fresher they would be good. Too bad there is no way to tell that before you order them. So, I won't be buying this product again. 3
If they were not on sale, I wouldn't have bought them, having tried other brands of "guac-a-mole" flavored tortilla chips.  I'm glad I didn't pay full price.  The taste is hard to describe - somewhere between gasoline and garbage, neither of which I've ever actually ingested, but which these chips brought to mind by taste and smell.  How do people eat and enjoy this crud?  The only explanation I arrive at is they've never savored the exquisitely smooth and sprightly taste of true guacamole made with ripe avocados and fresh cilantro.<br />I had to give this product one star because Amazon said so.  I guess that star could go for the unbelievably corny (no pun intended) "new look, same great taste" icon on the upper-left corner of the bag.  Its such a quaint reminder of the inane, inconsequential marketing style of the "Mad-Men" era I grew up in. 1
