Regardless of how this tastes (I like it), why would anyone pay these prices plus shipping when it is much cheaper at a local store like Shoppers Food Warehouse? Way too expensive  1 2
Let me start by saying that I have purchased Popchips for several years. I was even on Amazon autoship for 2 boxes every 2 months because we enjoyed them so much. That being said, I have been very disappointed with the last 2 shipments received. The barbeque had little to no seasoning on both boxes of both shipments. Not to.mention that the bags are now half filled with air. The bad thing about this is that both shipments came from different plants. I was so dissapointed with this last batch that I attempted to return them, but Amazon does not accept food returns. I have canceled both autoships and I won't buy them again until I am assured that this problem has been corrected. LISTEN UP POPCHIPS: YOUR LOYAL CUSTOMERS WANT THE PRODUCT THAT WE ARE ACCUSTOMED TO CONSUMMING. IF I WANTED ORIGINAL FLAVOR CHIPS I WOULD HAVE ORDERED THEM. I WANT MY BARBEQUE CHIPS TO TASTE LIKE BARBEQUE. YOU HAVE LOST A VERY LOYAL CUSTOMER WITH YOUR COST CUTTING EFFORTS :( THESE HAVE CHANGED....AND NOT FOR THE BETTER!  1 2
I bought a bunch of the Kitchens of India items during a promotional sale and the only one I'd recommend is the butter chicken sauce. If they were tasty I could overlook the salt content for the occasional enjoyment but I'm not loving the taste. I ofter buy similar products from Trader Joes and those, in my opinion, are much better and cost far less. I've had better  1 2
We love Gnu Bars, and have tried almost all the flavors now (but one).<br />But this one needs to go back to the kitchen for a rework!!<br /><br />One word description: YUCK!<br /><br />We all love coffee flavored items, so really, I thought this one might be a favorite.<br />However, it doesn't taste like coffee liquid. It tastes like someone poured the old coffee<br />grounds from a pot into the bars!<br />Seriously, it was that bad.<br /><br />Three people who like coffee gave it double thumbs-down.<br />Seriously iffy texture, and the taste of licking a paper cone<br />full of coffee grounds. NOT good!<br /><br />FYI since it isn't in the listing - Espresso Chip Bar<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br />Gnu High Fiber Blend (whole rolled oats, organic whole wheat flour, wheat bran, organic kamut, psyllium, flax, millet)<br />chicory root inulin, fruit juices, rice dextrins, canola oil, cocoa powder, plums, rice, ground coffee beans,<br />chocolate chips (sugar, chocolate flavor, cocoa butter, dextrose, lecithin), natural flavors, wheat protein isolate, baking power.<br /><br />NUTRITION:<br />Serving size - 1 bar<br />Calories - 140<br />Total fat - 4g<br />Cholestrol - 0 mg<br />Sodium - 35 mg<br />Total Carb - 30g<br />Protein - 4g Definitely their worst bar. Tastes like coffee grounds!  1 4
The whole point of a cookie is for it to taste good!  This product tastes little better than wood.  Sorry I wasted my money.  Do NOT buy.  Save your money -- they are not worth the calories! Poor Taste  1 2
I really like Nantucket Blend.  I drink way too much!  So I thought I would buy the 96 ct. pack.  What a mistake.  I ordered 2 weeks ago, but the product has not arrived.  I checked my Amazon account and it said the product would ship between July and August.  Three to four months for shipping?  How very ridiculous.  I must say that this is my fault.  It clearly says that in the product listing.  However, I usually get everything I order from Amazon.com within a couple or three days, so I didn't even think to look.  Buy this coffee from another vendor, please. Coffee is good - Shipping is 3 months??  1 2
I was looking forward to this product, as my wife and I both like Earl Grey tea, and decaf lets us drink it at night.  We drink a variety of tea, so we don't go through individual tea very quickly, so I was looking forward to the resealable packets.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this tea just doesn't taste good initially and has a particularly unpleasant aftertaste.  I definitely would not recommend buying this tea. Looks good, tastes bad  1 2
This product is portrayed as healthy and natural, but I was shocked and dismayed to see that it's shipped from halfway across the world. I understand buying electronics, shoes, etc. from China, but my FOOD? I doubt the safety of this food product, and don't see how they can guarantee that  it's vegan, non-GMO, dairy free, wheat-free, gluten-free, etc. Plus I don't see the point in purchasing something that has obviously left such a hefty carbon footprint. But beyond that, how hard is it to make a delicious snack like this in the USA, from USA-grown ingredients? Seriously? Delicious, healthy...Product of China?!  1 3
It took me a decade of yo-yo dieting on various plans, four short-term successes, and now, hopefully, a long-term success is on the way. I have lost 35 lbs in 6 months, and going strong. I lost it gradually and within recommended weight loss recommendations (1-2 lbs a week). I didn't starve myself, stop my social life for any diet's decrees, and I definitely wasn't under the tutelage of any one diet. I have done that already and realize a few things: 1) you must exercise daily, 2) you must mind calories, 3) you must eat 3 meals and 2 snacks every day, and 4) the types of nutrients matter (omega 3, 6, and 9 fats, thermogenic herbs, antioxidants, etc.)<br /><br />The greatest myth I busted was any form of perfectionism. If you have a candy bar once in a while, that doesn't mean you are a big failure, you have to start all over, and you might as well do that next week (so you can binge in the meantime).<br /><br />All diets are perfectionistic. They focus on one aspect of healthy eating and run with it to fit the lose-weight-overnight / Can-I-also-have-a-pizza-with-all-the-fixings? mentality of the typical deluded American. That's why we have the Atkins diet, illustrating the worst of this concept. However, these diets aren't bad, because you can extract a jewel of knowledge from each of these regimens. Atkins taught us to watch carbs and not to fear protein (although that doesn't mean you can eat bacon); Fat Flush teaches you the difference between good and bad fats, thermogenic herbs (that raise the metabolism), and a very basic understanding of the Glycemic Index, and Thurmond teaches you what combinations of foods work to lose weight and the power of eating many small meals throughout the day.<br /><br />Larabar is another great example of the focused diet. The jewel is the omega fats 3 and 6, gluten-free, no dietary sweeteners (which increase your appetite and studies have correlated artificial sweeteners to weight gain because of its high glycemic index count), and it being all natural, organic, and kosher. That's great, when you focus on only this aspect. But still, however popular diets have become, Weight Watchers, Jenny Craig, and the like can never be ignored. The one irrefutable truth is the calories you take in determine what your weight will be in the immediate future. If there is a high fat percentage, which are calories still, you have to consider that.<br /><br />LARABARS HAVE 45 - 55 % FAT! 200 + CALORIES! These health bars are healthy, but I would only have them as a reward before or after a good workout. This is the first review that I am rating this low because of the padding I suspect going on. One reviewer talks about the low calories, which is totally false. Two reviewers talk about how healthy it is, sounding very close to an infomercial as he focuses on only one aspect but ignores another. The suspicion arises when these two reviewers rate this bar 5 STARS 3-4 FREAKIN' TIMES WITH THE SAME WORDS! They must mention the excessive calories and fat in these bars, or else someone's going to go off of insufficient information and eat one every day with a sedentary lifestyle. Compare this bar to a Snickers, and you may have a different perspective. What is labeled "healthy" can be very bias.<br /><br />MY POINT BEYOND LARABARS: You can't focus on one system of ideas, because health and nutrition and weight loss are much larger and much more demanding concepts of nature's effect on the body. It's how you sustain and develop habits and balance in life, and it's about the knowledge you keep in your head, so you can deftly cut corners through increasing your metabolism or burning the maximum calories. It's about myth busting. It's about making smart choices. It's about knowing what choices are in the first place; if you choose one path, you can't choose another. Sacrifices may be what your particular body requires to be healthy and lose weight. You won't find a real chili-dog diet. You won't find a sugar that tastes exactly like sugar. One path leads to one place, while the other path leads to another. Note the difference, and be realistic.<br /><br />Lastly, the only health change you can make overnight happens in your head, not in your body. "Health" Does Not Always Equal Health  1 4
None of the asian super markets around me sell the old style anymore. I am so damn sad. This new bowl it comes in doesn't hold back the heat and is very hot to touch. The flavor is so damn bad. Bring back the old regular hot and spicy picante please... PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEE. WHAT IS THIS S***?  1 2
I've been making all kinds of soda for the last 5 years from various concentrates, with a home-made carbonation kit that consists of little more than a tank of CO2, some hoses, a filter and regulator.  I regularly get the Homebrew Root Beer and Homebrew Cola and have tried every other flavor they sell.  For starters, the Ginger Ale (and several others) keeps the essential oils in an alcohol suspension, yet is sold in a plastic bottle.  It doesn't take a chemist to figure out just how stupid that is.  Every bottle I've received has been partially collapsed, bubbled/sticky on the outside and has 'particulate matter' on the inside, due to the volume of alcohol migrating through the plastic.  Same with the Lemon flavor as well - it's been totally revolting.<br /><br />Avoid this - get the Ginger Beer instead of the Ginger Ale, use Koolaid unsweetened mixes for the fruit flavors, and really just use the Homebrew label for the Cola and RootBeer products.  Get any soda concentrate with essential oils in suspension (read: most) from a distributor that uses glass bottles.<br /><br />My Soda Rig:<br />*The Carbonator - fits to 20ounce and 2liter bottles: [....]<br />*Ball Lock Disconnect - connects the Carbonator to the CO2 tank: [....]<br />*5lb or 20lb CO2 tank (get the 20 if you don't need your rig portable) - local beer homebrew or welding store.  Make sure it's food grade.<br />*Dual Gauge CO2 Regulator: [....]<br />*3-6 feet clear tubing with 1/4inch interior diameter.  It only needs to handle 50-60 psi, so it doesn't need to be reinforced.<br /><br />Most of this stuff can be gotten cheap from various local sources or somewhere here on Amazon ([....]).  Once you put it together, you can start carbonating just about anything. If you got Ginger Beer, consider yourself lucky  1 4
I ordered this bouquet to be delivered to my daughter for opening night of a show. I specifically ordered a gerbera daisy bouquet that featured ALL daisies and no other flowers because these are my daughter's favorite flower.  The bouquet she received had ONE gerbera daisy in a bouquet of some other type of flower that resembled daisies. While she appreciated the flowers the bouquet she received was definitely NOT what I ordered.  very disappointed!!! flowers delivered looked NOTHING like this!!!  1 2
please be care full with this as i just complained to gerber as i found black powder inside sweetpottato tubs that i got from BJs , just a word of caution as im yet to find out what it is from gerber .upon calling gerber they said it could be charcoal from overburnt product & they are saying " as far as seal is intact its safe" hellooo plz dont tell me charcoal or rust or whatever it might be found in a tub sealed can be safe? im now going to be carefull while giving it to my baby .. so please u also be just carefull to see if no black powder is in .. if so discard it . black powder in it  1 2
The texture of these chips is terrible, it is like eating styrofaom, the taste is not bad but far from delicious. There are new much better option Not nice  1 2
Description says PDQ tray of 6... It is not. Only one package and priced three times a much as in the store. I will take the time today to send it back and reclaim my $8. Not pdq tray of 6  1 3
These used to come in four tightly wrapped tubes so that few if any of the cookies got broken.  Now they're just laid in rows.  1/4 to 1/5 of them were broken and many were just crumbs.  Too bad. Broken cookies and crumbs  1 2
K-Cup coffee was supposedly barely out of date, but tasted very, very old and I could not afford to order from Amazon as the ones I got were from Moriah Acres. K-Cups were BARELY out of date, but tasted very old  1 2
My sodium radar told me to not even try this product, but it sounded good so I did. Ew! A whopping 900mg of sodium in a one cup serving, to go with the 370 calories. It is worth it to take the extra effort to boil whole grain pasta, make a cheese rue myself, then add hamburger. Time-consuming, sure, but way better tasting and better for me. Even my husband gave it a thumbs-down and he is like Mikey from Life cereal commercials! ick!  1 5
I'm 35yo and I remember eating this stuff for breakfast all throughout my youth.  I loved it.  Loved it to the point that there were days that I would eat it for breakfast and dinner if I could get away with it.  For some reason I stopped eating it.  I saw this and decided it was time start it up again.  I'M SO DISAPPOINTED!!!  The flavor is completely different.  The end product is soupy and letting it sit for a bit doesn't help.  The portions sizes do seem like they might be a bit bigger but that's the only good thing I can come up with.  It might be a healthy choice but I think I'll just stick to my fresh fruit breakfasts.  This is just bad. ~~so disappointing~~  1 2
This mustard isn't worth what people say. If you like an exceptionaly creamy and NO taste mustard this ones for you people with no taste. Waste of money. GO find Koops Deli mustard for the best taste. forgetaboutit  1 2
Barbara's has some good grocery items. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. This cereal tastes as if it has too much baking soda and left me with a stomach ache. I hope the folks at the food pantry will like these more than I did! a disappointment  1 2
i was very disappointed by the small size, but i was shocked by the brick-like texture of a bar with chewy in the name.  it tastes good, but the hard texture and small size were not what i had in mind.  i called amazon with my complaint and received a full refund. thank you not pleased  1 2
I thought I was purchasing Keebler cookies, but I received a box of Murray cookies. I just tried one pack of the Murray cookies, didn't like it at all. I will never order these cookies again. I recommend that you buy Oreo sugar free cookies if you are craving a chocolate sandwich; they are so good! Don't buy them online, since it's about 65% more expensive than your local grocery store. Murray Cookies!  1 5
Item appears to be Keurig brand by title & description (big $$$).  However upon receiving it, it is an off brand "My Perfect Kitchen" sold at Bed Bath & Beyond and at HALF the price. I was disappointed in the jading and sent it back. Signed up for BBB email promos and got a 20% off coupon for use in the store so I bought this EXACT item for $20 (reg only $24.99 in store).  I mean EXACT!  Do your homework and save yourself some money.  Oh and the item itself is great...we have the larger Platinum B70 and it does have an issue with the cupboards but I just pulled it forward about 3.5in and it's perfect.  I am fortunate enough to have a lot of counter space and I may move it to an open top area so for us it's all good :) Overpriced OFF BRAND!!!  1 3
I am a Teavana tea freak, love the stuff, but this one tastes very odd.  Has an odd chalk flavor similar to tums or pepto, very odd can't figure it out.  Big dissapointment, especially at the price! I love teavana, but not this one...  1 2
I really tried this with an open mind. I love hot tea in the afternoon as well as other 'soothing' drinks. But this one was a killer. It comes as a powder to mix with hot water. It doesn't say how much water on the packet so I assumed that one packet is for one cup of water (as per the directions on this site).<br /><br />One sip put me into the gag zone. I'm sorry to say that it was horrible. It was bitter, spicy, too strong, and way over the top. I like ginger but in small doses. This was like chewing on a piece of ginger root. I guess there are some people that like that but for me, it was not a good experience. I tried additional sips just to be sure but it was a killer taste each time. And, it's hard to get the strong ginger taste out of your mouth.<br /><br />I know this is a personal choice but my choice is to stay away.<br /><br />*****Added note*****<br />My husband tried it and liked it. He would have given it a 3-4 star rating. It just goes to show the difference in what our taste buds like and how this is truly a personal taste opinion. Auuuuuggghhhh!  1 3
From the above review (just like fresh) I purchased this product (Royal Anne Cherries). The previous reviewer was about as wrong as possible. The cherries are mush, tasteless and certainly not worth the money.<br /><br />Only reason I gave one star is I could not give 0 stars. Someone is crazy  1 2
We ordered the product...our dog loves them...but no one cares if its 100 degrees outside.  recieved in one big melted ball.  thought they would ship in dry ice.  If its summer or hot in your area dont order them !! dont do it  1 2
They should put the origin of the product in the information so we can make more informed choices about our purchases. This tea is from Thailand. Do not be fooled. No thanks. NOT JAPANESE. It is from Thailand  1 2
1. Very small seeds<br />2. Slow to spout<br />3. 10 days and still not ready to be juiced<br />4. Glade that I ordered only 5lb...<br /><br />Stay away..... Not what you expect ....  1 2
Very odd product.  Can says No GM ingredients (Genetically Modified?) but the ingredients include partially hydrogenated canola and palm oils.  Yucky source of transfats so be aware that thsi imported product contains 2g trans fat per serving...and each can has 3.5 servings.<br /><br />Taste wise - in my opinion, tastes like soggy, wet fruitcake (not in any good way at all).  WAY TOO SWEET and I even got a few bites with a sandy, gritty, crunch texture which was horrible and I can only hope it was from the raisins?!<br /><br />This product is not pleasant tasting at all so I am just not sure about all the other great reviews.  But for my taste, I couldn't choke down even a few bites of this stuff.  Only thing I appreciated from this was the few laughs from friends/family over the name of this Heinz product. Tastes like wet fruitcake to me  1 2
I used this coffee years ago when it was sold by the A & P grocery stores but I did not like the taste of this particular coffee. Mickey  1 2
I used to buy the big bags of these and eat them constantly, then I looked at the back of the bag and saw they used MSG in the cheddar kind, but not in most of the others. I ate chex mix as a healthy alternative to chips and other junk food so them using something like this basically had me switch over to another snack. You can have your own opinions about MSG, but I think it's lazy personally when they don't even have to use it but they do anyways.<br /><br />They did taste great, though. Maybe if more people complain about them using MSG they'll release a new formula without it. And no, I don't mean take mono sodium glutamate off the label and replace it with yeast extract, or autolyzed yeast extract when it's basically just a different name for MSG. I'd buy them again if we got a no MSG formula. Fantastic Taste, unfortunate about the MSG, though...  1 3
I was looking forward to this product, as my wife and I both like Earl Grey tea, and decaf lets us drink it at night.  We drink a variety of tea, so we don't go through individual tea very quickly, so I was looking forward to the resealable packets.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this tea just doesn't taste good initially and has a particularly unpleasant aftertaste.

Good Earth made the very bad decision to alter their perfectly formulated Caffeine Free Original Sweet & Spicy Herbal Tea and the new formula is not even as good as the average Decaf Chai Black Tea from Celestial Seasonings. This used to be the best tea on the market for quality and flavor but is now not even in the top twenty. I can no longer recommend this product. I wrote to the company and received no response. The complaint is as follows.<br /><br />Dear Good Earth Representative, I am certain you have received hundreds of this precise complaint but I felt the need, after so many times checking back in stores and purchasing a box of your Original Sweet and Spicy Herbal Tea only to find that the taste is well below the average taste of any cheap store brand chai, to ask that your company, please, reconsider the decision to switch to this newer formula/recipe for the Herbal Sweet and Spicy tea. It has been so long since I or anyone I know has had your wonderful tea because you replaced it, a year ago or more at this point, with a tea that no one, and I mean no one, that I know was willing to continue drinking. At least 8 women at work stopped drinking it right along with me and the reviews on Amazon of your new recipe are consistently terrible. I used to have great appreciation for your company and a great love for your product. If you wanted to offer a separate Ginseng-free formula, your company could have simply introduced a night-time ginseng-free herbal. The orgininal formula did not have to be retired in order to facilitate this change. Please pass this sentiment along to your superiors on behalf of myself and many of my relatives, coworkers and companions. None of us purchase your products anymore and we would come back to your company as loyal and daily drinkers of the old formula of the Good Earth Sweet and Spicy Herbal Tea if you would only revive the old formula and resume manufacture and sale of this lost and missed product. Thank you for your time. All Sizes Now Have Artificial Flavor, Original Formula Retired  1 5
When I received my latest order, the bag said "36 count" but there are only 12 K-cups inside.  That makes this very very expensive coffee. 36 count means 12  1 3
So if you read the reviews, you'll see that some people thing these things are great. Many otehres cant get over the texture, and the initial smell is ... bad. I was able to wash out the smell pretty well, leaving a very mild fishy mildewy aftertaste. The texture... awful. Nasty. Chewy fishy pasta. The only good thing I can say about this stuff is the individual bags it comes in are really small -- about single serving size. So I've got a bunch I can inflict on my friends if I can trick them into trying it. Had to try it, but yuck.  1 2
Sent this to my mom for Mothers Day - she got a limp 3-color arrangement that was far from the photo! I won't do that again! Really disappointed  1 2
I have a 10 pound Yorkie who admittedly destroys most toys we give him.  I thought this toy would be an exception based upon other reviews.  He has a ball that he rolls around that dispenses food and seems to enjoy it and it has lasted longer than most of the other toys.  For this reason I thought he would love this toy.  Less than 36 hours later he became so frustrated in not being able to get the treats that he tore the rope in two. Destructible  1 2

I did not find this drink anything special in terms of taste; the black cherry juice infused with carbonation gave an odd taste. Black Cherries are not favorite fruit; however I tried this drink but did not make any positive impression on me. The juice is quite acidic and you don't feel that there is 100% fruit juice. The drink comes in cans rather than glass bottle which would have helped the drink maintain the juicy taste longer. It does not have any preservatives and it is gluten free, no sugar and no artificial flavors. This drink doesn't have any special features and it doesn't stand out well in a market crowded with many drinks.<br /><br />1. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q3ECXM">Minute Maid Mixed Berry Juice, 24 - 10 fl oz Bottles, 240 fl oz</a><br />2.

The tea was okay.  However, the picture and description of these tea bags led me to believe that each bag would be in an individual paper wrap. Instead, the bags were simply all stuffed together in the box----many without strings. disappointment  2 3
There were literally no more than 30 cashew pieces per box, and that might be a generous number. The actual brittle tastes good enough, but the lack of main ingredient means this product should not be purchased. Cashews Missing  2 3
This is a good idea, and they dissolve quickly for babies new to food. But if a partially slobbered on one falls out of the baby's mouth and onto clothing it leaves a stain that proves impossible to remove. The puffs have a bit of an orange coating on them, it must contain food coloring. I've tried organic puffs and they don't leave any stains. Stain clothing  2 1
I ordered this unit and loved it initially.  After about 8 purees, I noticed little bits of hard, clear plastic in my dish rack and realized that they had broken off of the bottom of the Baby Brezza unit.  These small bits of plastic hold the drive shaft in place.  The unit can still be operated but it is very difficult and frustrating.  It is very hard to mount the unit and have the lid stay on without the drive shaft being properly supported.  I have contacted the company and hope to get a replacement unit soon.  How discouraging though that this happened after just a few uses.  I have never used the dish washer to clean it either, so that I could just leave the drive shaft in place.  I will also comment that pulling the blade out of the unit in order to clean it is difficult which is probably what led to the plastic pieces breaking off.  Had the item not broken so quickly I would have rated this 4 or 5 stars.  I love the recipe booklet that comes with it.  My son loves the variety of purees that I have made him.  The idea of steaming and blending in one step is so convenient.  Hopefully my next unit will not break. Breaks Easily!  2 4
Original review: You would think the difference would be negligible, but there is a huge taste and texture difference between these nuts and your run of the mill Planters or Fisher nuts. Too expensive to buy all the time (I am on low carb and snack on nuts a lot), but definitely worth getting for a lovely little gnosh now and then!<br /><br />Update second purchase 6/1/2011 Dropped from a 5 star rating to a run of the mill 2 star rating. They were on sale so I ordered two bags - big mistake. These are nowhere near as good as the first bag I bought. The nuts are less fresh and 1 pound 10.9 oz of these nuts were almonds and cashews, probably more than that because I ate a few of them, so probably about 6oz of these nuts were something besides almond/blanched almonds/cashews - too bad because the last bag I bought seemed to have more of the "goodies" and less of the filler nuts and a lot of the pecans were flat and hard, as are some of the almonds. Given a choice between these and the Planters deluxe w/macadamia, I'd have to go with Planters...too bad, they were awesome. Guess I'll return that second bag. :(  (I don't really like almonds and cashews all that much)<br /><br />I can no longer enthusiastically recommend them...what a shame. I was really looking forward to this delivery. :( Review changed!! No longer best ever!!  2 3
Far from a "perfect mix" of flavors, Cruchy Nut cereal is basically your average sugary cereal.  Sadly, the sugar is about all you taste, there is no distinct honey or nut flavor, just sugar and crunch.<br /><br />I can't imagine this is any healthier than Captain Crunch or Lucky Charms, and with those cereals, you actually have distinctive flavors.  As an attempt to invade the Honey Nut Cheerios market, this is entirely a failure. Sugar Crunch  2 4
The plant in the picture looks so much greener and healthier than what I received in the mail today.  The pot is a very inexpensive 'growers' pot, and does not add at all to the over-all look and appeal of this half-dead plant.  My plant contains two braided brown trunks with no foliage, and three yellowish stalks with yellowed leafs.  The 'braid' is held together at the top with a green bread twist-tie.  Over all, I wish I had spent a little more money and ordered a better plant from a different supplier, and I should have made sure the pot was nice enough to keep the plant in for some time while adding to the decor of my home.  With the ill-health of this plant, I am afraid to upgrade the planter/pot as I might further stress this suffering little thing.  Maybe this one should have been called the "waste of money tree'.  If you really want one of these, look elsewhere - this one is just not worth it. Dissappointment  2 1
Tase is good, not as bold as I prefer. But I love strong coffee.  But the reason I cannot give 5 stars is THREE times now I have had a brewing problem that I have not had with other brands.  TWO TIMES, the coffee went all over the brewing part and not a straight shot into the cup.  Today, I noticed several grains in my cup, so rathr than waste a cup, I strained it through a filter and enjoyed my cup.  I have bought Tully's before, but nt from this seller. Wonder why the problems so many of us are reporting? Wish I had reviews - having problems with this  2 3

My grandkids and I love the mints in the tin and thought we would try these to cut down on packaging. They taste terrible. They have a funny after taste and really don't taste like cinnamon. We won't buy them again. We buy many Newman's Own products, but are disappointed this time. If they aren't the same mints, they should have a different name. Not the same as the tin mints. Funny aftertaste.  2 1
I was thoroughly disappointed in the condition of the cookies after they arrived. I receieved the Chocolate Chunk,Choc. Chip and Pecan Choc. Chip. They arrived in two shipments and all were broken. Only a few of the Choc. Chip cookies survived.<br /><br />Hey Amazon, I think that the packing wasn't sufficient and it might have helped to mark the outer boxes "fragile". disappointed by the condition  2 1
This was my baby's first food (or at least I tried it) at 6 months. When I opened the can, a musty smell welcomed me. It had not gone bad from what I could see and it was well before the expiration date, it was just not terribly appetizing. Several times I went through the hassle of expressing breastmilk and mixing it with this stuff. There is no way I could get my baby to take this cereal, regardless of the milk to cereal ratio. I threw the stuff out and we went straight to real solids (non-pureed or mashed) after a few weeks. My baby has some preferences for which I do not want to rate this product poorly, however the musty smell was a turnoff for me too. musty smell, baby could not stand it  2 1
I love loose leaf tea - the large leaves brew slowly, giving flavor but not bitterness. It has a subtle quality about it that sets is apart from the grounds found in tea bags. This tea does not have that quality. Rather than whole leaves, the tea is ground-up bits like in English breakfast tea. Even after brewing the leaves are tiny chunks. Rather than a long, slow brew, I found that this tea takes on a bitter edge after as little as two and a half minutes. I usually brew tea bags longer! If you keep the brewing short and use a lot of leaf to compensate it can be drinkable, but why bother when you can do better with a bag? I won't be buying this again. Loose "Leaf"  2 3
I expected to receive the smaller Trollis that are standard in 5 and 8 oz packages, but these are large worms that are chewier and far less sour. Product is probably not what you think  2 1
I tried integrating this into my German Shepherd puppy's food.  He is currently on California Natural Lamb and Rice puppy formula, but I have a hard time finding it - so I thought I would switch to this Royal Canin.  He loved it.  But then he started getting diarrhea.  The diarrhea may have been from something he ate in the yard and not the Royal Canin.  Regardless, I donated the Royal Canin to a dog shelter.  This is after I read reviews on it, and discovered it has some bad reviews.  It has lots of fillers in it.  I prefer a more natural, healthier dog food (this is my opinion after what I've read).  There are good websites to compare pet foods and read professional reviews on them. Has a lot of fillers  2 1
I saw that someone else had posted that these k-cups tasted different from other Gloria Jean's k-cups they had.  I should have believed them; it is true. Not nearly as good.  My only guess is that they are seconds..... different from regular mudslide K cups  2 4
Out of the several brands of canned refried beans I have tried, this is my least favorite.  They become more palatable if one adds granulated garlic and finely diced onions. Not So Tasty  2 3
I don't like the after-taste of the "Butter Flavored Popcorn Topping".....<br /><br />I prefer "Mor Gold" Premium Butter Topping it has a far superior taste and "Mor Gold" is also more creamy and more theater like buttery taste than "Butter Flavored Popcorn Topping".<br /><br />If you haven't tried Mor Gold - then you really can't say...I've tried them all and Mor Gold taste is just like in the movie theaters...I too use to work in a movie theater and I know that butter popcorn taste like the back of my hand, I love it and Mor Gold has it hands down....<br /><br />Also if you can find the Coconut oil in the 1/4 lb. sticks, this also helps make it more like the movies But it's not really necessary, Mor Gold will do the job well all by itself....The salt is really just up to you....I tried the "fine grain popcorn salt" but I think regular house salt from your pantry is just as good or even better...Try It & Enjoy! I like Mor Gold topping much more than this one.  2 5
I almost hate to say it, but I really love this product. But Nestl&eacute; doesn't seem to care about what its customers want.  They care more about the higher profit margin that is generated by the new 20-pack box.  (Today's 20 cup of packets - $3.39, yesterday's canister used to get about 100 cups for $5.29 in my area.  I guess this is the way of the corporate world these days - just look at AIG and other lending agencies.<br /><br />Nestl&eacute; - please bring back the canisters... Great product - Corporate greed  2 4
I have been purchasing this product for over a year and lately my jerky is hard as a rock. I have been feeling like my over $30.00 per month is wasted:(. i have recommended this product to many people, but now I feel bad. I am a little unhappy  2 1
I've had some of the other Pacific Natural brand products, and enjoyed them.  This one however, I just didn't care for.  It wasn't as good as some of their other chowders, and even though it was a lot of food, it wasn't satisfying.<br /><br />Since the flavor was potato rosemary I expected those to be the predominant flavors.  And they were to an extent, especially the rosemary.  There definitely was that piney flavor that permeated the soup.  The potatoes took a back seat though and while they represented most of the texture, they didn't really have that potato-like taste.  I also thought it was somewhat watery and nothing like the texture of a chowder at all.  There were other vegetables included, but you really couldn't taste them.  Another note on the texture, I encountered some rosemary sprigs that were tough to chew.  It didn't bother me, but I know it bothers a lot of people.<br /><br />The ingredients were pretty good.  Only a few things are in this including water, potatoes, cream, onion, celery, carrot, cornstarch, sea salt, garlic, rosemary, and natural flavor.  So really, not that much at all.  Which is good, I hate when they add fillers and at least with sea salt it's a healthier salt than normal.  Calorie wise its about 230 per serving, and there are two servings in the box.  I of course ate both servings since I had nowhere to store the rest at work, but even so it made up a pretty large portion that I almost couldn't finish.  It just wasn't satisfying as said before.  Fat is 8 grams per serving and sodium 730 mg per serving.  There are some vitamins, but I don't think they were added in intentionally, just a product of the food contained within.<br /><br />I wouldn't buy this flavor again.  Too watery and the taste wasn't that fantastic.  I'll stick to the other flavors from the brand.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012 Rosemary Potato Chowder  2 3
If you want delicious Organic Vegan gummy bears go for the Surf Sweets "Fruity Bears" instead they are delicious. These are hard and fairly tasteless in comparison Yuck  2 1
I don't trust dog treats (or much else) from China.<br />WISH AMAZON WOULD StART A MADE IN AMERICA CATEGORY!!<br />I love my Amazon prime account. I would be willing to pay a few dollars for a "PRIME USA" account great product but it is from China  2 1
I expected more with this chef's name on this product, but the flavor was blah. I even thought the first cup I tasted was a little fishy in its flavor. Tastes like a cup I would expect from Folgers and other common brands. Disappointing  2 1
I expect salt in a salmon jerky, but this is fully twice the salt level as a similar item I also purchased. Worse, it permiated the flavor. It was like salmon jerky texture with salmon-salt flavor.  The package is 1.25 oz and in what seems stilly, claim 1.25 servings. Gee thanks. So of course we will eat the whole thing and the 38% of salt for a day is really about 46%.  I might as well eat Campbell soup if I wanted salt poisoning at that level - it'd be a lot cheaper.<br /><br />I did find one bone. I would not count that as a problem.  I did not like that the pieces were chopped into fairly small chips. Oh the salt level  2 3
Since there seem to be no more Sunmaid Honey Bran Muffin mixes out there, I bought this brand but it doesn't compare. I won't purchase again. Honey Bran Muffins  2 4
She ate this but not very quickly.  Then she proceeded to stink up whatever room she was in for about the next 8 hours.<br /><br />Looks like others are having digestive issues.  Nothing life threatening here, just flatulence.  She didn't care...we did. The dog kind of enjoyed it, we didn't enjoy the dog at all  2 1
My husband has gluten sensitivity, so we've tried several gluten-free pastas.  This one does not hold together, even with the minimum cook time, and it turns into smaller bits, making my pot of spaghetti runny and not noodly enough.  I won't buy it again. Turns to bits.  2 3
Ordered this last month, and now regret it. The texture is right, saltiness about right, and sweetness about right, but there's an off-flavor here. Chew on one for awhile, then blow some air back through your nose: to me, it smells like ammonia. Not strong, but very off. Last time I bought Gimbal's. Too soft, but the flavor is much better; wish I had gone with Gimbal's again. Off-flavor for K&H Money Coin Licorice  2 3
I found this when I was shopping at Walmart and decided to give it a try.  I do have to say that it does smell good being "brewed".  I was very disappointed to find out that it tastes like the crap that you get at a convenient store.  Once you have Real Cappuccino you really can't ever drink that CRAPuccino at convenient stores.  I know I won't ever buy any of their "cappuccino" again, but I will give their hot chocolate and apple cider a try in hopes that they are drinkable. Yuck!  2 1
Salt and vinegar is just ok to me.<br />They are not in the same league of utz Salt and vinegar potato chips.<br /><br />Just ok<br /><br />Not enough taste to them. Not my cup of tea  2 3
I know these are supposed to be good for you but they are a little hard to get down without lots of liquid.  Also, way too expensive.  I don't think I will be buying them again. Like Hockey Pucks  2 3
I order 2 cases,(12 packs per case), every 45 days or so. In the past, a few crackers were broken. No problem. In my last 2 orders, nearly 3/4 of the crackers werw either broken or totally crumbled! When Amazon shipped the packages, there was very little packing material to protect the crackers. I currently have 2, unopened cases. Crackers or crumbs? Cracker Crumbs  2 3
I bought this pack from costco last week. However, I feel all the chips in these packets are undercooked ones. I was wondering thats how they make these economical 1oz packets. I clearly see the difference between big bag of Lay's and these tiny bags. I do not like them. Will never buy again These are undercooked chips.  2 1
Bought the tub at BJ's 33.9 ounce, Decaf Folgers and brought it home and it had no odor. Made it and it was no good. Exchanged it and second tub had very little coffee odor and again not so good. Could BJ's have gotten a bad batch. We have been drinking this decaf coffee for quite a few years and like it. Is there an explanation for these recent purchases. No odor  2 1
This coffee was far from the worst I have ever had, but it was not very good.  It was more bitter than most coffee, and it had an acrid, thin taste to it.  At $12.25/lb (26.96 for 2.2 lbs) it is simply not worth the price. I can buy Peet's at the grocery store or online for $10/lb and it is superior in every way. Mediocre coffee, not worth buying  2 1
I bought these chips in May 2009, and they were best eaten by 9/12/2009.  When I first got them, they were very tasty and exactly what I had expected.  I would have rated them 4 or 5 stars then.<br /><br />However starting in early August, there was a definite odd taste that was starting to creep into the chip.  And here in early September they are totally inedible.  My guess is that the oils used have gone rancid in the chip, since they are using natural oils.  Normally this is a very good thing, but the longevity of the product is sacrificed due to it, which is a problem when you are buying chips in 12 bag packages!<br /><br />So if you are purchasing these chips please make sure you are able to eat them quickly, they will not be any good about 1 month before the best eaten by date.  I had to throw away about 5 bags.... Good, as long as they are still fresh  2 3
When I received the item, the part of the label with the weight had been torn off which made me suspicious.  I weighed the item on my electronic kitchen scale and the weight including the plastic bag was 4 pounds 14 ounces instead of 5 pounds of nibs as advertised.  I later transferred the nibs to another container and weighed the empty plastic bag; it was .95 ounces so I was shortchanged almost 3 ounces of nibs. Not quite 5 pounds  2 1
First ever problem we've experienced with k-cups and it's this Timothy's variety. At least 50% of the cups did not function properly, water for whatever reason/s does not flow out of the k-cup properly. will not buy again  2 1
This a nice tea chest, but for the price, I was really shocked by the size.  It is not worth the $50 it cost.  I wouldn't send this as a gift again, it's worth half the price! was dissapointed with the size  2 3
it is not what was expected,flavor is not that great,kind of overpowered by certain spices,not worth the price and shipping cost,Tabasco is probably better way to go spice girl  2 3
I love bold/extra bold k-cups, but unlike some other choices this one was intense, bitter, and far too strong for my palate. I'm really surprised I didn't like this one since I have yet to find an extra bold k-cup that I didn't like.<br /><br />Some other choices I enjoy, in case you also found this way too strong:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002AQ0OS0">Timothy's World Coffee Rainforest Extra Bold Espresso K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO6DM0">Green Mountain Coffee Fair Trade Organic Espresso Blend (Extra Bold), K-cups For Keurig Brewers, 24-count,  Boxes (Pack of 2)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5Y8Y">Green Mountain Coffee Dark Magic (Extra Bold), K-cups For Keurig Brewers, 24-count,  Boxes (Pack of 2)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO7GYY">Newman's Own Organics Special Blend (Extra Bold), K-cups For Keurig Brewers, 24-count,  Boxes (Pack of 2)</a> I love extra bold, but not this one!  2 3
The price was comparable to Walmart for same size product.  However these nuts were not as crunchy; and they needed a little more salt. Too bland  2 3
I can't figure out why anyone would want to drink this stuff!? The can is 1/3 less in size than a regular can of soda, it's got more sugar and more calories and it doesn't taste very good. It's also a bit expensive for what your getting.......need I say more?......I think not! TOO SWEET AND TOO SMALL! SWITCH!?? I THINK NOT!  2 3
I srewed the top off the bottle without removing the hard plastic pull ring. Makes me wonder if it's safe to use. There is not other covering and I put the cap back on and it looks like it's never been opened! Since it's a powered supplement this doesnt look safe. I gave it a two because of the seal and the fact that I'll probably have to return it. Not sure bottle was sealed  2 1
I wouldn't say my twins are picky eater, but they wouldn't eat this one.  They eat just about every Gerber's organics. My twins hates it!  2 1
Quality is OK but if you need maltodextring in larger but not huge quantities, buy Carbo Gain from NOW Foods. Much better bang for the buck. Overpriced  2 3
I have to admit, I was a sucker for the large quantity, 12 oz, when shopping for hot sauces ...but now seeing the size of the bottle, it reminds of wing-sauce bottle sizes.  Plastic bottle.  It does have a convenient squirt top.  But overall, not very hot or tasty, and made mostly from jalape&ntilde;os.  If I had seen the ingredients list I would not have bought it:<br />Jalapenos<br />Water<br />Vinegar<br />Brown Sugar<br />Lime Juice<br />Fish Sauce<br />Cilantro<br />Habanero<br />Garlic<br />Spice Blend<br />Salt<br />Potassium Sorbate<br />Xanthan Gum Not hot, not habanero  2 3
It tasts fine... But I was expecting a 3 1/2 lb. beef brisket...instead i got five packs of shaved smoked beef. Not bad mind you, but the description clearly leads one to expect a WHOLE beef brisket... I can get sliced meat at the local deli... I was expecting much more.<br /><br />James Hatsis Not as advertised!  2 3
I would never recommend this item. I made it tonight with some vegetables and it pretty much ruined dinner. The taste is very bland (unlike other brown rice pasta that I've had) and the noodles are so small that they seem to divide and conquer the plate and completely take over. These are thinner than regular vermicelli and probably should just be labeled as an Asian brown rice noodle instead of trying to be an Italian vermicelli noodle. If you're seeking a brown rice noodle that tastes good and has substance to it, this isn't it. Try Tinkyada instead. Don't like this  2 1
This product is Hackleback Sturgeon roe which is very good. The problem I have with the supplier is that it is over priced. One may<br />purchase this product from Marky's Caviar-- the exact same caviar from Markys for a little over 43 dollars for 2 oz not 64 dollars for 1 oz.<br />The shipping for this product is also outrageous. If you like this product which I did get the most for your money from Marky's Caviar and<br />forget Charleston Seafood. I had even called Charleston and they were not able to  help me when confronted with the facts so poor<br />customer service. Overpriced  2 1
I have bought these numerous times over the years as a 'backup' quick lunch at work if the need arises.  Frankly it was my favorite flavor since I tended to vary the noodle flavors I bought over the years for variety.  But this last order convinces me I wont be buying this flavor again.  What once was a good "Peanut Sesame Noodle" is now a horrible "Lemon Noodle with peanuts".  They changed the recipe for the peanut sauce and it's now just overpowering lemon grass. I don't expect fine dining when I get these, but I do expect edible and it's nearly not. Changed Recipe ruined a great product  2 1
I was doing the 5-6 meal a day thing and trying to get some lean protein in between lectures until I could get some lunch. I work out and eat pretty healthy but was trying to lean up some more but as a college student don't always have the time and resources to cook a bunch of chicken breasts. Overall, these are pretty bad. They have low sugar, and are just about the cheapest protein bars you can get, but I'm 175lbs and these just don't really satisfy any hunger, and in fact only whet my appetite and make me hungry for some real food. I think the cheap price is just not worth the bad taste, and hunger they don't fill.  If you're looking for quick convenient good tasting protein that gives you a little sometime to go on, I would go for some protein powder like Syntha 6 or something, or at least get a little more expensive, slightly more sugary but more filling and better tasting bar like Builder Bars. These can be a last resort if you're just looking to stash them around here and there in case you find yourself without something to eat but you can definitely do better. If you're going to go against my advice, I would recommend getting the peanut butter instead of the chocolate, because cheap, fake, crappy peanut butter still tastes better than cheap fake crappy chocolate, and I've had both, the chocolate is much worse. Also, pair it up with an apple or banana or something to help fill you up a little more and have at least something with some nutritional value in there. Nothing special, gets the job done  2 4
These are not traditional udon noodles.. these are flatter noodles and are not as chewy. It's not a bad noodle but it says Udon and it is not udon. Not udon noodles.  2 1
Very dry, difficult to find that happy-place with this product.<br />I grew up in a Greek restaurant, I know food.........this product have us problems. Maybe missing quality-control, storing issues? Not sure.<br />There's far better products available for the money. Dry. No matter how it was prepared, dry, course, lumpy, clumpy  2 1
As I have problems with sleep at night and tried all sorts of things which are most commonly recommended to improve it, I tought I try this well rated product. I tried it in all the various recommended dosages. But it didn't make the slightest difference for me. Thus I guess that it probably only works if the cause of the unrest is a magnesium deficiency.<br />Reportedly:<br />"With supplements, overdose is possible, however, particularly in people with poor renal function; occasionally, with use of high cathartic doses of magnesium salts, severe hypermagnesemia has been reported to occur even without renal dysfunction".<br />"Safety Issues<br />The US government has set the following upper limits for use of magnesium supplements:<br />Children<br />1-3 years: 65 mg<br />4-8 years: 110 mg<br />Adults: 350 mg<br />Pregnant or Nursing Women: 350 mg"<br />"It has been called nature's calcium channel blocker."<br />"Magnesium assists in calcium uptake, but it also competes with dietary calcium for the same absorption site in the intestine. Excessive dietary calcium (or phosphorus) is much more likely to block magnesium absorption than vice- versa in the typical American diet. Magnesium absorption is also inhibited by excessive dietary fat, phosphate, lactose, phytates and oxalates which form insoluble compounds with magnesium. Magnesium is also lost in diarrhea, long term use of diuretics, excessive sugar intake and protein malnutrition...<br />...  there are lower levels of minerals in food today due to depletion of the soil in modern farming methods. (23) Modern methods of milling, processing and the preservation of food cause nutrient losses, eg 85% of magnesium is removed from whole wheat in the milling."<br />Thus it is advisable to consult a qualified health care provider if a deficiency is suspected.<br />It's usually best to avoid deficiencies by a healthy diet: "Kelp is very high in magnesium, as are whole grains, almonds, and cashews..." Chemical supplements should be taken based on the advice of a qualified health care provider  2 1
This product is labeled "100% of what you want". But one look at the nutrition facts and you may not agree. While it contains 100% juice and vitamin C, no preservatives or sugar, it contains 135 calories, 15 mg of sodium, and a whopping 34 grams of carbohydrates. All this in a tiny 8.3 oz can! I also thought it was too sweet for my tastes, but I normally drink a diet carbonated beverage, so the sweetness did jump out at me. Just okay. I won't add this to my shopping list. Lots of calories and carbs  2 3
I ordered this coffee a while back when it was $.40 a cup. I enjoy the Hazelnut creme as well as the Breakfast Blend. I would be willing to buy this coffee again but not at the current price of a dollar something per cup, that's ridiculous. There are a lot of K Cups out there for cheaper that are as of similiar quality. I don't know why they would even think this is a good price!!!! to much money  2 4
This coffee is weak and bitter.  I like bold and smooth coffee (such as Tullys or Starbucks). This coffee is barely a step up from grandma and grandpas instant folgers coffee. YECH! never again. Weak coffee - only a small step up from Folgers Instant. Yech.  2 1
I have to be upfront and tell you my family loves these but I do not. I do not like baked Lays or Pringles either. This product reminded me of them, not the same but similar. My son wanted me to try them and then invest in the company. I am glad so many people like them but I will pass on eating them and it looks like it is a private company.... So no stock either. Family loved them but this is MY review  2 3
I just don't see the reason why you should buy this when there's a box of Pocky, Stikko, and pretty much any other chocolate-related product sitting right next to it. You've got a couple bucks, why buy this when you could buy something much better with your money?<br />These have the same problem I had with pocky-- Sure, the chocolate part is good, but when you get to the bread(?) it's just bland as heck and out of place. I'd rather just buy a chocolate bar made by the same company, ya'know?<br />And don't misunderstand-- There is absolutely no bread inside the chocolate part of the candy, at least any that matters enough that you can taste it. Why can't they just be split apart and sold as two different candies? That'd how I felt when I ate it. (But then again, the bread(?) part of it isn't all that great in the first place, enough to be sold.)<br />They're cute. That's pretty much it. I just don't see why I'd ever eat these unless someone else bought them and offered them to me. They're not BAD-- But they're just stupid. Stupid in candy design. Unbalanced. It's like buying Lucky Charms and picking out the marshmellows, really. That's what it feels like. And again, I must ask, why do you buy Lucky Charms if you could easily just buy a cereal completely made out of marshmellows?<br />Also, for the cute mushroom aspect-- The mushroom tops are always tipped sideways. That's also a damper when the packaging clearly makes them all look like they're balanced. Eh.. Well, it's okay, but why buy it?  2 3
I like Dynasty Chinese Five Spice as a product.  I use it in stir fry.  It is a strong flavoring that works well for me since I reduce my sodium intake. I wasn't able to find it locally when I ran out, so I decided to buy  the 6 pack choice thinking it should last for a year and a half or so.  In this case, the spices all came with a best used by 12/15/12 date.. 4 months only. I got.. old(er) spice.  Disappointing. Old Spice  2 3
I looked for a long while to find a dry kibble that my cats would enjoy and tolerate. One cannot have rice or other grains. They preferred the previous formula of Nature's Variety Instinct Rabbit meal formula. I purchased a new bag and the cats wouldn't touch it and in fact were repelled by it. I looked at the ingredients and the order, and they were the same until you got to the ingrediant "Natural Chicken flavor" on the old bag. On the new bag, it said "Natural pork flavor."  The individual kibble are flatter and airy and the old kibble was denser and a bit rounder.  Further the old formula says "90%+ of the protein is from rabbit,salmon,chicken, herring meals." The new formula says "75% pure animal ingredients and nutriousl oils."  In any case, there are some differences. I'm not sure if it is the pork flavor, the disc texture and density or even if there is a change in the ratio. THe first bag references the percentage of protein and its identity, whereas the new bage simply indicates the percentage of animal ingredients. I have some sad kitties who loved the old formula. Looking at [...] review of premium dry, it also lists other types that might also appeal to kitties. Nature's Variety has changed their formula  2 3
I gave this review 2 stars because the dark chocolate isn't bad.  The plum bits are very hard, mostly flavorless.  It's like eating chocolate covered cardboard.  I would not recommend these to anyone.  The plum bits are so small, I can't image you would get that much benefit from any antioxidants. Go eat a regular prune and a good piece of dark chocolate and you'll be much happier. fruit is awful  2 1
This was the most potent orange drink I have ever had. It might be "100% juice," but this drink has some kick.<br /><br />There are no artificial sweeteners in this drink, but it is so highly concentrated that it was overwhelmingly sweet and even the tang of the carbonation couldn't cute into the sugary flavor.<br /><br />It was WAY too strong for me and I thought it had kind of an odd aftertaste, but if you like carbonation and have a powerful craving for orange-tangerine, this is the drink for you. Now that's orange  2 4
Got these with a one-day shipping delay, but still very quickly with Amazon Prime.  The taste is quite good, perhaps a little on the sweet side - especially when you hit a pocket of white chocolate.  The big problem is the condition of the product when it arrives.  I opened my first 2-pack and the granola bars were crushed into nuggets and powder.  Strangely, the box wasn't in bad shape, just the bars.  A few days later, I opened the other box of granola bars, which was in better shape than the first one, and the first pack I tried again contained smashed fragments of granola bars.  These are no fun to eat, as you can't really open the pack and pour it into your mouth (I tried), and if you pick out the big chunks you get fragments and powder sticking to your fingers, and on your clothes (and in your beard).  I'll eat the rest, maybe out of a bowl with a spoon or something (with some fava beans and a nice chianti...), but I won't be ordering any more crunched Clif Crunch bars. Crunched Crunch  2 3
Popcorn tastes OK -- but the kernal pop way too small.  It's like a whole bowl of the bottom of the tub of popcorn crumbs.  Regular Orville Redenbacher popcorn is much better Kernals Pop too small  2 3
i picked those bars, because they're my favorite larabars. When package arrived, I noticed, that even though there's still 2 months till expiration  date, my bars are stale and don't taste as the one I was usually getting at my grocery store. Disappointed  2 1
I ordered this product in hope of obtaining a good chocolate substitute for my toddler to snack on. Unfortunately, beside a lot of sugar these chips are loaded with saturated fats - almost certainly with plenty of trans fats since the oils are listed as being partially-hydrogenated [trans fat content not described on label]. Taste-wise these chips are too sweet for my liking but at least have the basic carob flavor that I remember from chips available in the stores back in the 80s and 90s - albeit a purer carob with less fat content would be most welcomed. maybe alright for baking but must have high trans fat content  2 3
I have tried and enjoyed The Switch black cherry flavor, but their kiwi-strawberry left a lot to be desired.  To my palate, the flavor seemed a mix of floral and medicine-y, not very pleasant.  I appreciate the fact that they are trying to push a healthy alternative to soda (basically carbonated water and fruit juice), but they need to get the flavor right. Not Up to Par Taste-wise  2 3
These used to be my dogs favorite treat till they changed them . They used to have a meaty texture now like most dog treats have a rubbery texture. Id pay more for the old style but wont buy these any longer. jam1037  2 1
The coffee is good. However, at least half of these haven't been sealed correctly. When I brew them the edge of the foil pops open and coffee grounds go everywhere. Not fun to clean. It may have just been the batch we got, but I won't be ordering these again. poorly sealed  2 3
Somehow failed to blow up the packaging and discover that despite the attractive description of this coffee that it is MILD. Very clear on the front of the box which is only seen if you blow up the picture of the product. Somehow missed Mild in the description of Coffee Ordered  2 3
It appears Amazon may have gotten a bad batch, or they are very old.  I was excited to find these as my Husky-Shepard has allergies to Beef & Chicken and these did not contain either.  They are expensive, but I decided to try them.  When I opened them they have all sorts of holes (looks like air holes) in them and the dog (66#) had a hard time chewing through them.  I think she liked the flavor, but biscuits shouldn't be so difficult to eat. I saw several other people with the same comments, so I believe either Amazon or the manufacturer needs to figure out what is happening with these.  Had they been $1.00 a bag I would figure I got what I paid for. Bad Batch of dog biscuits?  2 1
Popchips are ok.  However, these snacks are made from potato flakes, similar to "Pringles".  If you have ever eaten "Funyuns" the onion flavored rings made by Frito Lay you have already tasted pretty much what Popchips taste like, just without the onion flavoring.  If your not concerned with calories, but simply want the best potato chip you can buy, try "Grandma Utz" potato chips, a true potato chip. Not A True Potato Chip  2 3
I'm really sad about this. I was so excited to get this particular brand since it was so well received by everyone else. I went w/salt instead of oil so it would keep better and the whole bit about truffle oil not even containing real truffles. I was going to savor every last black bit of ambrosia in this little container. Alas, it was not to be. The aroma is definitely there, but after I put it on steaks, chicken, fries, burgers, pastas, etc, the truffle didn't come through. To get enough truffle flavor, I basically had to oversalt my food with this.<br /><br />Maybe I just got a bad batch. Maybe the seal went awry and the heat during shipping caused an irreversible chemical process whereby the truffle aromatic ringed compounds left my jar. I'm not sure. I'm just sad. And without truffle goodness. Overhyped, Underdelivered  2 1
Very disappointed...cookies arrived stale.  This is the only time I have had a problem like this. Perhaps there should be more attention when this product is shipped. arrived stale  2 1
I thought for sure I was going to love this tea. I love licorice and I like my teas sweet. I was so disappointed in the flavor of this product! It has very little licorice taste and an almost sickening after taste and smell. I added sugar to it as I did not find it very sweet. I ordered the 6 box pack of this so I guess I have 5 boxes of it to give away Disappointed  2 1
Amazon normally does a fantastic job getting product out to me in great shape and on-time, but, I guess this is one product that they can not.<br /><br />Several jars had compromised seals and so we had to immediately throw them out.  I wish I could order this by mail but it seems this is one item we'll need to go to the grocery store for. Product is good; Amazon fulfillment is poor  2 1
My kids love these, and we've ordered them often - but as was the case with at least one other reviewer, this batch came in with some mold. (I freeze them as soon as they arrive, so had the have been moldy upon arrival.)<br /><br />too bad - but at this price, won't run the risk of having to toss out product. poor quality control.... moldy  2 1
I won't pretend to be an expert on olive oils;  but I will attest to being a family cook and consumer of olive oils and this one did not strike me as quite what I was expecting. The first whiff gives a hint of stale and when blind-taste-tested in my home kitchen by my husband, my ten year old and me- dipping crusty sourdough bread-straight-up, no herbs, no garlic no other flavors- 2 out of 3 of us selected the OTHER first-cold-pressed, Virgin Olive Oil from Italy;  we were trying to buy more American stuffs but will stick with our imported Italian olive oils for now. OK,  for me, this one is fine for sauteeing- just not the best fresh flavor for dipping or dressings. In case it it matters substantially-  the bottle indicates: 'Harvested  Fall '07 and Bottled 6-21-08' Flavor or not  2 1
These are tasty, but after I'd eat a bag, my heart would practically seize. I looked at the packaging and it was 275mg of sodium. I threw the rest away. What a bummer. So tasty, but way way way way way too much salt! Salt licks  2 3
When I returned to work my supply really went down. I was afraid I would not be able to continue breastfeeding. Just one cup of tea a day has increased my supply so much that I have to wear nursing pads again! However, my baby does not like this tea. Whenever I nurse her after drinking this tea she screams like she is in severe pain. I don't want her to hurt, so I have discontinued use of this tea. Really increases supply but makes my baby cry  2 1
These Lipton iced-tea packets are a great concept. Essentially, you can take these little packets anywhere, pour it into a (standard 16.9 fl. oz.) bottle of water, and enjoy some tea. It's quick and easy, but unfortunately these Tea & Honey packets don't seem to actually work very well.<br /><br />The box warns, "Tea takes longer to dissolve so SHAKE WELL." This, however, is a pretty big understatement in my experience. After pouring the powder in, I shook the bottle a couple times and found that the powder clumped together immediately. I shook and shook and shook, but to no avail. Certainly, it flavored the water, but there were also big sugar-particles floating around my bottle. I tried it once more but to the same result.<br /><br />It's really a shame because the taste is quite good, much like a pomegranate flavored-water. But along with this good taste, your mouth is filled with an unpleasant amount of sugar clumps. Of course, it would be possible to filter these out with a strainer of some kind, although that would totally defeat the convenience aspect of the product. It's unfortunate. Good taste but fatally flawed  2 3
I had a really difficult time choking these down. It'd be great if they made noodle 1/2 from this and 1/2 from a grain. Still b half the calories and actually edible. i guess if your desperate and not too picky of an eater these could work for you. these taste pretty awful  2 1
By now I've eaten half the bag so I know what's in here. Sure, their beef jerky is pretty tender. But for some reason they decided to throw in an insane amount of salt. I've had store-bought beef jerky and I've had quality Amazon beef jerky and this is definitely the saltiest by at least double. The first time I ate this, I could only handle 2 strips before I had to put it down again. My friend made a disgusted face and refused to have another bite. Luckily I am a salt lover so I can at least tolerate the extreme saltiness. But it's still too salty.<br /><br />Next up is the gristle. Sometimes amidst the generally tender bites there will be a mat of unchewable mass that I pretty much have to spit out or swallow whole. It happens more often than other brands and definitely more than I care for. Secondly, I don't know if it's the salt playing tricks on me, but the texture and taste is a bit worse than other brands, like they use lower quality jerky.<br /><br />Overall I believe that Wild Ride is less quality than most other brands, even when you factor in the low price. There are similarly priced brands that are of higher quality and lower sodium content. I don't know why they sell so well. Personally my next bulk order beef jerky will be with someone else. Tender as promised, but more salt and gristle than bargained for  2 3
The taste is better than Captain Crunch because it is not soooooo sweet, however, this cereal gets really soggy.  I know it doesn't boast that it stays crunchy even in milk, but it gets soggy as soon as you pour the milk, and I am not exaggerating. my least favorite Kashi cereal  2 3
I ordered this product with the expectation of receiving a fresh product. There were clumps in the individual cups that didn't dissolve in the hot water coming from the machine. Other K-Cups that I've purchased are all powder, but the Cafe Vanilla had problems that you could hear when you shook the cup. With the clumps not dissolving in the water, the flavor is more watered-down than it should be. I have used other products from this same line of K-Cups, but this was sub-par to any other K-Cup I've ever purchased. Not Fresh!  2 1
I like Special K, but this product loses its crunch very quickly. It turns starchy and is like eating sweet mush. I won't be ordering this again. In fact, I will probably throw away the few cups I have remaining. Starchy and too sweet  2 1
I ordered six jars of these. The taste disappointed me. Two of the jars arrived broken and I was give a refund for the two jars. I guess with the taste problems I'll try a different product. Not a great product.  2 1
I really like Earth's Best Baby Foods and Amazon, but these jars were packaged so that glass touches glass... this may not be worth the good price.<br /> The jars arrived all wrapped up in bubble wrap, but 2 of the 8 jars were broken inside.  It was a big mess to clean up the broken glass and baby food.  Also, per the amazon return policy, grocery items are not returnable. 2 of 8 jars arrived broken BIG MESS (non returnable)  2 1
I love Smores, the combination of chocolate, marshmallows and graham crackers are outstanding. I also love Emerald nuts, so when I saw this at my local grocer, I had to try them.  Right away, the biggest problem with this snack is the marshmallows, if you can even call them that.  The marshmallows look like erasers from a pencil, and they are as hard as a rock.  I am not exagerrating, I nearly broke a tooth the first time I tried to bite one.  Are they stale?  Expiration date says September of 2012. I am not sure, maybe I got a bad package of these.  I am hesitant to buy another box.  The rest of the snack mix is fine, the cocoa walnuts, honey roasted peanuts, m&ms, graham chunks and oat clusters all tasted as they should.  But the most important part of the "smores", the marshmallows, was a major letdown. Rock hard marshmallows bring this snack down  2 3
I had very high expectation with this product, but the first cup I gave my son, he got sick with the taste and then developed aversion towards all chocolate products. I am consuming this product for the family now. Average so so  3 1
Packing for shipment was shoddy...  wrapping glass containers in bubble wrap is good.. but the bubble wrap should encircle the entire container...  don't leave the top and bottom unprotected... especially if you pack them in nice and tight to the corners of the box.. one good hit on the end of the box and you shatter the containers inside...  guess how I know this? Product Fine -- Packing Shoddy  3 2
Definitely not a generic box of chocolate that you buy from your grocery, but I wasn't too impressed otherwise.  Many pieces, the chocolate covering was just too thin.  The other problem, I feel their chews are just too hard/tough.  Quite a few pieces had a waxy, dry hue to them--like they were old.  I sampled two assorted (one mix, one dark).  Felt the cremes in the bunch were the best of the lot--some nice flavors and thick texture.  I know I will probably sound like a shill but Loweryscandies out of indiana are my favorite, but hey, look at my other product reviews--I'm no shill! Good but not great  3 2
I thought this toy would be great for my dog.  He was in desperate need of mental stimulation and I thought if he could figure out a puzzle while he was eating his dinner that would be great.  However, within the first 20-30 minutes he had it, the rubber "tug" rope was broken in half.  I think he chewed on it some, but I think the actual cause of it breaking was being bent since it was a smooth break instead of jagged.  He still uses it though, even without the rope.  Instead of tugging it now he'll stand it upright, knock it over, and eat the spilled contents or sometimes he'll turn it upsidedown.  Even though he isn't using it the way it was meant to be he still likes it and gets a lot of use out of it. Tug a Jug  3 2
I must echo many others' criticisms distinguishing between Thailand and Sri Lanka cans. Thailand cans are smooth and creamy; Sri Lanka cans are thin and watery. Unfortunately, Amazon cannot guarantee which you will receive, so I'll have to drop this from my Subscribe & Saves. Thailand / Sri Lanka  3 2
I thought I finally found a toy that would last for hours with my doberman and pit bull.  The first time I gave them the everlasting treat ball it did take a few hours for them to figure it out which was fantastic, but now they know how to pop the treat out within 5 to 10 minutes!!  They also love the bouncy ball with the rawhide rings, but again they get those out in one minute.  These toys are to expensive to go that fast.  I'm sure these work great for smaller breeds. Great at first  3 5
These chips are pretty good.  They taste just good enough for me to want to eat some, and just bad enough for me to only want one or two.  Great for a diet. Pretty good  3 4
We like these crackers but the last two times we ordered them all the<br /><br />crackers were smashed. Condition  3 2
This product is great as you will see an increase in your milk supply probably btw 1-3 days after taking these pills BUT what I did notice 3/4wks into taking it that all of a sudden I was eating like I was pregnant (increased appetite) and needless to say looking very swollen and gaining extra weight.  It wasnt until almost more than half of the bottle done I decided to do more research and found out that this was the reason why all of a sudden I was noticeably gaining weight :(.  I will stop taking it starting TODAY!  but will con't pumping while at work and nursing even if I have to wake up in the middle of the night to keep my flow going.  I hope to stick with Blessed Thistle and Mothers Milk Tea Bags hopefully there are no more unwanted surprises. Works Great BUT promotes WEIGHT GAIN!!!!  3 4
I can not tell you how good the chocolate covere cashews were, as I received instead chocolate covered cherries.  But I can state that they shipped each bag of chocolate with a cold pack to ensure the contents didn't melt while in shipment.  Nice jester on their part. Swapped on packaging  3 4
I'm a total ZICO loyalist and buy at least 6 liters a week. I decided to purchase from Amazon since they deliver and those bottles are heavy to shelp up my stairs. I would give this 5 stars but 3 out of my 6 bottles had cap defects. The caps were starting to separate from the bottle which resulted in leakage and possible contamination.<br /><br />I've seen this in grocery stores as well, so I know it's not an "Amazon" issue. :(<br /><br />I notified Zico online- I guess we will see what happens.<br /><br />On a unrelated note.. Amazon you should have a spell check option within the review section... Love the product but packaging issues- BECAREFUL!!!  3 2
This popcorn tastes good, just do not add all the salt if you are sensitive.  It is not soft/fluffy popcorn.  The kernels all pop (using 1/2 of the 8 oz pack in a Westbend StirCrazy popper), but they are not light and fluffy kernels and they pop very small. Taste good, but very small popped kernels  3 4
This is a great product, but at a price that is ridiculous.  Costco was offering this product at 6.99 for a box of 4.  That is $1.75 a packet.  Why is this vendor selling this same product at over twice the cost, when they probably have half the overhead as Costco.  I love the product, but refuse to buy at this price. Price on this product is ridiculously expensive!  3 1
I will say upfront that there are very few dark chocolates that I like. I'm a fan of Ghiradelli, and Lindt, but not most of the others I've tried. The Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate was tasty, but the texture wasn't as smooth as some of the others I've tried. I'd say it's better than most (say, Hershey's Dark) but still needs tweaking to be as good as Lindt. Expected it to be smoother  3 4
The Alvita tea is not very tasty. But it does pack a punch of benefits. It is priced well. Billberry is healthy for you. I gave it a 3 only because of taste. Alvita Tea  3 4
I really liked the illy Cappuccino coffee drink I previously tried, so I thought I would enjoy this caffe' Italian Espresso style coffee drink as well. While this is less calories (50 per can) and has a really bold flavor, it is a bit too strong for my liking. Now if you are a regular espresso drinker, you will most likely enjoy this very much. I tend to go for my drinks on the sweeter side. I also felt this drink was a bit on the "watery" side. I would have liked it to bit creamier, but obviously that would mean more calories. I also believe espresso tends to be stronger in general. So lesson here: I should have known better because I am not a HUGE fan of espresso. Now that being said, it still was good enough that I would enjoy it occasionally as a mid-day pick me up drink because it certainly helped get me through a mid-day slump! It wasn't all that bad, just not something I, myself would drink everyday. BOLD FLAVOR  3 4
I bought this device and use a brand new sure 52 with it.<br /><br />The noise and feedback I received with this device was horrible - I might have a bad unit.<br /><br />When I called customer service, a real person answered right away and offered to expedite getting me a new unit. (Very cool and is why I gave them 3 stars for now)<br /><br />I'll see how that process goes and update my review. Still up in the air  3 1
This is a high-quality food, but I think it's best for young, active dogs.  I bought it for my 11 year old mixed breed because he needs grain-free food for his itching.  It worked for that, and he loved the taste.  However, he's had some problems recently, and blood tests showed liver inflammation, as well as elevated cholesterol and very high triglycerides.  NONE of the problems were caused by TOTW, but it's extremely high in fat and protein, so it's exactly wrong as a maintenance diet for a dog like him.  Many older dogs have similar problems, so unless your older dog has had recent, comprehensive blood-testing, you may not want to put him/her on such a rich food.  My dog is improving on a low fat, moderate protein diet.  If I had a young dog getting plenty of exercise, a food with a minimum of 18% fat and 32% protein would probably be just fine. Best for Young Dogs  3 4
I don't use energy shots often but wanted to have some around just in case.  So I've bought a pack of this stuff and two months later the results have usually been hit or miss. Sometimes I feel it, sometimes I forget I've taken it and go about my business.  So I won't be going into details on the performance.<br /><br />The price was great and flavor was good with no strong after taste or anything.<br /><br />My issue with this product is that 90% of the time I open a bottle it, it has brown residue around the rim of the bottle. I see this after peeling off perforated cap band and unscrewing the cap.  I think that if the band were not there the caps would eventually come loose and all of the liquid would spill out.  I do not fear that the bottles have been tampered with but it's a bit unsettling.  Before anyone says it's due to how long I've had it, it's only been two months and I store them in my kitchen cabinets and my desk drawer at work.<br /><br />I believe Red Rain competitors have a small foil seal under the caps which prevent leakage.  Perhaps the lack of this enables them to cut the cost of the product?  At the moment, i will not be buying this item again, if however this issue was corrected I may consider buying Red Rain again. Leaky Bottles?  3 2
I do not expect miracles from Taco Bell and this certainly is not a miracle.<br /><br />it is bland, with a hint of spice.  Might be better titles "Chipotle Sauce For People Who Do Not Like Spicy Food".<br /><br />The closest I can come is to say it tastes like generic ranch dressing with a hint of Chipotle flavor.  I think you could safely give this to a five year old without fear of burning anything.<br /><br />it's not bad, makes a decent dipping sauce for chicken nuggets but don't expect any real "zing" to your cooking with this<br /><br />I'll admit my wife took one sniff and declined but she hates *anything* even vaguely hot and while this is not very hot at all, you do get a hint of spice in it.<br /><br />With green peppers a "1" and Habaneros a "10", this is about a "1.1" on the heat sscale.  It's not bad but it's not great and if you expect real spice and heat, try elsewhere on Amazon.<br /><br />(May I suggest <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00061EPZO">TABASCO brand Chipotle Pepper Sauce 5oz.</a> for a real Chipotle experience?)<br /><br />Or if you want to go full gonzo: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M0ETJ6">HOT SAUCE FROM HELL, DEVIL'S REVENGE, HABANERO, from Ass Kickin'</a> Neither Bold Nor Spicy  3 2
This product is so light weight. It is easily tipped over. The plastic is not very heavy and if the dog is very rough with it at all, the doors can snap off, even break off which was the experience that I had with the first one I owned.<br />I would not recomment this product. Too lightweight  3 2
You can get it cheaper at stores, around $3.00 each.<br />I'm not sure why would I buy 4 boxes at a time and pay more than $3.00 each. Cheaper at stores  3 1
This drink is spicy! It's surprising how much of a kick that ginger has, and the honey and lemon are nearly drowned out in the ginger flavor. I drank it warm, and it was a nice and soothing beverage on a cold day. I use ginger a lot for its anti-nausea effects, and I could see trying this to help combat motion sickness. That said, even watered down slightly, the kick was still a lot for me and it was rather hard to drink the entire cup in one sitting. Spicy, but I'd rather just drink tea  3 4
I don't want to comment on how this protein shake affected my body.  I will only say that I worked out like usual and drank this powder mixed with milk and neither gained nor lost weight.  I like that there was no funny aftertaste (unlike some protein powders containing artificial sweeteners).<br /><br />I am giving this product three stars because I like that it is of organic and fair trade origin.<br /><br />I would have rated it higher, but I find that if I mix this with milk, the resulting shake feels gritty and has a weird and almost unpalatable taste.  If you mix too much powder with not enough milk the shake needs to be consumed quickly!  If not, you will have a jello-like substance that is best eaten with a spoon or mixed with more milk.<br /><br />The two containers I received were probably not well mixed.  I found that as I got closer to finishing the product the shakes I was making started to taste sweeter, so I wonder if the sugar was just not evenly distributed.  Given that this product is a powder, I don't think settling during shipment was a problem.<br /><br />At this point, I will probably not order this product again simply because I find it too hard to drink given the flavor and texture. Good to know it's organic; not so great tasting  3 2
My local store was running a special on these, so I decided to give them a try.  They were ok, but I don't think I'd be getting them again if faced with the choice between these and another brand.  A good flavor was quickly followed up by a bad after-taste.<br /><br />The barbecue on this was the sweet smoky type of barbecue.  And it was good, a very addicting flavor.  The problem was the aftertaste that started a few seconds after the barbecue flavor melted away.  To me it tasted of straight rice flour, which is a very acquired taste and one that I've never been able to acquire.  It didn't help that these chips had the texture of Styrofoam either.  Between that and the rice flour taste I just couldn't enjoy them fully.<br /><br />The ingredients, however, are very good in this chip.  They're made of potato, use sunflower and safflower oils and the seasoning even has everything I can pronounce.  Although I am always suspicious when the designation "spices" is used without spelling out what those spices are.  And there was some rice flour in the mix which explains the aftertaste, but it was the last ingredient in the listing, meaning there shouldn't have been too much.  But I could still taste it.<br /><br />.8 oz is 100 calories for these chips, and it's a fair serving of the chips.  Enough for a small snack.  The bag boasts that they are all natural, and they are gluten free.  And there's no preservatives.  Sodium is about 7% of the daily value, which isn't outrageously high either.  All in all, they aren't extremely great for a person on a diet, but they aren't the worst thing you can eat, especially if you want a bag of chips.<br /><br />Maybe with a different flavor if they eliminated the rice flour I could bring myself to eat these again.  But since for now it's still there, I'll be steering clear.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012 Pop Chips Barbeque Potato Chips  3 4
I would caution anyone ordering this to realize that the chocolate melts in warm temperatures.  Mine arrived in a chocolate coated bag.  I put it in the fridge to try to solidify it a bit, but it wasn't a big improvement.  Makes it hard to eat out of the bag.  I really didn't want a chocolate flavored cereal, so I was planning on enjoying this as an eat out of the bag snack, but the melted chocolate makes it messy.  The chunks are an okay size for that, but it would probably work better as a cereal since the chocolate melted.<br /><br />When I purchase granola, I usually look for ones with either almonds or pecans.  This has neither. The only solids listed in the ingredients are whole grain rolled oats and chocolate chunks (first 2 ingredients). The rest of the ingredients are predominately sweeteners.  A serving is 1/2 cup and that has 220 calories, 50 of which are from fat.  There are 4g of fiber, 13g of sugar, 20g of other carbohydrates, and 5g of protein.  Just because something is "natural" doesn't mean it is good for you. So-So  3 2
The ryvita was still within the "best enjoyed before" date of 12.2010 but is not crisp. I am having to put it in the oven to crisp it up. However it was purchased at a reduced price so for future purchases I shall be wary of "sale" items.<br />I do love ryvita though and love the order coming to my door so quickly. crispbread  3 4
I read in the descriptions of this product that it would help with fruit flys, but so far I have had no luck.  It may work great for other flying bugs, but if you have fruit flys I would recommend looking at other products.  It seems like it would work to contain bugs that are attracted to it but I can't say for sure. Not quite what I thought  3 2
I've been a fan of dried ginger with crystallized sugar for years, so I thought I would give this brand a try.  If you're a ginger lover you will probably like this product, however I like my ginger to be more dehydrated and sliced into smaller pieces.  In fairness it does say "chunk" on the description of the product, and true to that the ginger comes in bite sized chunks that are chewy and kind of gummy. Not totally what I expected, but still tasty  3 2
taste not bad. I added cinnamon and nutmeg for pancakes. They were flat and not fluffy. B J McClain  3 2
I am interested in these but was wondering if someone that has them could post some nutrition info on them? Mainly, fat, fiber, sugars, and then any vitamins? Thanks so much!! Can someone post some of the nutrition facts?  3 5

Given that Salt & Pepper is my favorite potato chip flavor (specifically Kettle Brand Krinkle Cut for those who might be interested) and I love cashews, I was looking forward to trying these. Alas, once again, Emerald has managed to just miss the mark.<br />I like only enough salt in my food to enhance the taste, and the fact of the matter is that cashews are flavorful enough that not a whole lot is necessary. These nuts--which are nice and crisp and unbroken, no problem there--could easily lose 75% of their added salt and they'd be great, especially given that the black pepper used is of pretty good quality and kinda kicks in after everything has been eaten...if you can refrain from gulping your beverage of choice to slake the salt-induced thirst, that is. There's also some onion powder added, which would be a good thing if it were only discernible. But it's not because of the salt.<br />The lion's share of the nutritional data peeled off when I opened the canister, so I'm not able to provide them (I think I can be forgiven for not rifling through the garbage). Cashews are relatively low in fat for nuts, but they're not a low-cal food by any stretch of the imagination, plus these are roasted in peanut oil as well. I personally think nuts, plain or flavored, are a great source of nutrition but only if I can actually taste them.<br />In my experience, the single ingredient most common to mass-produced foods is salt, which seems a shame to me, especially since its misuse is so unhealthful. It's a lot easier to add salt to a dish than remove it, so if you're interested in actually tasting your food (and I think even simple, inexpensive food should and can be wonderful), let the manufacturers know. This product could easily be delicious if whoever formulated it would put a bit more finesse into it. Less Really IS More  3 2

The choclate used is not very complex or flavorful, making the bars a bit bland.  I was so excited to find this product but it was a disappointment--definitely not chocolate for chocolate lovers. okay chocolate  3 2
Compared to the Numi Oolong loose leaf teas, this one is about half the price.  The loose tea is comprised of almost all leaves, with just a sprinkle of sprigs.  In the mouth, the tea is mild with slight roasted quality, quite harmonious but not very distinctive.  It is a pleasant but definitely lacking character, especially when you compared it to the Numi Iron Goddess or Bao Hai Oolong varietals.  Nice for the money, but I think I would rather pay twice as much for a better Oolong. Average quality but good value  3 4
A very very strong candied cherry flavor, almost like the Cherry flavored Sucrets.  You probably would not eat Cherry flavored Sucrets on their own for dessert, but these Luxardo cherries cook very nicely in desserts.  Still, the flavor was a little "flourescent" and unnatural in the baked goods.<br /><br />Probably better left for drinks.  The texture of the cherry is far superior to a normal store bought Maraschino cherry. Very firm. Like a Cherry flavored Sucrets  3 1
I love dark roast coffee, served with or without cream/sugar, and this Sumatran k-cup is most assuredly a dark roast, but I found the flavor and aroma of this product to register as slightly bitter/burnt.  It did not overwhelm my senses, and it was easily alleviated and made better with the use of creamer, but it still wasn't my favorite of the K-Cups that are available.  I thought it was "okay".<br /><br />My husband didn't enjoy the Starbucks version of Sumatra, stating that he felt it had a somewhat chemical-like aftertaste even with cream and sugar.  We used over half of the box, to make sure that our opinion wasn't perhaps based on a faulty serving or two, but ended up giving the remainder to our neighbors; unfortunately, this Sumatra just didn't work for us. It is definitely dark roast  3 2
Perhaps I ordered at the wrong time, but I found this product to be very average.  Certainly it wasn't anything like the other glowing review above.  The fruit was OK, but certainly didn't seem very fresh.  The apricots were tough and didn't have much flavor. The date rolls with coconut were pretty tasty, but were kind of sloppily made.<br />They talked about the lovely wooden box which was just cheaply made stuff.  I would have rather have had a simple paper box with a lid.  This had no lid of any kind.  Maybe I'll try again in season, whenever that is. Wrong time of year?  3 2
I am from the Philippines, a country where there is an abundance of coconuts. I miss drinking coconut water which is something that you can easily get in my country by buying fresh coconut. So, I decided to try this product hoping to get the same satisfying taste that one would get from fresh coconut water. It turned out to be a disappointment. I do not doubt that this is indeed pure coconut water but it does have a sort of artificial flavor and smell to it. It might be just due to the plastic bottle itself. It was a good deal but not likely to buy again  3 2
Consider buying this from Bell Plantations it's much cheaper, about $3.99 a jar.  Amazon is riping people off with this product, shame on them! Buy from the Source  3 1
Over the past year my wife has been pushing me (kicking & screaming) into a somewhat more healthy diet with the purpose of helping me lose weight and gain control of my cholesterol. Having me try a number of these fiber bar type things is one of the ways. For the most part I am not a big fan of them but am always on the lookout for one that will appeal to my fat/sugar-loving taste buds. Pamela's Whenever Bars is the latest of a long list of hopefuls.<br /><br />On the plus side; wheat-free, glutton-free, and non-dairy. They include Omega 3 fatty acids and no Trans fats. It's also low in sugar, low in sodium, and low in saturated fats. This is probably a good and quick snack for those with special dietary needs.<br /><br />On the negative site; the taste will be an acquired one, at least for me. It's not a bad taste by any stretch of the imagination but in my opinion it's not one I look forward to either. Maybe it's the lack of sweetness to the bar, or at least not enough sweetness that makes it more of a necessary snack instead of an attractive one. We'll see if it eventually grows on me.<br /><br />Overall, a decent and healthy snack that is not terrible tasting. Could be better but based on other bars I've tried, could be a lot worse. Good on the "healthy" side but probably an acquired taste  3 4
I bought these because I am on a low carb diet. They are way way too salty...salt is bad for you to begin with but they really overdid it here...also there are a few ingredients that I can't pronounce...I thought they were more natural...Overall I would not buy again.... way too salty  3 2
My twins love this!! BUT Walmart sells them for $1/ for a 2pack!  Worth going there to save the extra $! Great dinner but horrible price!  3 2
I am an avid eater of Thai Food, so I was curious to see how this Pad Thai in a box would taste. Considering the price, I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />Ease of cooking: 3 stars. It's a tough trick to gauge when the noodles have been soaked long enough to get the perfect firmness. Also, you have to use and wash multiple pots to make this. One pot to boil the water for the noodles. And a frying pan to stir fry the noodles in.<br /><br />Taste: It's in a box. How much can you expect? Albeit, taste might have been better if I added some fresh bean sprouts, basil leaves, and shrimp or chicken.<br /><br />Price: Not bad considering it's a third of what  you would pay for compared to take out.<br /><br />All in all, I give it 3 stars. This is like the cup o noodle of Pad Thai. Decent enough to consume if you really run out of food, but not something you'll be craving during lunch hour. Average taste. Don't expect Authenticity in a box  3 4
I really like to mix things up with k-cups and rarely buy 50-ct boxes of a single flavor.  Exception to the rule would be for dark, bold coffees such as French roasts, which I really enjoy.  So when Wolfgang Puck's French roast turned up on Amazon's deal of the week, even though I have never tried before, now I have 48 units.<br /><br />It's fairly non-descript for a French roast.  Decent aroma, but taste is muted compared to, for example, a Diedrich French roast.  I don't hate or even dislike it, it's 'okay', and for the price I paid, is acceptable without complaint.  It may make an acceptable guest coffee for those wanting something a little bolder without being over the top rich.<br /><br />I'd call it mildly bold, average, and I won't be going out of my way to keep it on hand. Average quality French roast  3 4
I like all halo products but this canned cat food is just a little too soupy.  My cats look at me with "What's this?" .<br />They like a little something to chew on. soupy  3 2
This carbonated juice drink tastes pretty artificial, although they claim that it's made mostly of juice. This is really more like a Black Cherry soda. It's got a pleasant taste just nothing that will blow you away. It's a bit expensive for such a small can and not a fresh enough idea to really get anyone to Switch from their current drinking habits. Pretty standard fruity drink  3 2
but I will never order a 16 pound bag of dog food with those shipping costs tagged on again.  I somehow thought I was going to save something.  Aside from having to wait 10 days for something I could have gone to PetSmart down the street for...oh, well you live and learn. My dog likes it...  3 5
The cookies taste great; however, they have no nutritional information anywhere on the package. In fact, the cookies are only wrapped in thin, clear plastic sleeves. There was no individual packaging at all, just 24 thin plastic sleeves inside of one plain cardboard box with no additional packaging or labeling. I didn't know it was legal to send manufactured food products without nutritional information. Love the cookies, but....  3 2
Truvia seems to be a version of sugar-free that is healthier than most.  However--it is WAY cheaper ($3.34 for the 40ct. bx) at Wal-Mart...  time for Amazon to catch up--they are usually my go-to for cheaper healthy foods but not today. Time to Lower Your Price Amazon!  3 4
First time I tried it.  I don't like the puffed corn as well as the puffed wheat and rice.  It's similar to  Sugar Puffs without all the added sugar and is a whole grain. You probably want to try just one bag and see how well your family likes it before buying such a  large quantity. Arrowhead Mills puffed corn  3 5
I like raisins.  I eat them by the handful or in cereal or cookies.  Even with ham sometimes.  But, it seems, a raisin is a raisin is a raisin - no matter who packages them.  After all - a raisin is a dried grape.  These are good raisins but they taste no better than grocery store raisins.  Actually, I was a little disappointed.  I'd read many of the reviews here and expected something wonderful like little bursts of sunshine with each bite.  What I got was a good raisin.  Right now I am eating some while I re-read some of the glowing reviews and listen to Peggy Lee singing, "Is That All There Is?"<br /><br />The price is not great but it's not bad either.  It's Paul Newman so that's a good thing.  They're "organic" but I'm still not sure why that's important.<br /><br />Average Average raisins  3 4
Like so many Americans I grew up eating quite a few varieties of Kellogg's cereals. The new "Crunchy Nut" cereal looked like it might be good so I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />To make a long story short, it's tasty but it isn't anything like what I expected ... and isn't like what is pictured on the box.<br /><br />First, Kellogg's probably needs to get rid of the individual who came up with the idea of calling this cereal "Crunchy Nut." Besides the fact that it's unimaginative and blandly descriptive, if you tell your friends you just ate a bowl of "Crunchy Nut" you're going to get some pretty disgusted looks in return.<br /><br />Beyond the unfortunate name, as soon as you pour a bowl of Crunchy Nut you'll notice that none of the pieces look as "nutty" the the pieces shown on the box ... not even close. The box shows pieces of the cereal covered in small chips/chunks of nuts but the actual cereal just looks like fat Cheerios with the occasional "speck" of what might be best described as "nut powder."<br /><br />Once you actually taste this cereal you'll notice that it tastes almost exactly like Corn Pops (another Kellogg's brand cereal). My wife also tried a bowl of this cereal and the first thing she said (without any coaching from me) was, "It tastes like Corn Pops." This isn't a horrible thing as long as you like the flavor of Corn Pops cereal, but if you purchase this cereal expecting a burst of "crunchy nut" flavor then you will be disappointed.<br /><br />Bottom line, this is a very tasty cereal (just like Corn Pops) but it has a horrible name, it doesn't look like the picture on the box, and it doesn't taste anything like the name suggests. Tastes like "Corn Pops" and isn't very "nutty."  3 2
I found that when working on dried gumpaste, these didn't allow for the finest lines. Also the flow of colorings wasn't super consistent.  Also the felt tip didn't maintain its shape well, making it hard to do fine lines.  It was a helpful tool since I'm not the best with painting free hand. Felt tip is weak  3 2
It's not entirely obvious from the photos here on Amazon but these 7 ounce packages aren't like normal pasta, they're basically "precooked" noodles that are in bags filled with water so the actual quantity of noodles is maybe a small scoop per pricey bag. The noodles themselves have a texture that's (naturally) better suited to asian style noodle dishes (i.e. a ramen bowl) and upon initially opening the package there is definitely a vaguely fish-like scent-it's not a horrible pungent scent but more reminiscent of noodles just cooked in fish soup (really hard to describe to be honest). Thankfully this does go away nicely after rinsing and blanching per the instructions, and even when eaten with just red pasta sauce there weren't any weird flavors but the textures just didn't really feel at home here.<br />Honestly these noodles would feel most at home in making a low carb ramen noodle bowl or something similar, but the real reason I'm not going to buy these again is simply that the price is insane for the quantity you get. Expensive diet!  3 2
I do not have a green thumb.  Thankfully I'm great at feeding things, animals, children etc.  This plant arrived with minimal bud damage.  However once "fed",  she sprung back to life.  If you're squeemish around insects and worms, this is not for you.  If you enjoy nature at its best but live in suburbia, this offers a mini escape into the jungle :) Red Thumb needed  3 5
If you've never had Monin's full-on sugar rush syrup, you won't be disappointed in this. The sweetener does have a noticeable aftertaste. Not enough to ruin the experience, but if you're a purist, stick with the sugary drink version. Tasting very sugar free  3 2
I ordered Halter Sugar free candies for about fifteen bucks. Coffee flavor is my favorite hard candy, and sugar free was a must. This is the biggest Rip Off I have spent on amazon! The candies are great, but you get these eight little tiny boxes, the size of something you would give away as Halloween treats. Really liked the taste, Extremely disappointed on the cost for the amount. I will give it three stars, but only recommend if you are not concerned on price. Good Taste, Horrible Cost  3 2
I've always loved this tea, even though it is rather expensive.  I purchased it from Amazon because I've never been let down before.  Mistake.  The tea came in the same box shown in the advertisement, clearly stating "25 muslin tea bags".  My box had a STICKER over it, which said "20 muslin tea bags".  I figure if I'm already spending that kind of money on tea, I shouldn't get stuck with a 20% decrease in the product. Love the tea, hate the false advertising...  3 2
So some people didn't like that weird feeling the chocolate left in your mouth that people mentioned as a "waxy" feeling, but I personally enjoyed the taste of this a lot, and I bought this quite a bit until I realized there's trans-fat in the cereal.<br /><br />In the ingredients, the cereal contains "PARTIALLY HYDROGENATED PALM KERNEL OIL", which for those who may not know, but anything "hydrogenated" contains a very small amount of trans-fat.<br /><br />It may only be less than .5 grams and so in the nutrition panel, they can show that there's 0 trans fat in the cereal, but if you had 3-4 servings of chocolatey delight, you could very well be eating 1-2 grams of trans-fat. Just be forewarned.<br /><br />Anyways, give the cereal a try if you haven't, and don't just think you'll hate the taste of it just because others didn't like the taste of it because I enjoyed the flavor of the cereal very much. Contains trans-fat but tastes good  3 2
I bought this product because we originally thought our new puppy had a condition called megaesophagus which requires them to eat and stay in a vertical position for 30-45 minutes after eating and other people had recommended this product to keep the dog occupied during that time.<br />We later found that our dog doesn't have this condition (thank goodness) so I was going to return it but I decided to try it out when my puppy got a tick on her head, thinking it would keep her focused while I got the tick off (which it very much did)<br /><br />The only one I have used is the chicken flavor and when I took off the lid, I gagged and threw up in my mouth. It stinks that bad. But my puppy did seem to like the taste of it. These things stink!!  3 1
I've had truffle honey before and thought to try this one out. It's a nice acacia honey but not much of the truffle essence comes through. I suggest the Casina Rossa brand that comes in a 3-pack sampler as a better alternative. White Truffle Honey- there are better  3 2
This particular coffee is a bit strong for my taste. It was worth a try and you certainly get good amount of coffee for the money. Price is right  3 4
Eye Bought This Product On A Recommendation. However, Eye Cannot Seem To Get Past The Strange Taste Yet.  Eye Will Keep Using It To See If This Will Pass Or If Eye Will Acquire A Liking To It.  The Package States No Bitter Taste.  If It Is A Sweetener, Why Should There Be Any Bitter Taste? Disagreeable Taste  3 2

I've tried both the Italian and Colombian Via varities, and while there's definitely a 'Starbuckiness' to both, neither is a substitute for the real thing. However there are times when the real thing just doesn't work, and at those times Via gets just enough things right to make it worthwhile.<br /><br />I'll start out with the negatives. Both varieties remind of drinking from a pot of 'yesterdays' coffee. The kind where you can't finish the pot of coffee and rather than toss it all out, you let it sit and cool overnight and then reheat it the next morning. The next day the coffee is always more bitter and the flavor is flat as compared to a fresh brewed cup. Adding milk or cream helps, but the underlying flavor is still a bit off-putting.<br /><br />Though the worst part about the Via brand is the after-taste. There's something off about it. I don't know quite how to describe it. Almost like a tinge of paper/cardboard taste to it which is a bummer. I find I drink a cup of Via faster than a normal cup of coffee in order to combat that after-taste.<br /><br />Having said all that, I think I'm still likely to continue buying the Via brand. I understand this is instant coffee. I mean I'm tearing open a little pouch (love the design), dropping in some hot water, and I've got coffee. Just like that. That's pretty great. That ease of use, and fairly reasonable pricing means that in circumstances in which convenience trumps quality I can find a place for Via. Camping, too lazy to drive to a coffee shop, otherwise stuck drinking Folgers, quick pick-me-up during a zombie invasion, etc... are a few examples of when a packet of Via could come in handy. When grading on a curve, Via holds up.  3 4
As Chef Tom says, 'Don't be afraid of curry!'.  There's a light but distinct curry scent to this mix that works beautifully on shrimp, scallops, and white fish (catfish, orange roughy, red snapper).<br /><br />For those of you who who don't like the 'burn' curries can impart, no worries - the bark is definitely stronger than the bite in this case. It fades to practically non-existence on more distinctly flavorful 'red' fish such as salmon and tuna.  It's too weak for pork, let alone beef. (To be fair though, it wasn't really designed for these types of meat).<br /><br />This spice isn't quite as good as the two knockouts in Chef Tom's collection: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5TTHI">Chef Tom Douglas Rub With Love Salmon Rub</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5TTL4">Chef Tom Douglas Rub With Love Chicken Rub</a>  - but it is yummy.  I suggest drizzling this into your potato or pasta salad instead of paprika to give things an exotic punch! Not bad, in the second tier of Chef Tom's Rubs  3 4
This juice is my favorite (so delicious) but the juice boxes are smaller than I remember. My little kindergarten sister who is very petite needed at least 2 of these boxes in her lunch. I use these boxes to swallow pills and one pill takes 1 juice box b/c these are gone in 3-4 sips. so small!  3 4
I have tried spiced chai tea, but it did not have enough spices. I also tried a mix where you just add water, but they were too sweet. I prefer a stronger spice flavor and I like to be able to control the amount of milk and sugar. So, I usually make my own chai spiced tea from scratch. I get just the right amount of ingredients, but it is a lot of trouble and takes time.<br /><br />Then I tried the Stash Double Spiced Chai Tea. With more spice than most other teas I found the flavor and intensity to be fairly close to my home-made chai. This chai tea is able to maintain the flavor of the black tea with a nice blend of spices that give it a little extra kick with the double-spice. Of course, with more spices comes more bitterness. The way to lessen the bitterness is to slightly increase the milk and sugar. A better way to help cut the bitterness is to use honey instead of sugar.<br /><br />I will still make my own home-made version when I have the time to make it. But, I will also use this Stash Double Spice Chai Tea as an alternative until I find something better. Over all, fairly good  3 4
This cat food looks and smells a lot like the Fancy Feast premium brand, Garden Medley, that comes in the green cans. (Amazing that Fancy Feast, already an expensive, premium brand, would have an even more upscale variety that's even more expensive.) It almost looks like people food. I have eight cats and two ate it immediately and the other six walked away. In the morning, I would find the bowls empty (this is not always the case with other foods, even when they're hungry, they'll ignore some things). I don't know if others changed their minds, or the two who pretty much eat anything came back and cleaned it up. I can't compare prices with this brand because I have never seen it in any store (I live on the East Coast in Virginia, it must be a West Coast brand.)<br /><br />I was put off by the big Made in Thailand lettering on the box because I lived there for two years and it's not a clean country. I was a little worried about what actually was in this food.<br /><br />Since I don't buy Garden Medley because I can't afford it, and I suspect this is in the same price range, I can't honestly say I would buy it. But if your cat loves Garden Medley, and this is a better buy, then it's a good deal. Reminds Me of Garden Medley  3 5
We found this at BJ's before I started shopping on Amazon.  My wife and I were disappointed with it after having tried the Twinings in the sample pack that came with our brewer.  The Twinings is much smoother and balanced than the Bigelow.<br /><br />When I wrote this, Amazon was out of the Twinings and only one vendor was selling it at nearly double the normal price.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5WZ4">Twinings Earl Grey Tea K-Cups for Keurig Brewers, 25-Count Box (Pack of 2)</a> It'll do in a pinch  3 2
Seriously, there's a 'do not shake' warning on the can and it's there for good reason - the contents are under pressure so... you shake it at your own risk.<br /><br />As a coffee drinker, I can't say that I'm impressed by this canned Espresso to the point that I'd stop making my own but I suppose that's not the point of the 'illy'. No canned coffee can challenge the flavor and aroma of a freshly brewed cup but when that is not possible, here comes the 'illy' and... it's passable.<br /><br />If comparing canned coffees to canned coffees, the 'illy' espresso is okay as in 'decent' and probably preferable to most other canned brands but to call it 'espresso' is a bit of a stretch. It's got 'sugar' for starters, 50 calories worth of it and I don't know too many espresso drinkers that would tolerate sugar in their espresso drink. And it's not espresso-strong. It's a little stronger than the normally bland canned coffee but maybe only half-way between regular coffee and espresso. As for the taste, this is supposed to be made of 'Arabica' and maybe it is but it tastes more like instant coffee to me. Maybe Arabica-based, cold instant coffee.<br /><br />So... if stranded on an island or anywhere a decent cup of real coffee is not an option or you aren't in the mood or don't have the time to make your own, the 'illy espresso' is an option and at least as good, possibly better than alternative canned or bottled coffees. In other words, "It's Okay" (3 stars) if used as directed and your expectations are reasonably low.<br /><br />________________________________<br /><br />Note: Should this be chilled before use? Ice espresso is an abomination but, again, just because it says 'espresso' on the can it doesn't necessarily make it so. Stirred, not shaken  3 4
i got a bag of these and the veggie sticks. haven't tried the veggie ones yet. the sweet potato didnt taste like sweet potato to me. just tasted like rice flour and cinnamon and brown sugar. tastes like that cereal cinnamon toast crunch. i put the the so called skinny sticks in a bowl and added milk. taste better! They should say just add milk....  3 1
Puroast Low Acid Coffee Low Acid Coffee French Roast, sounds delightful for those of us who need to reduce acid in our diets.  I made a pot this morning, very excited to try this new product but found it is a little on the bitter side, and has a slightly over-roasted flavor.  I had to add extra cream to cut the bitterness, and don't think I could ever drink this black.  For those coffee drinkers who like a very dark roast, this may be just the coffee for you, but for myself, I believe I will pass on this one.  Puroast Low Acid Coffee is a really great concept, just not for this coffee drinker. Disappointing  3 2
Not sour as some of the other reviewers have stated. I for one could not really taste any sour bits, but it's a fine gummi candy on it's own. Sugar coated, etc. Just wish it was sour, or at least Hairbo made a 'proper' sour gummi candy. Not sour  3 2
The plastic packaging is not airtight, so you might want to stick with the cans to preserve freshness. Not quite fresh, but okay cashews  3 2
it was okay. Alot smaller bottles than I thought, however my guests loved them. The wood crate they came in was a little dangerous, because the wood seemed to have come apart and the nails were sticking out. Other than that, Id probably purchase again with diffrent packaging.

I've been eating Annie's Mac n' Cheese (not the whole wheat type) since 1994.  Amazon offers a excellent price (around $1.50 per box for certified organic, whoa!) and if I'm going to commit upfront to 12 boxes of mac and cheese, I figured I try to be a little healthier and get the whole wheat type.<br /><br />It is a quality product but it isn't suited to my taste buds.  I am surprised because I prefer brown rice and wild rice to white rice and generally enjoy whole wheat products.  But to this eater, the whole wheat shells were too heavy and chewy.  The watery white cheddar sauce enhanced the pasta's rougher texture and blandness.  (The white cheddar sauce is like an alfredo, and less creamy than Annie's regular cheddar.)  My friends love this stuff, but I think it's an acquired tasted.  If I had known what I know now, I'd have stuck with the enriched white (yet stripped of it's nutrients) shells or at least gone with the regular cheddar sauce.<br /><br />*Update*<br />While still not a full-on fan, I enjoying this product more now that:<br /><br />1.  Tastes much better when cooked 10-11 minutes at sea-level (the box recommends 8-10), the texture is less rough and gummy and is more noodle-y.<br /><br />2.  Adding fresh herbs with the cheese sauce.  It gives a depth to the flavor.  My favorite herb to add (so far) is cilantro (add about 1/3 cup chopped after mixing in the cheese sauce).  Other enjoyable variations were adding 2/3 cup of Italian parsley or 1/8 cup fresh dill leaves. Quality Product, Not Suited For My Taste Buds  3 2
I tried Coombs syrup just after Highland Farms and before Chafee Farm's. Coombs had a mildly unpleasant burnt caramel taste that I didn't care for in comparison, though it was fine used in recipes. Highland Farms has better flavor than Coombs  3 2

I should have picked up on the MSG before I ordered the jerky. That's my fault.<br /><br />The jerky tastes OK. It lacks in freshness and tastes salty in a less than favorable way. Also, in true MSG fashion, the jerky leaves you craving more even when your last bite was not particularly amazing.<br /><br />I'm torn between two stars and three stars. I think I'll stay at three. Not as good as I had hoped  3 2
This product costs $2.99/bag at my regular market.  I don't understand why it would cost so much more here, especially when buying 4 bags at a time. good product...bad price  3 2

I decided to try these when Clif peanut butter bars and Zbars were unavailable. The chocolate coating on the thinkThin bar makes it seem too much like a candy bar -- and it's messy if the temperature goes up at all. The flavor's o.k., but the texture of the inside stuff is mushy.  I'll be glad to have Clif back in a few months. OK, but no replacement for Clif  3 2
I like my coffee strong/bold, but the jet fuel seemed too acidic--definitely upset my stomach. I had bought the coffee people organic last time, and I will go back to that as soon as these k cups run out. The jet fuel is just not well blended, IMO. Bold but too acidic  3 2
I meant to pick up the normal Chewy Chips Ahoy and was flabbergasted when I returned home to find that they shoved the word "oatmeal" in the corner of the package but kept everything else the same. I decided to try them anyway and the oats definitely interrupt the normally wonderful chemistry between the chocolate and dough.<br />[...] Misleading Packaging!  3 2
I was hoping these would be a bit more exciting than they were. My son eats everything, but was fairly disinterested in these. I don't really blame him, I tried them myself and was underwhelmed with the flavor. Couldn't detect mango at all in the mango risotto! Organic ingredients are a huge plus though, so I'm glad they exist. Good quality, organic, but not much flavor  3 2

That means I am still at the stage of buying two cans of something new to see how he reacts, before I invest in a case.  He wants to like this one, but seems to be turned off by the wheat gluten, and possibly the modified corn starch, within.

I was expecting some "serious flavor" as it was advertised on the bag.. but compared to other jalapeno chips I've had, it's pretty bland. The ingredients list is short, which is a plus, and it's fairly low in sodium (160mg per 1oz serving) which is probably why I prefer this less, as I like saltier chips. Overall I'd say this is a good choice if you like a healthier version of a jalapeno chip.. but if you like strong flavor like I do, stick with Kettle brand jalapeno chips. Pretty good, but prefer other jalapeno chips  3 4
I ordered these as a gift for my parents-  the almonds are very nice, large, nice flavor but they are very very very salty! I wish I had ordered them plain (I like salty food so for me to  find these overly salted is really saying something.) Also, they came taped together with clear packing tape so to separate them I had to tear the label off and the plastic lid did not fit very well.  If you are gifting these and big on appearance I would reconsider. Beware- SALT!  3 2
The Uncle Ray's BBQ Potato Chips are comparable to Lays or most commonly available chips in local markets.  The BBQ spice ia a bit too much; the one pound bags consisted of about half broken chips.  I won't think about buying these again, even with the discounted price and will pay a bit more for a much better kettle fried potato chip. Good chips--nothing special  3 4
I bought these at walmart for less then $2.00 dollars a box.There over  $2.80 a box @Amazon for (box of six).Then you need to add another $7.00 dollars to your order to get free shipping ....I would not buy these again could be better if you added chicken or an egg like other reviewers mentioned. My box does say gluten free so maybe there are 2 versions. OKAY IN A PINCH...  3 2

What I expected: Something that tasted like green tea with perhaps a hit of honey, strawberry, and acai flavor, finished with the typical sugar-free aftertaste.<br /><br />What I got: A pleasant tasting strawberry soft drink with very little sugar-free aftertaste.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, the taste of this drink is quite nice. The strawberry flavor is quite fresh-tasting and at room temperature is very fragrant. It's just not at all what I'd expect for a product from Lipton calling itself "Green Tea Mix". The powder dissolves very quickly, even when stirred with a spoon in an open glass (vs shaken in a bottle).<br /><br />So why only three stars? Like I said, I expected green tea. I got strawberry drink. If you're looking for strawberry, this is very good. If you're looking for tea, move along. This is tea? Really?  3 4
I love me the regular Mi-Del Ginger Snaps... but out of a fluke I picked me up a gluten free bag once and thought it tasted not so yummy.  like ginger flavored sweetend hard dirt.  so unless you have to have the gluten free for some reason go get you the normal ginger snaps which as of Sep 2006, Amazon offers well  3 2
I did not find the smell to be anything but inviting.  Warm pork rinds is a concept that was new to me.  I found the taste to be very good.  I had no problems with the cook time and the bag did not collapse on the product.  My only complaint is that there was just too much salt. Very Good Taste but TOO MUCH SALT  3 4
As the description says: this is for single-serve "pod" type brewers, and it will be quite the pain to use if you're using a Keurig or a Mr. Coffee. Keep that in mind...<br /><br />Now, to the coffee: it was good in a 6-8oz brew, with the flavors being pretty much as described. However, at 15 pods to a pack, this a week's worth of coffee if you drink a 15 oz mug every morning, as I do. So, while it is a good coffee when made properly, the value just is not there for me with this product.<br /><br />If you're okay with that, because you see value added by the social marketing related to this product, then go for it.<br /><br />If you're just after good coffee, you can probably get just as good a cup with a different brand for a little less. Decent coffee  3 4
I wish Amazon had a policy of also posting the Nutrition Facts label of food products.  This product has 30g of sugar in a 2 oz serving and 140 Calories.  The ingredients List is Quince & Citron Rice Black Vinegar, Fructose, Water, Oligosaccharide, Conc. Apple Juice, Polydextrose, Maltodextrin, Mixed Apple Juice.  If you're fine with that then it does add a certain zing to recipes but I was looking for something simpler. 30g of Sugar & 140 Calories per 2 oz!  3 2
This is very similar in flavor to Kusmi St. Petersburg, although St. Petersburg is far superior in complexity of flavor. Ultimately, I find Paris to be a little boring.<br /><br />I've noticed that the caffeine in Paris makes me feel jittery for some reason. I drink black tea every morning and don't have this problem with other brands. Not sure why Paris seems intensely caffeinated in comparison.<br /><br />For those who'd like to try this tea without breaking the bank, I've found Paris and other selections at The Fresh Market for just $5.99. My local grocery store carries a few flavors as well, all for around $6. H&S Dragon Pearl Jasmine is my favorite from this line.<br /><br />If you're willing to shell out $15-20 for a tea, try Kusmi instead. Didn't knock my socks off.  3 4
very cute idea however they dont allow u to pick a flavor u get whatever one they want to send u they gave me lemon my least favorite flavor and the hole in it is tiny plus the lollipop gets digusting after awhile definately something that u shouldnt really eat would not order this again. it was ok  3 2
Vermont Country Blend is my favorite K-Cup. However, There were 2 different selections. Box of 24 for $24.25 and Box of 24 (Pack of 2) for $25.38.<br />I didn't see the (Pack of 2) for $1.13 more. Bummer! Vermont Country Blend  3 2
I bought these because they are a quick and easy way to get my coffee fix.<br />The price on Amazon was 50% cheaper than what I saw at StarBucks stores.<br /><br />They are not as good as fresh brewed coffee, but the result is still impressive.<br />This is not the rancid instant coffee that has been around for decades.<br /><br />I gave this three stars because the flavor is adequate only.<br /><br />These will not replace brewed coffee, but will definitely be useful when I'm short on time or options! Quick and tasty alternative  3 4
I just got these beans and have pulled a couple dozen shots, trying out different permutations of amount, grind, tamp.<br /><br />I'm disappointed as I expected a better flavor from the beans.<br /><br />The beans have a strong midrange coffee flavor and a strong sharp lemon note. The midrange coffee flavor is uncomplicated but good. A little chocolaty perhaps The lemon note is unpleasant for my taste which makes the beans go from a four star to a three star.<br /><br />When you pull a good espresso shot it tastes smooth for about 10 seconds, then the lemony taste creeps in and makes it unpleasant.<br /><br />The lemony taste is good in milk drinks however, it provides some character and interesting flavor. The strong coffee flavor also stands up to the milk and gives it a good flavor. I like lattes with these beans.<br /><br />The overall verdict is meh. If you only want milk drinks then these beans might suit you. If you like shots, I'd advise you to look elsewhere. Mediocre shots, good milk drinks  3 4
I have never tried an illy product before but I love coffee and was excited to try this product. I like the taste of this espresso flavored drink for the most part but it has a slightly artificial taste to it. Each 6.8 fluid ounce can has 50 calories. They display it on the can in a way that leads you to believe that should be good but straight espresso doesn't have any calories so 50 calories worth of sweetener seems like a lot to me. The size of the can is quite small as well. For the cost of this product I would think that they could be a little more generous with the size of the drink. It's nice and convenient while on the go and I like the energy boost from the caffeine. Tastes pretty good but has a slight artificial taste, high cost for a very small 6.8 oz can  3 4
The main reason the Newton Fruit Thins earned 3/5 instead of 4/5 is because I'm the only one who liked them out of all the people I tested them on.<br /><br />Let me back up. These Fruit Thins are flat, crispy cookies with a touch of fruit flavor (Being from the Fig Newton family, I expected a bit of moisture, but you'll never get confused that you're getting one of your daily fruit servings from these cookies).  Since Amazon sent me an entire package, I shared it with my 8th grade students and some adults. The students across the board tolerated the cookie, but wouldn't select it given a choice. The adults were mixed in their reviews. Some gave it a thumbs down, citing a cardboard bland taste, and others loved it as a low-calorie snack (about 50 calories per cookie.<br /><br />Me, I think they live up to their name--a crispy thin with a hint of fruit. If you like graham crackers, you may like these, although they aren't as flavorful. I certainly don't find the 'luscious flavor of figs, sweet raisins and honey' advertised on the package. A couple of setbacks: The fruit is so sparse--ninth on the ingredient list and behind 'folic acid' and 'palm oil'--I don't know how they can call it 'real fruit'. It is 0 carbohydrates, which is good, but it's also 0% of vitamin C, A and Calcium. You won't eat these for their nutrients.<br /><br />One complaint: the packaging is inferior. When I opened the bag and tried to use the retie at the top, it fell off, so I had to transfer the crisps to a plastic bag.<br /><br />Overall, a good choice for a snack that doesn't overfill you. I like them, but I'm in the minority  3 4
Ya- its okay.  The price point is great so ya get what ya pay for - average.  My fresh(er) french chicory goes for about $12 a pound.  I mix it with my ground coffee.  I prefer my coffee perked so this fine ground tends to go through the basket a bit - not a big bother. Fine ground chickory  3 4
I love juice and I love carbonated beverages, but it is difficult to see this product having a long retail life.<br /><br />Essentially, this is a good drink that doesn't really do anything well.<br /><br />It doesn't taste good enough to be a juice replacement--and is there really a need for a juice replacement?  It might have limited value in camping situations or during other times where small cans make better travelers.<br /><br />It's not exactly a post-workout recovery drink.  Juice would be better.  Minute Maid juice, for instance, has less sugar and carbohydrates, even though Switch doesn't add any sugar.  And there are plenty of other juices that have more nutrients, including Calcium and other vitamins and supplements, including potassium.  So, it's less healthy than most juices.<br /><br />Switch isn't exactly a diet soda because of the natural sugar content comapared to zero sugar in diet drinks.<br /><br />As a regular alternative to sugared soda, it tastes good, but there is nothing really to distinguish it from other fruit-based sodas.  And, $22 a case, it's more than twice as expensive of sodas that come in bigger cans.<br /><br />So, in the end, Switch is worth a try but likely not something you will habitually buy. A drink without a category  3 4
The price is great but I just didn't like the taste of this coffee. I'm pretty picky about coffee and love to drink strong. This one produce very acidic coffee when made strong, but if you make it thin, then it tastes okay with just slight acidic after taste. How you'd like this coffee is really depending on your personal taste of coffee, but if you are like me, drink coffee strong, or dislike acidic after taste that lasts while, then this is not for you. Slightly acidic, not for me...  3 2
I found these to be flavor-free.  They tasted like white flour, the snickerdoodle ones I bought had hardly any cinnamon.  True disappointment, my kids will not eat them and I bought a whole box. Tastes like sweet, baked flour and water.<br /><br />However the chocolate chip ones are good. Bland, Snickerdoodle, Tastes like flour  3 2
This is a tasty product that I really like. Unfortunately the standard put-up is 12 cans in a half-carton -- a cardboard box bottom and a flexible plastic film top, which apparently is a cost-cutting measure. The cans bang into each other during shipping, because the plastic film top is the equivalent of putting them in a bag.<br /><br />The cans arrive severely dented, which could compromise the seal, and allow baterial contamination. Although I pointed out this problem sometime ago, my most recent shipment arrived damaged again. Great product, dopey package  3 4
My small dogs were not thrilled with these they did eat them though. They may have beeen to har for them as they  are small dogs healthpro dentalnuggets  3 2
tasted great.  Anyone's idea of a guilty pleasure.  However, ingredient statement a shocker.  Very little in the mix was healthy.  It was not something I would want to indulge in on a regular basis.  Once in a while OK. Beware  3 2
Have plenty of water handy.  The over-the-top taste of sea salt and cracked pepper nearly overcame all the cashew flavor.  The Emerald almonds were much more enjoyable because they were more subtlely flavored. heavy seasonings get your attention  3 2
I did enjoy the snacks. Since I am diabetic there are few such snacks I can get away with and this one did not affect my blood sugar adversely. However the cost is more than I can justify. I will be canceling my next shipment. Really delicious, but not worth the price.  3 2
So for a "healthier" snack it sure is salty. But then the salt is a way for them to make the chips taste better without additional calories. Each bag is 100 calories with 10% sodium intake for the day.<br /><br />The chips are not bad, i just wouldn't get them again because most of the flavoring comes from the salt. Tasty but Salty  3 4
Energy Drinks are very popular these days.  Most, if not all, are loaded with sugar, various overloads of vitamins, and varying "energy blends."  A few energy drinks have tried adding pure juice, but have only come up with 50% at most.<br /><br />If your not a young'un and can't handle that blast of sugar and crash that follows, then Switch is a better alternative.  Switch is 100% juice, ZERO sugar, and lots of vitamin C.<br /><br />Switch is carbonated, so with the Orange Tangerine flavor, picture your morning juice with a little soda fizzle.  The taste is sweet, but not sugary.  Although the size of the can probably relates to the recommended serving, most people probably don't have this little juice in one sitting.<br /><br />Soda fizzle meets juice benefits.  It's a no brainer.  How about some more flavors? Sweet and Carbonated Like Energy Drinks but Without the Sugar  3 4
My first impression on this particular drink when I first tasted it was that it reminded me a bit of the "Shasta Black Cherry" soda that I drank occasionally as a kid, although nowhere near as carbonated. Unlike the "Shasta Black Cherry," this drink did not have the lingering carbonated fizz that your typical sodas have, and a very pleasant surprise was the fact that I didn't get any disgusting soda burps after drinking it. You know the kind I mean, when you burp and you could swear that you just swallowed a week old dead skunk tail first. I also didn't get any real aftertaste when drinking it either.<br /><br />Now coming in at 8.3 ounces, the calories in this drink are reported at 130 calories per can. By comparison, a 12 ounce can of Pepsi comes in at 150 calories per can. So, on the calorie front I wouldn't say that there is much of a difference between this drink and Pepsi, although if you do the math, this drink would actually have more calories than Pepsi if you compared them in equal amounts. However, if you look at the list of ingredients in both, you can see where this product is far better for you than your traditional sodas, although obviously not as good for you as drinking an actual 100% pure fruit or vegetable juice.<br /><br />To put in plainly and succinctly, this is a fairly good tasting beverage and is definitely one I would consider drinking over the more traditional sodas that are currently available. However, the one primary detractor to this is the size of the can compared to the price.<br /><br />The one thing that I had not quite decided on whether it is a negative or a positive is the size of the can, which as I stated earlier comes in at 8.3 ounces compared to your traditional cans of soda that come in at 12 ounces. In addition to the size of the can, there is also the consideration of price, coming in at roughly $1.00 per can which is considerably more expensive than your average can of soda. Therefore, when you take the size of the product combined with the price, I would have to say that it is a definite negative and would probably keep me from purchasing this product.<br /><br />If they created 12 ounce cans and lowered the price, then I would be more apt to purchase this product.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Author of the Achieving Kicking Excellence series. Not A Bad Alternative To Soda, But Not A Great One Either  3 4
Last year I tasted several of the Izze fruit drinks for the first time and became addicted.  I have an affinity for fruity foods and beverages, and that fact combined with my positive experiences with Izze prompted me to try THE SWITCH.<br /><br />I'll say it right off the bat - THE SWITCH was okay, but it doesn't really compare in taste to Izze.  If I had never tasted Izze, I might enjoy THE SWITCH more.  As it is, I thought it was tasty enough, but I wouldn't drive out of my way to get it.  If I were in the convenience store looking for a refreshing fruity beverage, I might buy it again.<br /><br />I tried two different flavors of THE SWITCH, and the Black Cherry was my preference over the other flavor, Kiwi Berry.  The cherry flavor really stood out and with every sip I felt sure that real black cherries were used to make this beverage.<br /><br />To sum up, I think THE SWITCH is a nice alternative to sodas, although a little pricier than colas are.  It is a refreshing fruit beverage, but there are other brands that have a tastier flavor.<br /><br />If Amazon allowed half-star ratings, I would give this 3.5 stars. Tasty, but I wouldn't drive out of my way for it  3 4
That's not a compliment. Maxwell House isn't exactly top shelf. Personally, it's not as good as Donut Shop but it is 13 cents per cup less when you subscribe and save.<br /><br />I love the packaging where the bottom is a coffee filter and not a k cup. Since it's not the proprietary k cup design, they can probably avoid royalties to Keurig. But in the end you drink coffee not for looks or cost but taste. And while it tastes OK, there are tastier options out there. My wife thinks it tastes like Maxwell House  3 2
My labs like to play with this toy-- which is good.  I don't put treats inside it and they still will play with it and fight over it.It seems durable and it seems safe.  The problems are two fold.  If the dogs play with it on a hard surface, like a concrete patio or a wooden deck, it makes a lot of noise as they drag the bottle end around and bounce it off of objects. Also my Labs will grab this thing by the rope end and swing it around in the air and it becomes a weapon of mass destruction whacking fixed objects or another dog while being whirled around. Nothing is perfect. I let the dogs have play time with it regardless of the negatives. Good Toy--A few Drawbacks  3 4
An otherwise good gum reduced to a three-star review by really mind-boggling packaging. I fail to see the advantage of the foil-covered capsule approach. I lose approximately one piece a pack by pressing just the wrong way and having the gum shoot out of the package like a cannon, forever lost.<br /><br />The gum itself is decent, lasts for slightly less than a twenty five minute car drive, packs a comfortable punch, and improves breath. Still, it's not outstanding, and doesn't overcome the poor packaging, so won't be buying any more. What's the deal with the packaging?  3 2
"The Switch" seems to be another take on carbonated fruit drinks. It immediately reminded me of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00094JEUO">Izze</a> line of drinks that I've tried in the past...same size, and same basic idea of just fruit juice and carbonated water. After trying this one sample though, I'd have to say I prefer Izze. The black cherry Switch that I tried had a decent enough flavor (very mild cherry flavor but still pleasant), but it was really sweet, and had even more sugar per can than Izze, which was already pretty high. I think these drinks are a nice alternative to sodas, if you just have to have something with fizz and can't take artificial sweeteners. Definitely a better choice for kids who want something sweet but at least a tad healthier since these are natural sugars with a lower glycemic index. But it's still a simple sugar, and there's a LOT of it in this drink, 33g in 8.3 oz. The price is also pretty hefty, at almost $1 a can. Personally, I think I do just as well getting fruit juice of my choosing and adding some club soda to it for fizz. But when I am in the mood for something sweet to pack for a hike, etc. and just have to have something, I'd probably look for Izze drinks first. A bit too sweet for my liking  3 4
Product used in carnival-type popper.  Nice to have everything self-contained.  However, so many kernels remain unpopped, you can watch them fly out of popper.  Product is very salty.  But if you're looking for real movie popcorn, this is it. Movie-Style Popcorn  3 2
The Torani chocolate & raspberry sugar-free syrups were to die for!  :)  The caramel was pretty bad, I thought.  The others were good but I wouldn't order them again.  I think this is personal preference stuff. Some excellent & some so-so...  3 2
This price is a little high.  You can generally buy it in a grocery store for around $1.25 a bottle.<br /><br />For some reason the seller claims they don't like the flavor.  It tastes like ORange Hi-C which I think is good.  Kind of like less sugary Kool Aid.  I love the taste.  Plus, there are 2.5 servings in  each bottle - so each bottle is 125 calories.<br /><br />The product is good.  I think Revive flavor is the best. I think it tastes great but...........  3 4
Once or twice a year for a little variety and that's about enough for my cat of this particular variety.  He likes it for a change from his chicken, turkey and beef, but not very often.  He will eat about 3/4 of the can and then he's had enough. He's not a huge fish fan anyway, but this stuff looks to be about the best out there in the fish varieties.  The chunks are bit sized so if your cat has a small mouth like mine does, it will be easier to chew.  Don't know why my cat doesn't like this type of fish, but he really could care less about it. Not the favorite in our house  3 2
Betty Crocker has discontinued its Stickerz line, which we preferred for their bite size format and ease of use.  Although the product photograph suggests that these combo packs will contain Stickerz/Stackerz/Shapes, the six disappointing boxes we bought did not.  References to the discontinued lines have been removed from the packaging, which is now limited to the same Gushers, Fruit by the Foot and Fruit Roll-Ups to be found at any grocery store. Not quite as pictured  3 2
The flavor is alright. It has a slight, slight taste of Root Beer and ice cream, but that only lasts a few seconds. As I chew the gum longer, it starts to taste like Pepto Bismol the most. It's not the worst gum I've chewed on, but it's not the best either. Tastes like Pepto Bismol  3 2
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SATIBO">Davidson's Tea Bulk, Earl Grey, 16-Ounce Bag</a><br />When received outer box was fine. However, package inside was open and tea was spilled. Attention to packaging is required. loose tea literally  3 2

I've been looking all over for this sauce to make my fried rice. I am a little disappointed in the flavor. I used to use LaChoy, but I can no longer find it. It had a wonderful flavor and made my fried rice real authentic tasting. Koon Chun Thick Soy Sauce  3 4
This is a tasty drink with pale pink/purplishcolor. With its carbonation one could call it a drink with bite. For me the taste was good but not outstanding. The aromatic bouquet of Switch is fabulous, but the actual taste, unfortunately, doesn't measure up to that mesmerizing scent.<br /><br />The can's diminutive size lends itself to a quick refresher, not a slake for a heavy duty thirst. It's a good size for a pocket, lunch bag, or purse. Good But Not Enough to Switch  3 4
Loved the distinct flavor of Stash Organic Chai Black and Green Tea and, when I could not find it, finally purchased the Earl Grey Black and Green.

I looked deeper into the description of these and found this:<br /><br />***ZICO 11 oz. tetra cartons are produced in Brazil and deliver a light, refreshing taste.<br /><br />One-liter cartons are produced in Thailand for a more nutty flavor profile, similar to fresh green Thai coconuts from the grocery store.<br /><br />And 14 oz. bottles are a nutty blend of Brazilian, Thai and Indonesian coconuts.***<br /><br />So you might not be liking the taste of the coconuts from Thai and Indonesia instead of it being the plastic bottle.<br /><br />I'll be staying with the original formula since I bought some from Trader Joe's and really like it but it is the Brazilian coconuts only.<br /><br />Mystery solved?  Let me know what you think. It might not be the plastic bottle that you're tasting...  3 1

We have purchased this popcorn twice. It's just the right amount for our popcorn popper as we have a 4 oz kettle on the stand up machine. About 95% of the corn pops so expect to lose a little but this is normal with an automatic paper as occasionally a popped grain of corn will take an unpopped grain of corn with it as it leaves the kettle. The oil in the packages in the first batch stayed firm however the oil in the second order is completely melted. We have not yet figured out the reasons as storage condition for each were exactly the same. This is a good product however you are paying a lot more than bulk ingredients when it comes prepackaged like this. Popcorn  3 4
A single can of this super energy drink is good for 2 servings.  Each serving has 130 calories, which means if you drink this all at once you will have twice as many calories.  Some of the active ingredients listed are: caffeine, taurine, L-carnotone and arginine.  There is plenty of corn syrup in this drink.  It is bubbly drink with ginseng and grape flavor and my can had beverage in reddish color.  This drink will definitely keep you up, but I am not sure that calorie count is worth it. Drink with a zing  3 4
Even though there is no added sugar, this small can packs in 130 calories and 33 grams of sugars via fruit juices.  That's the down side.  The plus is the flavor - it tastes of cherry with some fizz, but not too much.  If you've ever had Knudsen's Cherry Cider, that's what this tastes like, with some carbonation.<br /><br />While I like the taste, the high calorie and sugar count for 8 oz. is why I gave it three stars.  If you don't have to worry about sugar and calories, this is a tasty treat. Great flavor, but too high in sugars  3 4
THE Brine it self is great ,BUT  what you do not find out & there is NO way TO KNOW THAT it is NOT inside this product  after you open the package, you find out, is that you need a LARGE Brine BAG to soak the whole thing in for the 24- 48 hours before baking, so then you get this2 days before Christmas day & now it is to late to order a Brine bag to use with this, & NO place in this add to order did it say it was no included?? IT would BE so helpfull to know ahead of time that this is not all you will need to do the brine ,  I know IT also will not come with a turkey, BUT you would think for the price it would have a bag,<br /> BUT the truth of this is , THAT it is still great Brine  JUST hard to use IF you do not know what you will need,<br />  Thank YOU for ASKING&lt; A GRANDMA THAT FOUND another way TO SOAK THIS BIRD,when you do not have a BAG!!!!

I've always enjoyed the original Zico coconut water, but thought I'd give some of the other flavors a try. The mango flavor really jumped out at me because I love mangoes and thought coconut and mangoes would perfectly compliment each other. Unfortunately, the Zico drinks with "natural mango flavor" taste like someone dropped a mango flavored hard candy into my Zico drink. It's not terrible, but that's definitely NOT the refreshing flavor I was hoping for, especially after a hard workout! I think I can manage to power through the remaining 11 drink boxes I bought, but I won't be wasting my money on this drink again. Prefer the original flavor because the Mango tastes fake  3 2
I honestly don't care for the taste of the white cheddar. It was too bland and chalky for me (not smooth and creamy). My husband is finishing the case for me since he is not picky about food as long as it is made for him. The shells were yummy and when cooked long enough I found them to have a nice consistency and were tasty without the white cheddar sauce. Don't forget to mix the power and the milk together before adding the pasta, I know it is on the box but who takes the time to read the box? The taste is not for me  3 2
I have ordered this gold-bears with another bag of raspberries, both are 5lb bags. When they arrived, the gold-bears bag was taped together with a clear tape. I had originally thought it was just a random piece of tape. When I looked closely, I saw the bag was cut open and the tape was sort of holding all the bears in. The bag must've accidentally got cut opened at some point and taped together before it was even packed for shipping. I was disappointed. The shipping package was not damaged at all. So it looks like some one in the Amazon packing department decided that this is safe to ship this to the customer. I contacted the customer department and they were easy to work with. I needed the candy for kids' party, they offered to ship one-day but I didn't want to risk for another damaged bag. Maybe next time I'll think twice about buying a big bag. more of a packing issue, but important for food item.  3 1
I Recently bought a 3 pack of this coffee at Bed Bath and Beyond. As its brewing, it smells great (if you like coconut).  The taste isn't bad, but for me, it has that artificial after taste that many flavored coffees have. I gave it 3 stars because it's not terrible. But I wouldn't buy this coffee again. If you're sensitive to after taste, I wouldn't recommend. I'd Grab a dark roast and throw some fresh coconut in there instead if you want a coconut coffee. A bit disappointed  3 2
After finding the right way to brew this coffee - as strong as I like it - , I realized that there was nothing extraordinary about the flavor.  It's not completely bland, it just doesn't have anything special that would make me want to buy it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Organic<br />- Part of the money goes to a good cause<br />Cons:<br />- Nothing special in the type of roast.<br />- Too high price.<br /><br />I'd rather stick to other brands that I like better than buy Marley coffee. No pizzazz!  3 2

My first impression of Wheatena was that it tasted like coffee grounds. But then I realized that if they were more filling I would in fact enjoy eating coffee grounds. Wheatena is clearly an acquired taste. Furthermore, the claims of this product being healthy are somewhat neutralized by California's claims that roasted grains cause cancer. Wheatena is a nice change from oatmeal, but it is not as wonderful as the reviews of Wheatena devotees would have you believe. A Different Hot Cereal  3 4

I have to admit, I'm no stranger to dog treats.  I've had about forty years worth of dogs, and they've all gotten one sort of biscuit or another, and I've tasted the varieties.  With only two exceptions I've not been able to discern any of the advertised flavors.  Neither peanut butter, nor liver, nor any of the assorted others.  The best biscuit I've tasted was given out at a neighborhood coffee spot.  The waitress brought it out to the table I was sharing with my good dog Sam, and asked me if I'd like to give it to him.  It looked an awful lot like the scone I had on my own plate, so I said yes, and waited for her to leave.  Once she was out of sight I tasted it, and if it wasn't the same as my scone it was darn close.  Since I had my own, Sam got his, but I have considered going back for coffee and a doggy treat sans doggie.  The other biscuit whose flavoring I could taste was baked by my wife and it was something like an over-baked crust of bread.  My good dog Shalako ate 'em up - I passed on future offerings.<br /><br />On to Newman's Own.  I'm a sucker for anything Newman's Own - not that I like everything the company puts out, but I appreciate the altruism - so I jumped at the chance to review Newman's Own Organics Lamb and Barley etc's.  Upon opening the package I was hit with an aroma.  Nothing that got my mouth watering, but very few dog biscuits have an aroma, so that was a good sign.  The biscuits were a good color - standard brown, but they didn't look dyed.  Another good sign.  What also surprised me was how solid they were.  Not at all crumbly, and it took a bit of effort to break it in half, even though each biscuit is scored for breaking.<br /><br />I put the first biscuit behind my back and changed hands a few times, spreading the aroma.  When I held my closed fists out for Sam to choose the one with the biscuit he sniffed both but fixated on the correct one right away.  It was that good aroma.  When I gave it to him I think he was as surprised as I with its hearty texture.  I could see it was a good tooth cleaner, and as Sam never gets animal bones, a good thing to have.  The next test was for him to choose from hands that each held a biscuit, one with Newman's, the other with another brand.  The strong aroma didn't work to Newman's advantage this time, and Sam went for the hand with his old familiar treat.  But as soon as he downed it he was sniffing around for the Newman's Own that I still held out in front of me.<br /><br />I don't know if these tests prove anything.  I skipped the human taste test as the biscuits are so durable I was afraid I'd crack an implant.<br /><br />I'd buy Newman's if I saw them, but not for myself.  I'd get them for Sam.  He's a dog who deserves a good treat. Arf!  4 3
Kellogg's Special Potassium Oxide Protein Water does a good job in taking the edge off hunger.  I drink it about 5 times a week.  It is not a weight loss program by itself, but does help.<br /><br />I buy it from Amazon because few local stores carry it. Good Product, Not Easy to Find  4 3
This product worked really well and I am happy with my purchase. I used them for cake pops and they wrote vibrant and easy, unlike the Wilton ones I purchased before these. DO NOT buy Wilton if you are using them for cake pops. I didn't try them on other things, like fondant or gumpaste, but using the Wilton ones on cake pops was like writing on wax. The only thing I would suggest, would be to have a finer point tip on the Americolor pens. This would have made the lines cleaner and better looking. Good quality...good price  4 5
I almost didn't buy this from my local high-end grocery store because the price was so outrageous, but I'm glad I decided to go for it.  This is one of the better gluten-free cereals I've had.  It is not just like Cheerios, of course, but it has a pleasant taste of its own with just the right amount of sweetness added to make it flavorful.  It doesn't get soggy immediately like some gluten-free cereals, nor does it have that familiar "cardboard" texture those of us with celiac know all too well.  This product seems to have avoided the usual gluten-free problems, and I give the makers credit for that.<br /><br />I think it could have a little more cinnamon taste to it -- of course, I can always just add some myself -- and the price is still high compared to similar gluten-free cereals, regardless of where you buy it, but I think it's definitely worth trying if you're on a gluten-free diet and need something palatable.  I'll buy this again. Non-cardboard gluten-free cereal  4 2
If the container wasn't so loud and we could find the correct size/shaped treats to put in it this product would get 5 stars. It keeps our Pit/Lab mix busy and gets her thinking which let me tell you is amazing since she's quite "thick" in the head... I've found a few smaller sized treats at Petco and put a handful in at a time. Make sure to put different sized treats in it too or else the dog will dump them all out and then fill up way too fast. The plastic has held up fine on our tile floor except for the teeth marks but I'm not too worried about it breaking like other people have posted. Decent toy and kept the dog interested and BUSY!  4 3
This item was received promptly. I purchased it as a substitute for honey, and it is a little thinner than I expected. It's also not as sweet as I expected. I had to add additional artificial sweetener to my recipe to get the same sweetness as honey. It's vegan, so I will continue to use it. It's a little thin for a "honey" substitute.  4 3
I usually am not a big fan  of iced coffee drinks, but this one was not bad. It was not sickly sweet, and had a decent flavor.<br /><br />My only complaint was the size of the can/amount of product. In my opinion, it was too small. Not bad.  4 3
I ... like so many others who observe Thanksgiving, think that the holiday simply isn't complete without a slice of pumpkin pie.  And while it is one of the healthier desserts out there (well, I like to think it is, anyway, because of the pumpkin), it is still not at all what I'd consider healthy or low fat or low calorie.<br /><br />But ... this is the perfect alternative to those who feel guilty after indulging in a slice of pumpkin pie.  THIS is pumpkin pie without the guilt!  It has the flavor of Matcha in it (of course), but also the sweet, delicious, rich and savory taste of pumpkin, a touch of cinnamon, and the buttery taste of pastry in there.  So yummy!<br /><br />I recommend trying this one as a latte.  I used a 1:1 ratio here, using 1 part hot water to 1 part warmed milk.  This helped bring out the creaminess of the pumpkin pie, and also brought out the pastry notes as I had a hard time tasting them without the milk.<br /><br />Scrumptious! An Awesome Twist on a Thanksgiving Favorite!  4 5
I was very happen with my purchase from Amazon.  It was easy, and I received by coffee even<br />quicker that expected.  The price was right, and the coffee is good.  I don't usually like flavored<br />coffee and I am new to the Kerig K-cup world, but this is a good one. Green Mountain French Vanilla K-cup  4 5
I really did not know what to expect.  They appeared a bit strange.  In fact, they did not look like a food product.  However, after just two minutes on high, I got a treat.  The rinds were better than I ever had.  Once cooled, they were perfect.  If hot, they were soggy.  I enjoyed them; my son, who is extremely fussy, enjoyed them.  I would absolutely buy them again.  I recommend them highly. Microwave Pork Rinds  4 5
What can I say?  It's herbal tea, it tastes a bit grassy, but I like it.  I'd say try some before you buy a bunch of it because people either seem to love it or hate it. Not bad  4 3
This spread is just right but costs only about six dollars locally.<br />price with shipping here is ridiculous! Great but expensive here  4 3
I am not a diehard tea drinker and am a diet coke junkie.  That said - I liked the idea of trying the health benefits of green tea and, lately, have found a hot cup of tea a great way to start/end the day.<br /><br />This tea is fruity and not bitter.  I add a packet of sweetner in the AM and it is perfect.  I highly recommend this one!! Flavorful, fruity green tea  4 5
I like em but nothing unique about the flavor.  basically saves you from having to make them at home... a little pricey but for a treat what the heck tasted ok.... a bit overpriced tho  4 3
I love Italian roast coffee.  While this is not the "best" cup of coffee I've ever had it is very good for a Keurig cup.  The roast is nice and dark, but no bitter aftertaste, and does not have the almost burnt taste of some dark roast K-cups I've had.  It still has a robust flavor when you use it to brew the largest size.  This is a good cup of coffee. Tasty coffee  4 5
We got the salmon and the peanut butter flavors for our puppies, and they go crazy for them. They were really hard to potty train, but these were small and healthy enough that we were able to give them to our dogs every time they pottied outside. They worked great for that, and our dogs finally got the message! But they really don't smell appetizing, and even one of the salmon ones will make their breath smell terrible for a whole day!<br /><br />I'm giving it 4 stars for that reason. If your dogs like them as much as ours do, I think it's well worth the stinky breath. My dogs like them, but they STINK!  4 3
I was finding that every time I got a Frappuccino from Fivebucks..err..Starbucks, I was spending about, well, five bucks.  I thought I'd give these "Caffe D'Vita" powders a try.  So far, I've only tried the Java Chip mix, and found it to be "OK".  I think that even including milk and ice, I'm still probably spending only about 75 cents a cup, so it's a great deal.<br /><br />If, like me, you find the Caffe D'Vita flavors to be not quite up to snuff, you might try making your own Frappuccinos.  I found a recipe online.  The secret ingredient can be found right here on Amazon: xanthan Gum!  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0040DWCXG">Xanthan Gum 1lb Powder USP FCC Food Grade (Buy 5 get $15 off)</a> Not as good as Starbucks, but MUCH cheaper  4 3
These almonds are very tasty and popular at my workplace. If you've had wasabi peas, you'll probably like these too. "BOLD" is a bit of an overstatement, as these almonds are not as intense as the peas with the nasal burn, but still do have a bit of kick. I wouldn't say the soy sauce flavor is that apparent, though, but I'm not counting that against the product.<br /><br />Most wasabi-flavored snacks really contain horseradish because it is a cheaper substitute. Wasabi is notoriously difficult to cultivate and the chemicals that give it its characteristic pungency are volatile.<br /><br />I like these a whole lot and routinely buy several cans of them from my drugstore whenever they are on sale. My mom's factory wo-workers like these too. However, I took this to a baseball game and it was almost universally hated. Go figure! Can I offer you ladies a cool beverage or a tasty snack?  4 3
This is great especially if you are kosher and live in an area like me where it is hard to get kosher food. It come right to my door and easy to make. Tastes great with some coconut milk and chile peppers. Convenience  4 5
When i got it, was in amazing condition, only problem is it died due to the fact bugs { nats & flies } Love this for some odd reason. But all n all, love the plant! Will buy from seller again. Very good plant,  4 5
I'm sitting down to a fresh cup of this coffee on a Saturday morning, with a day of good work ahead of me ... drinking it straight-up, nothing added ... I have to say, it's pretty rich and flavorful. I am the kind of coffee drinker who doesn't have a "pot a day" or anything like that (and some days I don't have any coffee at all), but I can be considered a "Starbucks snob." I don't really like the plain cheapie supermarket coffee, and I can't bring myself to choke down instant. I like flavorful coffee. And this Puroast Dark Roast definitely has a lot of flavor. I cannot tell that it's low-acid. The typical coffee bitterness (I tend to like it strong) is nice here. Good stuff. Fine for an early Saturday morning  4 5
Nice selection of flavors.<br /><br />blue - tastes like blue!<br />green with yellow center - sour apple<br />orange with white center - orange cream<br />white with black stripes - anise/licorice and it tastes good too!<br />white with red stripes - peppermint<br />red with red stripes - cinnamon<br />brown, white - chocolate vanilla<br />yellow, pink - strawberry banana<br />peach - peach (wow)<br />brown, white, pink - Neapolitan<br /><br />Six packs will last a long time. Delicious favorite  4 5
Great alternative to fettuccine if you have gluten problems. Sauce is a big helper for taste and don't boil them to long. They will clump. Overall I am very happy with them. Great Alternative  4 5
Co-workers introduced me to instant Ginger tea. I've purchased a few different brands locally. I prefer the instant in this case because tea-bag varieties I've tried tend to lack flavor and be quite tame. I like my ginger with a kick to it!<br /><br />Gold Kili's Ginger-Lemon drink has that kick, though it isn't the strongest I've tasted. That honor goes to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0035UI0H2">Instant Crystal Honey Ginger Tea</a>.  The Gold Kili brand drink is almost as strong, yet its sweetness has a slightly artificial flavor. Not totally off-putting, but noticeable. The lemon flavor is there too, but very subdued. I prefer the honey taste of the other brand.<br /><br />The Gold Kili instant ginger drink can handle more than 6-8 oz. of liquid without tasting watered down, and I recommend 10-12 for most folks.  I can see it mixing well in various cocktails as well. Medicinal effects of ginger are well documented, though I don't know how effective they are in this formulation. Just be mindful that this is an instant beverage and not the same as one made with fresh ingredients. You get it for the convenience.<br /><br />3.5 stars for a tasty ginger drink.<br /><br />~ Kort Decent Instant Ginger Tea  4 3
My daughter (7yo) wanted a little tree for her room.  We thought this one had the best combination of hardiness, size, smile appeal, and ease of care.  We were a little concerned based on past reviews about how healthy the plant would be when it arrived.  I'm happy to say, the tree was/is healthy, packed well, and exactly as described.  My daughter named it "Lucky".  Seems like a good value. Cute Plant  4 5
This review pertains specifically to the Chunky Peanut Butter flavor of thinkThin bars.  I haven't tried any of the other flavors.<br /><br />It's always interesting when a product receives such disparate reviews.  Some people here think these bars taste great, and others found them so horrible that they threw them away.  Count me among those those think these taste good.  I didn't notice any chemical flavor, just a nice chocolate and peanut butter mixture.  Probably most impressive about this bar versus other brands with a similar flavor and nutritional makeup (Clif Builder's, Pure Protein) is that the thinkThin bar is more moist and soft.  I actually like the creamier mouth feel of the thinkThin bar, though it does mean it's easier to eat and feels less substantial than the drier brands.  The Pure Protein bar is more similar nutritionally since it also uses sugar alcohols; the Clif Builder's Bar has more actual sugar in it.<br /><br />I did a quick cost comparison with the two other brands cited, based on Amazon's current subscription price.  The thinkThin brand costs more per ounce than the others (approximately 7 cents per ounce more than the Pure Protein and 15 cents more per ounce than Clif), but the cost per gram of protein delivered is more similar, with Pure Protein being the least expensive at about 5 cents per ounce of protein, Clif's being about 6 cents per ounce of protein, and thinkThin being just shy of 7 cents per ounce of protein. good flavor, more moist than many similar bars; expensive  4 3
I am a complete novice about ginger tea and ginger beer (didn't even know there were such things until I read a review of this product).  I was most surprised when first drinking this beverage mix, added to hot water, at the strength of the flavor and the bite it leaves on the tongue.  There is nothing tepid about it.  However, if the drink is too strong for your taste, it can be weakened, but still taste good, by putting it on ice.<br /><br />The flavor of the honey and lemon is easily distinguishable.  So you have to be a lover of ginger in liquid form to really appreciate this instant drink.  I like the fact there are no bags, it's easy to prepare.  You just pour.<br /><br />It's really up to one's individual taste as to whether or not this drink will be appealing.  As for myself, I think I might drink it as a remedy for indigestion (rather than over-the-counter pharmacy remedies); however, for pleasure, I would choose something else. Just as described.  4 2
To me the hulls and taste were on par if not slightly better then Jolly Time white kernels.  From a price standpoint I will stick with Jolly Time, but that is just my preference. Good similar taste to Jolly Time White kernels  4 3
Effects with some foods are more remarkable than others. I found balsamic vinegar tasting fairly like wine to be one of the most remarkable. fun  4 5
We had this shipped directly to our family in another part of the country. They thought it was a beautifully put together and wonderful present. They loved everything inside of it and they tend to be very picky. The only complaint I have is it took forever to ship! Although I personally didn't see it from what I understand it was worth the wait. Wonderful Gift/ Long shipping time  4 5
These are nice large nuts, well roasted and salted. I like the 12 ounce size and the three pack is nice. I get them on subscribe and save and the price for this quality peanut is good. I use them for snacks and for cooking stir frys and making lettuce wrap fillings. Good size to throw in your bag to take to a game, or put in your car for starvation emergencies. Nice nuts, good size for portion control, salted just right for me  4 5
Tough?!?  Ah, C'mon, you can't compare this to Cap'n Crunch, for heaven's sake..!  This one is all-natural, and has no preservatives -- sure, it's going to get a bit tough once it's open.  To combat that, just put the bowl of cereal (dry) into the microwave for 20 - 30 seconds... let cool, and then enjoy - voila!  (This can be done with any cereal that goes stale, btw).<br /><br />It's really good combined with yogurt and fruit.<br /><br />Seriously, don't compare this with the over-processed, preservative-laden stuff in the grocery stores.  Zap it and give it a shot! Don't Compare to Conventional Cereals...!  4 5
Since being diagnosed with a wheat allergy several years ago, I have been on a mission to find good tasting, wheat free baked goods.  This crust is very good, it just takes a little more milk than the recipe on the back calls for.  I now look forward to making pizza every once in a while instead of it being a complicated chore. good and gluten free  4 5
When you have Libby's on the label....sorry, the old commercial popped into my head. Libby's products always taste good. I bought this along with some other canned goods. (See other reviews.) I'm working on building up my emergency food and kits and this 12pk of cans fit the bill nicely in quantity, price and expiration date of 12/14. Name brands aren't important to me as price, but this package was a good deal. I don't usually eat canned potatoes. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat these, but in an emergency they will do nicely.<br />The cans arrived promptly in advertised condtion without dents. No issues here. Okay corn. Arrived promptly without issues.  4 1
Review of any product necessarily reflects opinion.  I am not you (whoever you may be, reading this review).  Therefore, you may love this coffee.  I did not.  I gave it four stars because I felt the need to recognize that there wasn't anything wrong with it; it was coffee.  It was drinkable; there was nothing wrong with it.<br /><br />I just didn't love the taste, that's all.<br /><br />I don't know if this taste is a reflection of its low-acid content.  Moreover, if I were to attempt to describe how I perceived the taste, my description could come off as vaguely insulting; worse yet, I should have enjoyed it.  It had a sort of harsh taste, in my opinion, of a type I enjoy in other beverages such as unsweetened tea, particularly lapsang souchong.  Don't know it?  My friends describe lapsang souchong, variously, as smelling and tasting like stinky feet, motor oil, and dirt.)<br /><br />I don't know what it was with this coffee.  Therefore, I warrant that my review may be virtually worthless.  I struggled to find a way to write it such that I could impart some information; the best that I can impart is:  Try it for yourself.  Look at other reviews.  See mine as only one opinion; but honestly -- I really didn't enjoy this coffee very much.<br /><br />So I wouldn't exactly recommend it -- but it deserves a fair shake.<br /><br />Thanks for reading.

What better way to tell your mom you love her by reminding her of her age? This bundle comes with most of the candies from a decade long past. The amount of candy is generous and fun and fairly priced. Bring back old memories with this fun gift. a fun gift with fun memories.  4 5
Good quality product- medium grain, cook quickly & taste great. Very good value versus buying single packages in the grocery store which even here in the South most often carry instant grits (Yuck!)<br />Cook 'em, add Cheddar & heavy cream with a dash of Tabasco sauce & top with sauteed shrimp for a quick & very tasty meal anytime.<br />Oh yeah they're good at breakfast too! Good quality -Good value  4 5
The mixture of juices they use to sweeten this give it a little bit of an odd taste and makes it too sweet.  It's not a straight orange/citrus flavor.  Not being an apple juice fan I wasn't fond of it.<br /><br />I gave it four stars b/c it is what it advertises - it's juice with sparkling water, unlike some other "healthy" sparkling beverages that are basically soda.<br /><br />For sparkling juice I prefer IZZE - it's a little less sweet. Decent, but tastes a little "odd"  4 3
Well, I was envious when I gave this my dog.  It really does smell good and he loves it. yum  4 5
The good:<br />1. This tastes really good to me. One of the better truly low carb pastas that I've tried.<br />2. So easy to cook - it only takes 5 minutes.<br />3. With regular pasta, I dislike al dente because it's usually too firm for my taste but with this, al dente is just right. It's not too firm and not mushy.<br />4. Only 24 grams of carbs + 6 grams of fiber and you get an entire 1.5 cups which is a much larger serving for way fewer carbs than regular pasta.<br />5. The subscribe and save price was very reasonable I felt and it's great to have it delivered right to your door.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />1. Unfortunately this made my blood glucose rise from about 100 to about 150 within about 45 minutes of eating and it stayed up there for almost 90 minutes. Next time I eat this I'll know to exercise within 30 minutes or so of ingesting and I think that might take care of the blood glucose spike. Worth it to have some decent pasta.<br /><br />I'd also like to point out that my husband had a bigger serving than I did and it didn't spike his blood glucose as many points as it did me most likely because he's more muscular and more active than I am.<br /><br />I gave this 4.5 stars because I think it tastes really good, it has a good mouth feel, the price is reasonable and you get a good sized portion. Even though it spiked my blood glucose, I'm still going to keep this on the menu at least once a month. Spiked my Blood Glucose but Ultimately It's Worth It  4 3
I bought these for my Daughter because she is not very good at eating healthy food at regular intervals!  These are perfect for her to put in her bookbag and take with her to school so that when she gets hungry or has blood sugar issues she can just eat one of these delicious bars.  They really do taste good for a protien bar - not only do they have a lot of protien in them but they have fiber as well!! Great Snack  4 5
Have always loved apple butter not just in PB & J but makes a great glaze for pork and also a touch to apple salad or just plain apple.Have always trusted the Smuckers brand for quality and taste. Apple Butter not just for sandwiches  4 5
These are WONDERFUL -- BUT, the title makes it sound like you get 24 bags that are 8.46 ounces each. NOT SO! Each bag is only 0.35 ounces. The 8.46 ounces is the amount you get for all the bags put together.<br /><br />As I said, these are wonderful! But they are very expensive for the amount you get.<br /><br />I gave them 4 stars because the title is deceiving! If you zoom in on the picture, you'll see the bag says 0.35 ounces. Great snack - BUT, title is deceiving!!!  4 3
The taste is different than flour for sure, but in a very good way. Just be careful when substituting it in recipes where you're hoping for something sturdy or stiff. When used in pizza crusts, it tends to crumble and you end up with more of a pizza casserole. However, it makes excellent pancakes, and when used in sauces/rousses, it's basically indistinguishable from flour. All in all, the texture takes getting used to but the taste and low-carb formulation are definitely worth it. Great product, but strange texture  4 3
This dog toy puzzle comes assembled (which I completely appreciated) and was easy and straight forward to set up for our two dogs. It truly put our Rottweiler's problem solving skills to the test and proved to be quite interactive and entertaining for our German Shepard. Colorful and easy to store, the Star Spinner has been a good addition to our household.<br /><br />This is a social writeup! Dog's Completely Enjoy This Toy!  4 5
Happy Hips are one of my little monster's favorite treats.  She is a very finicky eater but she will obey and be sweet for a chance at these chip like treats.<br /><br />This product was recommended to me by another dog owner as a healthy treat because it contains no fillers, byproducts, antibiotics, or added hormones. It also has vitamins and minerals to maintain healthy joints, which for a French Bulldog that has problems with hips and joints, is a plus.  I feel better about giving the little critter a healthy treat instead of the garbage contained in brand name treats on the market.<br /><br />One huge red flag is they are made in China, which certainly gives me pause, but I will keep buying them.<br />I have only tried the beef liver variety and will stick with it since my little creature likes them so much. A Treat My Dog Loves  4 5
For some reason, I can't find this in the stores or markets in my area, and I can't eat regular pasta, so I as glad to be able to find it this way. I wish I could have ordered a smaller amount, but it is convenient to have in available (in my house) when I want it. kraft macaroni & cheese whole grain  4 5
My grandomther boought this a few years ago and gave me some of the flowers. now, a few years later the tea still tastes great but the flowers dont look very nice when they open love it!!!  4 5
I give the Zico mango flavored coconut water 4 stars because that touch of flavor does not do it for me unless I add some Splenda.  The natural flavor Zico coconut water, on the other hand, taste just right, and I give that one 5 stars!. Tastes just like coconut water!  4 3
Due to husband's blood pressure, I eliminated salt from my cooking and searched for ways to add flavor without much fuss.  This original seasoning has a nice blend of pepper with other seasonings and is a quick fix for boring rice, bland vegetables, etc.  I use it a lot when I don't have time to make a more complicated dish. good salt-free seasoning  4 5
Since this seems to be a main concern, I thought I would start with saying that all packages of cookies arrived intact along with a lot of other items I had ordered. Now on to the cookies themselves, they are very good tasting cookies. These taste like real chocolate chip cookies that crumble in your mouth and chocolate in every bite. The flavoring is great for packaged cookie. Yes, I would rather have a cookie home baked and out of the oven. But I will buy these again. I would recommend them for when you just don't feel like baking. For its price, it is the best chocolate chip cookie so far I have had shipped to the house. Great Tasting  4 5
These Honey Stingers are great.  I've used them a handful of times on runs lasting over an hour.  They do seem to provide some much-needed energy.  They're easy to chew, taste great, don't stick in my teeth or make me extra thirsty, and the packet is small enough to be portable.  I really like that the ingredients are pronounceable and healthy enough (organic tapioca, cane sugar, fruit juice, etc.).<br /><br />However, I don't see how they're any different from organic fruit snacks (like Annie's bunnies), which I can get much cheaper in a multi-pack from my local wholesale club.  The ingredients and nutrition information are virtually identical.  For that reason, I gave them just 4 stars. Great, but special?  I'm not so sure.  4 3
Okay, it does smell kind of like cat food. But it is packaged fish, which I think is what cat food is, so I guess that's not a huge surprise. My daughter really likes it, and I like that it's good for her, so overall we give this our seal of approval. Not bad!  4 3
Some people don't like it, but if you like sharp cheese, you should like these.  I take them to parties and at least one person can't stop eating them every time.  I like them okay. Yum!  4 5
Like that is it organic, don't like that it comes in plastic containers.  Earth's Best was always our first choice, but Gerber Organics comes a close second. Yum.  4 5
I ordered these simply out of curiosity. All those rumors about space food people have been spreading around. First of all this is NOT what NASA eats as their regular food supply. They do in fact have real fruits and other things like meat products and they do have freeze-dried snacks to reduce the weight on the space shuttle. this food is extremely light weight as compared to traditional foods. On a space shuttle launch every pound costs thousands of dollars so literately every pound counts. I would see this being a good snack pack for the crew of a space shuttle on the bridge or other space craft crew or the I.S.S(International Space Station)teams. But let me explain what exactly you are supposed to get in this sampler. Two 4inchesx4inches freeze dried astronaut ice cream squares one green mint chocolate chip and the other strawberry/vanilla/chocolate combo flavor, and one freeze dried ice cream sandwich. You also should get two astronaut space food energy bars with a refrigerator magnet. One chocolate and the other peanut butter. So basically what they show in the picture is what you get in this food sampler. But if you ask me it did make me thirsty. So I would drink a good amount of water after eating this stuff. Oh and FYI the ice cream is broken up into peaces so you can eat smaller peaces of of it. So my opinion is great sampler for the money. Just have water with yours. Not bad.

I bought this fondant to use with young teen girls who had no experience with fondant.  We used gel colors to make several different colors, and the gel colors worked beautifully with this fondant.  We didn't need the expensive cake decorator colors to get gorgeous results.  The other thing I liked was this fondant was not hard to work with.  If you can work with playdoh, then you can work with this fondant.  AND it tasted good, too!  I have tasted other fondants and it looks pretty, but you peel it off before you eat your cake.  With this fondant you will actually want to eat it as well as look at it.  This is a good choice for cooks who like their creations to look and taste good. Fondarific Fondant  4 5
I looked at the old fashioned pop corn poppers (you know, the red cart and metal popper), but those looked like they would be a lot of work to keep clean as well as take up counter space I don't have. However, I still really wanted "movie theater" or "carnival/fair" popcorn. So I got the Presto popcorn popper that goes in the microwave and works either with or without oil. If you get the 2.5oz size pack of Northern popcorn, you can easily split it in half and make 2 batches. (The Presto popper is too small for a 2.5oz pkg all at once.) This stuff tastes great. Yeah, I know palm oil is horrible for your heart etc. etc., but THAT is what makes all that fake buttery taste so yummy. Like another reviewer said, the salt packet is a quite salty so I only used half (maybe even less) the salt for all of the popcorn in each packet. After looking at several online distributors, at $18.95 (subscription price) Amazon has the best price. 4 1/2 stars Movie theatre popcorn from the microwave at home!  4 5
I try to give him one every night as a treat. Although my puppy is only 4 mos and only 22 lbs, he is quite the rough chewer so the Medium size is just fine for him. We may need to step up to the large size as he gets older and larger in size. one every night as a treat  4 3
I like the busy bones.  My pit has to work at it a bit harder than she does some of other "large" bones on the market.  I do wish it would last a little longer.  She can finish one in under 5 minutes.  I'm giving it to her because I want her to be BUSY.  Not distracted for 5 minutes. Almost 5 stars  4 3
I have the regular my K cup accessory that comes with the Keurig, but you have to insert the special holder and fill the filter each time, then wash them both out.  I like these because they are disposable.  And I can fill several at one time and have them ready in the refrigerator when I want them.  Very convenient. These Work  4 5
These wine gums were pretty good. Compared to Maynards wine gums they are more tart and less chewy.  They are more "more-ish" so they disappear faster.  I don't regard that as a good quality though; I prefer wine gums that are more fulfilling that I can savor for longer.  I'm going to stick with Maynards, even though they cost more. Good, but not the best  4 3
I think the title says it all.  The ingredients aren't exactly what I would choose.  And the texture is a bit odd (a bit like smooshed raisins).  But it did taste really good!  And the nutrition info fits within my diet. Really Good And Not Terrible For You  4 3
I actually didn't buy this through Amazon, but from a local general store in SC. I don't know when the original was out, but I'd never had it before now, so I have nothing to compare it to. I just finished my first ever piece and it was WONDERFUL! I guess if you're being nostalgic, brace yourself. But, if you're trying it for the first time, DIG IN! Just be warned, they are addictive. Yum!  4 5
This bubble gum does not stick to my partials. I have been chewing this gum for the past 10 years, it is my drug of choice. It relaxes me after a hard day in the office. Love to chew this gum!  4 5
My 1st no/low acid coffee. Not bad at all.  The dark roast was not too heavy but provided balance needed. Tasted like a good quality decaf coffee. I would buy it if I was uable to drink regular coffee! Not Bad!  4 3
I bought these for my  grandbabies because they are earths best and organic. They like them,but not as well as the cinnamon ones. I tried them,thought they tasted kind of like dirt. organic honey grahams  4 2
I love Kettle Brand Chips!<br />I've been in love with the Honey Dijon for years and decided to try out their other flavors.<br /><br />Sea Salt & Vinegar Chips are TANGY, SOUR, and make my lips pucker when I eat too many at a time.  I got 12 big bags for a steal from amazon ($11 WHAT?!?).<br /><br />Personally, the flavor is too much for me, but my mom & aunt LOVE them and they hate potato chips. PUCKER UP  4 5
I love having a soup that is healthy and not full of bad ingredients.  I like the chicken noodle better, but the rice is pretty good too. Love Wolfgang Puck soups  4 5
I purchased this tea for someone who enjoys Trader Joe's white pomegranate tea, and unfortunately it was not a good substitute. Though I haven't tried it myself I was told it had a strong floral taste and aroma which to that particular tea drinker was undesirable.  I am rating 4 stars since this is such a subjective judgement, and I have no doubts about this being a high quality product. Floral tasting tea  4 3
I have a Wasabi Pea addiction. Its not pretty, but its true.<br /><br />Having tried all kinds of Wasabi Peas, here's my review of these in context:<br /><br />- Hot 7/10<br />- Salty 7/10<br />- Wasabi Flavor 7/10<br />- Crunch<br /><br />Other than my annoyance that these peas have food coloring in them to make them look more Green, and the fact that they do not score the highest on the Flavor scale (meaning "how much does it taste like actual Wasabi...is the flavor well-rounded, etc), they are<br /><br />"PRETTY DARN GOOD." (7/10)<br /><br />The 5Lb bag probably would have been large enough to have let some of them go stale if you didn't divide it up into smaller bags...but I ate them in 1 month, and the flavor did not suffer in that time.<br /><br />Enjoy!

Love the combo packs for a fraction of the price as compared to a convenience store. These are delicious, portable, and even the pickiest eaters in the family love them. Great protein energy boost any time of day. Just be sure to keep these somewhere cool or the cheese melts. good portable snack  4 5
Wow, this tastes great, sweet and chocolaty! Like a liquid chocolate bar.<br /><br />Plus it is organic!<br /><br />It does contain high-glycemic cane juice, so I don't drink too much. The original and vanilla flavors are sweetened with low-glycemic rice syrup. They have less sugar. All are organic.<br /><br />I don't know why the ingredients here say canola oil. Neither the Good Karma website nor the label on the box has that ingredient. If I verified that this site is correct, and the Good Karma corporate website and the label on the carton are wrong, I would stop using the product. Perhaps this page has outdated ingredient information.<br /><br />This is the richest most milk-like rice beverage and the label on it does not mention canola oil, which contains up to 2% toxic erucic acid and is found in many rice beverages that are fed to children! Canola oil cannot be used by US FDA regulation in infant food. (One research paper found higher levels of erucic acid in red blood cells of autistic children compared to non-autistic children, and there are many other well established toxic effects of erucic acid in humans and animals. Look in the medical journals.)<br /><br />This product is sold in my neighborhood Ralph's (best price), VC discount, and Whole Foods in Los Angeles.<br /><br />The 365 brand (Whole Foods own brand) is also canola-free. It is much cheaper but watery in comparison. I use it for cooking. Only plain and vanilla flavors, though.<br /><br />West Soy Rice beverage is also canola free. It has a more neutral taste and less body. They have a chocolate flavor.<br /><br />Many people find rice milk better tasting than other milk substitutes. I find it to be much easier to digest than soy and nut products. Soy milk, however, has much more protein. Aside from being hard to digest, I don't eat too much soy because of the anti-nutritional components; so I get my protein elsewhere. best tasting chocolate beverage  4 5
I bought these to put in my office.  They were exactly what I expected- a retail box of tootsie pops!  My box included banana flavor lollipops, which I could have done without, but otherwise, it was the classic flavors that everyone knows and loves! Who doesn't love a tootsie pop  4 5
Like a number of other reviewers, we use canned pumpkin as a dietary supplement for our dogs. As a result, we go through a lot of it. We usually use the Libby's brand which is readily available in our grocery store, but due to flooding of last year's crop it has been out of stock for a few months. Luckily the organic growers did not have the same problem. I find this product to be more finely pureed than the Libby's so it seems a bit runnier. However, my dogs love it. The only minor disadvantage is the cost. It is more expensive than the Libby's, plus I'm paying to have it shipped now vs. picking it up at the store.<br /><br />A number of other Amazon customers have complained about receiving badly dented cans. Mine arrived 100% intact. This may be a result of the unconventional courier used. It appeared to be some sort of private delivery service though I paid for the standard service. A man hand delivered the item to my house using what appeared to be his ordinary Chrysler Pacifica minivan. I've never seen an item delivered this way by Amazon or anybody before. A workable alternative to Libby's pumpkin during their shortage.  4 3
This is a great snack item. It's delicious and even better when warmed. Perfect with that morning cup of coffee. It's just like a pastry. Delicious snack for when you're "on the go...".  4 5
Nice storage drawer..matches nicely in my kitchen...only drawback is I can't store it under the coffee maker due to not be able to open the keurig dispenser so I store it under my toaster.  Other than that it's really nice. I wished it fit under the coffee pot...  4 5
I have been happy with the quality of this food as well as delivery time & speed. The cats tried tearing into this bag before their old food is gone yet. They really like this food. Cats like this food  4 5
My cats love this brand of food, especially the salmon and turkey flavors. However, they leave the peas and carrots behind. Which makes me feel like I'm not getting my money's worth! However, I've started squishing the carrots into the food, and they seem to be leaving less in their bowls. After trying many brands of canned foods, this is one of the few that they eagerly eat, and it doesn't smell as bad as some. My cats love this brand of canned food, but....  4 3
i have been clean and sober almost 23 yrs. and never got into energy drinks but the local wal mart was giving free samples, small cups so i took one, i felt kind of tired but after drinking just a small cup, felt 'great' body and mind so, i bought a 3 pack. 4.88, they only have grape and i've never liked grape, anything but it was o.k. but kind of expensive for 3 drinks but i figured if that tiny cup made me feel, 'that' good, each tube would last me a while.  i gave 4 stars because in my experience, when it gets too 'hot', the tube,  on two occasions, i put one in my pocket, pulled it out later to pour into a cold bottle of water and even though i poured some of the water out of the bottle, it FIZZED UP AND OUT and made a mess, i think the GOOD STUFF gets lost when this happens, has only happened when it was hot and i did not feel ANYthing after, NO ZIPP, like it all came out.  i am going to try just drinking the amount i drank in the 'sample cup' maybe drinking the whole tube, is too much for me becasue i noticed i get almost wired and that's something i don't want to be, any more, just feel 'good' first energy drink i've tried  4 2
An average formula.  I would compare it to the same quality as other Store brands on the market.  It mixed well, and my son did not have any adverse reactions to it. I would buy it again, at the right price.  I paid $7.00 for it. Just fine  4 3
I have used this in coffee, oatmeal and yogurt and it has a good toffee flavor.  However, it is not as sweet as other stevia products; I find myself using a squirt of it instead of "just a few drops" as it says in the description.  I would still recommend it though because it is a lot less expensive than other stevia flavorings I have found. Good flavor but not as sweet as I thought  4 3
The local auto shop offers this free to it customers. I've tried it twice and liked it both times. Perhaps, if I had to pay for it, I might not love the price, but I would still enjoy the flavor. Quick, Easy and Tasty  4 5
We really like Tully's Kona Blend in the K-Cups!  It's hard to find inexpensive 100% Kona coffee anywhere, so I usually order the K-Cup blends that are available either on Amazon, or at our local commissary, because I really love the unique flavor and aroma of Kona.<br /><br />I think that Tully's is a quality brand of coffee in general, but the Kona is my favorite.  It's delicious: rich, smooth, nutty, the flavor and aroma make a great start to my day.<br /><br />Definitely recommend! Good Kona coffee blend  4 5
I purchased this storage drawer so that I could better organize my mass of K-Cups. It currently sits underneath my Keurig. It looks very nice and does what it is supposed to. It is a simple design and while it doesn't save a lot of room, it doesn't take up much room either. Very stylish  4 5
I picked up a bag of these in NYC and ate them on the train home. I liked the flavor a lot, and the fact that they have less guilt in them than other options like potato chips. When I got home, I could not find these in CT, so I bought a case on Amazon. I have shared several of the bags with friends and everyone loves them. I highly recommend these chips (if you must have chips, that is!!!) Good snacking option  4 5
The dark chocolate flavor of this NEWMAN'S OWN ORGANICS DARK CHOCOLATE BAR is mild, compared to dark chocolate bars manufactured by specialty candy makers (for example, See's Candies).  But the flavor is quite good, especially for a "commercial" candy bar designed for general sale in grocery stores.  Unlike many health food store "organic" products, this "organic" chocolate bar leaves no unpleasant aftertaste.<br /><br />The bar (approximately 2.5" x 4.5") breaks into six large snack pieces. One bar (one serving) weighs 64 grams, has 330 calories (200 fat calories), and 22 grams total fat.  There are 5 grams sodium, 37 grams carbohydrates, 4 grams fiber, 28 grams sugar, and 3 grams protein.<br /><br />The label warns that the bar is manufactured on equipment that may have been used to process other products containing peanuts, other nuts, milk powder, wheat, soy and egg (although the bar itself contains none of these).  The bar is 54% cocoa (Rainforest Alliance Certified).<br /><br />Because I'm a big fan of "Newman's Own" products, I was eager to try this offering from the "Newman's Own Organics" line.  It did not disappoint. Tastes Like Chocolate, Not Like "Health Food"  4 3
Key lime pie is one of my all-time favorite desserts. When I heard about this gum I was definitely a skeptic, I figured it'd taste more like just a standard, citrus-y/mint gum. I was wrong! This definitely tastes like real key-lime pie filling: actual key-lime flavor with a milk-sweet taste that's not too overpowering. The flavor actually lasts for quite a while too (though it's much more powerful within the first 5 minutes). Try it! Tastes like the real thing!  5 4
I've ordered these maybe 4 times now. I see a lot of comments talking about how they burst open during shipping. The most recent shipment I got had maybe 1 or two burst open, not hard to clean.<br /><br />This is a great price, shelf stable and tastes just like the dairy french vanilla creamer. I would highly recommend it- I'm addicted. This is great to take to work and it makes others jealous! I'm ordering more...  5 4
This is something I was looking for the office. They were affordable and great taste! They arrive on time too! Happy!  5 4
This was a new product to me.  They were very tasty, crisp, and surprisingly delicious.  I was very pleased with this product. Delicious  5 4
I'm a sucker for caramel anything.........love the flavor, the aroma, and most important the taste.  I honestly do not like flavored coffees in the morning, but I have made an exception for this one! wonderful flavored coffee  5 4
I like this coffee. It smells good while brewing and tastes as good as it smells. for a decaf coffee it is very good<br />will definitely buy this at my local store. very good coffee  5 4
I use this product daily, and it provides a steady stream of energy.  I do not get jittery or crash.  It also helps me practice portion control because it acts as a slight appetite suppressant. Great energy drink without artificial ingredients  5 4
After years of being unable to eat butter due to dairy sensitivities, we were delighted to discover Pure Indian Foods Organic Ghee. Not only is it packed with nutrition, it gives us the opportunity to enjoy the taste of a much missed staple. Apparently, according to Nourishing Traditions proponents,  it aids in digestion, as well. Although ghee is often compared to theater popcorn butter, we have found the taste of this ghee in particular to be much milder and natural tasting. We will definitely keep this stocked! Great Dairy Replacement  5 4
Put simply this is a brilliant piece of kit... does exactly what it says on the tin... converts any XLR mic to USB  - including phantom power supply.<br /><br />We have an Neuman professional condenser mic here at Blockhouse tv and I kid you not  - it sounds amazing with this piece of kit.  Have plugged into our mac and thrown the signal into Audacity and/or Final Cut pro and it sounds the business - no hum, noise, clicks or pop. We use it to voice the children's animation DVD series; Jack and Holly.  Both the actors and the tech staff find it a really easy and portable set-up to use. OK - looks aren't great - and it's plastic - but I don't really give a monkey's about that - all I care about is the signal to noise ratio, the sound quality and can it power our very expensive mics?  The answer is - yes it can.  We say buy!<br /><br /> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004AM5PZ4">Jack and Holly's Christmas Countdown (US Format)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00439GWTM">Jack and Holly's Christmas Countdown (European format)DVD </a> the business  5 4

Kombu is a wonderful energizer, especially during the summer and in the cold and flu season.<br /><br />Drop one strip into boiling water for 2 to 3 minutes, remove and cut into smaller pieces.  Add to 6 cups of water, then add 12 teaspoons of shiro Miso (mild white miso), heat and stir until miso dissolves.  Avoid boiling the ingredients. Add cubed tofu (soft is best), spinach or swiss chard cut into thin strips, shiitake mushrooms cut in thin strips and scallions thinly cut including the green part (reserve half for soup garnish). Heat, but do not boil, for about 10 minutes.  Servie with a splash of soy sauce for a little extra flavor.<br /><br />The Kombu has a very mild flavor and best if not overcooked or over softened.  Great for vegans and better than chicken soup!<br /><br />Enjoy ! Great Seaweed !  5 4
I enjoy a good cup of Hot Cocoa on occasion, and this is "good stuff"!!  Not only that but in a time where prices are out of control on K-cups, this product is very reasonable in price. Good Cocoa - GREAT price  5 4
I prepare these baked potatoes in a toaster oven. They are the perfect compliment to a hamburger, steak or chicken entree. Try them. You'll like them! Taters ...  5 4
I was very excited when I received a Keurig coffee maker as a Christmas present, & couldn't wait to put it to use.  However, in the three months since I've had it, I have struggled to find what I think is a good cup of coffee.  Most of the brands I've tried have either been too weak or too strong.<br /><br />I am not a "Starbucks" kind of coffee drinker, or fan of fancy flavored coffees.  I just like a regular cup of coffee that smells good when it's brewing, & tastes smooth when I drink it.  Finally, just like Goldilocks said, this one is "just right". What I've Been Looking For  5 4
I love this product! I make all my own baby food and this makes the perfect portion size.  A bit pricy but worth it. great product  5 4
I really like this protein drink. I'm pregnant and trying to increase protein in my diet without adding a whole lot of extra calories or fat. This is the perfect solution. I usually mix it with a combination of 1/2 plain almond milk and half water. I also usually add a little more liquid than it says in the directions, otherwise I find it too sweet. The nice thing is that it is sweetened with stevia instead of a calorie-filled sugar of some sort. I prefer egg protein to other proteins because soy is often GMO and not recommended in high doses in pregnancy (or for anyone actually), and whey protein is a dairy product, which I generally don't tolerate well. Egg protein is perfect for my needs. Low calorie, high protein, great taste  5 4
This orchid arrived in good shape.  I was a little skeptical as to the "blooming size," but they were right...it bloomed 9 months after arriving, with 3 big, beautiful blooms...not bad for a first-time bloomer.  And the colors are outstanding! Lovely orchid  5 4
I ordered these to use for marathon training. I have a sensitive stomach,but have had no problems with these. They do give me energy during those long runs! TASTES GREAT  5 4
The first thing you notice when you open up your package is the intensely delicious smell of vanilla.  The package is vacuum sealed, but the smell still leaks out.  These beans are a great deal!  I think I got about 28-32 pods in my bag and was able to make good use of them.  They (as previously mentioned) have a wonderful smell and great flavor.  It is really hard to find a better deal out there. Great deal for a good product  5 4
I tend to get upset stomach/nausea in the evennings. This NEVER fails to make me feel better. I love it. They don't sell it at stores in my area anymore, so I was fine with buying a case of it! Works Great!  5 4
When I recently started using K-cups, wasn't sure that the quality or the intensity would be up to par.  I wound up trying many of the standard k-cups which for the most part were ok but not great.  The Barista Prima French Roast is well worth trying.  Very intense and flavorful. No more concerns about throwing away my old coffee pot. Finally, a coffee that makes K-cups worth converting to!  5 3
Trying to eat a healthy breakfast, but also don't have time? Me, too! This oatmeal is perfect - organic, quick, and delicious. Yum!  5 4
I found this tea by accident but it worked so well that i later ordered it,<br /><br />after not being able to find it again.  It really helps open nasal passages.<br /><br />Since starting to use it whenever I have bad nasal congestion, I have not<br /><br />had a sinus infection.  Everyone is different, but it sure worked for me. Sinus Help  5 4

This was purchased as a game for my thirteen-year-old daughter's Harry Potter themed get-together to celebrate the release of the final movie.  The jelly bean game is loads of hysterical fun, and fit very well with our theme.  :) Really Cool Game!  5 4
This coffee proved to be a really nice treat.  I read the reviews, but gave it modest hope based on pricing. That proved to be a mistake.  The beans are dark and oily and very fragrant.  I used my burr grinder and had to poke at it several times so that the beans did not jam due to their oiliness.  I drink my coffee black with nothing in it, and this made a rich wonderful cup, with no bitterness.  My husband and I went through the 5lbs quickly.  I always have several kinds of coffee from which to choose, and found myself turning to this one more than not.  I'm back for my second bag, and trying more from this brand. NICE SURPRISE  5 4

I love this product! BUT the downside is that I was overcharged. When I saw that the cost of this product was $10.00 I assumed that it meant $10.00 for a case. When I received only one can, I was stunned to say the least. A few days ago I happened upon this product at a grocery store. The 8.1 oz was $1.29. I am hereby requesting my change back!!!!!!  Rumford is one of the best baking powders presently on the market!!!  I like the fact that it's aluminum free.  Hence, I will be purchasing this product from the grocery store. Stunned  5 1
We lived in Charleston for years and always loved the availability of fresh seafood - especially oysters!  Now we live about 24 hours away and I do miss being able to swing by the seafood market when I'm in the mood.  I had no idea that I could have it delivered to my doorstep within a couple of days!  It was well packed and smelled as fresh as if we bought it off the boat.  Impress your friends and throw together an oyster pasta dish.  SO much better than the stuff in the small plastic containers at the grocery store!  These were HUGE. Fresh as it gets!  5 4
I did NOT expect this gum to be more than just your typical "lime" flavored "candy" type taste. But I was floored. This gum literally tastes like key lime pie. I swear I can even taste a graham cracker crust. The flavor only lasts a short time, but it's an amazing taste! Floored! Shocked! So Amazing!  5 2
It was a bit of a risk to order this, I mean what are you going to do with 2 boxes of kcups that taste terrible? But this was delish, the flavor was really good, and it was still awesome after it had cooled down. It has a coconutty, vanilla flavor, very nice!! LOVE IT!  5 4
After getting used to using product where I live, and with everyone else using it they would run out witin 2 days.  so, now when thry run out, I have my own. You should see the looks on their faces when I still have some.... Vanilla coffe creme  5 4
Caramilk bars are soooo good.  One of the pleasures of visiting Canada is getting yourself these Caramilk bars.  Along with Aero and Kit-kat, they are top of the line!<br /><br />If you happen to have read the article from the Food/Dining section of the New York Times, dated July 11, 2007, you will agree that British chocolates (and their commonwealth brethren) are da best! Yummy - better than the best American chocolate  5 4
I bought this product because my dogs were having accidents in the laundry room overnight.  I'm not sure how or why this works...but it stopped them from peeing.  The dogs love em too. stopped doggie accidents  5 1
My daughter will start school this fall and i was concerned about lunches and fruit-to-go choices. We've bought several different fruit pouches at a local organic store and she and I loved these the most. It it not overly sweet (and a strawberry variation as well), tastes really good. She can easily eat 2 of these every day.<br />I really like the fact that it has no sugar and color added + it is organic. Just fruit puree.<br /><br />I, personally, don't like banana variation, but it's just because of my own personal preferences (i like fresh bananas more than cooked), other than that, my daughter approved all of flavors to 10 stars. Great idea! Yummy product!  5 4
This coffee is the best I have ever had.  If you like good coffee you should try it.  I mix it with another coffee that is not as strong but the results are wonderful. Good Coffee  5 4
Arrives always in about 4 days. It is more convenient and cheaper than the store. Recommended!! Great service too. My Dachshund love it! My Dachshund love it!  5 4
I hardly ever write reviews but this tea is quite excellent.  I decided to try it without any sweetener or any other added taste enhancers.  It is flavorful without being overpowering.  It is a great pleasure to have a fine tea like this loose and reasonably priced.  After the first try I have continued to drink it just as it comes.  You can see by the leaves once they are soaked that it is a premium tea. Great Tea  5 4
These Albanese gummi bears and rings and so on are very good and tasty and high quality. The bears even have little faces. At my local candy store this type of gummi stuff (bears, rings, snakes, balls, worms, whatever) are about $10/lb. These twin packs of 4.5 or 5 pound bags is a screaming deal as far as I'm concerned. I'm probably 50 pounds deep in these friggin' things. Consumed! Great Gummi!  5 4
If you are trying to eat healthy (like me), but love junk food (like me), these are the chips for you.  I have given up potato chips and french fries in my quest to eat guilt free, but a sandwich just needs something on the side. These chips add a great crunch as a side to a sandwich, and are a great snack for only 100 calories. They have no preservatives, no artificial flavors or colors, no cholesterol, 0 grams saturated fat, o grams trans fat, and are gluten free. Ingredients are potato flakes, potato starch, safflower oil and/or sunflower oil, rice flour, sea salt. They would be great to pack in a school lunch or for an after school snack. I ordered them on the subscription plan, a case a month, but might have to add an extra shipment. Everyone I have given a pack to loved them too and came back for more. Good chips and not bad for you  5 4
Its great to be able to get sugar this way.Its not good to eat but if you are going to use sugar at least this is not processed to an unhealthy state on top of what sugar does to your body,and i am helping the  fair trade farmers.It is a good thing all around.I am happy i can get it in Amazon. Eco sugar  5 4
I bought this juice because I really like mangoes. It is great refreshing and smooth beverage that everybody in our family enjoy. Will buy again. Nice, sweet mango  5 4
I love these so much I'd give them a 10-star.  I love them so much I have an Amazon subscription so they get mailed to me regularly.  I discovered them at Henry's but they're the only cracker on the shelf that are always sold out so when I saw the 10 pack here I was so happy.<br /><br />I eat them as a bread substitute with everything!  Can't go wrong with the calories and they don't have a strong flavor to mask the food so really they can be eaten however way you like.  Endless possibilities ... Goes with everything  5 4
These are my favorite, but they aren't for everybody. In a way, they sort of taste like Oriental flavor ramen, but with a kick. For me, how can one go wrong with the combination of jalapeno and ginger? They are a bit rich, so they aren't for EveryDayForAMonth snacking. Because this is a case purchase, I recommend trying out a single bag before buying an entire case. The 2oz size seems to be no longer available, which is a shame; I can eat the entire 5oz bag.

For some reason, the stores around me stopped having these.  I use this type of bag for a few things in my life: camping gear (sleeping bag, hammock/tent) is able to breathe without being all over the place, storage of down comforter during summer, etc.  Then I got the great idea of using them for my recycling.  What a change in life this has been.  For three years, we've had to take moldy cans to the recycle center to redeem all our beer cans for the 5  apiece.  The little sips of beer in each can accumulate, and get trapped in a plastic bag, so I took my recycle cans and drilled holes in the bottom for drainage, then I line them with these bad boys.  The beer leaks right out, and when they're full, they're dry and while they smell slightly of stale beer, the change to that from stale wet beer and mold is incredible.<br /><br />Would I trust them for laundry?  Probably not if I had to carry it any distance.  They're mesh bags.  Going up or down stair or across the house is probably not a big deal.  Since I don't have machines, I wait until the last possible minute to do my laundry, so these bags would be totally and utterly full, stretching the mesh past its abilities, and would probably rip on the first or second go.  If you're smarter than me, though, and do your laundry in a reasonable amount of time, or don't have to leave your house/complex to do it, they'd probably be fine. Exactly what I needed  5 3
On the first offer my ferret didn't want the treat. But a couple of days later I noticed him trying to steal the whole bag, so I offered a piece again. This time, and ever since, he's loved it. Go figure!<br /><br />I like this treat for ferrets because the pieces are appropriately sized (ie- small) for a ferret, and the ingredients and stats are superior to most ferret treats! His digestion has been less affected by these than by many ferret treats also :) Great for ferrets too!  5 4
I've been using this "low acid" coffee for a few weeks now and along with the taste, I enjoy not having an "acid stomach", especially the "morning after".  To me, there is no difference in taste between it and regular coffee.<br /><br />I give it 5 stars. DELICIOUS  5 4
Great flavor and love the texture too, but don't overpay.... $8.99 is crazy. The product can be found for much less. Wow  5 4
These anchovies are excellent; nothing like the salty, fishy cousins packed in oil available on a grocers shelf. Instead the taste has depth and character, somewhat like a sardine but with a little more bite. The drawback here is that you must scrape the skin off and "filet" the little fishes, worth the effort in my opinion. These are anchovies?  5 3
I tried both these and just the plain shirataki noodles with zero calories purchased at my local Asian market and I prefer these the best. The plain Shirataki feel like a noodle shaped gummie candy when you eat them...not as hard but too 'slippery'..The House Brand with tofu didn't have that same 'slippery' taste. I didnt find preperation to be that bothersome as a couple of posters have mentioned. I just open them and pour them in a strainer and let the water run over them throughly, flipping them once or twice to get them rinsed well then I toss them in a pan of boiling water for about 15 seconds (they're already cooked) drain and season them however I wish. They have been a great addition to my low calorie diet. I just tried them last night with a packet of seasoning from a box of Suddenly Salad (classic) and I was in heaven...40 calories for the WHOLE bag! Im impressed!  5 4
I spent along time and a lot of money looking for a great Earl Grey... to this point its been loose leaf tea i order from another site until my girl friend went to London with her family bring me back a small sample pack of 10 tea bags. i loved it so much i had gotten this 6 pack of 20 count boxes which i have polished off and reordered since then.<br /><br />The tea stays fresh in the foil package each tea bag  which makes it so air and light cant damage the flavor of the tea which is the problem is loose leaf tea's.<br /><br />The flavor of the tea is a nice Bergamot flavor which is smooth no matter how long you leave the tea in. i perfer mine strong and straight up. each sit is as good as the first. i will keep buying this tea and also try other ones by ahmad of London love for earl grey  5 4
This is a great tasting product!! Both me and my wife love it. I don't know how they did it but it is wonderful. For when you forget the actual bacon  5 4
I wasn't sure about these chips, but thought I would give them a try. These are tasty, crispy chips - and only 100 calories a bag! I like all the flavors included in the variety pack. I definitely will buy again. Better than expected  5 4
Rosamonte Especial can never let you down. Tastes fresh and strong. I smell Argentina in every sip. Yerba mate is going through an increase in prices, almost double..crazy. But it's worth the value. I will never change Rosamonte ESPECIAL! Always good  5 4
I've been gluten-free for a little over a year and I've struggled with finding tasty and affordable alternatives to my favorite foods. The great thing about this mix is that it's really easy to make, affordable, and the pancakes are so tasty, my children do not object to eating them--saving me the time of making two batches of pancakes. If they didn't see me eating them, I don't even think my kids would notice that they are eating gluten-free pancakes. Easy and Tasty  5 4
I love this stuff!  This is my favorite of the flavors I have tried.  I do feel like I have to add quite a bit of chocolate powder to get it to the flavor that I like, but that is okay.  I'd take this over any of the other stuff any day.  Swiss Miss is for the kids and this stuff is for me.  My husband loved the milk chocolate...until he tried the amaretto.  I just stick with this because I haven't found that I like the others as much.  Even though I don't like the others as much, all of the Stephen's cocoa that I have tried is the richest out there.  It doesn't taste like I mixed it with water at all. Yuh-uh-um  5 3
This brownie mix doesn't bake at 7000 feet altitude, but it works super well as chocolate/chocolate chip cookies. Makes 24. great as cookies  5 4
Few things are as enjoyable in life as freshly popped pork rinds.  Modern technology has enabled us to produce the epitome of snack foods in a hot, fresh version.  I will be relegated no more to the listless depths of popped corn.  Pork rinds are the ultimate man chips. Very similar to microwaved popcorn, you just shake the bag and put em in your microwave for about 2 min and voila, hot fresh pork rinds.  When you pop them you have to get accustomed to the fact that they don't "pop" like popcorn - they just crackle a bit.  So it is a bit hard to tell when they are done and usually through trial and error you will get the perfect time depending upon the type of microwave oven you use.  Mine is 900W and takes just under 2 min. A couple of pieces will get burnt, or as I affectionately refer to as char. The bag will inflate slightly.  When they are done, you open it up and you are greeted with an aroma that is bacon heaven.  Put one in your mouth right away and it will stick to your tongue like a live octopus.  They are a bit salty so they make the perfect accompaniment to a nice cold beer.  I didn't find them too spicy, just enough.  If you want to be creative, you can throw em in a bowl right after they are done popping and throw some salsa verde or any other kind of salsa you have.  You will be greeted with a chorus of wonderful snaps like getting sizzling rice soup at a Chinese restaurant.  Throw on some shredded cheese and the result is "man nachos".  My wife thinks that it is utterly disgusting, even though that hasn't stopped her from eating them.  Trust me, they are delicious, but don't let em sit too long or they get soggy.
