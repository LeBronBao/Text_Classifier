i ordered this november 17 it is now dec 19, im still waiting for it. dont know if i will get it or not still waiting for product 2 3 
Tried these on our two Schnauzers----they were impressed!  These are rather large biscuits that are made to break in half which makes them a perfect size for a snack or reward.  They have a good crunch which I think is good for dental health.  Anyway, I have a box of Alpo Variety Snacks and a box of Milk Bone Flavor Snacks to which I compared ingredients.  They both have artificial color, Alpo lists animal digest, whatever that is, while Milk Bone won the contest with all of those ingredients that no one can pronounce.  I would list what makes up all three but think it would not be too interesting and you probably have at least one of the listed brands if you give your pet treats.<br />What sets the Newman's Own apart is the simple list of Organic ingredients including lamb, carrots, apples, molasses, barley and tocopherols for Vitamin E.  It is made in New Zealand where they raise a lot of lamb, so this seems just the perfect place. The bottom line is our dogs think Pa and Nell Newman have a great product and would highly recommend it to their four legged friends.  Life could not be better than living with happy dogs.  So, on their input I must give this product a five star rating. Schnauzer Recommended! 5 4 
I have fine, medium length hair and normally use a very mild shampoo that cleans well without drying my hair out, followed by a good Rinse-Out conditioner. My favorite shampoos are Paul Mitchell's Shampoo One and Pantene Pro-V for Fine Hair Volume Shampoo. They wash really clean and leave my hair nice and bouncy. I couldn't wait to try this New CLEAR Scalp and Hair Therapy Volumizing Root Boost Shampoo. What everyone wants, who has fine hair, is body at the roots. They list a lot of vitamins in this shampoo for your scalp that sound great too.<br /><br />When this New CLEAR Scalp and Hair Therapy Volumizing Root Boost Shampoo arrived it was sealed in a plastic bag inside of a bubble wrap envelope. The bag was soaked through in both the bubble envelope and the inner plastic sealed bag. When I opened it up to see what was the problem- the cap is so poorly designed that it leaks at the seal. The flip top was not opened, it literally leaks at the seal, where the bottle connects to the cap. I can't even begin to tell you about the strong smell of this shampoo. It is overwhelming and so perfumey, it's really hard to take. I ignored this poorly designed bottle and the strong perfume smell and went on to try the product, as sometimes shampoo smells are milder when you rinse them out of your hair.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed is that the shampoo is a really thick pink cream- not like my see through completely clear Shampoo One or completely clear see through Pantene for Fine hair. This should have been a dead give away that this shampoo is not good for fine hair, as my hairdresser said if you can't see through the shampoo- it's NOT for Fine hair. I tried the shampoo and it hardly foams up, but lays on your hair, coating it really thick. It doesn't rinse out well, leaving my hair greasy, yet my hair dried frizzy and felt dried out at the scalp. This is without a doubt the strangest shampoo I've ever used- how can a cream leave your hair and scalp dry and frizzy? The smell was not as overwhelming when the shampoo was rinsed out- but still not a pleasant smell. I couldn't wait to wash my hair again with my Pantene and get this strange drying cream out of my hair. If you have Fine hair- I would not recommend this shampoo- it was one of the worst shampoos I've ever tried. Super Drying, Strong Smell, Poor Cap Design 1 3 
The product is a good value for the amount you get, however it is way too salty.  The product is very dry and firm.  I think this would be good if they cut the salt content in half. Salt Lick 2 3 
I made Chai tea - as well as a home made chai ice cream and just a chai milk without the tea + cloves, star anise and a few other spices.  But you have to have the cardamom pods and these were wonderful. Beautiful Aroma! 5 4 
The dog loves these treats. But why is this particular package size not sealed? All other size packages of this product are strongly sealed, so that a plastic rib must be torn off to remove the lid. At least some tape could be used around the lid on this size. Please consider doing something to provide assurance against tampering. dog treats - beef liver 4 3 
Good. Exactly as advertised. I was surprised that not a single one broke open during shipping, so A+ on the durability of each individual packet.<br /><br />Be warned though, that these creamers are not very sweet. Very Good 5 4 
I bought a 2-pack of the orange flavor 5 hour energy drink at Wal-Mart.  I tried one bottle in the afternoon, the other 2 days later in the morning.  I drank the whole bottle, but saw no real change.  I don't drink coffee, so I can't imagine I have made myself insensitive to caffeine.<br /><br />The orange flavor tasted fine though.  Kind of like orange drink in elementary school.  It sounds like other reviewers don't like the berry or lemon-lime. No effect for me 1 2 
This is suppose to be a "healthy" snack. Then they shouldn't sneak artificial sweeteners in. I do like the taste, but I'm going to have to go with another flavor. I got the applewood also and it looks like it doesn't have sucralose. So just be aware that different flavors will have different ingredients. Has Sucralose!!! 1 3 
I tried this illy issimo Caff&egrave; Italian Espresso Style coffee drink for a quick energy lift after lunch. The drink is made in Denmark (not Italy) and distributed by the Coca-Cola Co.<br /><br />Likes:<br />>The AL can chilled quickly (1.5 hrs) in the fridge OR pour in a glass and heat it up in the microwave.<br />>Richer taste of Arabica coffee than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEVJRY">illy issimo Coffee Drink, Cappuccino, 8.45-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> without the fat and cholesterol (from lowfat milk).<br />>Per 6.8oz. can: 10g sugar, 0mg cholesterol & fat, and only 50 calories.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />>Each 6.8oz. can contains: 155mg caffeine and 20mg sodium.  Not bad but for those who are very sensitive to caffeine, even 155mg could cause an extra hour or two of insomnia (happened to me, drank it around 2PM, stayed up until 2AM).<br />>Easy to exceed the maximum daily intake of 500mg caffeine (as recommended by physicians) with just three to four cans.<br />>Competitively priced at $2.01 per 6.8oz can (12-pack) but costs can add up quickly for heavy coffee drinkers.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br />Tasty drink for an occasional energy boost but not recommended for people sensitive to or trying to minimize caffeine intake.  Give it a try, some may enjoy the flavor and couldn't care less about the 155mg caffeine; make your own informed decision! Worthy entry into the crowded Energy Drink market. 3 4 
I know these are super trendy right now, and I totally wanted to love this product (or, to be more exact, I wanted my toddler to love this product). He took one taste, handed it back to me, and said, "Why you gave me baby food, mom?" I tasted it, and he is right. It tastes just like jarred baby food. Same consistency (not any thicker), too. If your kid likes the packaging, great. If your kid doesn't, then it is just really, really expensive baby food. I'm going to give the rest to my baby, as the toddler is not the least bit interested. Glorified baby food 3 2 
This little can (6.8 oz.)of coffee drink has the flavor of espresso with a not-too-sweet note.  There is nothing artificial-tasting about it, as is often found in other energy boost drinks.  With 155 mg. of caffeine, it contains almost double the jolt in a 7 oz. brewed cup of coffee.  This one's not for sissies.<br /><br />Please note that, with 10 grams of sugar and 12 grams of carbohydrate, it may not be for those on sugar/carbohydrate restricted intake. Other than that, it contains nothing to deem it unhealthy.  It even has no preservatives. (I wonder what this drink might taste like if it were artificially sweetened and have no carbohydrates.)<br /><br />I enjoyed it ice cold straight from the can.  This tastes every bit as good as the Starbucks bottled coffee drinks.  I would not hesitate to choose the Illy brand over the other one.<br /><br />Coca Cola produces it in Atlanta, Georgia under a licensing agreement and it is a product of Denmark. True Expresso Flavor 4 3 
I love Lady Finger popcorn.  It has so much flavor. It's a million times better than microwave popcorn and a thousand times better than the popcorn in the super-market.<br /><br />Warning....Once you have the good stuff, you'll never want to eat regular popcorn again. Yummy 4 5 
This product is tastey but it is not "Crunchy" so I'm not sure where they got the name.  If you are looking for a freeze-dried crunchy strawberry you will have to get Cereal Toppers which I don't think are offered on Amazon.  These Crunchies are good on cereal with milk.  My four year old likes them but I'm not crazy about the soft texture.  Just Tomatoes brand has dried stawberries on this website that are better. Crunchies are not crunchy 2 3 
My wife lived in London for three years and developed a variety of British tastes. One such item was for rice pudding or creamed rice. Not too long ago I spotted Ambrosia Creamed rice (in 15-ounce cans) on the shelves of my local Fresh and Easy Store (a British company). Well, I just had to try it.<br /><br />Creamed rice is not bad. It's rather bland for my tastes and perhaps it's meant to go with certain types of food.. It's low in fat and sodium and not particularly high in calories, so I don't feel guilty at all.I prefer it chilled. It's smooth and creamy and I'd judge it to be a good product. But, it might take me a while to develop a taste for it. Right for the moment, I find it overly bland.<br /><br />Gary Peterson A Good Product, But Rather Bland. 4 3 
+Really really tasty<br />+Much healthier than almost every other potato chip<br />+A variety of flavors, consider this a huge sampler<br /><br />-Sea Salt & Vinegar is crazy sour. Personally, I think they overdid it on the vinegar.<br />-It's hard to stop at one serving, but I take this as a sign of a good snack :P New favorite munchies, found! 5 4 
Beef might be listed as the first ingredient but that hardly makes it the main ingredient.  After reading the ingredients list this "food" seems to be mostly made up of various forms of soy.  I am not a fan of soy & with all the GMO crap being pushed on us, I like it even less.<br /><br />Upon presenting this artificially flavored & dyed product to my fur babies, they started to eat up.  But then one by one they stopped & looked at me as if to say, "What is this crap?  We don't want this.  Where's the stuff you normally give us?"  I left the food for them.  Several hours later, the food was still in the bowl & a disgusting explosion of black runny vomit was all over everything.  Jerk that I am, I continued to try to get them to eat it.  After all, I have a review to do - that's how I ended up with the food in the first place.  After several days I gave up.  One of my babies simply stopped eating.  That was the final straw.  I am not torturing my pets any longer.  They are back on their usual grub. No more black vomit.  Everyone is once again eating until the bowls are empty & my furbabies are back to their joyful behavior. Garbage 1 2 
If you love mayo and a touch of black pepper then this is not for you. You are better off with just your regular mayo and adding your own sprinkle of pepper. This stuff is downright hot. There is so much pepper that you can not taste the mayo. The mayo flavor is lost even if you only use a little bit of it. However some like it hot, so they may fall in love with it. It was too strong for me. Pepper overwhelms the mayo taste. 1 2 
My husband had purchased this product, as a single bottle, at our local supermarket for $5.99. I love pepper on my foods. The flavor of the three different peppercorns in one grinder adds a nice and tasty "ping" to your foods, meats, poultry, seafood, salads. Buying it here was so much more economical. Great stuff!! 4 5 
I finally found my most favorite cookies through a dealer on Amazon.  After waiting nearly 4 weeks for them to arrive I finally contacted Amazon to let them know that I still had not received the cookies I ordered.  Two days later the cookies arrived - where they went before reaching me is still a mystery.  But I was happy to finally have them as I can't get them in Southern California.  The minimum order was 4 packages and that was okay, I would freeze some for later.  Much to my dismay the supplier just put the four bags of cookies and a box with NO packing to protect them.  So you guessed it....almost all of the cookies were broken into crumbs:  And to top it off the cookies "best if eaten by date" was only 2 days after I received them!  Needless to say these must have been sitting in a warehouse for quite some time.  After contacting Amazon I was able to get a refund for my crushed cookies.  Oh well, maybe I will try again by ordering with Amazon through a different vendor. Thank you Amazon - you were great. Chocolate Chip Coconut Cookies not so yummy - but Amazon was great! 1 2 
I've never had Sunchy Malta before (I drank a lot of Goya when it was available locally). Tastes similar to Goya, though with less of a sour taste and slightly less carbonation.<br /><br />I ordered 50 bottles in order to get free shipping. Said bottles arrived in 4 large boxes, with each bottle individually packed. None broke. At the time of purchase, this was the best deal going for Malta either locally or in stores (I've never paid less than fifty cents anywhere).<br /><br />Now, though, the free shipping is gone. Unless  Sunchy seriously expects me to drop $7.50 for shipping per bottle, it's unlikely I'll be buying anymore. They should consider selling by the pack or case if they wish to pursue the online business model.<br /><br />So, 5 stars for value and the quality of packing, with the caveat that I won't be buying any more until Sunchy figures out how to sell it. Good Malta, baffling business model 5 4 
I love annie chun but this particular soup just does not do it for me personally, however you may love it. The soup has a very unusual taste. I really wanted to like this soup but I will stick to the other flavors that I love. didn't like it 1 2 
These chips taste great. I use them mostly as a topping on my garden salads I make at home. They give it a great crunch and sweet taste that makes the salad so much better. They also make a great and healthier snack. Original Seneca Apple Chips 4 5 
As a young guy im concerned with taste and also fiber content. This is high in sugar/carbs but it's entirely justified for the great taste and the high fiber. No other cereal taste this good and is moderately good for you. Other fiber one cereals maybe healthier, but they taste like pinecones and sticks. Sugary but high in fiber 5 4 
My son wouldn't eat it either! I tasted it... I would not eat it, also. Tasteless, unappetizing in texture and  flavor.<br />It says "minimal processing"... does that mean it is not even cooked? No wonder our babies and toddlers hate it!!! I would NEVER knowingly feed my child or myself RAW meat. Cooked? 2 1 
I was thinking this was a nice low calorie snack, but I'm sorry - 38% of your sodium in one little packet is obscene!  Not to mention that it TASTES too salty.  It overpowers any other flavor that this soup might have...  Very disappointing...  They should offer a low sodium option that might be more palatable... SOOOOOOO SALTY!!! 2 1 
Now I can save a trip to the local beachfront and smell the seaweed soaked sand, and maybe even eat a little, each time I open a can of these really beachy smelling and tasting oysters from the good people in Mainland China, where all workers are happy all the time, just like their English radio broadcasts say.  Well, whether it's sand or shell bits that my teeth are grinding on, I'm sure to get some extra minerals that I didn't pay for each time I'm hungry enough to wolf down a can of these little mollusks.<br /><br />Oh, and they come packed in Cottonseed oil.  You know, the oil squeezed right from the seeds of the plant your T-Shirt is made of, and we know how great T-shirts taste!<br /><br />Seriously, what was I thinking?  I suppose I'll finish the package I bought because I abhor wasting food, and there are many in the world who don't even get to eat stuff like this, but I'll never buy this product again. A little bit of beach in every bite! 2 5 
Delicious and easy to make. I make mine with milk and it comes out extra creamy and rich. You can pour boiling water or hot milk onto the cereal to cook it, or you can heat it in the microwave (be careful about if boiling over. I like the Maple Brown sugar just as much as the Cinnamon. Delicious and easy to make 4 5 
The seasoning was very difficult to shake out of container as it appeared to be stuck together. I suspect this product was outdated, although wasn't able to find a an expiration date on the container. Not very happy with this purchase. Very disappointed 2 1 
One of my longtime favorite drinks is a half-and-half combination of club soda and fruit juice. Most fruit juices by themselves are a bit too sweet for me (even the ones without added sugar), and the addition of carbonation just makes the whole thing more agreeable to me. This drink does this for me, and amazingly, they do not add a boatload of sugar. Too many off-the-shelf beverages--even those claiming to be healthful--have way too much sugar (or worse, the cheap corn syrup sugar substitute). These guys give it none of that. It's both tasty and refreshing. This is a product I would actually buy. They got it right 5 4 
This tea really is just an apple cinnamon tea (with no "spice" flavor included).  It is pretty mild and tasty enough but I wish it was a bit stronger (if it were I would have given it 5 stars).  Typically I drink green tea or chai tea so this herbal tea is something new to throw into the mix.  Shipping was fast and the boxes were well packed. Good flavor, but not my favorite tea 4 3 
these are good :) taste almost like the real thing has vanilla inside tastes awesome  you gotta love the poptarts :D i love poptarts :D not bad :) 4 5 
If Amazon offered this on PRIME I would get it all the time.This coupled with the Whole Wheat pizza dough makes an excellent quick pizza and a healthy one too. Yummy Pizza Sauce 4 5 
Received order within 7 business days.  The product received did not have the same label as pictured though the wording was the same.  Also the product did not have the same flavor as the product pictured (which we had bought previously locally).  I suppose the manufacturer has not only changed the label for this product, but also the recipe.  The distributor provided excellent service and we have decided to keep the sauce we received, just have to make our own modifications for our grilled vegetable recipe we have used in the past.  Thanks for another great distributor for the products we like.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5ZFQ">World Harbors Jamican Style Jerk Sauce, 16-Ounce Bottle, (Pack of 6)</a> Great service 4 2 
I ordered regular shipments for the cacao powder and drink cacao daily; the most recent batch was terribly bitter and had a burnt woody flavor and texture.  Clearly there was a change in the quality; I sent an email to the company (they;'re based in Novato, so not far away) and heard nothing back.<br /><br />Not impressed, am looking for a new brand. disappointed in flavor change and company 2 1 
I was out of town when I purchased this item. I can purchase the 4-pak at Wal Mart for $1.48 but it's never in stock. That is all my cats will eat so I just purchased it on Amazon cause I've always saved, especially for free shipping. I paid $30.11 for the 12 4-paks. This is the one time I didn't save, in fact it was outrageous what I paid on Amazon. I will continue to shop Amazon but I need to be more careful. 9-Lives Supper Suoreme 4 3 
way too sweet by itself.<br /><br />however this and a bold coffee makes a pretty good mix.  just do 5oz of this then replace, and do a 5oz of a bold coffee of your choice in the same cup.  then stir. way too sweet by itself.  but makes a good mixer 2 3 
Behind the 12 packets of Via instant coffee, Starbucks placed a brief message, "Never be without." That's a better marketing strategy than, say, "You could do worse." Instant coffee is still instant coffee and no one who starts his or her day with a cup of Joe is about to trade fresh brew or French press for instant.<br /><br />In a pinch, Via is a portable and affordable option.<br /><br />However, I don't recommend Via as a strategy to save money on your coffee bill. A quality coffee press and a thermos will do much better. The 12-packet order currently sells for $8.95 on Amazon, without special offers or subscribe-and-save discounts. That works out to $0.75 per cup, which is about what you'd expect to pay in a standard vending machine. Hands down, Starbucks Via tastes better than anything pouring out of a vending machine. However, each Via stick produces an 8-ounce cup of coffee so, depending which size you normally order, you might spend $1.50 (for 16 ounces) or $2.25 (for 24 ounces).<br /><br />At $0.75 per 8-ounce cup, Starbucks' Via sticks are the same price as SoloBrew's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QTJ70M">French Press To-Go SoloPress</a>, which I also reviewed on Amazon.com. I still recommend both brands as tasty and portable options over the ubiquitous, freeze-dried coffee sold in glass jars.<br /><br />Rating: Four stars. In a pinch, Via is a portable and affordable cup of Joe 4 3 
I really like this product. I have been trying to loose the "last ten pounds" for a few months now. The problem is I am hooked on chocolate. Rather than completely give up on my goal, I have switched to these as a meal replacement. Definitely wish Amazon would get these (and at a reasonable price). They are excellent! Great for a chocolate boost 4 5 
I use this as my morning coffee wake up call.  I continue to re-order it because I like the medium roast flavor. Morning coffee 4 5 
I bought this based on my experience in europe. I figured it was Italian and would taste as much of the coffees did when last I visited Europe, Bold and stout. Also, I was drawn in by the words "La Crema"...meant strong and with much head like a beer I thought.Unfortunately, the coffee was much like a regular, everyday folgers blend, kinda bland and fairly regular. Buy it if you like regular coffee but pass otherwise. Fair to midland 2 3 
My four mixed breed dogs (40lbs-100lbs)gobble up Newman's Own dog treats.  But, these terrific dogs gobble up just about anything (except fresh green leafy vegetables), so perhaps their standards shouldn't be the mark of "goodness".<br /><br />I'm an ingredient list reader for all foods (human & animal), so that is what I did when I received the Newman's pet treats.  The ingredient list is short & consists of the following:<br /><br />Organic Barley, Organic Lamb, Organic Carrots, Organic Apples, Organic Palm Oil (Preserved with Mixed Tocopherois, a Source of Vitamin E), Organic Molasses<br /><br />The treats themselves are rectangular & scored in the middle.  They are 2" x 1-/4" for the full size & 1" x 1-1/4" for the 1/2 size.  They do not have a strong smell, but a hint of apple is noticeable (& a grain smell, which I presume is the barley).  My 10oz bag came with 18 full size treats.<br /><br />I like the rectangular shape of the treat.  Sometimes my large dogs get excited about treats & forget about "nicely".  With the rectangular shape, my hands won't fall victim to an enthusiastic chomp.  Since the treats are scored down the middle, I can break them down, so my older, smaller dogs can easily eat the treat.<br /><br />Overall, I think the ingredients are excellent for a dog treat, and it is nice that they are adaptable for different sized dogs. Tail Wagging Treats! 5 3 
My husband enjoyed this coffee. We usually use Newman's Extra Bold but thought we<br />would try something different. It was a bit too strong for me; I prefer Newman's. But it was<br />still good. A bit too strong for me 4 3 
This stuff is really gross - I tried the lemon-lime and the berry. Neither were good, but the berry was a little better. I have also tried chilling them and transfering to a glass. Nothing seems to help. Add that to the fact, that I got nothing from these. Nothing at all. Not worth the money to me. By reading the label, I can see why - they contain vitamins, enzymes, and a little caffeine - products I ingest daily anyway....maybe if you don't take vitamins or drink caffeine, these can help you. The biggest jolt I got was a gag reflex 1 2

I've been looking over some alternatives to dairy drinks to go with my meals. Plus, I might add the meals of my little boy (3.5 years). So, I was looking around in a nearby Trader Joe's  and found this interesting Pacific Natural Foods Organic Almond non-dairy beverage. It has a good, if somewhat bland, flavor and goes down easily very much like a low-fat milk. The calories per serving are moderate but the fat is a little high. I should add that the fat is non-saturated and non-trans and there is no cholesterol. The 50-50 sodium to potassium ratio is about ideal. I think the drink is a little low in protein that I should substitute it for milk in my boy's diet. All in all, I'm favorably impressed and this was my first experience with an almond beverage. I'd have to rate it good, but not great.<br /><br />Gary Peterson Good, But Not Great. 3 4

It was very dry, and a lot of Grissel, Looks like they left the string on the roast when they served it. Driest beef jerky 3 2 
The beverage has a really delicious spiced smell.  However, just a sip made my entire mouth feel stung.  The sensation faded to a tingle and finally passed, but for me, this drink is too strong.  The taste was fine, just not the sensation.  A second sip was all to similar to the first and so I passed on the rest of the cup. too strong for me 4 2 
Now keep in mind that I'm kind of a coffee snob, but I rarely have time to grind and press my own coffee.  I use the Senseo pods simply for convenience sake.  And since they have different flavors, I figured I'd give them a try.<br /><br />Now Senseo coffee in general tends to be better than most any store pre-ground, canned, or mass produced brand, like Folgers or Maxwell House.  But that's not saying a whole lot.  I find these to be kind of bitter, but the one saving grace is that I like the frothy finish.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is the inconsistency.  When I initially wrote this review, I was drinking my first package that came in a four-pack.  It actually tasted kind of fresh, and I liked it.  However, the next two packages were quite stale.  I have now tried a different brand of coffee pod which really blows this one out of the water.<br /><br />One to help make better coffee with your Senseo coffee maker:  Don't brew as soon as the red light stops flashing.  Let it warm up a few more minutes before you hit the brew button.<br /><br />Also, there are some pretty good pods out there, and they are not expensive.  You can even get fair trade and organic blends along with single origin coffees.  Shop around.  The Senseo brand pods are about the worst pods I've tried, but since they are better than Folgiers, I give them two stars. Decent for a pre-ground coffee 2 3 
This coffee's main advantage is its size!<br /><br />The coffee itself is nothing special and it certainly does not deserved to be labelled as a "medium" roast coffee.  In fact I wonder, how weak must Gevalia's mild brews must be.<br /><br />I was excited about the variety of coffees when I purchased my Tassimo but so far I have been disappointed by all except the Starbuck's blends (which are pricier).  I made a special trip to the US to purchase a few packages of these since many comments pointed towards a comparable alternative to the Starbucks.<br /><br />Having gone through a few now, I'd argue that it's the same as the Nabob Morning Roast sold in Canada.<br /><br />Now back to the size argument, if you had an extra 3oz to the Starbuck's house blend, you will have much richer tasting 12 oz cup of medium roast coffee. Not Outstanding 2 3 
The ease of preparation for BARILLA's fusilli w/veggy marinara is more than offset by aroma and taste.<br /><br />To prepare, a corner of the top seal is lifted to vent a sauce tray. Nuked for a minute, everything's hot.<br /><br />When you peel back the rest of the cover you're hit with an unsavory odor, can't call it an aroma, that doesn't stimulate the appetite.<br /><br />Lift the sauce tray out, spoon the gravy over the pasta, and there isn't enough to cover all. eh<br /><br />The first bite reveals that the smell you immediately noticed is part of the food's taste. This stuff's edible, but only if there isn't something else available.<br /><br />NUTRITION FACTS: 50 of the 9 oz. serving's 320 calories derive from fat, mostly saturated. It's a good source of fiber (44% RDA) has 57 grams of carbs, a zero cholesterol rating (despite saturated fats), and is high in sodium (710 mg, or 30% of RDA). One serving provides 25% of your Vitamin A needs, 15% of iron, 6% of calcium.<br /><br />And yet, after my free Vine serving, I would never buy BARILLA's nukeable pasta and wouldn't eat it again if comped in advance. Convenient but odiferous 2 3 
I consider this in the category of what should be quick, easy, edible food. However, the instructions are a bit more complicated than I like for food in this category. If I open this box, it is because I am short on time and need something quick and easy. However, here are the instructions:<br />1. Brown 1 pound of chicken (cut into 1 inch pieces) in a large skillet<br />2. Add 2 1/2 cps of water, seasoning and pasta. Bring to a boil<br />3. Cover and stir often for 7 minutes. Add broccoli; cover and cook until most of the water is gone, about 2 - 4 minutes. Remove from heat.<br />4. Add cheese with Velveeta cheese sauce pouch. Stir in cheese sauce<br /><br />Since some of those steps actually have multiple steps embedded inside them, this goes from and easy dump and heat meal to a more complicated recipe. For the same amount of work I can this same meal - just with fresh broccoli and ingredients I can actually pronounce.<br /><br />Now, I am no food snob - I actually enjoy the microwave version of the Velveeta broccoli and cheese pasta. Its just that the instructions for that meal is simply open the cup, dump in the broccoli dust, fill to line with water, microwave and stir in cheese sauce. For this amount of effort, the pretty much a similar product - I will pass in the future.<br /><br />Now, if you just really like the taste of Velveeta over other brands of "cheese sauce" and want a meal where all you have to do is add chicken - this is for you. However, this doesn't fit the bill for "quick and easy" and the flavor doesn't compare to fixing the same meal, in the same amount of time - with fresh or frozen broccoli and your own spices. Don't get me wrong, it isn't terrible; just not the ease I would be looking for in a box. Okay, but a little more work than I like 3 4 
I bought the vanilla, orange, mango, lemon and peach flavors of these.  They are OKAY in hot foods - I used them in herbal teas and to punch up my orange chicken.  However, these were only good in hot foods and in very small quantities.  They were extremely bitter and were completely useless in cold foods because even a couple drops made the item so bitter the food was inedible.  Even in hot foods the bitterness came out after a couple drops.  Save your money and use a better brand like truvia and just flavor your food with pure extracts from the baking aisle.  No bitterness and you get to control the level of flavor. Okay for hot foods 2 1 
Ok, I can't speak for when the last review was written, which looks like 2009, but I'm looking at the back of a bag of Almond Crunch and it clearly says that the product is made in California, not China. So if that was the main deterent back then, it's no longer an issue. I just discovered this snack and as a person who can't eat either gluten, soy, or dairy, I am thrilled to find a snack I can eat first of all, and a snack I can eat that is actually tasty, even better! I've been eating these for a few days now and no adverse reactions (and I have an extremely sensitive stomach). I plan on trying out all the flavors to figure out which ones I like the best but yeah, I'd highly recommend this product to those on restricted diets and even to those who aren't. Product not made in China! 5 4 
After using French Vanilla creamer in other coffees, I made the jump to French Vanilla coffee.  What a mistake.  Definitely not the same.  Not even close.  This coffee is weak and the french vanilla flavor is barely noticeable to me.  Ended up pitching the rest and going with that amazing Italian Blend, also by Timothy's. Weak 2 1 
This is a very strong tasting bar.  It is not very sweet tasting. It is close to imposible to eat this with out a large drink. Does not seem to be very satisfying as an afternoon snack. bar 4 3 
I bought this because I felt I wasn't getting enough vegetable in my diet at college, and I'm sure that it has done a terrific job stuffing my system full of nutrients, but I am always hesitant to take it because of a few reasons.  First of all, as I'm sure must be expected, this powder (when mixed with water, of course) has a god awful taste. Thankfully, the drink doesn't taste all too bad in the moment, but the aftertaste leaves you looking remarkably like a cat wheezing out a hairball. This might be due to the fact that the powder doesn't dissolve fully into the water, and instead all sifts down to the bottom of the glass, such that when you reach the end of the drink you're literally drinking a gritty green sludge (even if you stir vigorously and then drink it immediately). The only other reason that I have any qualms with this product, is because you're forced to use so much water to mix it into, that you overload your stomach with liquid and it sloshes about for a surprisingly long time. This always leaves me feeling nauseated, and I always end up burping excessively and having the fight the urge to vomit.<br /><br />All in all, I'm happy this product exists, but I wish there was some way to make it dissolve more effectively, or simply taste ever so slightly better. I've heard that mixing in a packet of Emergen-C does wonders for the taste, and I've also considered mixing the powder into something like apple juice to help the taste.  In any case, I'd still consider it a worthwhile product with just a few understandable drawbacks. Worthwhile, but gross 3 2 
The low acidity of this coffee is probably a good thing for folks that have trouble with that sort of thing. I found the taste to be lacking and a bit bitter. I brewed it weak and strong and prefered it on the weak side.  It's not a bad tasting coffee just not my cup of...coffee. OK Coffee 2 3 
They were $2.50 at the grocery store when I flew back home over Christmas. I bought four and brought them back with me, still paying less than these distributors.<br /><br />Buy the powder, but not on amazon. Great Product. Wtf price. 2 4 
If you use these raw, then be aware each bag had pieces of broken shells. I use them in hot cereal and salads and have had the less than joyful experience of biting down on a hard shell piece.<br /><br />If you care about your teeth, you may want to buy them whole and break them up yourself. I've never found a shell in the whole ones. Shells 1 2 
Ok, yes, this particular whey protein doesn't contain artificial sweeteners or other stuff you don't want in your diet but it really tastes awful and I haven't found a satisfactory way to dress it up.  I tried putting it in my coffee...it just ruined my normally delicious cup of coffee.  I tried putting it in juice but I had to make the juice (from frozen) really concentrated to make it taste ok..and then it still smells awful.  Jarrows whey may be better than 30 others out there but it's still not good enough to make me happy to take it.  I always like it when other reviewers tell me what's a better option so here's my advice.  Buy a jug of Optimum Nutrition Solid Gold.  It has fake sweeteners which I don't like but it tastes really good in a glass of skim milk! I'll probably throw the rest of this Jarrows whey in the garbage (unless I figure out how to cook with it or something). Yeach 2 1 
What is pictured and what you recieve is not the same!  The picture when I ordered had 6 or 7 different flavors pictured, one being banana, which is the main reason I ordered and I recieved only original flavors.  I will not recommend this seller and will never order from them again! FALSE ADVERTISEMENT! 2 1 
I received a single serving packet of this item for review. Frankly, it was nasty. I prepared it according to the instructions on the product (add 1 cup of hot water, stir and serve instantly). Yuck. Considering that it was supposed to taste like ginger, honey and perhaps a little lemon flavor - I was not pleased. Then I tried putting it over ice and yes, adding a little sugar. No improvement. I can't see recommending the beverage, buying this or encouraging others to use it despite the medicinal qualities of ginger for motion sickness or the nausea of pregnancy, etc. It did absolutely nothing for my digestion, either.<br /><br />I am sure whether or not you like this will be wholly a matter of personal taste. It was not for me! Nasty! 2 1 
This pump seems to work well. My only problem is that it loses prime and must be pumped a couple of times to get the syrup into the nozzel. Not a big deal though. It sure makes metering the syrup easier than pouring it out of the bottle. Torani Syrup Pump 4 3

The candy company that provided the Zagnuts is #1 in our book, because when we had an issue with the "heat," they took care of it in a timely manner. We strongly recommend doing business with them!!! You need to always promote a company that puts service and customer satisfaction as their priority. :) Hometown is a great vendor! :) 4 5 
I LOVE Merrick's products. I bought the Ranger Rib and was disappointed when I made my 6 month old German Shepherd mix spit out a small and very sharp shard he chewed off. It would have been easy for that piece to cut through his intestines if he were to swallow it. Hopefully he didn't swallow any pieces while I wasn't looking; I only had my eyes off him for maybe 8 minutes before he chewed through it.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this unless you watch your dog like a hawk while he/she chews it or if it's bought for a small dog that can't break off pieces easily -- there are other Merrick's bones that are much better; I bought "The Sarge" and my dog loves it! Splinter Scare! 3 1 
people need to know from the seller how thin these sticks are because you think when you order your getting a good deal on price then you get them and they are thin and<br />you feel ripped off. They stink really bad. Bully sticks are a bulls penis. I looked that up on the internet. Yes dogs love them, but please supervise your pet as they get down to a nub quickly and could cause choking. bully sticks 2 1 
My dog loved the taste. They are perfect for a treat, but once a pill of ANY size was inserted, he would find it, spit it out and eat the treat. Maybe for some dogs, but did not work for mine. Not for my dog 2 3 
I guess you could sum it up by saying, "you get what you pay for."  While it was a good price for the product and it was shipped and received in a timely manner, the product itself tasted less than fresh.  So far, the  cookie/candy bars that we've had have had an after-taste of an unfresh product. Twix-Chocolate Carmel Cookie Bars, 36ct 2 3 
These are absolutely awful. I like Stonewall's Jerkee, and Tofurky Jerky, and even normal Primal Sticks aren't bad... so I thought these would be right up my alley. They taste terrible and have an awful texture. It's like eating spiced crumbly rubber -- I couldn't get a whole one down but even if I could, I wouldn't feel safe eating it because it feels like it would take forever to be digested. I'm embarrassed that my desire for vegan jerky was so gluttonous that I spent so much on things that ended up so terrible! high hopes, dashed 2 1 
these almost disappeared before i had a chance to get a taste! Everyone loved, even teens visiting who don't eat a gluten free diet...teen age son asked "are these really gluten free, they're good!" yummy! 4 5

Cadbury chocolate uses a different formula in each country it is manufactured.  New Zealand is uses more cream than Australia, etc.  This version by Hershey is not what you expect from England, Australia or New Zealand Cadbury.  It does not melt on your tongue like those countries so it tastes differently.<br /><br />If you are looking for the silky smooth easy melting chocolate find the non Hershey version.<br /><br />Hershey has missed an opportunity to introduce high quality Cadbury chocolate to USA.

While the sugar count is slightly higher than a can of coca-cola, this soda gets it sugar from 100% Fruit Juice, not from High Fructose Corn Syrup.  I wouldn't give this to my daughter every day but as an alternative to soda once in awhile I think it is a good choice!  Plus it tastes great! Healthier Alternative than soda pop! 3 4 
Tastes good, but barely any protein. If you want protein, get Nutiva's unflavored 50% protein powder. You can flavor it yourself. It's cheaper and has more protein. Chocolate HempShake 3 2 
Very refreshing as an iced tea.  Mint is subtle and not overpowering.  Also nice hot.  Had enjoyed it at one of the coffee shops where I live, but was unable to find it in any local stores, so was glad to find it on Amazon.  Worth a try - highly recommended. Very nice! 4 5 
My two lhasa apso's absolutely love this food! For the last 3 years, I've been feeding this to them exclusively, full time as their main meal. They are pretty finicky eaters but not with this food! The only thing that has worried me is the amount of water they drink after eating their 4" slice (2" each daily) I've read some comments where this has been cautioned against as a full time meal replacement but so far other than the extra water intake & subsequent occasional in house potty accidents, I've experienced no adverse reactions! It helps them stay at a healthy weight & they look forward to feeding time each night as if I am giving them prime steak! So far it has been affordable & I usually buy 6-8 rolls a month & then give them cans of Iams for the in-between times when I run out. Lately it's been averaging for the beef rolls about eleven ninety nine.<br /><br />I just went to order a new batch & was shocked to see the new price of over sixteen dollars, which is much more than even buying it at petco (in-store) I recently was at my local petsmart @ was looking for Natural Balance food rolls & they did not carry it:( but what they did carry was something very comparable a product called Pet Botanics Dog Food Rolls! I went ahead & bought four 4.5 lb rolls (2 of the lamb & brown rice & 2 of the beef) My dogs loved it just as much as this! So if anyone else is concerned as I am about the Amazon price increase I would definitely recommend Pet Botanicals Food Rolls! I just ordered my monthly 6 rolls for $9.99 EACH which are 4.5lbs or 1/2 a pound more than the Natural Balance 4lb  rolls & they were even less than the $11.99 I paid BEFORE the price increase! I have shoprunner so shipping was free & I had a $4.00 offf a $15 purchase coupon code for Petco! So I placed 3 separate orders of 2 rolls each & saved $12.00 which more than offset the tax I had to pay! Good luck! Yiikes! $16.13 Why the sudden price increase? 4 5 
We loved these at first.  While we thought the salt and pepper was very powerful, the cashews themselves were large and flavorful, and the whole thing really worked.  We still love them, but it's a hit-or-miss proposition.  You never quite know how your taste buds are going to react when you open the container and toss a few in your mouth.  Sometimes, without a doubt, it's just a little too overpowering.<br /><br />The quality of the cashews is fantastic, the salt and pepper adhere to the nuts surprisingly well considering how coarse it all is.  There are times when I'd rate these a 4 or even 5, others where I'd want to go as low as 2.  3 it is.<br /><br />Would we buy them again?  I don't think so, but I had to stop and really think about that.  Emerald has a great product here, and we loved their Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds, 11oz Canister (Pack of 4), but the moments where these are too much, are enough to keep us from going back for more when this can is gone. Sea Salt and Pepper:  Too much?  Just right?  Yes and yes. 3 4

My daughter loves this Spring Vegi Pasta. So I ordered a dozen Earth's Best Junior Baby Food Organic Spring Vegetable and Pasta, 6-Ounce Jars (Pack of 12) - very disappointed to have a package arrived broken leaving me a huge mass and short food supply! I ordered previously the stage 1 and stage 2 with the same brand ( forgot the seller) which arrived in perfect condition with a tight box wrapped with plastic. Another disappointment is that it's not eligible for return! A huge mass and waste of money!! Poor packing 2 1

I ordered this cake and was very excited and anticipating its arrival. But then it came and I opened the box and I noticed on the side there was white power on the side (while it was still in its plastic wrapper) like a rotten fruit but I thought maybe it was just the plastic but then I opened it and took a bite and it was horrible. IT WAS ROTTEN. I was very upset because I bought it in Jamaica b4 n it was good so I called Amazon and they refunded my money. Don't think I will be trying this one again. All the other onces are good including: Chocolate, & Original w/ Walnuts. Disappointed 2 1 
There's this recent move to create animal crackers that have the consistency of a butter cookie, with artificial flavor and colors. This version is exactly that; mealy, grainy and a faint hint of fake vanilla. Bought them once but will not NEVER purchase them again. Barnum's, which were the gold standard of animal crackers, have changed their recipe to this as well and suck just as bad. At least these are organic! Not real animal crackers 1 2 
These by far are the BEST gluten free cookies there are.  I even like  them better than any non gluten free cookie also.  I would give them a five star rating for that but the problem is when they are shipped they come broken and crumbled every time. You need a spoon to eat the tiny crumbled pieces!  I have ordered a few times and even tried another company and they came shipped the same way.  The store I could buy them from is very far for me so I tried Amazon.  I would love to buy them again and again from Amazon but it's not fun to need a spoon to eat a cookie!  Taste is AWESOME though. Delicious but have a spoon ready! 3 4 
The rainbow chip is okay. Everyone one in the family felt the Pillsbury Funfetti tasted better. I had high hopes for this product, because it looks delicious unfortunately looks can be deceiving. It is not disgusting, just not tasty enough to justify purchasing it again. Not as good as Pillsbury Funfetti 3 2 
This one is an excellent beverage if you're feeling sick due to the flu, car sickness or pregnancy. The ginger is an ingredient which is known by natural health workers to settle stomachs and the honey and lemon are a good flavor mix. It's also soothing for indigestion and is good for children's tummies since it's caffeine free. Good for motion sickness 4 5 
No harsh after taste, no tangible negatives.  It just doesn't have the "bite" that I crave from other carbonated beverages like ginger ale or root beer.  It's a good option for a healthful drink with some fizz. Nothing earth-shattering; I enjoyed it, though it lacks bite 4 3 
These noodles are indeed gluten and soy free.  Please note that the label says that they are processed in a factory that also processes soy products, however. Wish I had known that before I bought them, since soy is a no-no in our family. Warning for people with allergies to soy. 2 5 
The crystalized ginger drink tastes much the same as other such drinks readily available at many Asian markets at half the price. I see other reviewers complained about after taste and it being too strong. I haven't run across a ginger drink that is too strong, so maybe it is just me but this one is relatively mild. At first, I didn't taste anything bad in the after taste but I wrote the review before finishing the drink... then went back to revise. Yes, not as good as I thought after the flavor lingers. It is a mediocre product at an premium price. High Priced 2 3 
I enjoy Bigelow Teas and was looking for a stronger cinnamon influence.  It is very good, hot or cold. I will use it all, but perhaps stir with a cinnamon stick for deeper flavor. Cinnamon Tea 3 4 
These bars really hit the spot: they have a good consistency, like a very thick brownie or fudge, without being overly or cloyingly sweet. The texture is just right, and rich enough to feel like a treat. The chocolate taste is pronounced (and really more of a 'dark chocolate' than any kind of milk chocolate), and the almonds - while not particularly numerous - are present, and add an extra crunch and flavour to the bar. If you're a die-hard, need-a-chocolate-bar kind of person, it's likely these won't satisfy your sweet-tooth cravings; for the rest of us, it's the right amount of sweetness.<br /><br />It's important to keep in mind that the bars aren't really 'health food,' though: they're not nutrient-dense enough to be a meal replacement, and likely won't fit easily into a stringent diet regimen. They're calorically dense, at 190 calories/bar: not very big, either. They'd be great to bring on a hike, long bicycle ride, or run, though, as they're compact, portable, and taste good. I wish they had more fiber (because really, these aren't very filling), but am glad they don't contain a laundry list of random chemicals/fillers, nor do the bars have any soy. The protein count is fairly good (7g), considering the Pure Natural bars aren't being sold as as a protein supplement. Taste Great, but Not a Health Food 3 4 
Not my favorite bread mix as it has a little bit of a "gluten free" taste to it, but better than most.  Also, very easy to make as you can prepare it on the one-hour gluten free setting of a bread maker.  It's a pretty good option. pretty good 3 4

I used to have this syrup at my grandmothers house all the time.  The product is the same as I always remember it.  It is a very thick syrup.  The only complaint I have is that the bottles I used to use it out of were glass and these bottles are plastic.  No big deal though it doesn't change the syrup. Just as I remember it 5 4 
The status quo worked great. I'm on the road a lot and like to have some snacks that are not too fattening. I was addicted to the old style not only for the taste but the texture. They were GREAT! The new stinks! Whoever brewed up this junk must have been on drugs, or at least does not care for the American people. I mean really, would you let your children eat this??? I rarely eat these because I care about my taste buds, but when I do, I wear a blind fold ,pinch my nose and hope that the company repents of this abomination and soon. We did not hope for change 2 1 
Let's face it: Americans are fat. Europeans tend not to be. Plus they live longer, more fulfilling lives. So who cares about hydrogenated oils (as in palm kernel and coconut)? Seriously, people. Go outside for a change and get off your computer, get some exercise, and stop being stressed out over the little things in life, such as banning so-called "deadly" oils. Some oils make things taste better, as the case with these fine cookies  :) They're tasty. Just don't eat the entire case! 4 1 
I cannot detect any vanilla flavor at all in this tea, instead it tastes like cloves. Doesn't Taste Live Vanilla 2 1 
I purchased the six pack of 12 ounce bottles.  Amazon was amazing-as always, and delivered my order in a very timely fashion.  However, the caps were loose on all the bottles.  I didn't think much of it until I realized every single time I served it (as dip, with salmon, with chicken), it ran straight through my family.  I hate to waste so I really tried to see if it was just a coincidence.  Nope.  It does taste great, just like the Trader Joes product, but I wouldn't suggest using it to cook a romantic dinner for two.  lol Be careful! 1 2 
This product converted me, I kid you not. Before: I did not think I liked instant coffee. Now: I think I do! :-)<br /><br />I've tried <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E50TSS">International Coffee</a> type products, which are powdered drink mixes and not truly instant coffee, and I was never very impressed. Eventually, I learned (and you'll laugh at me for not knowing this) that instant coffee is not a "mix" like hot chocolate but actually coffee beans treated differently in their production from coffee beans intended to be brewed. The bean is roasted as usual, then crushed (rather than cut as for brewing beans) in preparation for creating a coffee "concentrate" that will then be either freeze dried or spray dried. This product (as explained on the Nescafe website) is Robusta and Arabica beans, freeze dried, a method which may or may not be the top choice for connoisseurs of instant coffee, but being new to instant coffee I don't yet appreciate the difference.<br /><br />I do know that the product in these single-serving sticks is the same product that was sold in canisters, before. This is just a new format for their current product, not a new product. And wow, for the sheer pleasure and convenience, it's a decent cup of coffee! It can't be mistaken for richly brewed coffee from a restaurant or from your home coffee machine, not even if you douse it with cream, but instead I compare it to "office" coffee, or 'cafe au cube farm', which it definitely matches in taste and quality. Easy, quick, mellow. Great idea when I'm the only soul who wants a cup of coffee and can't bear to brew just one or two lonely cups.<br /><br />The big disadvantage of instant coffee, as far as I'm concerned, is that a serving of this product has only abut 65mg of caffeine compared to 45-180mg of caffeine in a brewed cup of coffee (we're talking in the upper end the way I brew mine!). I want my caffeine! The flavored versions of this product have even less caffeine per serving (at 25-30mg) although I couldn't tell you why. (This information, by the way, comes from the Nescafe website FAQ.) The other disadvantage, I suppose, is that the whole house doesn't fill with the sound and fragrance of brewing coffee when I choose to go instant. Alas.<br /><br />Still, given the convenience and the decency of the beverage itself, I'm now buying these little "single sticks" pretty regularly! Recommended. :-) Pleasant beverage, convenient format! 4 5 
Ordered 3 bags of the Highlander Grogg in WHOLE bean.  Received 3 bags already opened, ground and then labeled "drip" with little handwritten garage sale stickers.  Gross.  No thank you!  Daughter unpacked my order and didn't notice until 2 weeks later when I went to brew some coffee at 6am.  Threw out the whole batch.  Very disappointed. liars 3 1 
K-cups are marginally better than good coffee that I can buy at the store for 1/2 the price or less. This product was offered at $19.95 and I was willing to purchase it but it immediately went up to $26.95. It is not really worth $19.95 and is certainly not worth any increase. Additionally, what's the deal on offering INSTANT COFFEE in K-cups for $15.99 leaving us to think it's a good deal on REAL coffee. Do you want to lose our trust (business)???? That's a good way to do it!!!!!!!!!!<br />jb Wolfgang K-cup 3 2 
I thought this dog toy would perfectly fit my 11 month Samoyed and provide the durable playful time. Unfortunately, my Samoyed was not just rolling the bottle, her chewing on the knots caused the bottle to fly around and when it hits my fragile ceramic floor, it broke (both the lid cover and my newly set floor).. *sigh*<br />Maybe this product should be used in a carpeted environment only. The lid cover broke within 5 minutes 2 1 
We love these chips. They can be eaten alone, since they are so crisp and tasty or with a dip. Every one that we have introduced the chips to, loves them. And the expiration date is for 8 months from now, so ordering 12 bags didn't come near to them going stale. Great 5 4 
These chips are a great kettle chip with good crunch and excellent taste. The after burn isn't for everyone ( watch the reaction from people that don't like a little heat!!! ), but it isn't unbearable. Great with sandwiches or by themselves. I buy them by the case and give a bag to friends. Great Chips !! 4 5 
I'm a user of liquid stevia and i was looking for something i could use for baking.  The sweetener never dissolves with the wet ingredients, and, when your baking cools off, you have crunchy crystals of this sweetener in your baking. I even tried dissolving it first by warming up the wet ingredients, it appeared to dissolve, but after cooling i got the same results.  The other reviewers say that you tune into the taste in order to taste it.  I agree, if you use too little, it does not sweeten (you can't taste it), and if you use enough to taste it, you've ruined what you are trying to sweeten with it's nasty tin foil taste.  Dont bother using it for coffee or tea, because it sinks to the bottom of the cup because it does not completely dissolve even in hot water.  I should also mention that its not sweet in the slightest bit.  And i've been off sugar for years, so it's not because i'm used to real sugar.<br /><br />Bleh. Does not dissolve, not sweet, tastes like tin foil 1 2 
This product works great for me.  I hate spending money on herbs just to use a little and have the rest go bad shortly after.  I put some herbs (mostly basil) in here and they were fresh for a few weeks!  No leakage probs either, the bottom is clearly labeled to twist to lock and the plug stays flush.<br />This thing has already paid for itself in money saved and looks pretty cool in my fridge and on the counter when I'm ready to cook. WORKS FOR ME AND SAVES ME $$$$ 5 4 
I bought this canned crab meat for the first time and just used it in a soup. I bought "Pacific Organic red pepper creamy tomoto soup" (comes in cartons) and added a can of strained "mixed vegetables" and a can of this "crab meat", added some old bay seasoning and to tell you the truth, it was pretty good and it only took a couple minutes to make! The crab meat itself doesn't have much flavor at all and living in Maryland, it certainly isn't the crab meat I'm used to but to make a quick inexpensive crab soup it's pretty convenient. I wouldn't just eat this out of the can or make crab cakes with it because it's not high enough quality to do that. I also buy lots of canned goods for "emergency" back up my sister convinced me to always have so this along with the cases of tuna fish and canned chicken breast we should be in good shape in the "meat dept.". crab in a can 4 3 
I've been noticing recently that this and all their chunky soups are becoming more and more watered down.<br /><br />That and the incremental downsizing of their products(as with just about everything else in the grocery store) means I'll be passing their section of the soup aisle. Time to make my own I guess. Watered down 1 2 
If you have nothing else this is acceptable, but it definitely lacks that special something my two local restaurants seem to have in the korma. I was disappointed. Possibly it was too mild. I could tell from the aroma it was different from what I had on my recent Lamb Korma dishes while dining out. Something missing. 2 3 
This plant type is easily stressed and it was stressed when I received it. After a few weeks, It is doing fine.  The plant came in bloom; this was different then the other desert roses I have purchased from other sellers.  It is making itself at home in the bright Florida sunshine.  Doesn't need much water and love sunshine what a good plant. OK for the price 3 4

I eat crystallized ginger because I have a finicky stomach. I've tried several brands. This brand just doesn't cut it.<br /><br />Each package has ginger, coated very liberally with sugar, and then about another teaspoon of sugar added to the bag for no particular reason. The extra sugar just adds weight to the bag. If you buy this, shake the bag up, then remove the ginger. At the bottom of the bag, you'll have a nice teaspoon of sugar for your coffee or tea.<br /><br />If you like super-sweet candy and  plan on filling your sugar jar with the extra sugar, then you'll like this. If you're looking for something that tastes like ginger, look elsewhere. Not for me 1 3 
I haven't tried these yet; they have just arrived, but I wanted to warn fellow customers that you will be receiving 56 TOTAL ounces (four packages of 14 ounces each):  that adds up to 72 cents per ounce! Amazon has given me an appropriate refund, so props to them.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Flavor-wise I enjoyed these pumpkin raviolis:  Are they worth the specialty 40.00 dollar price?  -I would say not because the pumpkin flavor gets overwhelmed by the sauce and even by the ravioli pasta itself.  Another issue is that the raviolis are covered in powder and thus make a mess, especially when recycling.  I would pay 20-30 dollars for this product for a gift, but probably not 40. WARNING: You are paying 72 Cents per Ounce! 2 3 
These chips are pretty delicious.. Even the original flavor with nothing on it is good. It's not as delicious as Doritos, but it's also not fried either, which definitely balances it out. A good snack for all times of day! Pretty delicious 5 4 
I really appreciate the ingredients in this gum, and the fact that it is more natural, but the flavor is only so-so. My kids haven't complained, but they are not picky when it comes to things like gum. I have had problems with it sticking to my teeth or fillings. That is not pleasant. But in spite of the down-sides, I will probably purchase this gum again because I don't like giving my kids artificial sweeteners, which are in most other kinds of gum. Some glee 3 4 
I think this is one of those types of food products where you will either really like it or not care for it.<br /><br />I am a chocolate fan and I love chocolate and almonds, so I figured this was a natural fit for me.<br /><br />Upon opening the first bar it seems like any other bar of it's type. However, once that first bite was in my mouth it's evident it was not. The chocolate in these bards over powers the taste of anything else. Like I said, I'm a chocolate fan but this was just too potent of chocolate for my tastes.<br /><br />Since there were a dozen in the box I decided to let a few others try them. It was a mixed bag of results there too. One person took one bite and would have no more. One said they were okay with coffee. One person ate an entire bar before deeming it "not very good". The last person really liked them and said he would buy them in a store. So, basically 1 out of 5 people in my highly unscientific research liked them.<br /><br />I guess if you are a dark chocolate person these may be something you'll like. But if you're not stay clear of these. Didn't care of it too much 2 3 
Great value for the money spent, actually too much... The bottle is plastic. They look like glass in the picture though. Too much... 4 3 
I was hoping the Timothy French Roast K-cups would be as good as the Tully's French Roast K-cups; but, in my opinion it is not.  The Tully's FR is much bolder and more flavorful.  I have a standing order for the Timothy FR that I am going to cancel. Not a bold French Roast 3 2 
This tea is the best tea i've ever had. i first tasted it in norway, and had to find it in the states. i have it every morning. delicious 4 5 
Taste good but are nothing special, a coffee bean covered in mediocre chocolate.  They don't last long once opened though, I should have put them in a tupperware in the fridge.  That's not the product's fault though... Taste good. 4 3 
This really is the only choice when it comes to soy and dairy free baking (unless you want to use lard).  The Spectrum shortening uses palm kernel oil and has the consistancy of regular Crisco (perhaps a little stiffer).  It seems to bake just fine and if you need to be soy and dairy free I highly recommend it. The only soy and dairy free shortening 5 4 
I love coffee with no bitterness and lots of good coffee taste and this one fits the bill. Holds up well to milk & sugar-I love it in the morning for the first cup and in the evening just as much. Definitely would buy it again. Good medium strength coffee 5 4 
I love using fresh ginger and lemon when I cook, so when I saw that there was a ginger and lemon drink I had to try it.  While the flavor was good, it did leave a slight after taste, but not enough to deter me from trying it again.  My only complaint is that I received a sample pack of the Gold Kili drink and it did not have any directions as to how much water to use.  I tend to like most of my foods and drinks very flavorful, so I opted for a regular coffee mug, but found it too strong and ended up pouring it into my largest one.  All in all, I thought this provided a nice change of pace for the basic varieties of teas, coffee and other warm drinks that are on the market today. Powerful Flavor 4 3 
This product is so sturdy and great. The rope only lasted a day, but I still use the jug constantly. My Lab loves it and it has held up to her power chewing. Once she figured it out I've had to use larger treats to keep her busier longer. Great product. Tough Jug! 4 5 
I used to buy these delicious crackers at my health food market, but they stopped carrying them. I was happy to find them at Amazon, but when my order arrived, they were all broken up, many in very small pieces. I asked for a replacement, and it came quickly, but again, many of the crackers were broken up. It doesn't look like the packaging is going to improve any time soon, if ever, and it's a shame. When I bought them at my health food store, they were all in one piece, so obviously, it's possible. Great crackers, terrible packaging 4 3 
I like my espresso drinks. I wouldn't say I am an expert but I have at least one mocha (whole milk, half choc) daily from Kaldis, Starbucks or my new thing is making it on my office DeLonghi 32Bar Pump Espresso machine.<br />I wanted to like the Dolce Gusto Cappuccino, I really did. I wanted the no mess option for my home kitchen. It would save me money, it would save me time. So I read the reviews and I purchased it after serious consideration.<br />I am disappointed. All I could taste when I drank it, was a sort of powdered milk taste - it reminded me of coffee creamer which I never drink (the last time was stuck waiting for a car service at Midas three or four years ago). So if you really like your espresso and froth, this will not cut it. If you were having a party and your guests were not foodies, or wanted coffee in the morning in a rush, or if you don't mind the taste of coffee creamer, then this is not the worst espresso drink I have ever had. It compares to an average restuarant that serves this type of drink BUT does [not] compare to a coffee house despite the claims on the box.<br />See my review on the Cafe Lungo option if you want to know what it tastes like when you remove the milk capsule as a factor... Disappointed, tastes like coffee creamer 1 2 
This bread is very dry and crumbly compared to the other major brand. Will definitely not be switching from my usual brand (without the 'R'). There are better gluten-free breads... 2 3 
I don't know about you but there is nothing like a warm poo in your hand first thing in the morning.<br /><br />I don't think I'd even be interested in having a dog anymore if there wasn't the thought of being able to scoop up the warm poo after intently watching him give waste to his kibble every morning. How would I know I was still alive if not for the warm embrace?<br /><br />This product is absolutely brilliant but what about the fecal freaks... Where is our product? No more warm poo?!?! 3 2 
After the purchase I found the same brand & size at a lesser price at the local Grocery store, My fault for not checking the price prior to purchase. Over priced Almond paste 3 2 
This has been a good product for me.  It seems to be increasing my milk production, but not by a lot.  If you forget to take it once or twice, your milk production will decrease again almost immediately.  I'm glad I got this to help me get a little further with breast milk for my child, but if your milk is pretty good and your not good at remembering to take pills, I wouldn't bother. Good product 3 4 
I love iced coffee so was eager to try this. I appreciated that it was lightly sweetened and that it didn't have any added dairy.  The portion was just the right size and I liked the strong espresso flavor.  It did have a bit of a bitter, over roasted flavor to it -- not entirely unpleasant but not a "great" cup of coffee.  I would consider buying this again but wouldn't go out of my way to look for it. It's okay -- I might have Starbucks tastebuds 4 3 
I do not recommend this food for your pet. I ordered this as a replacement food for my two adult boxers. About a week after transitioning to this food my two year old female started having head tremors. I did some research and found that this is benign and can happen with foods with certain ingredients. I changed the food and the head tremors stopped. I now feed my dogs Taste of the Wild and love it. Caused head tremors in my Boxer. 1 2 
My lab chewed up the rope in a couple hours. This alone is not a huge deal as the instructions with the toy say that a ball can be placed inside the container and have a similar effect as the rope. However, before I could even place a ball in it, the plastic developed a large crack from the dog just carrying his toy around the house and dropping it on our carpetted floors. He has other plasic toys that he has had for months with absolutely no signs of damage. Good for a couple days 1 2 
Sorry but I do not like bitter food but know I now. I love olives but not these dried ones. Dried olives 2 1 
I used to eat these all the time when I was in Japan. They didn't cost nearly that much though. In Japan they're about $4. You can get them for about $5 at [...]<br /><br />They're a lot of fun, I sent a few to my niece and nephews. Definitely fun for kids. Asian food grocer also discounts if you buy more. I'd check them out before buying these. too expensive 1 3 
Most dogs love these but our dog was less than pleased.  He is a tad persnickety.  It is a good product with few calories. Great for training purposes. Lamb Lungs 5 3 
There are only a few candies in this tiny box, not worth spending over $20. Nice but too expensive for such a small size 4 2 
Was very happy to find this at such a resonable price and I am sure it will a very good product.  The unfortunate part is they seem to charge shipping according to the price of an item, not the weight.  By the time you add up shipping and price of the xanthan gum you will pay the same anywhere.  Not a savings! Good price, questionable shipping 2 3 
By initial appearances, this looks like it could be very good.  Sweetened by honey - good, natural - good, but then take a look at the actual ingredients.  Not much natural about this.  Sure honey is one of the ingredients, but so is sucralose.  I know plenty of people are fine with this or use it as a substitute for sugar for dietary reasons, but I can't stand the stuff.  The mix of different tastes (tea, pomegranate, sucralose) is very unpleasant to me.  Of course tastes vary between any two people and you may enjoy this, but be aware that it does contain artificial sweeteners if that is not what you are looking for.  I have also tried the Mango version and although it also contains sucralose, it is a bit more tolerable. horrible 1 2 
I couldn't get past the acidic taste of this coffee. I know French roasts are strong, but this one was overpowering. Doesn't taste like it's low-acid 2 1 
So I'm not going to taste these myself so I'll just have to rely on the enthusiastic reception by my wheaten terrier. Obviously the big draw here is the quality ingredients and assurance of the brand. I probably am more willing to spend on quality brand food for my dog than I am for me. I try to avoid Chinese food products since they have regulatory issues. No need to rehash the whole pet food scandal. That said it's easy to but junk American pet food too so I try to shop carefully. This seems to be a quality dog snack that the dog enjoys... The dog has spoken... 5 4 
Crackers looked fine but I didn't try them because the ingredient list on the package listed soy, which I can't have.  I went back and checked the Amazon description and the ingredient list did NOT list soy.  Makes me hesitate to order grocery items if I can not trust the information on the description. Crackers contain SOY. 2 1 
While you would expect Ghiradelli to make good chocolate, the flavor of this mocha cocoa is precisely that of great darker chocolate flavor, using just enough coffee flavor to accent the cocoa without overtaking it.  A smooth, delicious start or finish to your day - even a warm afternoon pick me up on those chilly days! The Chocolate side of Mocha 5 4 
We tried this a couple times, but we have a SUBSTANTIAL preference for the Kraft Bacon Ranch Pasta Salad.  It's the same idea as this, but for some reason the Betty Crocker Suddenly Salad gave our family upset stomachs both times we tried it.  In fact, my kids started calling it "Suddenly something down your leg", which is what it is known as to this day in our house.  The sad part is the Kraft version is MUCH harder to find, but definitely superior.  Check out the Kraft one - more delicious and less crampy results. Beware of the "Suddenly" part 2 3 
I got this for Father's day and my dad loved it and did not mention one thing about it being small or anything. This really made his day so I am pleased with the idea to order the gift for him. I would recommend it! a nice idea 3 4 
I recieved this Ghee right away and came safely packaged. I love that it is grass-fed and organic, very important to my family. We use this with stir fry and saut&eacute;ing and can't wait to try on our popcorn! Delicious Ghee! Great Ghee 4 5 
When I first saw the website for this i thought it was a joke, especially growing up listening to the Offspring, Pennywise, the Vandals et al... anyways, decided to see who carried it and they have it at my podunk, hillbilly a$$ food 4 less here... $3 bucks a bottle, kinda pricey, I thought, till i saw how much it is here on amazon... I suggest checking your local Albertson's or Food 4 less and seeing if they have it, you'll never want tapatillo or chalula again... this is the real deal and tastes amazing!! I guess if it's one thing us Southern Californian's have in common it's our love of mexican food, and as any good So Cal resident knows, the salsa makes the burrito (or at least can make it go down easier in some cases)... Seriously good hot sauce!!! The BEST mexican style hot sauce you'll find!!! 5 1 
My dogs enjoy any type of "puppy cookie", they're not picky at all. But I noticed that in feeding them this product they started to prefer this brand over all others! I am happy knowing they enjoy it, but I'm even happier knowing that it is filled with all sorts of good "real" food - not by-products and what not. I would highly recommend these! My Dogs Loved them!! 5 4 
Our dogs do NOT like this and won't eat it. Yes, they have no problem with the Libby's real canned pumpkin, but not this brand. Not so good 1 2 
I'd eagerly awaited for delivery of this vanilla candy that I vividly remembered from childhood and was disappointed with this ersatz version of Bonomo's Turkish Taffy.  It's not as rich and creamy in the mouth and doesn't have the real vanilla flavor that I recall in the original.  I would bet that the ingredients are not the same; for one thing soy is now used. Not the Same 3 2 
Switch is a tangy drink that's more reminiscent of Sprite than Orange Juice. It's carbonated all the way and you will even burp after it as you would've after consuming any soft drink. The drink doesn't feel sugary, but a quick glance at the nutritional facts reveals that each can contains 34 grams of sugar. The claim on the can is that there are no additional sugars added, so I'm assuming that's the sugar from the orange and tangerine. The can tinged with vitamin C 2 3 
I am not too sure why it is the case, but the coffee seemed not fresh and having been roasted quite awhile ago. I am not sure if it is adistribution issue or the roaster's fault, but I was not really satisfied. It is the first time I try ordering coffee from Amazon. Kona 24 karat 3 2 
I have long been a fan of mixing juice, such as orange joice, with a carbonated soda like 7Up - it provided the best of both worlds, fresh juice and carbonation. The down side over the last number of years is the high fructose corn syrup that has replaced sugar in the carbonated sodas.<br /><br />But, of late there have been alternatives. First there was Orangina, which mixed 12% orange juice with carbonated soda - still had the sugar, but far better than mainstream sodas. Then a number of drinks have become available that mix the carbonation with a high percentage of real fruit juices. Some of these have been underwhelming to say the least. The best so far is IZZE with its 70% fruit juice and 30% carbonated water - no added sugars.<br /><br />Now comes along The Switch. The Switch is 100% fruit juice with carbonation added. And, like IZZE, I really like this drink. It is different than IZZE drinks; The Switch blends their juices different to achieve a little more subtle flavor where IZZE has more tang and punch. I can't say one is better than the other only that they each deliver a different refreshing experience.<br /><br />I have tried The Switch in Orange Tangerine and Black Cherry. The Orange Tangerine is very good! I highly recommend it. The Black Cherry is good, better than some other cherry drinks of this sort I have had, but it could be a bit better; it doesn't quite deliver the same flavor experience of a really good Black Cherry soda. Great Alternative to High Fructose Corn Syrup Laden Sodas 5 3 
I have been eating the 100 Calorie Chip Ahoy for sometime. I really find that it is a filling, guilt-free snack. It has a unique taste of its own - not a `diet' food-type taste either, it taste like a `real' snack. Very Good 5 4 
I used to have no problem with these, until one day on an impulse I decided to give Target's Archer Farms brand coffee pods a try (breakfast blend aka medium roast).  They cost less, are bigger, individually wrapped and produce a much smoother coffee.  Now I can't drink Douwe Egberts anymore and am hooked on Archer Farms. Okay but there is better out there for less 2 3 
Not bad, but be warned that it tastes like a cocktail sauce. If you have anything else tomato flavored in your chili this will put it over the top and cause your chili to taste like it should be eaten with defrosted shrimp. Rebranded cocktail sauce 2 3 
Adopted my cat from the ASPCA in the City. They had her on this Instinct Diet. My cat does not like this food sorry, plus when received it was more dust in the bag then nibblets. very disppointed Instinct 2 1 
I find this product to be too sweet and syrupy and consequently does not quench my thirst. The size is nice but that's the only thing I liked about it. This is a subjective review of course and other's may love this product, just not me. Too sweet and does not quench thirst 1 2 
I have to say my golden and cocker love these treats and they are great for dogs, like my cocker, that have allergy issues and need higher quality food. I bought these at a specialty dog store for 3.00 more and the treats seem to be more solid than the ones I got from Amazon. The delivered treats were not consistent and many were hollow inside. This isn't even mentioning the fact that half the bag many of the treats were badly broken up but I can look past that versus the quality. Great treats and the dogs don't complain about my complaints :). Great Dog Treat...Quality and Condition when received questionable 3 4 
I was disappointed because I didn't pay attention to the quantity of the coffee.  I feel it's way overpriced for the very little coffee you get.  Two ounces of coffee for $8 is not a fair price. Disappointed 2 1 
We received the product in a timely manner after placing the order but it was expired when it arrived based on the date stamped on the neck of the bottles. Expired Product 3 2 
If you want a really good snack bar try these, they are healthy and taste as good as any granola bar, but without the gluten!! I buy these regularly. Great bars for gluten-free diets! 5 4 
Besides the obvious convenience and portability of the individual creamers, I liked this item specifically because of packaging. I couldn't believe how many reviews I read about coffee creamer cups; but many of the Amazon creamer options (both Coffeemate and International Delight) had multiple negative reviews due to the shipment arriving with broken cups thanks to sloppy packaging.<br /><br />That was not an issue here. The shipment arrived in four dispensing boxes of 50 each (as shown in the photo); those boxes were tightly packed in a thick cardboard box which could take a good beating before damaging the inner boxes. Thus, none of my cups were broken, no waste and no sloppy drippy mess. Plus the four boxes means I could put one in the kitchen, one in the bathroom (we moved our mini Keurig there when we upgraded the kitchen Keurig - best idea my husband ever had), and one at work, with a reserve for whichever runs out first.<br /><br />If you are looking for these mini creamers but deterred like I was by the negative packaging reviews on other options, this is your best bet. As a bonus, the auto delivery price is very reasonable. Better Packaging 5 3 
A previous reviewer from August '10 noted that the description and picture states these cans are 11 ounces when in fact what you receive are 10 ounce sized cans.<br /><br />Well, it's half a year later and Amazon has still not updated this product.  I guess even Italian espresso is utilizing the underhanded business practice of lowering the quantity of the goods you receive, but not changing the price at all, similar to what so many other food companies are doing, canned tuna among them.  The coffee is still a great product, just be aware you are getting about 7% less of it for the same price.<br /><br />(UPDATE: Well, I just checked back today--last day of June 2011--and FINALLY the product size of this item has been updated. Too funny though--if you look close at the picture for it it still shows an 11 oz. can! Haha! Also, someone commented that this is not technically really "Italian Espresso" because it's not produced in Italy...well, whatever, the name is Italian so it's a valid mistake and pardon me all to hell.) Product size still not updated 2 3 
Work well and made solidly.  For whatever reason the Keurig takes longer to complete the brewing cycle when using these cups and the liquid bleeds through the filter on the outside of the cup making a small mess.  They do the job as intended but could use a different type of filter to make the experience less messy. DisposaKups 3 4 
My kids love macaroni and cheese with dinner. They even like broccoli. I thought that this would be right up our alley.<br /><br />The broccoli: The broccoli is more of a seasoning that a real part of the dinner. I know, I should have expected this. But when I poured the little, dry broccoli pieces out, I had a bad feeling. Sure enough, I ended up making some real broccoli to eat along with the cheesy skillet.<br /><br />The noodles: Nothing to really complain about here. If you follow the directions, you pretty much get what you see on the box. Only smaller. I wish they'd stuck with regular macaroni or with shells, but these weren't bad, just not great. The picture on the box really magnifies the noodles too.<br /><br />Chicken: Well, you add your own. So go for it! If you like your food all mixed up, then the cheese coated chicken will be yummy at least.<br /><br />Cheese: The high point of the meal right here! It comes creamy already, no need to mess with the powdery stuff you get in some "meal" boxes. Flavorful, cheesy, and creamy. It's just about all you can ask for in a pre-made "Mac and Cheese" box.<br /><br />Overall: I might buy it again as part of a larger meal. Definitely make your own vegetable to go along. Not horrible, not great, just a quick easy dinner if you are runny late. It's ok, but not really "dinner" 3 2 
because i enjoy this manufacturer's dried apricots and plums so much, i thought i would give the peaches a try; however, i was disappointed.  they were not all sweet, and some of them were so dry they were hard to chew. texture and taste inconsistant 3 2 
It's been a month, and this still has not arrived. I ship several packages a week to my son's APO address in Afghanistan, and this is the only company that has not delivered. still waiting 3 1 
These were a sore disappointment to the Nana's brand. I love the Chocolate Chip and Peanut Butter but these were way to dry and powdery. The flavor was good but the texture made my stomach turn. Does Not Compare To Other Nana's Cookies 1 2 
This coffee lacks the richness I am used to in coffee beans that are french roasted. Although it doesn't make a bad cup of coffee in my book it is not frech roasted. Doesn't taste like french roast. 3 2 
First quality, dogs like it and it does not have grain as an ingredient, therefore a reduction in ear infections due to yeast infections. Premium Dog Food 5 4 
Now I know this formulation is not the most natural or high grade one on the market right now. Believe me, I have tried to get her interested in just about every brand with the word "natural" in the title, and she is not having it. She won't get the benefit of the food if she won't eat it. So when I noticed she was eating all of her food when I put this in front of her, I decided to stick with what is apparently working. This is still premium food, formulated for my twelve year-old's needs, and she really, really likes it. 'Nuff said. Cat LOVES this stuff. 5 3 
I normally like glutino but their honey nut flavor is so boring and the texture is wierd. Apple cinnamon flavor is significantly better so if you are buying one of the two definately go with the apple cinnamon. However, the best gluten free cheerio is PerkyO's Frosted Cheerio. Amazon......WHY is it not for sale on your site??? PerkyO's is excellent in size of the "O" as well as taste. In my opinion the frosted PerkyO is better, more flavorful than the original brand but amazon needs to sell both. Especially for the young toddler that needs just the right size for their little fingers, the original is a good choice for them as well as for those of you who don't like sugar much. NO FLAVOR!!  Don't waste your money. 2 4 
To make this simple the tea is perfect!  It's the same refreshing taste I'm used to during my stays in Japan.<br />My previous delivery arrived in near impeccable condition with only one bottle slightly dented.  I have never had problems with products shipped directly from amazon, with the exception of the one I have just received.<br /><br />The wrapping on the bottles was very dirty and deteriorated.  Most bottles remained intact but a couple were dented badly and on the verge of bursting.  The cardboard packaging has obviously been exposed to a lot of moisture and other elements.  I'm not sure what happened.<br /><br />Unfortunately Amazon wont allow these items to be replaced.  I gave it 4 stars because of the tea and at least they are still drinkable.  I might consider canceling my subscription if they arrive like this again.<br /><br />Great product and true to the Japanese original. Just may not arrive 'AS' great. Great tea, poor delivery 4 3 
These bars are huge, with good texture and very filling. The taste is mediocre (a bit fake). Overall, they'd be fine if it weren't for all the sugar alcohols.... all ELEVEN grams of them. That much maltitol tends to mess with digestion. I'd go with a different bar, if it's going to be a regular in your diet. Mediocre 2 3 
Chocolate, marshmallow, graham crackers.. there's nothing really more nostalgic than a combination of those three ingredients (s'mores anyone?) bringing back so many young memories. The true beauty of the combination is its simplicity and that it spans so many different countries and cultures.<br /><br />I actually grew up more with moon pies (or choco pies as it is called in Asia) that more closely resembles a s'more by having two graham crackers sandwiching instead of the mallomars single cracker on the bottom. The thing I really like about this version is that it is smaller and much easier to have a small snack or nibble as opposed to the larger alternatives. Sinking my teeth into the fluff first made me enjoy and taste the marshmallow sweetness first which I've come to realize I prefer.<br /><br />The only problem I had was that my package (of 18 cookies) came smushed in the mail so many of my cookies had their layers separated letting me not enjoy the full experience as intended. Small Nostalgic Bites 4 5 
I love the 100 calorie packs. They limit my intake so I don't eat a huge bag. Bring them to lunch with me to get a good amount of protein. I like how they are smaller bite size pieces of jerky. It makes it easier to eat and not so gamey. They are delicious too! A little pricey though. Love the 100 calorie packs 5 4 
I bought this for $45,000 or thereabouts.  It was definitely delicious, but after finishing it in 15 minutes I wanted a little more bang for my buck.  $20K would have been a better price point. It's good, but probably only worth like twenty thousand 4 3 
Update: This coconut milk is shipping out from Thailand again and you can definitely tell the difference. We have been ordering this brand again for the last few months and have not received any of the low quality Sri Lanka product. I definitely recommend this coconut milk as long as it continues to come from Thailand.<br /><br />Original Review:  The first time we ordered this Coconut Milk it was delicious and thick as expected. We went through it quickly and ordered a second case. I was just about ready to set this up for subscribe and save, but after tasting the most recent batch I was glad I waited. As others have mentioned, they are currently sending out cans that were processed in Sri Lanka. I do not know if they are processing it differently or if the coconuts are just regionally different, but it is a big difference in flavor. Our coconut ice cream is coming out less creamy and more like blocks of ice and it requires a lot of extra peppermint extract to get the flavor right with the Sri Lanka Product. I will be ordering another brand until this is resolved. Updated: Sourced from Thailand 4 3 
It's an Assam-blend but it tastes more like traditional black and orange pekot tea than the Assam tea I can get in India. That said, it's still very good black tea and a great value. Mostly black tea but still good and good value 3 4 
The beans are great, the parcel arrived on time, but many of the cans were badly dented due to poor packing. dented cans 2 3 
You have to love ginger to like this product. It's not a ginger-flavored drink, it's a ginger drink.<br /><br />I admit, i only like ginger, i don't love it. I found the flavor to be too strong, and too bitter. I had to add a fair amount of sugar to make it drinkable. Never once did i notice any lemon flavor.<br /><br />As with most drinks, it's going to be up to each individual to decide if they like it. Ginger-philes will probably love it, ginger-haters should stay well clear, and people somewhere in between might like it with a bit of honey or sugar. Very, very strong ginger flavor 3 2 
This is for the Health Valley Tomato Soup No Salt Added, 15 Ounce Cans (Pack of 12).  I purchased this specifically for a person with heart problems.  One of the problems with canned foods is too much sodium, so the No Salt Added is a good feature.  Another problem is cholesterol content.  The ad for this product states 0 mg cholesterol, which is a false statement.  Apparently the supplier did not update the ad when Health Valley changed their recipe for their No Salt Tomato soup and is now adding cholesterol.  The cans I received have a "NEW" on the label, which the can shown in the ad does not.  This is an honest mistake on the seller's part, but he should correct it, and he should list the true contents. no salt soup ad says no cholesterol; the facts are different. 1 2 
This is like a junk food for doggies. My dog loved this, he scarfed it up and didn't leave behind a single crumb. I'd rather use this as treats than his actual daily food. Which is what I am doing with the remainder of the bag.<br /><br />Even though I am sure this dry food smells and tastes great to my dog, that is where my satisfaction ends. The ingredients aren't of high quality. It has artificial coloring, isn't a natural dog food and I think I am going to go back to Natural Balance.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this if you're looking for a lean, high quality dog food! Dog loves it, but it isn't very healthy 3 2 
This jar of baby food has 7 GRAMS of FAT and 110 calories - thats triple the fat and double the calories of most baby food!  I highly recommend for babies needing to put on some lbs - as well as picky eaters.  I have to offer my son a variety of 7-8 foods each meal (cheese, avacado, chunks of meat...etc) b/c he turns up his nose at so much (and I can't just say 'well too bad' b/c he desperately needs the calories!) But this is one of the foods he rarely turns down.  I highly recommend. GREAT for the Little Guys 5 4 
This food might have great contents, but my 7 1/2 lb, 11/2 yr old poodle doesn't like the taste. She's not a picky eater. Dog doesn't like it 1 2 
This powdered peanut butter is quite tasty, either on its own or mixed with water as instructed. The problem is, it is about twice as expensive as normal peanut butter wherever you try and find it. I didn't like the price on Amazon, and Bell Plantation's website charges over $11 to ship their 4 pack, which makes the price of each bottle about $7. $7 is also about the price I've seen in specialty stores as well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, while it is a healthy, tasty substitute for real peanut butter, I'll be sticking to the real thing due to the price. Plus, nut fats are good for you as long as they're consumed in moderation. Good, but expensive! 4 3 
Mrs. May's pumpkin crunch is a great snack. For those of you watching calories and intake, be aware that the 2oz portions are two servings. Most of Mrs. May's products are great, but with the fat at 11g per serving, i find it's not a complete guilt free snack. However, the pumpkin seed crunch has 9gms of protein per serving vs. the usual 4gms in their other snacks. So if you're monitoring your intake and want to indulge in these now and then, the pumpkin seed crunch is the healthiest option of the bunch.<br /><br />That said, they are all tasty and certainly not bad for you, just a little high in fat if you're watching your weight. Highest in protein 5 4 
I used this kind of hops in my batch of homemade Blueberry Wheat Beer. They worked great! Only thing the shipping was over priced for such a little pack of hops pellets. You should consider looking for cheaper shipping before placing your order. hops 3 4 
We have the pickiest dog on earth.  It took us 3 years to find a food that he would eat a full bowl of on a consistent basis!  When this came and we filled his bowl with it the first time, I fully expected him to possibly take a couple of bites then refuse to eat any more.  I was shocked when he ate the entire bowl then went to his food container, basicly asking for more.  I gave him another cup of the food, he ate most of that before he laid down again.  I was thrilled to find another food that he liked!<br />After 3 or 4 days of him eating this food, he started having REALLY bad gas.  Imagine a 100 lb dog with bad gas laying next to where you are sitting on the couch!  Nevermind, you don't want to imagine that but you get my point.  After 4 days of dealing with the gas from hell we put him back on his old food.  Viola, gas was gone!  Thank God!  I don't know if that's a common reaction to the food but it certainly didn't agree with our dog's tummy.  Good news is that the outside cats like it and if they have gas, too, I don't have to deal with it.  ;-) He likes it but... 3 5 
I love everything else from this company but these taste horrible- dry, fishy, bitter. I can't taste any cheese flavor. My daughter won't touch them. Horrible tasting 2 1 
This product did not include the "shaking bag". In addition, the package says that it will cover 6 pork chops. I was only able to coat 4 thin chops. The chops were done in 15 minutes as promised BUT they were not flavorful at all. Dry coating without much seasoning. I recall having shake n bake in youth and it was much more tasty. I so wanted to love this nostalgic food, but it just was not good at all. ): Lacks flavor 1 2 
Go to any grocery store, gas station or nutrition shop, and you will no doubt be overwhelmed with the panoply of energy drinks on the shelves. There is clearly money to be made here, so every company under the sun has their own brand, replete with flashy packaging and a mad-scientist assortment of ingredients. No Fear Super Energy Supplement drink is just such a drink. The cool black can with the menacing skull and bold lettering are alluring, likely to attract many. Tread cautiously, dear energy drink consumers.<br /><br />The aforementioned flashy labeling atop the can highlights ingredients such as Taurine, Arginine and L-Carnitine, which are all great components of a good energy drink, but the quantity included in this beverage are so minimal that their impact is likely negligible. And caffeine? 85mg per serving. Slightly higher than a cup of green tea. Basically, every ingredient falls far short of being able to have any real impact -- other than the sugar. But, I'll let the nutritional panel speak for itself:<br /><br />Serving Size: 8 fl oz (240ml)<br />Servings Per Container: 2<br /><br />Amount Per Serving:<br />Calories: 130<br />Total Carb.: 34g (11%)<br />Sugars: 33g<br />Vitamin C: 60mg (100%)<br />Vitamin B6: 2mg (100%)<br />Folic Acid: 40mcg (10%)<br />Vitamin B12: 6mcg (100%)<br />Zinc: 1.5mcg (10%)<br />Selenium: 7mcg (10%)<br />Sodium: 100mg (4%)<br />Potassium: 20mg (1%)<br /><br />Proprietary Blend: 1.35g<br />Taurine: 1000mg<br />Innositol: 100mg<br />Caffeine: 87mg<br />Panex ginseng Root Extract: 50mg<br />Guarana (Paullinia Cupana) Seed Extract: 25mg<br />Grape Seed Extract: 25mg<br />L-Carnitine: 25mg<br />L-Arginine: 10mg<br /><br />Ingredients: Carbonated Water, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Citric Acid, Taurine, Grape Juice Concentrate (Color), Sodium Citrate, Natural Flavor (Contains Soy), Inositol, Ascorbic Acid, Caffeine, Caramel Color, Fruit Juice Concentrate (Color), Monopotassium Phosphate, Grape Seed Extract, L-Carnitine, L-Arginine Hydrochloride, Zinc Methionine Sulfate, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Guarana (Paullina Cupana) Seed Extractive, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Potassium Sorbate, Selenium Complex with Amino Acids and Polypeptides, Folic Acid, Cyanocobalamin.<br /><br />Well, if that list isn't compelling enough to get you to rush out and slam a few of these, maybe the taste will! The flavor is something akin to a slightly un-ripened fruit blend, with a metallic, vitamin aftertaste. If you aren't yet drooling, then perhaps the energy rush will get your head swirling. Speaking of ... .<br /><br />For an "energy supplement," there was nary a buzz derived from this beverage. I experienced an ever-so-slight perk, likely due to the sugar content, rather than the blend of B-Vitamins, amino acids and caffeine, which was quickly followed by a large crash, again, likely due to the sugar (66g in the entire can, may I remind you!).<br /><br />Bottom line:  No Fear Super Energy drink is essentially nothing more than colored sugar (well, high fructose corn syrup, specifically) water. You're honestly better off drinking a good old 12 ounce can of Mountain Dew, which has better flavor, a bigger energy boost, lower caloric impact and cheaper cost. Fear the No Fear. Big on sugar, low on ... everything else 2 4 
My 13 months old son generally liked the concept of eating by himself but not this combination of beet, berry and banana. It tastes sour probably it tastes sour 3 2 
These are the large bars and the box is huge as a big as a family size of cereal, but 3 times as thick! JUST WISH IT WAS STILL OFFERED AT THE ORIGINAL PRICE!!!! TOO EXPENSIVE NOW big box big bars 4 3 
Summary: Set an alarm to wake up 4.5 hours after falling asleep, take around 10mL of tincture and then go back to sleep for strongly enhanced dream recall, vividness, and possible lucid dreams, OBEs or other phenomena.<br /><br />I have been a lucid dreamer for over a year now, usually having 1-2 per week as well as remembering 2+ dreams most night, so I'm pretty in tune to noticing a change in my dreams. When this arrived I immediately noticed this tincture comes with no dosage information, so I looked around in the comments and decided to start with 1 dropper (roughly 1mL), and didn't notice any difference in the vividness of my dreams. I upped the dose to 3mL the next night, still no effect.  The next night I tried 5mL and smoked a bowl of mj before bed, and it added a nice dreamy feel to the bud and I noticed strong hypnagogic hallucinations as i was falling asleep, but there was no increase in dream recall or vividness, I assumed because of the bud. So I tried 6mL with no smoke, and there was not much difference. A little frustrated at this point i tried a tablespoon, around 15mL, and this worked. That night I had a lucid dream followed by an out of body experience and a few false awakening, much better dream recall and increased vividness. Since then I have experimented with a few different doses, and for the most part have had success by taking 7mL+ a few hours after going to sleep. works, but it takes alot 3 4 
When we received our Keurig Elite for Christmas, we were so excited to break open the sample pack of pods to try out different blends and flavors.  Of the 12 pods we had in the box, four were Green Mountain Coffee brand.  I'd never tried anything from this company before, but from what I had researched online, they have the largest range of Keurig pods and have even bought out competitors to produce coffee under their brand names as well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was immediately disappointed by the quality of the coffee.  We tried their Dark Magic, Decaf and Breakfast Blend and all were underwhelming, to say the least.  I was almost completely set on writing off Green Mountain altogther.<br /><br />We had one GM pod left and being of the mindset of waste-not-want-not, I figured I'd give it one last go around before forgetting about them completely.  And I'm glad I did.<br /><br />The Nantucket Blend is a perfectly pleasing cup of coffee.  It is nice and flavorful without being thick and pungent (unlike some of the other GM blends we tried).  I added some flavored creamer to it and it almost measures up to our go-to Caribou Blend pods.  Almost.  All in all, this is a very standard cup of coffee which, while it isn't anything new or exciting, is very pleasing and definitely one of the better Keurig options we've been able to test out.  When we run out of all the pods we've accumulated, I'll probably pick up a box of these as well.<br /><br />Now that I know Green Mountain isn't completely disappointing I'll definitely be open to trying a few more of their coffees (with our promotion for getting the bewer we ordered <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I3Y4IE">Green Mountain Coffee Golden French Toast,  K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a> to try as well) and see how it goes from there.<br /><br />If you're looking for a go-to choice, this is your cup! A saving grace for Green Mountain Coffee... 4 3 
If this flavor lasted longer than it does, I'd probably die of starvation for lack of wanting to take it out of my mouth. The flavor of the gods 5 3 
This stuff tastes worse that the juice from the olive jar. Oversalted, overpowering taste. To top it all off, I sliced my thumb open trying to pull the little string to get the foil off the top. It was wrapped poorly - the tab you're supposed to pull tore off. Save your $12 (including shipping) and get something else! Overpriced, crappy packaging 2 1 
1 Month ago I looked up this product and it was about $23 for a case. I thought good price I will order next month.  I came back to order and the price nearly doubles!!!  What is with that?  Is there a shortage of coconuts?  Does any one know? What's up with the price? 2 1 
I also asked By nature if their food has menadione on facebook, they told me the organic ones have menadione.  I got the reply about 2 months ago.  So does it or does it not have menadione???? So does it have menadione or not? 3 1 
I got this as a gift and liked the flavor but I wasn't crazy about the texture.  I like fluffy pancakes and believe it or not, imo, Aunt Jemima's buttermilk ready mix is the best one out there and it's so easy to make.<br />Of course, the best tasting waffles are made by me from scratch with buttermilk and all.=)<br />Overall, I think buying gourmet pancake mix is one of the biggest waste of money.  And it still requires you to put melted butter, milk, etc.<br />I am sticking with my own recipes and Aunt Jemima's if I am in a hurry. Tasty mixture but 4 3 
Wow, I had one yesterday and all afternoon and night I was filled with gas.  I couldn't figure out what I ate that caused this but I loved them so much that I was looking on line for a place to order a big box.  I'm so happy that I came across the reviews on Amazon, otherwise I would have ordered more boxes and had to get rid of them.<br />One thing I do know is that if your body is not used to a lot of Fiber that it can upset your stomach.  What you may want to do it gradually introduce it into your diet i.e. start with a third of one and see if that bothers you.  If it does, then its not the fiber - its something else in the bar.  This is what I'm going to try because I really like them.  Thanks for all of the reviews because I'm not sure I would have figured it out.  There is a blog on the internet about these bars complaining about the same thing.  They actually wrote to the company and received a response back that they all had a good laugh for the day!!!!  The blogger said that there is chicory root in the bars and that can cause GI problems I will have to look at the ingredient list myself then look up the chicory root.  If its not that, then its the fiber which means you have to gradually get your body used to it. Taste Great but hell on the stomach 2 5 
Having tried all of the Taco Bell bottled sauces, I have to say this is my least favorite. The chipotle flavor is very powdery, almost chalky, and the overall taste is extremely strong. You don't have to use much of it, literally 1-2 drops on a taco is all you would need, but I found it unpleasant. The other flavors are smooth and well balanced, but the chipotle flavor just doesn't cut it. The consistency of the sauce is good and it lasts a good long time in the fridge, and the 8-oz bottle goes a lot farther than you think it will. very strong with a powdery taste 3 2 
This is a new line for Friskies and is not a "treat" as the title implies. Just another can of cat food to try! My female loves this stuff, can't wait to get it in her dish, and gets quite angry whenever she gets anything else but this or the tuna variety. My male, forget it!  He loves the shredded turkey and cheese but won't go near this one.  Weirdest thing in the world to me - thought he'd go gaga over it like he does his turkey, but he just won't touch this stuff.  Anyway, this is a bit pricey here so check around for a better price.  At least in Ohio it's a bit high!  Highly recommend! Loved by one, hated by the other 5 2 
And where's the vegetable's while your at it? The last 3 or 4 cans of this that I've had has only had 5 or 6 little bits of beef in them. This last one was mostly carrots. It should have been called "Carrots in Beef Broth" Soup. It only had 6 pieces of meat and 5 or 6 little chunks of potato with about 20 pieces of carrots. I usually dump a handful of frozen sweet corn or peas in it and a handful of instant rice to help fill it out. But this time I was out of frozen veggies so I got to see just what ISN'T in the soup. Like there's more stuff missing than in it. Once I finish off the cans that I have left I sure ain't going to waist any more of my money on it.<br /><br />I scanned and uploaded the ingredients on the label from one of the smaller microwavable cans of the same Chunky Beef Soup. What I have got OUT of the can sure ain't like the picture ON the can! where's the Beef? It's "NOT" like the picture on the can! 2 3 
I want folks to know that this ear cleaner definitely has a distinct odor, contrary to what the other review says. However, I am buying lots more of this great stuff, as my kitties don't mind it at all and I find it to be very gentle, effective and it really is natural, with only 4 ingredients. Plus it's alcohol-free, so I have peace of mind that it is safe for my babies and not harsh in any way. And I found it for the cheapest price on Amazon - the key is to buy several bottles for lower shipping & you may as well, since it only comes in a 4 oz size! Stock up now! There definitely is an odor, BUT... 4 5 
Pork roll can be ordered directly from the company in NJ for a lot less - four boxes of preslice is the smallest you can order, a bit expensive to ship - but arrives fresh and ready to enjoy Cheaper to order direct 1 4 
I was really excited to find this product but was disappointed in the results.  I used it to sweeten some carbonated soda and the first sip was great.  Every sip after that had less and less root beer flavor and more and more of the artificial sweetener/alcohol taste.  So now I'm looking for another root beer extract to try! disappointed 1 2 
Have a senseo coffee maker given to me a few years ago. For more than a year, could not find pods sold any more in local supermarkets - even at the big W. Just happened to come across them at Amazon & went on auto-ship every few months for additional savings. I have always liked the French vanilla so no problem there. Still like fresh brewed better but if you want a quick cup of coffee,these are perfect. I'm just happy that I did not jettison the coffee maker & will next look for the Sumatra pods, my other favorite. Senseo pods not easy to find 4 5 
I LOOOVE IT..great coffee..cool name! You should buy it. In fact, I am drinking it right now. It is strong and bold. I have to use at least 20 words but really what else can I say? LOVE IT 4 5 
great service and delivery for a really good product. i am constantly looking for a good hazelnut coffee and so far this is the best, along with green mountain... thanks!!! 4 5 
I have a picky dog with tummy troubles who has to eat a prescription diet.  She loves the Newman's treats but they are too hard for her since she is missing half her teeth.  Still, occasionally I hear a crunching sound and she is munching down a Newman's.  I was hoping she would knaw on these treats and thought the center would be a little easier to eat.  Here's how the trial went:<br /><br />Me:  opening the bag "you want a treat?"<br />Dog:  tail wagging, ears perked up and looking at me intently<br />Me:  I pull one treat from the bag and hand it to her<br />Dog:  She takes it carefully and sets it on the floor. "sniff, sniff".  She looks back up at me.  "sniff".  She walks away and lays down in her bed.<br />Me:  I pick up the treat and sniff and don't smell anything.  This doesn't mean much since I'm not a dog.  I pull on the outside "wrapping".  It's pretty tough.  I push the middle up a little.  It's hard!  I was expecting a softer middle. I taste the middle.  It's tasteless.<br /><br />I tried again to tempt her with one of these treats by giving it to her in place of our nightly "bite of cheese" ritual.  Once again she just sniffed of it and then ignored it.  The other treats I've tried with her (beggin strips, puperoni, blue bison apple/yogurt biscuits, milk bone) she will either attempt to eat or carry around in her mouth for several minutes looking for a safe place to hide it.  These treats don't even get the honor of being buried. tasteless 2 3 
This honey is good. But I can't understand why the price is changed so frequently. One month ago I bought it at Subscribe price 34USD. This time I bought it at Subscribe price 40.83USD. But now it is 39.86USD. From the price aspect I don't recommend it. The price is changed a lot 2 3 
For several months now I have been ordering this by the case on subscribe and save.  Compared to other brands, I have noticed that some cans go bad really quickly once opened.  Also, I recently received a case in which at least several of the cans had coconut oil that had separated from the milk. I know that the white and clear parts of the milk often separate, but i have never opened a can of coconut milk and had a layer of oil on top.  Very disappointed.  Was hopeful because the cans are BPA free so I would like to stick with this company, but how can I justify the expense? We have just thrown away so many cans of it because we weren't sure it was good. Quality varies 2 1 
As of this review, I've also tried Taste of Thai, Thai Kitchen and Thai Pavilion versions. For a Dr. McDougal product, the amount of sodium is inexcusable. Taste of Thai was the lowest in sodium (and best tasting of all, by far) clocking in at just 320 mg. Next in the sodium ladder is Thai Kitchen at 650 mg., then Thai Pavilion at 810 mg. The Dr. McDougal version, which the label says has 480 mg. is for a very small serving size, less than half a serving compared to all the others. So, multiply the McDougal version by 2 to get the real comparative sodium and you're at 960 mg. Like I said, inexcusable and from supposedly a "healthy" product. All I can say is watch your blood pressure folks. Way too much sodium for a Dr. McDougal product 2 3 
My dogs love Newman's the Chicken and the Peanut Butter treats, but didn't care for these treats.  They are about 1.5 inch square and very difficult to break in two.  I felt they were too big and solid to give to the dogs.  After several attempts to entice them with the treats and no happy response, I tossed them.  I will stick to the other Newman's treats. Newman's Lamb and Barley Treats 3 1 
Olive oil in large bold print on the front of the bag is misleading!!  Olive oil is NOT the main oil the chips are cooked in.  The product has more sunflower, corn and canola oils than it does olive oil!! The ingredients are NOT listed in the description.  I should have known better.<br />There are other, much better "Olive Oil" potato chips on the market that use ONLY olive oil. I was quite disappointed in this brand. Disappointed 3 2 
This tuna has a very strong fishy taste. I was also disapointed that there is 100mg of sodium but it says "no salt added". Didn't like this stuff 2 1 
At one time this was my favorite guilty pleasure. Sadly, there's nothing left to enjoy in these dry, flavorless packing peanuts. Once Great Snack Gives Cardboard a Bad Name 1 2

Don't get me wrong, I wanted to try the holiday sampler (mostly coffee) but I ordered the summer sampler with teas.  There were just a couple peach teas, sweet teas, and unsweetened black teas.  I didn't send it back because I wanted to try the holiday sampler.  Almost everything I got was the eggnog coffee, apple ciders, ginger bread coffee, and french toast coffee.  The box was labeled summer sampler, so I'm sure that this was an accident.  I didn't contact the seller because I ordered it while I was gearing up for finals and now there is no contact seller button.  So seller, if you see this review message me and we can talk. Recieved the Holiday Sampler with a Couple Summer Teas 3 2 
One of my boys needed to lose some weight and the other didn't.  I put this food on the floor for the chubby guy, and the protein-rich, no by-product food up higher where only my skinny boy can jump.  The higher food sits going stale.  They both really go for this food.  And my chubby boy has been losing about an ounce a week. My cats LOVE this "diet" food better than their regular food 5 4 
Terrible clunky product.. drawer doesn't open/close without making clunky noises.  Not a space saver, hard on the eyes.  Would return it for a refund if I weren't terribly lazy.  Go to Bed Bath and Beyond and use a 20% off coupon for something else.  Not worth it. Not for us...  better off with a different product! 2 1 
My husband prefers this bread to others he has tried, and ordering in bulk saves money over grocery store purchases. It is relatively easy to make, which is nice.  This review compares Pamela's gluten free to regular bread according to my husband, but that doesn't seem fair! Better than most 3 4

I can't say enough about these nuts, they are fantastic!  I stopped buying them years ago because they were way too expensive but at Amazon's price I'm now a subscription customer.  The only problem with these nuts is that once you open the can you don't want to stop eating them.  They have a Kona Coffee glaze and have just a hint of coffee flavor. I highly recommend this product. Nuts Over These Nuts 5 4 
These taste exactly like cinnamon toast crunch, but with the nutritional composition of almonds. They're pretty mind blowing. Don't be afraid of buying a 6-pack; you'll need it. Cinnamon nom nom noms 5 4 
These cherry tomatoes have a nice flavor although they sort of "deflate" if you cook them for more than a minute.<br /><br />Even out of the can, if you pop one in your mouth, it feels hollow. Hard to describe. I added these tomatoes to a pasta primavera I made the other night and had to remove them from the heat after just a minute because half of them had already started to collapse.<br /><br />I shared this order with a friend so now I'm left with 11 cans and I think I'll use most of them in pizzas or to make quick sauces. And if that works out then I'll keep the Subscribe and Save on this item, otherwise I'll have to cancel.<br /><br />I can't recommend this product because, in my opinion, the tomatoes should be firmer and not collapse like these do.<br /><br />Also, these cherry tomatoes are not peeled.<br /><br />Prompt delivery, but six of the cans arrived dented. Good flavor but not as plump 3 2 
These are so healthy, and I feel great giving them to my children.  I was disappointed with the packaging, though.  I am opening my second box and found that some of the packages of puree weren't sealed properly in the corners and they leaked on the others.  What a mess!  I bought another variety in the same brand and it was fine.  I would probably buy these again, but I don't know. Healthy product, bad package sealing 2 3 
I am fairly certain this is the same tea sold by Caribou Coffee.  I think I could be considered an addict! The flavor is so good - lots of cinnamon and slightly spicy because of it.  Price for 50 is good and less than I have been able to find it elsewhere. Delicious tea! 5 4 
This is one of the best dog foods on the market.  It saved me quite a bit of money to order it directly through Amazon rather than try to find it locally. Canidae Dog Food 4 5 
The liquor filled chocolates arrived in perfect condition and were securely but attractively packaged. i am unable to comment on the flavor as they were purchased for a gift. The secure packaging prevented me from sampling the various flavors. Liquor Filled Chocolates 5 3 
Not too sweet.  The best K-cup hot chocolate I've tried thus far. The kids loved drinking and making the hot chocolate. Tasty 4 5 
I can't tell who this is targeted to, but it doesn't seem to fit kids or adults, in my opinion.<br /><br />It's a small, skinny can - just 8.3 ounces, compared to a typical soda can at 12 ounces.  It's all juice and there's no sugar added, as promised.  But there's still 33 grams of sugar, compared to 35 grams in a full sugar version of regular Coca Cola.  They also aren't kidding about not full carbonation.  It's not exactly flat, but it's close to it, and it actually needs the carbonation to cut down on the sweetness.  This is some seriously thick-tasting juice to my palate.<br /><br />This is something like an amped up Welch's, according to my taste buds - slightly more complex tasting, but not as interesting as a Snapple or any one of the similar individually bottled fruit drinks out there.  It's hard to describe, but with a less sweet juice, you can pull the flavors apart and say, tell the kiwi and strawberry apart in the drink.  This isn't that kind of juice.<br /><br />The "black cherry" is made up of apple, grape, acerola and cherry juices - reconstituted - with filtered sparkling water, so it's not particularly bad stuff, but aside from the 100% daily dose of vitamin C you get, there's nothing here to recommend it over a glass of orange juice either.<br /><br />Sorry, if I want a carbonated fruit drink, I'd rather add ginger ale to a Snapple or Sprite to CranApple or something - this is just way, way too syrupy, even for a kids' drink.  Maybe it's being targeted as something convenient and fun for kids, but it's an awful lot of sugar for an alternative to soda. Ugh, too sweet 1 3 
I've purchased a few of these, and they are very reliable. I've used them with Win7 and OS X. The A/D quality is acceptable for most needs. The limited bit depth and sample rate are probably the only drawbacks. Works well if all you need is 16-bit, 48kHz mono 5 4 
These arrived in the middle of May and they have an expiration date of the first week of July. This means I have to eat a lot of these in the next few weeks! Just beware if you're planning on stocking up for the future...the future will get here very soon with these!<br /><br />It's also interesting that the box inside the Amazon box says "For internal use only". I'm not sure what that's about! Good product but not fresh 4 3 
A good product at a reasonable price. I find some of the product to be somewhat hard, harder when compared to other suppliers. Professor E 3 4 
I agree with this product's description as it having a unique" flavor. While the flavor is not unpleasant it has a certain Asian quality to it. I am a traditional tea drinker, but tried this one out to see what it was like. I enjoy lemon and ginger, as well as honey so I figured this would make for an interest brew. It does have a bite to it due to the ginger- a slight heat to the back of the throat. On the whole the aroma was divine and made my allergy nose open up a bit and feel great. The overall flavor is that of an herbal healing broth, not so much a relaxation and read-a-book cup of warmth. I would recommend this for those looking for herbal remedies that taste like the ingredients they are made with. This unique flavor is full of ginger and a touch of honey. Ginger has a bit of bite 3 4 
The tree came on time; but two words describe the tree I receive:  Ugly and sickly.  Obviously, I am not as lucky as the others in the reviews had said their trees were so wonderful.  Mine is consisted of only one twig, no branching, nothing like the picture!  I contacted the seller; he told me that in the description it says, "Tree shape and size may vary" and refused to exchange my purchase.  I understand that every bonsai tree may have been shaped differently but mine hardly has any shape at all; it is not artistically styled to be a bonsai tree, it is basically a slim twig stick inside a ceramic container.  I guess you have to be so lucky to receive a decent tree as shown in the picture.  Awful experience, I am very disappointed! Disappointed 2 1 
I really liked how my hair looked at first when I tried this shampoo but by day 3 and 4 I started developing itchy bumps on my scalp. I also realized that this product was leaving a film on my hair. I had been using sulfate free shampoos for the last few years but I broke down and bought this because of all the great reviews. This shampoo is not for everyone. If you're at all sensitive to chemicals, stay away. I went back to an awesome shampoo that I stick with. Every time I try something new, nothing treats my hair and scalp the way Henna Hut shampoos do. I've tried them all and I like their Neem shampoo the best. I don't work for them. I'm just a customer who appreciates them more and more every time I try other products. Itchy Bumps Developed On My Scalp 1 2 
I thought this was a great deal in the warehouse deals section, but it was pretty nasty and smelled like dog food when I opened each bag.  Slim Jim is made of crap too but at least it tastes good. Tastes a lot like dog food 1 2 
Just tried this Pumkin Spice Coffee.  Spouse said it left an after taste.  I couldn't taste the Pumkin -- the only reason to buy Pumkin Spice coffee.  Label says its Low Acidic -- that's a plus if the coffee was better.  Bean Coffee Engineer's have some work to do on this Pumkin Blend.<br /><br />PROBLEM:  We got use to GODAVIA, Pumkin Spice Coffee which is the VERY VERY BEST!  Unfortunately it is also $$$$$ VERY Pricey. NOT Pumkin Spice Coffee 1 2 
I HAVE ALWAYS LIKE BUSTELO ESPRESSO REGULAR, AND STILL DO. I FIND VERY LITTLE DIFFERENCE IN TASTE BETWEEN THE BUSTELO PREMIUM AND THE REGULAR TO MERIT THE EXTRA COST. NOT WORTH THE EXTRA MONEY 1 2 
Before I ordered this coffee, I read reviews both here at Amazon and on other sites.  I used reviewers comments to base my decision to purchase it.  I am a lover of Starbucks Espresso Decaf coffee.  I have my own Breville espresso machine at home.  I have been using Starbucks for years.  My Lavazzo coffee arrived and I was eager to give it a try.  I opened the tin to find brown coffee - while I already knew I would be disappointed because I already know I prefer Black coffee beans to brown. While it pulled a decent looking cup, I put it to my mouth only to find it did not match my tastebuds. One sip was all it took for me to hand it off to my husband.  So. My verdict here is, if you are like me and enjoy only black bean coffee DO NOT buy this product.  If you prefer brown bean coffee, give it a go. Nothing like Starbucks coffee 1 4 
I had high hopes for this - I added it to seltzer water and it tastes every so slightly like root beer...more like diet root beer.  I was hoping to use this as a soda replacement to try to be a bit healthier - but I doubt we'll even finish this bottle. Ick 1 2 
I love the idea of this product but with larger pills the beef pill pockets are much easier to mold around the pill than the chicken. Although my dogs love both flavors my boxer can easily eat the pill pocket and spit out the pill with the chicken flavor but does not do that with the beef flavor again because it is easier to bury the entire pill in the pocket using the beef.  They work great with smaller pills. Sue 3 2 
I got these in the mail today, i know right, sounds so weird to say i got hash browns in the mail, haha.  Come in dry ice cooler and were in box all in their own lil plastic bags.  Just stick them on a baking sheet for 35 min. at 400 degrees.  when you get them out of the oven you smell the cheese and it has nice crunchy outside with creamy potato inside, if you want the best side dish to your steak or other meat, hey could even use for breakfast with some eggs and sausage, your choice, this get a 5/5 for taste, 5/5 for presentation, buy these now, great price too, thanks for your time, and thank you omaha steaks, the best at great prices. These are the best hash browns!!!!!!!!!! 5 4 
well, do you know how difficult it is to find WHITE RICE PUFFED RICE?<br /><br />Only company that does it is QUAKER.<br /><br />Millet doesn't cut it. sorry. won't but it again.<br /><br />Have tried all the puffed rice products. Most don't tell you that these puffed rice products are BROWN RICE PUFFED RICE.. Truth in advertising?<br /><br />I think not.<br /><br />BROWN RICE PUFFED just doesn't have the taste of WHITE RICE PUFFED.<br /><br />I can still find it at ALBERTSONS at around $4 bucks a box. tasteless 2 1 
We have previously had Davidson's English Breakfast tea and stored it in a plastic clear container.  We bought the Davidson's Earl Grey tea and within 3 days the clear plastic container has been chemically etched where the tea had touched it.  The container ultimately became totally opaque and now permanently shows where the tea level was.  The tea tastes good but one has to ask 'Is this good for you?' - I doubt it and will not be buying the Earl Grey again.<br /><br />I have since been in contact with Davidson's.  They believe that the oils in Earl Grey may be the culprit (never heard of oils affecting plastic before!).  I have since sent them the container and they have sent it to their management for review.  Davidson's have also said they are going to send me a glass container in return. CHEMICALS 2 1 
The probe has a braided metal outer jacket on the cable that causes any flexing of the cable to strain the cable where it exits the probe.  This condition causes failure (shorting of the sensor wires to the jacket) at that point.  I have had 2 other probes with this type of cable that failed in that mode.  The best type of cable is a thick silicone jacket like used on microwave temp probes. Bad probe design..... 2 1 
Like most of the US, our local stores were all out of canned pumpkin and didn't expect any more to be available until after the Fall 2010 harvest.<br /><br />So, I turned to what I thought was a reliable online retailer - Amazon - to fill the gap.<br /><br />I read the other reviews, but not until AFTER I placed the order.  My mistake, I know.<br /><br />I was optimimistic that perhaps I'd be one of the lucky buyers who didn't get any serious dents.  Unfortunately, just like others reported the case came sealed in two boxes.  The inner box was well packed with bubble wrap covering the already sealed case of pumpkin cans.  The cans were dented even in the middle of the sealed case.  They had clearly been packaged this way and not damaged in shipment.  I find it appalling that Farmer's Market is using Amazon.com as a way to sell its dented and damaged product, knowing full well that buyers cannot visually inspect the product prior to purchase. Farmer's Market is clearly packing dented cans and marketing them through Amazon.com 1 5 
We had been eyeballing this on the shelf for a couple weeks at the local grocery store and were thrilled to get it to review.  My favorite cereals are Honey Nut Cheerios, Honey Bunches of Oats, or Crispix.  If it is my birthday or a camping trip and I am going to indulge in a sweet cereal I prefer Frosted Flakes. Cereal tends to be a sweet breakfast treat, and not a staple in our home, so I can overlook the nutrition facts.<br /><br />Probably the best way I could describe Kellogg's Crunchy Nut is "greasy Kix."  It left a funky aftertaste and slime on my tongue.  The flavor, even before the aftertaste, wasn't good, though it was not the most horrible cereal in the world.  It was edible so I gave it an one star more than something... inedible.  My son thought it was ok, though not a favorite, but this seems to be packaged as an "adult" cereal so his vote doesn't count.  I was done after my first bowl and let him finish the rest over the course of two weeks.  This is unusual in my house as we usually go to blows on who gets the last bowl of cereal.  Even my son did not ask to repurchase!<br /><br />Unfortunately this failed for me.  Sorry Kellogg's! Greasy Kix? 2 5 
I had gotten tired of the Redbulls and 5 Hour Energys of the world and thought I'd try something new. I'm a big fan of anything pomegranate flavored and my dad (who rides 50-70 miles a week) said these made a big difference for him. The flavor is great but I haven't noticed any sort of energy pick up after eating them. I've since switched to Sambozan Acai energy drinks and those are a huge improvement. Not so sure about these... 2 3 
I purchased a case of this product in the hopes to find an alternative to the high calorie, high sugar beverage I normally drink.  Dr Pepper has been my favorite for years.  I have tried other beverages that were supposed to be cheaper versions of it, only to be disappointed every time.  I thought, with this version (Dr Zevia) being so much more expensive and using stevia to sweeten as a healthier alternative than sugar, that this would likely be closer to the brand name beverage it was trying to be like.  Unfortunately, I found it not only wasn't closer to the flavor, it was much worse than any I had tried in the past!  It was like drinking carbonated cough syrup!  I did not return it because my son decided to drink it and suffer through it to try to reduce his caloric intake, but if he wants more of it, he will have to buy it himself.  I will never again spend 4 times the amount I spend for the real deal, just to be disappointed by what is expected to be a high quality product. Not Even A Knockoff 1 2 
While, we wouldn't have blind tasted picked out the idea of Mozzarella for these, the flavor is still cheesy and good. Everyone in my family enjoyed these. A light flavor that left us all fighting over the to the last bite. Definitely going on the grocery list. Cheesy 4 3 
The product itself is good I suppose.  Maybe it's just my dog.  I have a 7 month old lab, and he can't figure out how to get the food out very well.  It's kinda hard for me too--I have to hold the rope part with one hand and shake the bottle with the other hand.  So I can see why it's hard for dogs.  But anyway--the product is very durable, and maybe Samson will learn the trick one day. Pretty good 3 4 
Item arrived swiftly however, a lot of the cans were dented. If you can live with a dent in your can, the product is perfect inside. Highly recommended seller. Organic Canned Pumpkin 4 3 
I love rice and really had hopes that this product would be great. Rice can be a pain to make, with this only taking 90 seconds in the microwave, it was really appealing! Really I should have known better though... a product being cooked in a plastic bag is going to come out smelling like plastic. The smell of plastic was pretty stomach turning, couldn't possibly be good for you.... Smells like the plastic you cook it in! 1 2 
You would think that if a company goes as far as producing an organic product, the rest of the packaging would be safe.  I will no longer be purchasing from this company until  they change this.  I would pay more if it were in glass. Has BPA in lining 3 1 
the coffee tastes good when there aren't grounds in the coffee. i thought first time i made the mistake somehow...i don't know how since you just plop the kcup in the machine, but now it's happened for like 1/2 the kcups...it's terrible and a waste. this has never happened with other ones. i have other ones from different companies and it never happens, just with these caribou daybreak morning blend ones. :( grounds in the coffee 2 1 
This cereal is difficult to find in the stores so I appreciate being able to purchase it through Amazon.  My husband really likes it and looks forward to the delivering of it every month.  Seems like an unlikely thing to look forward to, but it's the little things that count.  P. Looney cereal 5 4 
I ordered these when trying to find a chicken treat that is USA made. For years I had bought the Waggin Train brand.  My dog loved them, but had a diarrhea every time she went "number two" and neither we nor our vet could figure out why.  Finally after seeing the story about chews made in China, I stopped buying them.  Within a week my dog had totally stopped her diarrhea!  She has hardly had it one time since and that was last year.  Back to topic - the bag does say USA made which is comforting, but the chews are very hard and crunchy.  I just rescued a male Shih Tzu and he ate them, but my girl wasn't impressed.  I am still searching for a USA made chew that is not hard as a rock. Okay but not a home run 3 1 
I have been GF for the past year and have tried all sorts of flour alternatives. This one is certainly the best, and the best part about it, is you can substitute it for any creation that calls for original bisquick. The best so far is the waffles that you can make following the directions on the back. I will be ordering again!! My only complaint is that the boxes are small compared to the other boxes of bisquick available on the shelves. Finally, a tasty GF baking mix 5 4 
The kids love the hot cocoa and I like the fact that I can get the stuff shipped to me when I need it without worry of order. Hot Cocoa right on time 4 5 
This "Baby White" popcorn pops small and somewhat hard.  I have tried several batches with various adjustments of heat, using a "whirlypop" popcorn popper.  Unsatisfactory results!  I won't purchase this again. Baby White Popcorn 1 2 
Wasnt happy with this purchase. Coffee was completly stale I guess thats why they price was good, But wont purchase again. Stale 1 2 
i ordinarily eat plain cheerios or oatmeal for breakfast, so trying this cereal was like having a candy bar for breakfast.  that being said, i think this crunch nut cereal resembles honey nut cheerios in appearance, but the flavor is more like that honey smacks cereal.  i thought it was very sweet (but that might be because of what my usual breakfast is), and did not notice any nut flavor at all. very sweet, not enough nut flavor 2 3 
The package was wrapped properly. The cookies were not fresh. They were broken into small pieces. Considering shipping charge, overall the price wasn't worth for these cookies. I wish I had purchased more at the Disneyland. Mickey Mouse Shortbread 1 2 
At least half the cans in my last order arrived in a crushed condition; not just dented but caved in. The inner and outer cardboard cartons that they were packed in were not damaged, so the cans had to have been damaged at the time the cartons were packed by the manufacturer, and not damaged during shipping. The can condition was such as manufacturers commonly donate to food banks, knowing that retail supermarket shoppers would not touch them. Perhaps disposing of such product through Amazon.com rather than taking a charitable writeoff is a more cost effective strategy for a manufacturer. Buyer beware when buying products sight unseen. The chicken itself was OK. Damaged goods 3 2 
This is a great product, however, you can buy it in a salumeria in Brooklyn, NY for $9.99.  Frank & Sal on 18th Avenue--Brooklyn. And I'm editing my review because amazon assigned me the profile name "LIAR LIAR." Animals! I was only stating a fact about what a rip-off the site is.  In the future ,Amazonn please don't call me a liar. That's not nice you stupid thieves. great product--but a rip-off on this site 4 3 
Well, The smell was not as bad as Redbull but I still had to hold my breath while I drank it. I have no idea what flavor it is supposed to be but it is tolerable.<br /><br />The definite pros are that it did work well. Each can has two servings, I downed them both after a particularly grueling workout. I'm happy to report that I did feel renewed and my energy levels lifted and kept me going for the rest of the day.<br /><br />I would use this product again - however I might add I would prefer a Full Throttle for better flavor. Also what is it with the Soy? Why is soy in this drink? To what end? So I suppose I should add that those with Soy allergies will/should take a pass on this. Not my favorite but it does work 3 4 
I received the hazelnut order yesterday.  The box was wet, some of the hazelnut was leaking and I had to throw out some of the product.  It has been not a good experience.<br /><br />Joyce Kwartler<br /><br />joycekwartler@yahoo.com leaking of international hzelnut delight 2 1 
I ordered the chocolate hemp shake hoping that it would be easier to drink (or for that matter, to keep down) than the bulk protein powder, but I was not impressed. The only liquid I seem to be able to get this to mix into without having large lumpy chunks was coffee-hot coffee. I'm not sure what the high temperature does to the protein, so this left me a little frustrated. If you want hemp protein I would actually suggest just buying the bulk protein and dealing with the bad taste. Mixes poorly and tastes bad-but a good source of fiber and protein 2 3 
Needed some bulk quantity jelly beans to fill small jars for baby shower favors.  Buying them this way saved a lot of money over buying them by the pound at the local candy store.  As stated in another review, the jelly beans just come in an unlined cardboard box.  This seemed a bit odd, but there were 2 sheets of wax paper, I guess to prevent dust, etc from getting into the box through the top and bottom.  Not much else to say, they're Jelly Belly's at about half the cost of the local guy! Jelly Belly's are the Best 5 4 
This is good smooth harissa.<br />This brand is the most commonly found in France and my Moroccan Grandma was swearing by it.<br />I would get a lot more if the shipping charge were not so ridiculous! Typical product 5 4 
To me, fruit juice in small cans are simply a staple - first example that comes to mind is good ol' Dole pineapple juice. The trend towards trendy little "health" beverages in overpriced little cans is nearly tragic.<br /><br />There is nothing about this product that would compel me to buy it. If I want a soda, I'll just grab one. I don't drink enough of them to have much dietary impact and despite the claim of "100% What You Want", there is nothing in here for me. If I want 100% Of What I Want, I will buy a few oranges and some seltzer water. If I want "0% Of What You Don't Want", well, why buy it?<br /><br />This is a time when we had better look pretty closely at what is an indulgent convenience and what is a necessity, and how to find a happy medium. I consider the likes of Pellegrino Aranciata, Orangina and Izze a luxury, and when I indulge it is a true delight.<br /><br />"Switch" is a product that is not better tasting, proven healthier, or even less expensive than any of many other alternatives. Once again marketing is driving product creation and design, and that is a hateful concept.<br /><br />If you want a similar taste experience for about the same price,  pick up some Alka-Seltzer Cold Plus Nighttime- you'll stop sneezing and sniffling and get a great night's sleep. "I'd Rather Fight Than Switch" 1 2 
I love coffee, but I also love not having to messing with the coffee maker sometimes.  This instant espresso is the best I have tried and I have tried about 7 different brands.<br /><br />Not overly acidic at all, melts instantly in hot water (no sand dunes left swirling at the top if your cup), travels wonderfully (compact jar) and is very versitile to have around for cooking:<br /><br /> -- I but a tsp. in a batch of brownies to deepen the dark chocolate flavor<br /><br /> -- I put a Tbs in a BIG batch of chili to compliment the spices and add extra richness.<br /><br /> -- I add a bit to mexican mole sauce for punch.<br /><br /> -- I also put it in: chocolate granache icing, chai tea with milk for a java chai latte, coffee drink mixes for extra umph, etc.<br /><br />It is over 5 bucks at some supermarkets, when/if you can even find it, so it is nice to know it is cheaper at amazon! SOOOoo Good and VERY versitile 5 4 
As a warning - I am not a vegan, I do not hug trees (though I do love them), and I really am not into the whole organic movement (though I have no problem with it).... If my stance on those three "issues" was different, I might love this product... as it is, I found it to be somewhat disgusting.<br /><br />I typically drink Meijer branded chocolate shake mix (Meijer is a western US mega-store & the shake mix is a knock-off of what slimfast puts in a can).  I hoped that this mix would taste at least somewhat (even a little bit) like the meijer brand.... The ways that I described this taste to my wife each morning... well, they aren't good... I'm listing a few:<br /><br />- It tasted like rope<br />- It tasted like licking a wet horses bridle<br />- It tasted like sucking the water out of a wet hemp bracelet<br />- It tasted like someone had mixed dirt in with my unsweetened baker's cocoa<br />- It tasted like chewing on tree bark<br /><br />In all seriousness, the "rope" & "wet hemp bracelet" analogies are the closest... I used to wear a lot of hemp (before doing so was part of the "organic" eating movement I guess?)... and I remember chewing on the necklace/bracelets.  This product tastes just like that.<br /><br />Another note - I was not impressed by the blending of this stuff.  Most shake mixes actually dissolve in liquid; this stuff just sorta clumped into the liquid.<br /><br />On the other hand, I ate (almost) all of it... and it was much more palatable once I mixed it in with the meijer shake mix (2 parts meijer mix, 1 part this stuff).  The fiber content is really high (always a plus).. and it was fairly reasonable.<br /><br />So, if you are into the earth loving hipster movement or are just a standard faire hippy - this stuff might be for you.  For Joe Six-pack (even the liberal type), this product should probably be avoided. Nutritious and... Ropey 1 2 
These noodles are excellent. Be aware that they are not Fried Ramen... these are much healthier. This one was a little basic for me right out of the package, but when i have a craving for noodles, I always make them my own when I cook. I added fresh ginger, tofu, broccoli and soy and these were excellent. I am going to try the mushroom next as they seem to be the ones people give the best review for. Great Noodles! 4 5 
I did not think coconut and dark chocolate could ever taste bad.<br />I was expecting mainly those 2 ingredients. I was wrong. It's mostly a date flavor and texture with a sprinkle of coconut and a thin chocolate coating. I did not taste cashews or almonds at all. Maybe the folks that are rating these bars highly have acquired a taste for such items. Little coconut, lots of dates, minimal nuts 1 2 
I was pleased with the product's taste and texture, but it didn't make great BMs for me (made them a bit sticky without getting to graphic). I tend to have a sensitive system. I have switched to brown rice because that makes my innards feel better and the BMs better, but it is harder to make sushi with brown rice. Pretty good rice 4 3 
I truly love the Rieme Pomegranate Sparkling Lemonade.  DO NOT, repeat: DO NOT order this product online and have it shipped.  I ordered 4 bottles, and 2 of the bottles leaked have of it contents into the shipping box.  It took me 20-30 minute to clean the mess up and salvage the 2 other bottles.  (It would have cost more and been a huge mess to return for credit)  The "unique metal fastener seal" on this bottle is not designed to be shipped FedEx or UPS. BUY THIS PRODUCT FROM YOUR LOCAL RETAILER. Excellent product, NOT made for shipping.  Buy it in a store. 1 2 
Syrup was not terrible, but as other reviews have mentioned, the chocolate flavor is a bit too subtle for my liking. Also, while I love other flavors, this one has a slightly odd aftertaste. A bit lacking 2 3 
I purchased the Kyjen Dog Games Paw Hide Treat Toy.  Labs are exceptionally smart and I try to give mine, Autumn, a variety of challenging toys.  She loves her chew toys but she needs to be challanged.  First of all she found her toy under the tree wrapped and without a treat in it.  How did she do that?  With encouragement we allowed her to open her toy.  I took it away after she examined it.  While she wasn't looking I put a few treats in a few of the compartments.  It took her a few minutes to figure it out.  Next time, no challange at all.  That is why I only gave it 4 stars.  It was too easy, but I think to some dogs it will be great, others fustrating.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043A71PU">Kyjen Dog Games Paw Hide Treat Toy</a> Just too smart 4 3 
In the past I've enjoyed drinks with Aloe Vera. And I love green tea, so I had high hopes for this drink.  The taste is ok, though the bits of passion fruit make give it a texture that is rather slimy. That combined with the fact a one cup serving has 80 calories, makes this a drink I would have to pass up.  This might not be a problem for green tea drinkers that are not worried about calories, but they might be turned off by the bits of passion fruit floating around in the drink.  Also the price is a bit prohibitive.  It works out to $2.08 per bottle, which seems a bit much for an 11.5 oz drink. Ok, taste, but too many calories  and too expensive 2 3 
I've dipped into my new bag of Chocolate Pirate Booty (eww?) twice, and although my experience has been consistent, it makes for a difficult review.<br /><br />First, the appearance: I won't bring this into work. I'm a brave person who does zany and odd-looking things at work, but the resemblance of this snack to poop cannot be overstated. I just can't bring myself to indulge in this snack in public. Can't do it.<br /><br />Then the texture: this is very, very similar to the cheese and veggie pirate booty snacks. The crunch is the same, less powder gets onto your hands, and it seems to have a bit more oil in it. No complaints about the texture.<br /><br />Now the taste: Um. The first one always tastes burnt and yucky. Then I try a second and a third, the chocolate powder flavor kicks in and identifies itself as chocolate instead of burnt stuff, and I find myself addicted and reaching for the next chocolate doodle without knowing whether or not I actually *like* the flavor. It seems the more I eat it, the more I like it. It's a strange, strange substance and I'm glad I tried it, but I won't know until I'm finished with the bag whether I'll purchase it again or not. It's likely I'll take it in to game night as a gag sometime so we can all have a laugh about poop doodles. (poodles?)<br /><br />I recommend trying it just because it's so incredibly unique, but if you find the appearance off-putting and the flavor incomprehensible, you heard it here first. Very Strange Snack 3 2 
I cannot understand for the life of me why dye is added to color foods. I was excited to receive this to find out it has dyes and preservatives in it (which is not a good combo). I like to eat foods without these so I will be giving this away to the local food pantry. Contains Dye in it - So unnecessary 2 1 
If you're new to caviar or don't like overly fishy tastes, this is a fine pick. I prefer stronger taste and larger eggs. With better caviars, a little goes a long way. With this, you'll use larger portions - luckily, it's inexpensive enough to do so. Smooth and mild 3 4 
I have purchased this particular item several times (10-12 canisters)and have been somewhat disappointed in at least half of these purchases.  I don't know how the process is done when adding the salt and pepper, but on most of the containers I have purchased, the salt and pepper did not stick to the cashew - hence, just another cashew!  I have waited for months in between purchases to see if the next canister is better - sometimes yes, normally no.  I don't know if I will continue to take a chance on purchasing these really good cashews (when S&P adhere to cashew)as they are rather expensive and I am tired of not getting what I pay for. Somewhat disappointed 4 3 
I enjoy sodas and carbonated drinks, but don't drink too many of them because I'm trying to consume healthier things.  I was sent a can of The Switch through the Amazon's vine program to review.<br /><br />The smell is very strong, medicine-like, and somewhat unapproachable.  The taste on the other hand is very sweet, and it does have hints of the kiwi and strawberry flavors.  It's a little too sweet for my liking, but I am the type of person who drinks juice watered down.<br /><br />As far as being a "healthy alternative to soda", they do a pretty good job.  There's no HFCS (a big plus), and no artificial colors.  On the other hand, all of the juice in it is "reconstituted from concentrates".  The can says it has "natural flavors" which I always consider a dubious term to hide behind on items claiming to be "healthy".  Also, and 8.3 oz can of "The Switch" has 135 calories, while a 8.3 oz of Coke has roughly 109 calories, so this thing is a sugar bomb (even though it says there is "no sugar added".  No kidding!  It doesn't need it!).<br /><br />If you like really sweet things, then this might be a good buy for you.  As for myself, I don't think I'd go out of my way to try this again. Good, but a little too sweet for my taste 3 2 
(These'd be ranked 4.5 if possible.)<br /><br />Holy crap, this preserve is amazing~!<br />They taste just like fresh out of the orchard strawberries, with a little extra sugar. If they got rid of one of the sugar sources, or reduced it by a touch, this would be hands down, one of the best fruit spreads I've ever eaten. Amazing preserves, just a tad too sweet 4 5 
It works and the taste is very pleasing. I will order again to get through those occasional sleepy afternoons. Works faster than a cup of coffee. Tastes Great! 4 5 
OK.  I admit it.  Cats can be finicky.  They can be very picky about wet food, so I wouldn't write reviews about canned, wet food.  But treats are another matter.  I've tried a lot of treats.  Usually, one of my three cats will eat the treats.  I have one who is picky, one who isn't particularly fussy and one who is a chow hound.  I keep seeing healthy treats and trying them.  I am such a fool!  As my cats started getting older, I worry about their mobility.  I tried some Omega-3 salmon oil and that was a fail.  I tried some of these treats.  Not one cat would eat them.  When I leave food out for them, sometimes it will eventually get eaten.  Not these.  So I gave them to an office mate at work who has two kittens.  Neither of his cats would touch these treats.<br /><br />I can't attest to the effectiveness of these treats.  But if you are looking for a healthy treat, try another brand.  It seems that these treats are disliked by lots of cats.  I'll give two stars instead of neutral three because so many cats won't touch these treats.<br /><br />What's a good Cat Parent to do?!<br /><br />PS.  My cats all like Whisker Lickins tartar control treats, so I've signed up for an Amazon subscription for them since they price is the best.  I think you would be hard pressed to find a cat that does not like the WL treats.<br /><br />PPS. Every one of my cats loves Trader Joe's Tuna for Cats and it was the only food my deathly ill cat would eat for several weeks.  It probably saved her life. Five strikes against these treats 2 5 
We have cans of the blue Rockstar in this house. We don't drink energy drinks everyday anymore. I did not care for the taste at all. I'd rather just drink a bottle of Mt. Dew. or 2, in replacement of the caffeine. I am not a fan of any sour, and this to me, was sour tasting. Not for me 1 2 
The kernels were small and there were lots of hulls. 98% of the corn popped, no complaints here.I should have purchased  six one pound bags of different varieties, instead of one 6# bag of the same item. not the best popcorn 1 2 
I only took a couple sips of this before I decided it wasn't for me.  The first sip sort of burned the back of my throat as it went down, and it wasn't because of the temperature.  The second sip was a little better, I guess I was expecting it, but still too much ginger for my taste buds.  The lemon was sort of an after taste, which wasn't bad.  There were not directions on the package as to how much water to use.  Perhaps it was meant for two cups, or a VERY large mug?<br />  Maybe if it was mixed with tea and diluted it would be better. flavor okay, but too much ginger. 1 3 
I am a coffee fanatic - drink it day and night, no, coffee does not keep me awake.  I am enjoying the flavor of Emerils bold.  When I got my Keurig it came with a sample pak and in it were two samples of Emerils coffee.  I immediately went to Amazon to see if I could order larger amounts than at the Keurig site.  I am so glad I did as, yes, Amazon had larger paks at a very reasonable price.  This will become one of my repeat orders in the future. Great Taste 4 5 
Good firm texture, comparing to other silken firm, this is just the right consistency. Hassle-free, it is easy to come out from the container Tofu shape as is.  Easy to handle and manage rather than crash or smash it. GOOD TOFU 5 4 
VERY PICKY about my k-cups, some are to sweet or others are to strong.  This k-cup coffee is perfect in the a.m.  It was a great deal and will last us a long time. Great coffee for the price 4 5 
If you want a good cup of coffee and are rushed for time or your household is like mine and you are the only coffee drinker, then you must give this a try. I admit the price is a little high but for that occasional cup it is well worth it. No bitter after taste like other instants Instant coffee without the instant taste 4 5 
I was really disappointed when I opened my box of snacks yesterday. This product claimed to be pure cheese and even says it contains no MSG when in fact it has autolyzed yeast, maltodextrin and yeast extract. For those who don't know those are just synonyms for MSG but they hide it under any name they can. Check out the site www.msgmyth.com. Good dog treats 2 1 
This product is delicious.  I will say this upfront - Thou semi messy (why not place the peanut butter in the center??? Instead on the back?)  The taste is great.  So great that I started to eat them all day -- not good as it ruins the enjoyment!!!<br /><br />These are actually so good I had to stop eating them!!! (I guess I over did it!!!)<br /><br />Value:  Excellent snack for everyone (all my friends love them) / family.<br /><br />Shipping:  Fast (as always with Amazon Prime membership - 2 days)<br /><br />Packaging:  6 Boxes Total - each contains 6 individually wrapped granola "thins"  (1/3 of granola bar but flat with peanut butter on one side [seriously).<br /><br />Also do not ruin the granola as I did by eating every day!!! Also I notice to avoid mess just open with scissors!!! (pealing makes a mess!!!)<br /><br />[...]  Exclusively Delicious &  HEALTHY SNACK 5 4 
i assumed since Lorann seems to be the market leader in the cake & candy semi-pro flavorings arena, that this would be an excellent product.  I was making a lot of milk shakes with the standard McCormick strawberry flavoring, found in most grocery stores, which worked well but was getting expensive.  I thought this might help me save some money.  Boy was I wrong.  No matter what I did, I couldn't get anything resembling a strawberry flavor.  I couldn't believe it, so I literally titrated the stuff into a glass of whole milk with one tablespoon of sugar added.  Drop by drop.  2-3 drops wasn't too noticeable.  By 9 to 10 drops, there was a horrible chemical mouthfeel, almost a mouth burn.  It was as though I was drinking Kodak film developer or something.  Maybe there was the slightest hint of strawberries, but nobody would have found it palatable. Avoid buying unless you know for certain it will work...I'm giving it 2 stars instead of one because I can't be sure it doesn't somehow become edible after certain cooking or processing steps. carefully consider your intended use of this product 2 1 
I spent close to $4.00 for each cube which turned out to be the 16oz size.  I know it says that upon further review but I was assuming it was the 3lb size because that size is $3.99 at the grocery.  And I just paid the same thing for the 1lb size?!  Shame on you Amazon.  Or better yet shame on me.  The expiration date is fast approaching too so I'm not even sure I'll use these up in a month.  I was very disappointed in the price as well as the expiration date.  I had the same issue with some sunflower seeds I bought recently, they expired before baseball season even started.  However, I did get what I paid for...it's just my mistake for not realizing the size was not what I thought I was getting.  Who would pay that for the 1lb size? Way over priced for the size 2 1 
The tea tastes great hot or iced.  Very good for the price.  I recieved the package fast with no problems. Very good tea! 5 4 
The quality of the food has declined drastically.  My 3 cats refused to eat no more than 3 bits of the food.  Looks like a more water downed version of potted meat. Quality declined drastically. 1 2 
The taste although very sweet is closer to a molasses taste than other grade B Maple syrups in my opinion. Tastes of molasses a little. 2 3 
Original review -- I thought I had purchased salt with almonds in it. The amount of salt is RIDICULOUS and very unhealthy. Almonds are a healthy snack but not if they are this salty.<br /><br />UPDATE -- I contacted the company and they provided a replacement. The new bag was perfect, the almonds were tasty and not too salty. It seems that I purchased a bag from a bad batch. The company was prompt at correcting the problem. I originally gave the product a 1 star rating, I'm updating the review and giving the product 4 stars. Purchased a bag with way too much salt - Company provided a replacement: almonds were perfect 4 3 
Please be aware that this tee from Frontier sold by ABC is non-organic.  I informed ABC about it but the product's 'Ingredient' desciption still mentions organic Earl Grey tea.<br /><br />To be fair they offered me to return the merchandize and receive a refund. beware - description says it's organic but it's not 2 1 
You know this stuff tastes really good... once you get it to dissolve. I suppose if you have a food processor and can powder it (as its in sugar-esq crystals on arrival) - or can make a liquid variant. Took off one star for the hassle of having to modify it from its original state for use in cold drinks.<br /><br />That being said, does anyone know if the heat + equal parts sugar / water = liquid sugar method will work with Erythritol? Or will the chemical process be different? Great but not perfect 4 3 
I've only used Shake N Bake for pork a few times in the past and decided to let my youngest (he's 10) give this a try.  While I supervised, he did all the work which to say isn't too hard.  It didn't come with a bag so we used a ziplock 1 gallon size. The product is simple to use and a quick fix if you're looking for something that requires little prep work.<br /><br />The taste is the same as I remember and would have preferred something a little spicier and not so heavily coated.  The pork was fairly tender but the coating does make it a bit messy. I thought it was okay but doubt I'll get it again. Simple To Use 3 4 
I bought a 48 pack of this through Amazon when it was on special.  I normally drink medium blends and stay away from flavored but my wife likes the flavored coffees.  Her favorite is Pumpkin Spice from Green Mountain.<br /><br />What we found is the flavor of this was artificial.  I almost think it tastes a bit like maple syrup.  Too sweet...it would be better with less of the flavor.  I tried making it on the largest cup setting on the B70 but that just waters down the coffee.<br /><br />If you like the flavored liquid coffee creamers, this might be something you will like. Not my favorite-  syrup artificial flavor 3 2 
I am using this for as a meal replacement for weight loss purposes.  I'm definitely seeing results, however I find it to sickeningly sweet (and I have a sweet tooth)! It's like over sweetened cake batter and I can't even stand the smell. However, my husband likes the flavor and is drinking it because he was encouraged by my results! I'm going to try ordering something other than the Vanilla Ice Cream . Works for weight loss! 3 4 
AFter reading the only review for this product, I accidentally purchased these thinking it was the actual toy. These are simply the treats made for the toy, not the toy itself. My dog seemed to like them but theres nothing exceptional about them that makes up for the price. Snacks 3 2 
Our three cats don't like this variety. Probably because of the herring.<br />You would figure thyey would love the fish but I guess has too much of a fish odor. Cats don't like 3 2 
I've ordered the sugar free Hazelnut syrup from Amazon before and it tasted just as I expected (like my local coffee house).  However, my most recent order (a pack of 3 bottles) tasted like caramel, smells very sweet and has no hint of hazelnut. I thought perhaps is was a packaging mistake since all 3 bottles had the same horrible taste. However, I was told that Torani changed the recipe. If you're expecting a hazelnut flavor, don't order this product anymore unfortunately. Recipe changed!! 1 2 
Received 5 lb poly bag of gummie bears....very disappointing... they are somewhat hard and difficult to chew. Not like the Haribo Gummi bought at Walgreens in a small package, which were soft and easy to chew. Are these dried out? Old stock? Kinda hard... dried out? 1 2 
This bone is very good for a large dog. My rottie/mastiff loves them.<br /><br />But be careful the Amazon web page says "pack of 5" for 5.99 or 6.99 per bone and I had an order screwed up and they sent me one bone which is in no way near cost effective. Either buy five bones or none at all!! Merrick 9-10" sarge bone 4 3 
My dog would not eat these bones.  Nor would my cats.  They were so tiny.  Maybe the size of a treat for a hamster or guinea pig.  And way too expensive. Mini bones 2 1 
very sad to say that this is salty, no I mean SALTY! Will try something else for my son. Annie, please make these less salty and I will try them again. salty 2 1 
Sleepytime tea is one of those teas that can always be counted on. It's very mellow, with a great taste and smell. Perfect for relaxing after a long day. This is the tea that all other herbal teas should be measured against. Flawless herbal tea 5 3 
I live way out in the boondocks and even the closest little town stores do not carry Liptons' Loose Tea.  I don't want tea bags for both ecological and economical reasons, so the convenience of subscribing to a scheduled shipment at a reasonable price is wonderful for me.  Thank You. Convenience and ecology 4 5 
I saw an ad for Runa guayusa in Mother Jones magazine and because it is a Fair Trade item and described as less bitter than tea, I thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />It is exactly as advertised - no bitterness, just a little hint of sweetness, and a nice gentle flavor.  Very easy drinking, and it does give a kick of caffeine energy.  I have been a Diet Pepsi / Diet Coke drinker for 25 years because I like their tastes and the caffeine (never could do coffee and tea is too bitter), but I have recently converted to being a bicycle commuter for work and needed to ditch the heavy soda drinks.  This guayusa is perfect - as tea bags, it is obviously lighter than hauling around sodas, and it has more caffeine too.  Better for me, too.  And no bitterness like tea or coffee.  And I'm supporting fair trade small farmers in Ecuador instead of giant soda companies.  The packaging is 100% recycled, 70% post-consumer.<br /><br />This guayusa is as good as advertised, I like drinking it, and I can't think of any negatives.  5 stars.  I'm glad I found this product, it is worth the price. As good as advertised 5 4 
I dunno how Amazon gets this wrong - this cruddy tea comes with brain-drilling aspartame instead of Splenda. I am almost tempted to apply for a refund here. "Tea" mix is tasty enough I suppose but the cruddy bait-and-switch ruined the experience. Description is wrong - has Aspartame instead of Splenda 3 2 
I was crushed that my fav store discontinued my fav crepes (& the *only* mix I ever liked!).<br /><br />I called Trader Joes Customer Service, they were a brick wall ("Confidential" who the real manufacturer of their crepes were)...My French friend had a brilliant idea to google the ingredients which lead me to this discovery! It also appears others are catching on b/c the Kungsornen crepe mix is sold out all over the web...<br /><br />The boxes from Amazon taste slightly 'barkier" (hard to describe but I am a huge food snob), but it's the exact same ingredients so I'll live with it (ie, wheat flour, no sugar!).<br /><br />Pass the word out there, & if anyone else is as fanatical about this mix as I am, please help me petition Trader Joes to carry it once again! :) Missing Trader Joes Crepes Discovered!!!! 4 1 
Bought as a Christmas present. Smells like a milk shake. I might have to try it, might make a coffee drinker out of me! Great aroma, and I don't like coffee 5 4 
I need to increase my nutritional intake due to a health condition.  It was suggested I put this on my popcorn to help boost my health. I toss it with some olive oil on my popcorn and treat myself to some Hawaiian sea salt too.  It isn't "much" but it makes me feel proactive in managing my health.  It is certainly an acquired taste.  It is helping me with my vitamin levels so I am pleased. It is a lot cheaper on so many levels than a visit to the clinic. Good for me! 3 4 
At this price, I was expecting 3 bottles; got a nasty surprise when 1 bottle got delivered.  Amazon sells other brands of 3 bottles for the same price that taste just as good. This is for just 1 bottle! 1 2 
I decided to try "The Switch" orange tangerine because it was promoted as a drink that is 100% juice, 100% RDA Vitamin C, all-natural and it happens to be carbonated.<br /><br />The taste is like drinking orange juice at first with carbonation and I have to be truthful, at first I wondered if it was an alcoholic beverage at first.<br /><br />But after tasting it, you do taste the combination of the orange tangerine and the carbonation.<br /><br />The drink contains no sugar or corn syrup and no preservatives.<br /><br />Overall, a tasty carbonated beverage with only 140 calories and no fat.  15mg of sodium and 36g of carbs.<br /><br />If you are interested in the beverage that combines the taste of juice and carbonation, give "Switch" a try! A combination of juice and carbonation, 100% juice, no sugar, no artificial flavors 4 3 
I bought this product thinking that it would be good for a rainy (or snowy) day. But actually I would rather have cereal than this. It is salty and has no taste at all. Perhaps since I am of Indian origin, I expected something more suited to my palate as I see that most of the others have given this a good rating (and that is what made me buy it in the first place). I have purchased similar stuff from grocery stores and they taste much better so it has to be this product. Definitely, will not buy in the future and not recommend either. Bon Appetit, folks! Salty, and tasteless 1 2 
It works. i took one, 2 minutes later i was trying different things in my mouth. Last thing im trying right now is beer and it taste different and sweat. if your into trying new things give these a try. i read that it wont work on some people but well chalk this as a did work for me review. Interesting 5 4 
Not sure if this was AUTHENTIC Cosmic Catnip, as it had a lot more larger bits of stems and coarse material. My cats had loved this stuff when I had gotten a small sample from a local pet store. So, I thought it would be a great idea to get this larger size, but the catnip was not the same. My cats barely like this stuff and it even hurts my fingers when I pinch it to release the aroma. Would not recommend this 3 oz size! Not The Same as Store bought?? 2 1 
If you are used to buying the Piggy Twists that are about the size of fat cigars, these are not them.  These come 20 to a pack, but the individual twist is about as wide as a regular drinking straw, and 2/3 as long.  If you have a very small (as in toy breed) dog, they are probably great.  I have two dogs between 50-60 lbs., and these are barely worth pulling out of the bag.<br /><br />UPDATE:  After using all the piggy twists (because I'd bought them), we are now used to this size and actually prefer them to the big cigar-like ones because they don't make such a mess.  I still think they are made for tiny dogs, but they will keep a 50-60 lb dog occupied for a while, too.  Just realize what size you are getting with this purchase, because the product picture does not make it clear. These are super skinny 3 4 
Just recently purchase as I like the soda taste but not the amount of sugar in Soda.  Have tried all flavors and regardless of soda, they all have the DIET aftertaste.  If you suffer from migrains (as I do) the artificial sweetener used in the soda syrups will only cause more pain and surprisingly quickly.  There truely needs to be an alternative to the artificial sweetner for this to be a soda substitute. great idea, needs work 2 3 
This would have been a winner if my cat's would have like it, They will eat a little of it then walk away leaveing the rest. I like that it had quality ingredients and the price is very reasonable compaired to other quality cat food. I wish my cats would like the good stuff this is the third quality cat food I have purchased and its the only one of the 3 that my cats would even touch. Fair price 4 3 
I consider myself something of a chocolate connoisseur, I love it and have tried many different types and forms of chocolate at quite a few "tastings".<br /><br />I had hopes that this chocolate would be divine.  It wasn't.  It tasted waxy and strangely, not all that chocolate'y.  It was also shockingly small after seeing the caloric content -300+ calories in a bar barely the size of my iPhone!<br /><br />Since I work on a system of "worth the calories or not" when it comes to sweets...I immediately placed this chocolate bar in the "not worth the calories" category, and that is why I can't recommend this product.  Seek chocolate cravings elsewhere! Not impressed. 3 2 
We rececived our 50 flavor jelly bellies this week and boy do they taste good. The reason for this has to be because they use natural ingredients to create the flavors. My favorite is Tutti Fruiti (tastes like bazooka bubble gum - go figure). My wife's favorite is root beer. The soda pop flavors are good. My only complaint is the beans arrived all mixed up... is this the shipper's fault - I don't know.<br /><br />So when I saw the flavors scattered across the bins instead of being in each individual compartment I groaned. I even attempted to sort the beans - but gave up after 20 minutes. However, my wife who is much more patient than me spent over an hour to sort the beans and came up with every flavor in the correct compartment except for Jalopeno and Green Apple - which have the same coloring. So watch out when you grab a Green Apple. Otherwise this is a good buy.<br /><br />In conclusion - This comes with a menu for mixing flavors and the kids love them too... Good Stuff but... 4 3 
I believe the world is divided into two groups: those that eat black licorice and those that don't.  I belong to the first group, which I also find to be superior.  (Just kidding, kind of).<br /><br />I'm always looking for black licorice and cannot get enough of it.  I find licorice from Europe to be superior to that found in the states.  Gustaf's licorice is made in the UK, specifically where, I don't know.  It comes in a huge and heavy 5 lb bag.  It contains a long list of ingredients, including BEEF GELATINE. Okay, that's gross.  It also has Desiccated Coconut, whatever that is.<br /><br />The licorice is not shiny like in the picture, but dull, like a tractor tire.  It smells good and has a nice pungent taste to it.  (The Beef Gelatin perhaps?) It's all stuck together but comes apart easily.  It's a bit soft for my liking, but hopefully it will harden up over time.  Despite the disgusting addition of beef gelatin to my licorice (I know gelatin is from hooves, but do you have to remind me?) I will eat this licorice.  I have uploaded a picture to show everyone how this mass of licorice really looks, just so you don't stock up for parties.<br /><br />Will I order it again?  Probably not.  I want a company to lie to me about where gelatin comes from.  Gustaf is just too honest for his own good. Good Hardcore Licorice! 4 5 
I've never been a huge fan of oatmeal in any form. But I've learned to appreciate these instant packets as I get older. They're ready in mere minutes, quite filling, and the taste is not bad--I find Quaker brand far tastier than any generic or store brand I've tried. Maple brown sugar, along with apple cinammon, is among my faves. Add half a banana, and maybe some strawberries, and you have a high energy meal that leaves you feeling full and satisfied for hours. Great for the price and convenience. Breakfast in a Hurry 3 4 
so so.there was great reviews on product only made it once will try it again thought it would be better 2 3 
On an empty stomach, in a controlled environment, with plenty of water, I felt no physical change to stress levels, at least not the way that you feel an immediate sense of relaxation from Xanax. Like homeopathic medicince (highly diluted), this product is bunk.<br /><br />But it tastes good, and maybe it could have a little placebo effect. Tested it's Effects: None 2 3 
I am pregnant and so far went from 120lbs to 150lbs with 3-5 weeks left. I wanted something natural yet satisfying and sweet to help get me thru without going overboard. No pudge did the trick! They are not identical to full fat brownies, but pretty close. My husband eats them but compared them to a kid cuisine brownie. I think they are much better than that and with only 100 calories and being natural, they are great! No Pudge Please! 4 5 
I've got nothing new to say here; I'll just pile on with the rest.<br />The texture is ... friable. It's loose granular granola. The clusters have de-clustered. This doesn't bother me.<br />The acrid aroma does bother me. It smells like a drying oil portrait. In other words, like rancid linseed. This odor accompanies each spoonful down your gullet. If you care about healthy-eating things, you wonder about the oxidative-stress, anti-health effects of rancid fats as you finish your bowl, because this stuff is expensive and there's no way you're gonna waste it, free radicals or not.<br />Several have commented on the price. Note that it's gluten-free. If you had to eat gluten-free all the time (and I do), you'd be accustomed to this kind of gouging: $6 loaves of bread, $7 frozen pizzas, and now, $6, 11-oz bags (that's about 3 or 4 bowls IRL) of gluten-free granola. "Gluten-free," translated into English, means "Give me your money."  Celiacs' diets are limited to what's available, and a lot of it isn't very satisfying.<br />Fortunately there are many other less expensive and less rancid tasting cereals/granolas available.<br />Because I feel sort of bad for KIND, I will say here that I like their nut- and fruit-based bars very much.<br />[You may or may not be interested in the following: Oats by themselves are gluten-free. However, commercial oats sold on the world market are extensively contaminated with gluten-containing wheat, rye and barley, and are therefore not suitable for a gluten-free diet - this includes grocery store oatmeal and products made with oats. However, in the past 8 or so years, oats have been grown in dedicated fields using scanned seeds, and the crop tested for gluten. These are known in the celiac world as "gluten-free oats." These GF oats cost about five times as much as regular oats, and are the type used in KIND, friable, cinnamon-linseed granola.] Feh 2 3 
I looked these Halo pumpkin dental chews up on Amazon to see reviews.  I also read the ingredients on them, and found they were wholesome good food products that I would want my dogs eating.<br />  I went by my local animal food store and bought two of these chews for the 25-60Lb size.  One was for my 20lb jack russell who is an avid chewer and the other was for my 40lb aussie/heeler.  Great ingredients.  Since this size has 85 calories a piece, I needed to give only half to the jack.  I gave the jack the half one and the aussie the full one.  Wow, were they hard.  Problem was my jack wanted the whole thing in his mouth while he tried to chew pieces off which he couldn't really.  So I thought uhoh I better get the rest away from him but if he thinks I am coming to take it he will gulp it.  So I distracted him with squirt cheese and took half of the half away.  The aussie promptly gulped the rest of hers fearing I was going after hers too.  So where these were great that they were hard so they actually had to chew on them, maybe not for gulpers.  The dogs seemed very happy with the taste and smell. Very hard product 3 4 
I bought this because I am trying to drink less soda. This gives you that same soda-ish appeal without all the sugar. In fact it is a little tart so if that doesn't bother you than this is for you. Hope this helps. Healthier than soda 3 4 
I have tried 4 times to make cocoa with this product.  Twice it appeared to plug the coffee maker and would only provide about one once of cocoa.  The other two times the product worked correctly.  I do not think it is the coffee maker problem because it has made dozens of cups of coffee with no problems.  So I can not recommend this product. Problem with making the cocoa 1 2 
I bought these as a quick snack and because they were on sale. My kids won't eat them because 'they're yucky.' I tried them and indeed they are!<br /><br />They're dry and tasteless. Pretty Dry and Tasteless 1 2 
First of all, these smell awful.  The fake smoked scent stays with your dog long after the treat disappears.  In addition, these are very messy and the color comes right off and stains the carpet. Not for inside the home 2 1 
These are pretty good size pieces and are very hard and do not become soft like a lot of similar items.  They taste decent have a mild banana flavor.  This product requires your child to have some molars to be able to chew these up, my 18 month old has some trouble with them and prefers other things much more. Ok for toddlers, but not for infants 2 3 
When I opened the much-anticipated package, it smelled dusty and stale, which should have been my first clue. When I looked closer, I found it was at least half twigs & sticks, and the other half a poor quality crispy dry 'white' tea with moldy-smelling lavender buds.  Tried using it for tub tea...smelled musty there too! From now on I will stick to mixing my own - best I've found is Davidson's silver needle with Harney super blue. Disappointing 2 1 
This popcorn has hulls, which I don't care for. It's not labeled as hulless, so it's not deceptive. I just thought for the price it would be - my bad. I only use the whilry pop popper, so this review is relevant to that method only. It produces somewhat light, crispy popcorn of fairly large size with a real popcorn taste. I did think it would pop larger though. It's good for the coated popcorns I like to make. It's not the best I've tasted though. Fireworks makes some delicious, hulless varieties that have spoiled me, I'm afraid. The company ships fairly fast, and the shipping cost is what I'd expect it to be. I'm ruined by Amazon Prime though, so to pay any shipping at all is a drawback; that being said, for this quality popcorn plus the S&H cost, I won't buy it again - simple as that - and for no other reason than that. Good, but not great 4 2 
I normally buy Mee Chun fermented black beans from a local store (a tiny family run placed called "Nak's Oriental Market" in Menlo Park by Oak Grove). Those have a wonderful strong flavor and nice texture. I thought these would be similar. They are not. They are also NOT like in the photo.<br /><br />The photo makes them look just like Mee Chun beans, but they are not like those beans. They are dryer and lack the flavor of Mee Chun. These are not as salty as Mee Chun, but they do not add to a dish at all. In fact, they detract from it. If anything, the flavor of these is a bad flavor.<br /><br />The little market (Nak's) I go to normally has 8 oz Mee Chun for less than $1 each package (it even used to be $0.69 per 8 oz), but it is not close to me now, so I ordered these from Amazon because all Amazon vendors of Mee Chun charge an absurdly high amount for Mee Chun.<br /><br />Back to Nak's for me. It is worth the trip to get the real deal. I do not recommend these at all. Nothing like Mee Chun 1 3 
I received Old Country licorice in a gift basket for Valentine's day and fell in love. I ordered it in the 4/ 1 lb. tubs shown here and received it this past week. It is not soft, in fact it is a bit on the tough side. If you are considering making an order, wait for the bags. I do not think that the tubs are airtight. Better in the Bags than in the tubs 1 3 
Sadly, I quite disappointed with this product. It was definitely not the same tender popcorn I remember. Actually, the popcorn wasn't tender at all and had tons of kernels. I did not feel this sensation but my mother complained that the popcorn made her tongue feel numb. I did experience an odd aftertaste, though. Fortunately, amazon has wonderful customer service and I was able to receive a refund. A Disappointment 2 1 
I had high expectations based on some reviews, but aside from the apple, these were mostly blech and my baby did not like them.  The consistency of the squashes was very pasty, and the peas tasted like powder.  I ended up just using them to sneak extra nutrition in other dishes (the squash wasn't bad mixed with mashed potatoes, but I couldn't put in too much or the little guy was on to me!).  The apple was actually a really nice consistency, a little bit of texture and tasted quite delicious.  I definitely recommend getting the variety pack before launching into a big box of one kind.  It's a great idea, but won't work for everyone. OK 3 2 
It's getting hard to find T Discs and there are limited types of coffee.  I like the Gevalia better than the Maxwell House.  Gevalia is not as bitter. Best  T Disc Decaf 3 5 
Some people want to criticize organic products due to their often higher-than-average cost. I'm not sure I agree with that thinking. Organic ingredients ARE more expensive, and their added cost ensures that you (and your pets) are eating food that meets strict production standards.<br /><br />Is it worth it? Well, consider the source of the ingredients in most pet food. I shudder to think about the junk that makes its way into "food" that you feed to your beloved animals. That's why I'm more than willing to seek out--and pay more--for quality in the form of products like Newman's Own Organics Lamb and Barley New Zealand Ranch Style Dog Treats. What you get for your money is the peace of mind that comes from knowing that your dog will be eating human-grade ingredients, including certified-organic barley flour, ground chicken, carrots, apples, rolled oats, etc.<br /><br />My beagle loves these treats, and I love giving her food that keeps her healthy. Good quality and organic - what's not to like? 5 3 
I was looking forward to the popcorn and was disappointed it never arrived.  Possibly it is back ordered.  Hoping to have fresh pop corn soon. still waiting 1 2 
These are pretty good. In my opinion, they aren't nearly as good as the Teriyaki Beef Steak Nuggets (which are sort of similar), but they aren't bad either. They have sort of a prime rip au-jus flavoring, but you can tell that the meat itself isn't prime rib. It's definitely work a try to see if you like it. Pretty good. 3 4 
I have one cat who cannot tolerate THIS PARticular Fancy Feast Salmon Product. It is only the Shredded one that gets her, but get it does.<br />Everytime she eats it, she throws it up all over everywhere. My shoes, the white rug and gratefully, the tile.<br /><br />She ate this for several years with occasional upsets, but now it is EVERY time. No more for this family. I realize that this occurs on an individual basis USUALLY.<br /><br />But, I also have one younger kitty who is at the "occasional upset" stage. So, if you have a kitty with a tender tummy, I would avoid this!! INDIGESTION OF MAJOR PROPORTIONS 2 4 
I'm a big fan of Emerald nuts, just check out my other reviews.  However, I was slightly disappointed in these cashews.  While they're very fresh, there was much too much seasoning, especially going overboard (haha, get it?) with the sea salt.  Furthermore, I question whether real sea salt was used, which typically has larger grain sizes than table salt.  It looks just like regular table salt.<br /><br />However, there is a saving grace for these nuts, and it prevented me from dishing out just 3 stars.  What to do with overly salty, peppery cashews?  Stir fry some chopped chicken breasts, and make Chinese chicken & cashews with bell peppers.  Don't bother adding salt to the chicken- just add in these cashews, and you're good to go! Cashews are very fresh, but much too salty, sea salt questionable 4 3 
First I'd like to say that this pepper oil has a GREAT flavor. It is the best ever for seasoning many dishes (including fried rice as noted by another reviewer). Also like that other reviewer all my local stores stopped carrying the product, even the ones that carry other House of Tsang products. So I decided to buy a case here. That was a bad move.<br /><br />Know that with this oil a little goes a long way. The case I got has a 'best by' date of January 2011. From when I received my product that was almost exactly six months. Now I can use a good amount of this oil pretty often, but as I said a little goes a long way. I'll probably use perhaps 2 bottles by the end of January. If I still use up another one, well by that time the rest may not last. Anyway that means I paid about $20 per bottle when shipping is added in. I just can't recommend ordering this product by case of twelve bottles if it only lasts six months.<br /><br />The best thing I can recommend is that since this is a great product, just hound a local grocery store manager into getting it back in stock or find sonewhere to buy single bottles. Too much product; too little time 2 5 
I like to give good reviews but unfortunately, this time I can't.  This product made my doberman very very sick, Twice!  I thought, the first time it could have been something else.  Then I remember reading the post that said warning don't feed, her lab had explosive diarrhea, well same thing happened to my doberman.  So the second time, I tested it out, gave her two chips as a snack, then the next day, the same thing.  So, that's the end of those chips for me!  I will say, I think it's only for certain dogs as my heeler can eat them, with no problems.  So, it just depends on the dog and dobermans are known for having sensitive stomachs although, no other raw hide chips have ever bothered her in this way whatsoever.  Just want to put it out there, to help give you an informed decision. Warning, Made my Doberman Sick! 3 1 
I had hoped that this would still have a rich flavor without an acidic burn, but it just tasted bland, old, and stale.  I actually couldn't drink an entire cup and threw out the rest of the package I got as a vine member. I typically prefer a rich, strong flavor but often bold coffees have too much acid. This had no richness or flavor. bland and boring 2 1 
The first time I ordered this, it was great.  After adjusting my grind, it made the perfect espresso with a thick crema.  However, subsequent orders left much to be desired.  Some were OK... Some were horrible... None were great. Inconsistent Quality 2 3 
I consume about a jar every two weeks of this, either adding it to fajitas or using it as a corn chip dip.  It is hot, but after awhile the medium Salsa Suprema was too mild for me; I thought maybe I'd cut down how much I ate by going to the hot Salsa Ranchera.  It's hot enough that people who aren't used to it will say "That's hot!".<br /><br />Flavor: bright and forward.  The similarly hot Salsa Victoria is a duller taste to me, I guess earthy.  This salsa is much brighter in the mouth.  I don't like to go hotter than this because the sauces I've tried lose any resemblance to yummy salsa and just taste hot (this happens to me with Tabasco sauce, for example).<br /><br />A drawback is La Victoria doesn't make a larger bottle of Salsa Ranchera nor Salsa Victoria, nor do they sell them in [...] or Sam's Club.  To get a good deal you have to watch for sales. Hot and delicious 5 3 
I received a pack of 8 cans of formula. Which 6 were damaged. I paid $80.00 for all but two cans to be partly opened. I  returned items. However, I still have not received new formula. The product is wonderful.I just wish that the delivery and shipping process was handled with care. Damaged cans. 1 3 
Unfortunately having ordered quite a few of these previously, I neglected to not look for the word: "supreme" in this offer and since I was then receiving free shipping had 4 delivered. We (that is my husband, guests and me)knew immediately that these were different from those previously enjoyed. BUT, currently Amazon featured the "supreme" babka and now I am awaiting to receive these. In the future, I will read more carefully. Disappointed! 1 2 
It is great to have this available as it is gluten free. The taste is okay to good. It does have a taste that I characterize as the taste I expect from a packaged sauce mix. I don't use it as much as I would like to as I can make a better tasting, more satisfying sauce, IF I want to take the time and expend the effort. I don;t always want to take time/effort, so on those times I use these mixes. Could be better; could be worse 3 4 
This popcorn does all pop. Doesn't have much taste. I will get the seasoning salt or something and see how it tastes after that. I have poured butter over it but then to me that defeats the idea of diet stuff. Popcorn 4 3 
I have used this product multiple times.  In fact, I purchased four tubs of the gold and silver luster dust (2 each) five years ago and I am JUST NOW running out!  I use this stuff to gild all sorts of things for Renaissance themed banquets - including gilding an entire roast duck and then, using vodka, painting filigree designs onto it!  The clients thought it was prop food it looked so beautiful.  I can't recommend this stuff enough! The Inexpensive Alternative to Gold Leaf! 5 3 
I did not like them, they seemed flavorless compared to other brands.  The Byzantine olives are a little more, but are a MUCH better product.  I will likely never buy a Roland olive product again, as I was disappointed with their black olives as well. Did not like them!  Yuck! 1 2 
Unlike this company's (not) Pretzel Salt, this product is exactly as described. A great fine flake salt that adheres to popcorn and other foods (french fries) wonderfully! Great Salt 4 5 
I did a lot of research and decided to buy this food for my 4-year-old cat. I had been feeding him Royal Canin but he got fat, so I was hoping this food--without fattening grains--would help with that. (Side note: I only feed him a little bit at a time, he doesn't eat that much. But he still got fat.) When I got this and mixed it in with his old food, he didn't eat it at all, or even consider it. I'm not sure if it's because it's new, or because the kibble size is very small. It falls out of his mouth. Also, compared to the other food, it doesn't not smell very attractive (to a cat, I assume). I can barely smell it at all. While I like that, my cat doesn't seem to think it's food. He did eat some last night, but he still meows at me for the other food when I try to give this to him. He picks out his old food if I mix the two. If only they could make it smell better somehow while keeping out bad ingredients, and make an adult version (bigger kibble size), then I think this would be the best food (based on ingredients). Maybe for kittens 3 2 
I just made myself a cup of San Francisco Bay Coffee, Rainforest Blend and am very disappointed in the lack of flavor.  I had previously ordered from this company a different flavor and was pleased with that roast which had a strong distinctive flavor. This current order is tasteless. Unfortureately, it is not returnable. Disappointed 2 1 
Unfortunately, I didn't see the other reviews warning that the image falsely advertises brown cubes and am now stuck with 4 boxes of white cubes that I do not want. Not happy. Amazon, or whoever is the supplier, needs to change the photo so that it correctly displays the white cubes.  I feel like the victim of a bait and switch scheme! CHANGE THE PICTURE - THESE ARE WHITE, NOT BROWN CUBES 2 1 
Great idea - no calories, no fat, etc. They are slimey and chewing them is what I'd guess chewing worms would be like. They are firm enough to have more texture than pasta, but still gel like. I just put them with spaghetti sauce, but maybe there's a better option. Have not found it yet. I've read more about them and what nutritional benefits they may have so it makes it worth the try. Cost is certainly reasonable enough. Give them a try and maybe you'll have a better idea. Not so miraculous 2 3 
when I went to make a larger order of it at Amazon, found it's cheaper and immediately available at the local grocery store ($22.68), though I do have to add tax. (On the other hand, I'm supposed to declare the tax avoided on my state tax anyway.) So, double check on pricing at your local grocery chain, etc. Another problem - turns out my digestive system is allergic to its non-sugar sweetening ingredients. Love This Candy, but 1 3 
The quality of the tea is very poor. For this quality of the tea there is no need to buy on Amazon. Any grocery store sells this kind of tea. I would suggest Adagio tea. Or, even better, expensive Lupicia tea, if you can find one in retail store  ( unfortunetely, on Lupicia site there are only cheap teas) Not good tea 3 1 
Let me start with a few things. I love Nong Shim's Shin Ramyun. I am also a big fan of kimchi. So I thought what could be a better combination than that? So I ordered a case of these from amazon during the back to school sale. I must say I was very disappointed. First of all the noodles are more of the traditional ramen noodle, not the thicker type you get with the Shin Ramyun. (So disappointment #1) Then the flavor of this was not good at all, it wasn't like adding kimchi to a bowl of the Shin Ramyun stuff at all. To be honest the flavor was quite off putting. Now I have a case of these noodles I have no idea what to do with. Flavor is just not there. 2 1 
I only get these when I forget to order my regular brand (Spectrum); my local GNC has Nutiva. Every bag has had dirt in it and a couple have had other 'foreign' hard objects. I have to look at every spoon as I eat to make sure nothing other than chia is included. I tried to find a better way to clean them, but of course.. water is not an option. I do buy these locally when in a pinch, but I would never, ever order them. Every Bag Has Dirt  and Grit 2 1 
My original review was pretty harsh, but after a few months I have gotten somewhat used to these and enjoy them more than I did originally. I will restate, however, that Griottines are much better and have less of a fake syrupy taste and hard chewy texture.<br /><br />I bought these at the recommendation of a local liquor store owner, who thought that they were amazing as far as cocktail cherries are concerned. My past preference has been Griottines, which never seem available on Amazon these days (in the larger, more reasonably priced jars). The Griottines are nice small, tender sour cherries. I would suggest finding those somewhere on line in the larger (10+ oz) size, which is more reasonably priced than the small size, or these Luxardo. Do yourself a favor and seek them out. Not my favorites 3 4 
We have three dogs.  One will eat anything, one will eat almost anything, and one is a picky eater.  Fortunately, the picky eater is the chihuahua.  Part of the picky eating comes from his sensitive stomach, and we avoid chicken and turkey because that consistently upsets his stomach.<br /><br />The first time he was offered Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin dog food, he devoured it with pleasure, and I was ecstatic to have a dry food that got some enthusiasm.  Unfortunately, that enthusiasm was gone by the next day, and he absolutely refused to eat it for two days.  We gave up.  If he'd rather eat the big dogs' food than eat his premium food, there is no  point in spending extra for a more expensive food.<br /><br />From my point of view, the "premium" seemed to be mostly the "Chef Michael" name, as it didn't seem to have any better ingredients than the other Purina foods.  Beef was the first ingredient, but it was followed by soy meal and soy flour. (Can we say GMO?) It also contained chicken by products (a long ways under the soy products, by the way.)  Even salt appears before green beans and potatoes.  It is cuter than regular kibble, but I don't think the dogs care.  It also has varying textures, but once again, even when I let the big dogs try it, they weren't overly impressed.<br /><br />My opinion is that either spend more and get real premium food or save your money (unless you want attractive kibble) and just buy a standard dog food. He ate it once and then never again 2 3 
Just to clear things up, no brand of Baking Soda contains aluminum. Some baking POWDERS do (so check these labels), but not baking soda. The benefits of this brand vs. A&H, for example, is the way in which they are mined. Bob's is mined naturally so this baking soda is in it's natural state (yay). A&H on the other hand uses chemicals during it's mining process. So, yes, Bob's is more natural. No, you don't have to worry about aluminum when buying any brand of baking soda (this label is just a marketing gimmick ... for shame...). Check out: [...] fyi: NO Baking Sodas contain aluminum 5 4 
I really wanted to like this product.  The other reviews were outstanding.  However, no one in our family liked the flavor and mostly the smell of the sauce.  I would rather make my sauce from scratch.  I will not be purchasing this product again. Funky taste and smell 2 1 
Add these to some hot water and they perk up really really fast and get huge in size compared to the dried version. More so than the tree ear fungus I am used to using. However, these turn pale brown in color and have a different flavor and a bit softer texture than tree ears I have used before.<br /><br />I do like these, but I miss the tree ears that remain black after I re-hydrate them and keep a higher level of crispness when re-hydrated.<br /><br />The price for the quantity of these is good, but the quality is only B level not A level.<br /><br />I probably would get them again because of the price. OK but not great 3 4 
I've never been a huge fan of oatmeal in any form. But I've learned to appreciate these instant packets as I get older. They're ready in mere minutes, quite filling, and the taste is not bad--I find Quaker brand far tastier than any generic or store brand I've tried. Maple brown sugar, along with apple cinammon, is among my faves. Add half a banana, and maybe some strawberries, and you have a high energy meal that leaves you feeling full and satisfied for hours. Great for the price and convenience. Breakfast in a Hurry 3 4 
Unfortunately these nuts have left me with "pine mouth" it's been about 4 days since eating them and it doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon. Do some research before you buy! I have contacted the FDA on the matter so we will see where that goes... Chinese nuts! Avoid or you will end up with "pine mouth" like me! 1 2 
Are they kidding? Who would name a product this? Really!!! Love the part about preventing it from spurting...LOL! Nothing that a dose of penicillin can't cure!!! 4 1 
I purchased two cases of Merricks Wingalings and Smothered Comfort. The label states "whole thighs" and "whole wings" but that is a lie. Once opened, the cans have one - if you're lucky two pieces. The rest (3/4 of each can) is processed cubes of who knows what my dog refuses to eat. Merricks should either fill the can with what they advertise - "WHOLE thighs and wings" - plural - or tell the consumer the truth about what they are selling here. false advertising on cans 2 1 
i share my muffins with the women in the other trailers on my street. in the rv park in florida. that way i don,t have to bake any ,they bake them for me. a great way to get to know your neibours. friendly muffins 4 5 
the mac and cheese, meat sauce, seems to fit his taste more, so now we got allmost 20 of these sitting on the shelf with all the other ones gone not my kids favorite 2 3 
Oreos have gone downhill in quality. Little creme filling and mostly chocolate cookie. Recommend Newman's equivalent, much more filling and great tasting. Little filling, disappointed in quality of product 3 2 
These taste synthetic. There is a big difference between mashing your own potatoes and the contents of this package. The second ingredient is powdered cellulose and that's what they taste like - something that just can't or shouldn't be digested. STRANGE TASTE 1 2 
This blend makes a very weak tea. I tried it because it was less expensive than the Numi brand Genmaicha. You get what you pay for here. It has none of the depth or flavor that Numi has. I would not recommend this tea. Weak Tea 2 1 
Good product and decent shipping. However, the price was $15.95 and I later found the same item in a local store for $6.95. What a gouge. Good but way too expensive 4 3 
I have  started experimenting with different brands of Peppermint Hot Cocoa and I started with Stephen's Gourmet Candy Cane Hot Cocoa.  It was a home run.  Very peppermint, very creamy, perfectly sweet, very chocolatey, wouldn't change a thing.<br /><br />Next I tried Bellagio Peppermint Truffle hot cocoa (this one).  What a drastic difference.  The first problem is that it tastes more like Mint than Peppermint and even has a slight cooling affect to the mouth like brushing with mint toothpaste -- not something I expect or particularly desire from hot cocoa. I noted that Stephen's Gourmet Candy Cane Hot Cocoa has Peppermint Oil, while this one contains merely "Artificial Flavoring".<br /><br />The second problem is that this cocoa isn't sweet.  It isn't bitter, but it was necessary to add a little sweetener to bring out any flavor, else it was just a bland hot drink with a cooling minty affect.  Even then, the mint is more detectable by the cooling affect than by actual flavor.<br /><br />The third problem is that this hot cocoa isn't creamy.  I had to add a little half-and-half to make it creamy.  In contrast, Stephen's Gourmet Candy Cane hot cocoa only needed water to produce a very creamy hot cocoa -- probably because it includes Nonfat Dry Milk, while Bellagio Peppermint Truffle hot cocoa (this one) includes non-dairy creamer.<br /><br />The fourth and probably biggest issue is that this hot cocoa isn't very chocolatey, no where near as chocolatey as Stephen's Gourmet Candy Cane Hot Cocoa, and this is someone who actually prefers milk chocolate to dark/rich chocolate -- i.e., it is even weak by milk chocolate standards.<br /><br />Two stars for the following: 1) attractive and convenient packaging 2) it doesn't taste bad.<br /><br />Bellagio Peppermint Truffle Hot Cocoa is Made in the USA.  Directions: add 3 tablespoons of mix to 3/4 c. hot water and stir.  I also add a little sweetener and milk or cream. Not peppermint, weak chocolate, not sweet, not creamy 2 3 
It makes it easier to use my 8oz popper( Gold Medal 2408) But its too SALTY. The Gold Medal Seasoning Flavacol is much better. I will not get again. I have adjusted by not cutting the salt portion then adding the Gold Medal Seasoning by hand that Works better. also others have talked about old maid. that comes from the Popper design. I also had issues with those Cheaper poppers & 4oz. poppers -That's why we upgraded to the professional Brand, Gold Medal, you will pay a tad bit more, but its worth it because parts can be replaced & fixed easily + it can pop ALL day with out issues + better product (popcorn) makes it easier - but too much salt 2 3 
My little dog (15 pounds) loves these things!  I like that they are small and easy to cut into smaller pieces.  Be careful of treating with the whole piece if your dog likes to inhale food.  My dog has choked twice. Careful 4 3 
Great value and much superior to what you find in stores. Makes a great snack or after dinner treat, but for those who are health conscious remember to keep it to a few pieces since they are covered in thin sugar. Try to keep the bag tightly sealed once you open them since the slowly begin to dry up. Will be ordering more soon :) Mango anytime! 5 4 
To say I am no expert on tea is ...well... the truth. My earlier experience with tea was the occassional cup at a Chinese restaurant,or the cup loaded with honey for a sore throat. For me it was coffee, coffee, and more coffee.<br /><br />However,hearing so much about the benefits of green tea,I picked out a box of it at the store and put it up on my shelf.It just sat there. Then disaster struck - I was out of coffee! I remembered the green tea on the shelf and thought what the heck, maybe it will hold me over till I get to the store. I liked it! It gave me an afternoon pick-me-up that I wasn't expecting and even thought it tasted pretty good as well. I don't remember what kind it was as I have been through several boxes of green, various brand and flavors of the tea since then. Then I hit on:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BM68QG">Good Earth Tea Green Tea, Lemongrass, 25-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> -see my review for details of the Lemongrass - I loved it. It was the best I tried. Naturally I found the best deal here at Amazon.<br /><br />Next I wanted to try other flavors. This Orange flavored sounded pretty good. It has the added benefits of super anitoxidant(70% more than Good Earth's standard green tea) Japanese teas matcha and sencha. I found both the aroma and taste much lighter than the Lemongrass. The Orange gives just a hint of it's flavor. Other reviewers felt otherwise, so I would suggest to try one box first and if you like it go for this multi-pack. I do agree though that it's great for what ails ya. It's definitly one I would drink for anything from colds and sore-throats to aches and pains of all sorts. I also read that the matcha leaf helps to cleanse the body of toxins.<br /><br />This blend brews up an appealing golden shade. It gives me a renewed and refreshed feel but I also found it to be more calming than the Lemongrass which gave me quite an energy boost.It also doesn't seem to be dehydrating -as coffee can be - with more health benefits.Although I personally prefered the taste of the Lemongrass - my only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 - I still like this one and it is nice to have a litle variety for different moods or needs. And I don't need to add anything.<br /><br />It is caffeinated, but comparably much less then coffee per serving. It may be served hot or as Iced Tea.<br /><br />From the box:<br />Ingredients: Sencha Green Tea,Orange Oil,Green Tea Extract,Natural Flavors,Matcha and Chamomile Flowers.<br /><br />Super Green Tea - 162 mg avg antioxidants per serving.<br />Good Earth Standard Green tea -108 mg avg antioxidants per serving<br /><br />So I still love that morning cup of Java, but now I look forward to my afternoon Green Tea as well.Now I would find it a disaster to be without that! I even took some with me on a recent road trip - just to be sure I had some wherever I went.<br /><br />Remember to breathe,eat healthy and...enjoy the holidays!....Laurie Nice Change Of Pace and Super Antioxidants 4 1

My dad just loved this. It was full of so many things plus the cooler bag!! Great price and great product! Excellent gift 4 5 
I'll start off by saying that this gum has a very good flavor. The electric watermelon also mixes in with some sort of banana flavor making a perfect combo. Its a great addition to the 5 collection and would recommend this gum to anybody here who enjoys the 5 gum series. My only negative sight on this item would probably be the lasting time. Flavor only lasts about 10 min, or so then begins to fade.<br /><br />ALSO: Item has only 10 pack not 12, so I had to ask for a refund of $5.00. Be Careful! 5 Prism Gum 4 3 
Each package comes with 8 milk creamer discs and 8 chai tea discs, making a total of 8 drinks.  You use the creamer disc first, then the tea disc.  Tassimo recommends that you run the brewer through a cleaning cycle after making a milk drink (you don't want to spoil your next non-milky drink).<br /><br />I love Chai (or spiced) tea with a little sugar or honey, so I was really looking forward to a Chai Latte made with my brand new Tassimo Brewer.  Boy was I disappointed!<br /><br />I don't see it in the description, but the tea contains sucralose (that's the sweetener in Splenda).  While I generally avoid artificial sweeteners in general, as I don't like the taste, I do make some exceptions.  It's possible to use them and have an enjoyable flavor if the flavors are balanced.<br /><br />They aren't in this Twinings Chai.  There is definitely too much sweetener.  I would prefer that they err on the side of not enough sweetener---after all, everyone has their own preferences, but I can always add more, I can't remove what's already there.<br /><br />The balance between the milk and tea was also off and the milk has a decided reconstituted dry milk taste to it.  Not my fave. ;0)  Between the sweetener overkill and the milk, it was hard to even tell that this was spiced tea or tea at all.<br /><br />I won't be purchasing again. Almost undrinkable due to the artificial sweetener taste 1 4 
Same price as Dr. Foster & Smith. no shipping charges in December if over $50 on DrFosterSmith.com 2 3 
After searching for a more constant and less expensive supply of "real" licorice over my favorite (more about that later), I decided to try this one based upon other reviews and the description. I have to say that I was disappointed. It is not intense enough and a bit too salty for my preference since all that I noticed was salt and more salt until it got down to the licorice flavor which I would charactize as "modest". My all time favorite licorice was discovered years ago while visiting a St. Louis mall has been and remains an excellent choice made by Bissinger's Chocolate Company and they call it French Long Licorice. It is not noticeably salty and packed with flavor without being a sicky-sweet candy. I say that and caution licorice lovers to know their favorite "type" of licorice; this is important when reading reviews and purchasing. I was looking for something not American-style junk candy, with actual licorice extract not anise, chewy, lasting, with true strong licorice flavor and no other flavor overtones.<br /><br />As far a Bissinger's is concerned, they do not make this licorice year round nor advertise it on their website or in their catalogs so you have to call their toll free number and ask if it has been in production. It is expensive but well worth it for excellent flavor and lasting ability (I can enjoy one for at least 15 minutes if I don't chew). These are my favorite thing to have when reading a great book and I limit myself to 2 at a sitting for my "fix"; okay, sometimes 3 if it is a superb book:D.<br />The last time I ordered it they were generous and added a pound of their premium chocolate as a thank-you for being a customer that troubled to find their particular product because I do not live near one of their stores and unless I visit say St. Louis (where it is headquartered) I have to mail-order.Anyway, I prefer my licorice hard and let it soften in my mouth so when I get an order ($56 for 2lbs) I leave it out lightly wrapped for a few days to harden off. That makes it last longer in my mouth and does not affect flavor but that it personal mouth feel preference. It frezes without problems so I will just have to go back to that and pay for my pleasure and stock up :). Licorice-gotta have it! Not nearly as good as Bissinger's French Long 3 2 
I love all of Newman's Own products, and I like that their dog treats are all-natural and that it's a trustworthy brand. My dogs really like these treats and they are a good-sized for a snack for medium/small dogs (I have pugs). The biscuits are hard and they come in "sets" of two, but are easy to break apart. The broken-apart squares are about one square inch.<br /><br />They are definitely hard snacks, and they are easy to break into one square, but I could see that it would be difficult to break them up further. They are perfect for my dogs, but I would say that they may be difficult for tiny dogs to chew because of their size and crunchiness. Great, All-Natural Treats - Good Snack Size 5 4 
Not really sure if they really are "power" bones, but my dog loves the taste and doesn't complain! We buy lots of other Zuke's products as well, and my Golden loves them all. Dog loves the taste! 4 5 
Pan Ducale Almond Biscotti were a  disappointment to me, not because they were bad, but because they could not come close to the great Lettieri Prato Belli Cantuccini Almond Cookies.  At best they are low in calories - also in almonds. A  Disappointment 2 1 
I have drank Bigelow band peppermint tea and loved it.  But, by current supermarket doesn't carry Bigelow's peppermint tea and I figured how different can they be..after all the ingredients on both is "Peppermint".  I was very surprised to find Celestial Seasonings peppermint tea is very weak tasting.  I am using two tea bags just to get more flavor.  Also, there is a subtle difference in the taste of the two teas.  Bigelow's brand has a slightly sweeter taste, which I enjoy.  In the future I will not be purchasing Celestial Seasonings peppermint tea. Meh..I've had better 2 3 
I have pain and numbness down both arms from a pinched nerve at the bottom of my neck.  I started drinking this juice three months into what will likely be a four to six month recovery.  Because my doctor has put me on a long-term anti-inflammatory medication, I am not allowed to take over-the-counter medications like Advil and Tylenol.  I can say that taking a glass of this juice has the same pain-killing effect as taking two Advil.  I enjoy two glasses a day - one in the morning and one at dinner.  The only down-side is the sugar, which is really the only processed sugar I eat during the day.  The juice tastes good and the quality of the syrup is consistent and pleasant.<br /><br />I usually don't go for "miracle" foods or diet fads, but this juice simply works - this is the real deal.  It will not cure pain, but it will inhibit inflammation and facilitate faster healing of arthritis, spasms, and sprains. You bet your life! 5 4 
Once again I did NOT receive COMVITA Raw Honey.  This is not the first time that the supplier substituted another New Zealand honey for the Comvita Honey which I had ordered.  The two are not the same and I will not order the 35.2 ounce jars again because I do not have this problem when I order Comvita honey packaged in small jars. 'COMVITA' Honey 3 2 
I'm sorry I just can't eat this.  It is too thick and chewy and slimy to eat.  I have tried, several times, several different ways. I wanted to like it. It isn't something I will buy again.  I do, however, like the angel hair pasta.  Is is much thinner and is easier to chew and good in soups and oriental dishes. Yuck 1 2 
I have generally fed Hills Science Diet to my cats over the years. This year I started over (my elderly cats have passed on) with a young cat and her litter. The mother was up and down with her apetite in the hot weather, during pregnancy and nursing, and not keeping a good weight. She also had an upset tummy off and on. So I tried a few different chows, and Purina One certainly agreed with her the best. Once or twice I went back to other brands (including the regular Purina chow) and they just did not agree with her. She also seemed hungry all the time on the regular Purina chow.<br /><br />Kittens are now 3 months old and glowing with health, as is their mom. The vet sang their praises at vaccination time, and even asked me what I was feeding them. It pays to try different brands if your cat is not happy. This one sure worked for us.<br /><br />The price is $6.95 at our local supermarket, though, so I won't be buying it here! A nice kitten chow, easy on the digestion 4 5 
This is for the hardier consumer, taste wise. If you don't mind the flavor of powdered peas, this one is for you. Good texture, good dissolvability. Price is what you would expect--no bargain but not a killer. There is, however, most definitely the flavor of peas there, and nothing really covers it up. I like peas when they are green and I have to chase them around on my plate. In the form of a vanilla, or chocolate, or coffee, or banana, or blackberry, etc., etc. drink?--naw.

I love this company and what they are trying to do.  However, when I first got my celiac diagnosis, though, I got glutened by these.<br /><br />A couple of years passed.  The buzz on the celiac boards was that Mi-Del had really cleaned up their act, and that their cookies were safe.  From about 2004-2009, I ate these without incident.  I even figured out how to make cookie pie crusts in them and put the recipe in my gluten-free cookbook.  Then, I got a bad batch two times in a row, and got glutened again.<br /><br />Maybe they have problems with suppliers?  I understand they've been a lot more careful with the actual manufacturing process.<br /><br />It's sad, but I would buy Pamela's ginger cookies (available on Amazon!) instead. Sometimes, they will gluten you. 3 2 
I love pistachio nuts and I also like working with nut oils of all kinds. I had not even thougth of using pistachio oil.<br />After purchasing this oil and using it once as a salad dressing(spinach,nectarines and toasted pistachios) I am sold and am on a hunt for more ideas..I would welcome ideas. Pistachio oil and the quest for its uses 4 5 
I'm not a gourmet coffee critic, but this stuff is disappointing.  Based upon previous good reviews, I suspect that the coffee in the K-cups I received is not the same -- they may have changed the manufacturing.  The Wolfgang Puck Decaf I received is lifeless, watery, and tasteless.  There's no aroma when it's brewing in the Keurig.  Never again. Tasteless and watery 2 1 
purchased and it came looking new, as i had bought it NEW, but it was actually damaged.<br />customer service with the actual company is awful--as i needed to contact the company itself to return it. came damaged. 1 2 
This is an excellent tea, very flavorful - the cinnamon is fresh and powerful, and overall it's slightly sweet without needing any sugar. Excellent with milk or straight. Excellent tea 5 4 
The idea behind buying this is to have a natural pick-me-up in the morning.  The problem is they have doses of things in it that are too high.  Back when the natural supplement/remedies law changed allowing manufacturers to sell so call natural products it created a problem and this type of product is one of the symptoms of that problem.  They can claim it's herbal and natural etc.  and put out stuff that is not good for you.  I curse the day I signed that partition in a Whole Food type of store.  A already sick pharmaceutical industry is now even sicker.  I want a do over on that damn change.<br />If you don't like my comment good for you.  If you leave a comment I will not be reading it.  So swear away. This product is vastly over rated. 2 1 
I was happy to find this gluten free cereal available, but am disappointed in the taste - I'm not tasting "honey nut".  In fact, these have very little taste. very little taste 3 2 
I am a huge fan of Two Leaves and a Bud.  They make a beautiful English Breakfast Tea and many others.  I ordered this giant box of White Tea being a Tea lover and especially a White and Green Tea lover.  The idea of Rose Pedals in my Tea was also enticing and I dreamed about early mornings on my deck, sipping White Peony Tea with Angels flying and Songbirds singing.  Not really. But I did have high hopes for this Tea and I was let down.  The leaves are too small, the Tea goes bitter quickly and it's hard to brew as the bag won't immerse easily in the water.  Try Mighty Leaf Teas for real White and Green Teas.  They are almost unmatched in quality.  For more reviews please visit my blog [...] Not Up To My Expectations! 3 2 
After reading the reviews on the salt I decided I wanted to make Kalaua pork for my husband to remind him of the 5 years we lived on Oahau.  Bummed that I got Lava salt instead of Alaea salt.  Amazon was great in crediting me for the wrong product but bummed I had to reorder and can't make the special dinner I had planned. Got Lava Salt instead of Alaea salt bummed 3 2 
This product is a great idea -- finally, someone made instant hot chocolate that contains recognizable food ingredients. Sadly, the flavor is very mild, and tastes more sweet than chocolately. Less sugar, more choc. would have been better.  I have to put in a little instant coffee to bring out the chocolate taste. Plus for all natural, minus for mild flavor 3 2 
The package says that this is supposed to be practically break-proof, which I thought was perfect for my year-old Beauceron who is a pretty aggressive chewer.  Finally!  A toy that would make his brain work and keep him occupied.<br /><br />Three uses.  First one he very quickly discovered how to get the treats right out.  Second, he learned how to get the screw-off bottom to come off of the jug.  Third time - he chewed the plastic to bits by the time I got it away from him - and he was in the same room with me!<br /><br />I'm a dog trainer and only recommend high-endurance products for my clients.  This didn't even come *close* to meeting my expectations!  Total disappointment.  Will not buy another 'Premier' Busy Buddy toy for my chewer!<br /><br />At almost 3 years old, we still rely on the blue K9 Kongs, Holey Moley, and Everlast Treat balls to stand up to his strong jaws and chew drive! Definitely not a Kong.... 1 3 
This was a gift for my husband.  We love to cook and have been intrigued by finishing salts for awhile.  We've used the white and the pink with good results.  Really liking them. Good salt 4 5 
These have a good kick, come in nice packaging, and have an initially good flavor, but they have a sour aftertaste that leaves a nasty flavor in your mouth that lingers.  Not exactly what I think of when I think of Cherry Jelly Bellies.  However, they do give you a quick shot of energy. Good Kick, but funky flavor 2 3 
I have 4 felines of my own and feed the one who sleeps in my backyard who has been stopping by to eat supper on an  almost daily basis for 3 years.<br />I am never surprised at the things my finiky, spoiled kittys will turn their collective noses up about. I have learned through testing and error what they will generally eat, but they never cease to amaze me: will not touch crab, shrimp, calf liver or lamb. Usually they are pretty good about all things seafood though. I am aware that the older female is not fond of food in the form of Pate. However, I have two kittens who will generally eat whatever is put before them (the no crab, shrimp, liver or lamb rules were in place when they arrived.) The older male is better about taking on new things than the older female. He WILL eat pate.<br />This particular item Friskies Cat Foof Classic Pate, 4 flavor Seafood Variety Pack was purchased primarily for the outside kitty who is not technically mine. I buy Friskies food for him all the time. It is so convenient to have these Packs set up on Subscribe and Save. They are delivered to my front door and I do not have to lug them home from the local grocers. That gives almost everything that arrives from Amazon on a routine basis a 3 star rating from me to start with. Usually Subscribe and Save Items work UP to a 4 star or 5 star rating from there. I have no shame, but say with gratitude that those items have a favorable positive predjudice from me going for them from the beginning! This Pack was no exception. I thought my older female might refuse it, but expected to hysteria from the others, outside Kitty inclded.<br />All four inside cats are now getting a half of a 3 oz can at their back feeding station at supper time. I used to give them all a whole can, but jealousy of the kittens is still present, so each gets a half and then I go to fix dinner for my outside, feral guy who is known simply as "Yellow Kitty."<br />Now, I am not dense, I realize that the four of mine were accostomed to an entire 3 oz can each for supper at one point. Then the green eyed monster of Jealousy appeared on the scene and brought along with her Screeches and Skirmishes over what bowl belonged to whom (Each had his own station which was 10 feet away from the next fur person. Squabbles ensued anyway.) So the Front Feeding Station now has two bowls which hold a half can each and in the next room is the Kitten Station with two bowls which hold a half can. Everyone circulates around and disagreements have almost disappeared. I admit to the use on the elder cats of a calming collar: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003SLYWLQ">Calming Cat Collar 1 Count</a> and to the use of Feliway throughout the house.:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00608SVD4">Feliway Electric Diffuser Kit with Vial Electric Diffuser Kit with Vial</a>.<br />Having become an artist at cat rigamarole, I usually suceed in finding foods that the cats will eat. Friskies is a dietary staple. I receive The The Meaty Bits and the Seafood variety pack plus the Pouches of Gravy Sensations on a regular rotating basis. EVERYBODY will eat those. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00376301U">Friskies Prime Filets Seafood Selections Variety Pack, Seafood, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CJG2H2">Friskies Cat Food Meaty Bits Variety Pack, 24-Count</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012KIB8K">Friskies Gravy Sensations Pouch Favorites, 6-Flavor Variety Pack, 3-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 24)</a>.<br />The Pates being reviewed came up on Amazon's Recommendations For Me a few days ago. I was thrilled. This was a 32 pack instead of the 24 Packs that I usually get. So I ordered it right away. I was just about out of large canned food and none was due until mid January.<br />During my feeding production tonight, I gave part of one can of food, thereby using 3 of the varieties, placed at various feeding stations. I paid no attention to who ate what but headed out to feed the outside boy, Yellow Kitty. Salmon flavor had not gone to an indoor cat, so I gave it to him, along with a can of Mariner's Stew. Yellow Kitty eats a lot in the winter when it is cold and hunting is difficult. He is only fed in the evening, so will eat a lot at his first sitting, then nibble on and off until his next feeding.<br />Today was a BUSY DAY. It is 21ntin days until Christmas and I still have many things to wrap. Little last minute sales precipitate unplanned purchases, and that means more wrapping, and, what is for Christmas Dinner. Better be on that too!<br />So, I paid little attention to who ate what and went busily on my way. It must have also been "noisily" on my was as no one mentioned a thing.<br />As I was preparing for bed, I started turning off lights. The back door light was on. Yellow Kitty is fed by the back door. His wet food bowls were almost full though the dry food was almost depleted, which was unusual. Usually he eats the wet food first. Hmmmmmm.....<br />Front feeding station: Friskies Meaty bits which were a leftover, had disappeared. Otherwise, it appeared that one or two bites had been taken and then the rest was left. Kitten Room: Bowls were full, just as they were in the back feeding station. Oh well, I went to bed.<br />The next morning, bowls were still full. Breakfast of a different variety was served and gobbled down by all.<br /><br />This scenario took place several times over the next 10 days. Yellow Kitty, who lives outside, finally began to give in and eat about half his normal portion. My inside kids continued to nibble at the pate. They then ate some dry food and waited a bit, THEN BEGAN TO COMPLAIN LOUDLY FOR SOMETHING GOOD TO EAT! I finally caved and gave them a different menu.<br /><br />This product recieves 2 Stars which represents "I don't like it." I really would not personally have feeling about the Pate and would let the cats vote. HOWEVER 1. I have had to clean up several uneaten meals which means picking up and doing something with 4-6 bowls of disgusting looking brown stuff which purports that it is Cat Food; however, my guys will not eat it. 2. I have to delete my Subscribe and Save order. It ism't much of a pain to do so, but I like to think that if I put an item on S&S, I will give Amazon their money's worth and reorder the item several times. 3. Also, I now have about 3/4 of the pack in the cupboard and that must be taken out and donated to someone. It adds up to more work than I had in mind.<br /><br />I guess that is the 2 star bottom line: my cats will not eat it and it causes a disposal dilemma. Gabriella, Trinity, Mischief, Mercy, Yellow Kitty and I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT because none of my 5 Fur People will eat it. MY CATS WILL NOT EAT THIS AT ALL, AT ALL 2 3 
I really wanted to love Cherry Switch. I'm a big fan of cherry-flavored sodas and I like Switch's blend of natural juices, vitamin C, and filtered water. On paper, this seemed like the perfect beverage for me. In reality, it tasted like I was drinking a vitamin. You ever have one of those cherry-flavored acerola tablets? That's what drinking Cherry Switch is like.<br /><br />By no means if the beverage offensive; it's just not particularly tasty. I'll give it credit for being a natural product that offers vitamin C, but I'm dinging it for the taste. Would I got out of my way to buy this drink? Absolutely not. Would I buy it as an impulse purchase if I saw it at a deli? Maybe...but chances are, something else would get my attention.<br /><br />On another positive note, my wife liked the beverage because of its low carbonation. If regular soda is too bubbly for you then maybe you'll enjoy this product. Great Concept, But Tastes Like You're Drinking a Vitamin 3 2 
We had an earlier model of this jug, with a rope instead of the rubber "rope."  My dog was able to get the food out a little easier, which I preferred.  This rubber thing in the middle quite effectively blocks the food and my dog gives up.  She used to eat her whole meal everyday in the old jug.  So I am disappointed they changed it. not as good as the previous model 3 2 
Berries are find, but the package is bad. Unable to open neatly and then it rips open and your berries are all over the floor. get a new package 3 2 
My baby loves this apple sauce. He didn't like the gerber brand at all, but yummys this down right away and I like that it is organic. yummy 5 4 
I ordered the Grade B Hidden Springs Syrup -- Grade B is my favorite for baking.  I love the strong, rich maple flavor.  This is my favorite amongst several maple syrups that I've ordered from Amazon.  Maple syrup is understandably expensive, but this syrup is a good value among its' competitors. Rich maple flavor, good value 5 4 
I ordered these to try them out and the price was cheaper than the supermarket.  The cinnamon apple bars are not tasty at all.  They have a very dry texture and taste chalky with a (surprisingly) bitter after taste.<br /><br />Basically, they are not palatable...there are better fiber bars out there--especially the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YNQRSM">Gnu Foods Flavor & Fiber Cinnamon Raisin 1.6 oz. (Pack of 16)</a> --<br /><br />I know a few people gave high ratings to this, but honestly, these bars are not very good at all.....YUCK is the best way to describe them. Yuck...they are really not tasty at all! 1 2 
We have a pug that suffers from chronic ear infections and skin problems.  We've consistently kept him on expensive brands that are well known for having good ingredients like California Natural, Chicken Soup for the dog lover's soul, Royal Canin, and a couple others that I can't remember off the top of my head.<br /><br />My Mom picked up this Newman's food because it was available at the grocery store.  They love the food, but what really surprises me is that his ears and skin have improved dramatically.  His stools are also much firmer and way less stinky than before.  This food seems like a real winner for us. This food is working shockingly well for our allergy prone pug. 5 4 
I have been drinking espresso a long time and use the beans in my Jura X90 commercial automatic espresso machine.  Larry's beans are way too light to work as an espresso blend.  The coffee tastes good, but it is not the strong taste that a seasoned espresso drinker is looking for. Not Really Espresso 2 3 
The taste was ok, but every cup ended up having sediment at the bottom of the cup.  I will not be buying this brand again.  So far, Brooklyn Bean Cyclone and Coffee People Jet Fuel are my favorites. Sediment in every cup 3 2 
What can I say??? This is delicious on any day.  Sip til your heart's content. Chocolate Heaven 4 5 
I really love Cheez-ITs. I can sit down in front of the tv with a box and before I know it, it's half gone. But these were different. I don't know why, but I expected just a little more from this box, and yet it seemed to fall just short of hitting the nail directly on the head. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed them, but they left an odd after-taste in my mouth that I honestly wasn't that crazy about.<br />Not much else to say, but I do hope that this review helped you in one way or the other.<br />Enjoy. An okay taste, from a delicious brand... 4 3 
When i opened the package the box was wet, so i figured out why it was wet, i found it came form the spam can, the can was not sealed enough, and i guess its not healthy to eat it, but i already opened one can, wonder if i can return the remaining cans,the expiration is year 2014 but i guess it will only last maybe few days since the can wasnt not sealed enough. not sealed enough 1 3 
Despite looking good "on paper," this granola isn't very nutritious.  The recommended serving size (there must be some government regulation that pegs cereal servings at around 1 ounce) is only 1/4 cup!  Who is going to sit down and have just 1/4 cup of cereal for breakfast?  I'm thinking more like 3/4 cup.  This will put you at 500 calories if you add a cup of (skim) milk.  And most of the protein will be coming from the milk, since even three "servings" of this granola will only give you 6g.  (See the pictures I uploaded for a closeup of the Nutrition Facts label and what one serving looks like.)<br /><br />But if you do go and have yourself a 500-calorie bowl of cereal (570 if you're using whole milk), it's actually pretty filling.  With 18g of sugar in a 3/4-cup triple serving, you're going to be feeling kind of guilty, but the triple serving would have 6g of fiber, so at least that will help slow down the sugar spike.<br /><br />The taste is pretty good.  It's kind of like you went for a hike with a chocolate bar and some trail mix and they melted together.  Can't go wrong with that!  With the notes of coconut, it kind of reminded me of German chocolate icing.<br /><br />I didn't think I'd like the berries, but I do, and I actually wish the mix had more (and bigger pieces of them; these are minuscule).  Watch out if you order online and the weather is hot.  My bag arrived kind of melty (made me feel like I'd been hiking!), but I take that as a sign of the chocolate's quality.<br /><br />If this weren't so carby (and expensive), I could happily sit down and eat it every morning.  But it is, so I won't. Tastes great, but serving size is ridiculous 4 3 
Hun Fung? Who wrote this?! They can't even spell sriracha! It's the same Huy Fong sauce from Rosemead, CA, and full of preservatives. Go for Shark brand from Thailand. Read the Label 2 1 
The coffee cartels and monopolies are desperately trying to control market prices, enter Coffee Bean Direct, offering a great product for a very reasonable price, and oh soo fresh too! That $8.99 a pound stuff at the grocery is just not on the same page! I am gonna shut up now; you need to go order up a bag and see for for yourself! you gotta try this--best for the buck!! 5 1 
After reading all of the positive reviews, I was anxious to try out this product.  I was so disappointed when I got it.  The texture is chalky and the taste to me is unpleasant.  It was really quite solid so I warmed it up so that I could mix it up better.  It became more of a spreadable consistency, but the grainy texture and the taste did not improve.  I'm going to try using some of it in my smoothies, but if it still doesn't taste good to me, it's going into the garbage.<br /><br />I also ordered the Artisana coconut butter and Artisana macadamia butter.  I had the same same bad experience with the coconut butter in that the texture was grainy and the taste was unpleasant to me.  I did, however, really like the macadamia butter a lot. dislike!  awful tasting 1 2 
I ordered this product because I have enjoyed Crystal Light since it first came on the scene. I was really looking forward to enjoying all the packettes of drink. I have high blood pressure and imagine my dismay when I discovered the Strawberry (which I was very much anticipating) was an "energy" drink with caffiene added. I had always relied upon Crystal Light because I did not have to worry about getting ingredients which would be harmful to my health, however if I had not noticed the caffiene in the packettes and drank them my blood pressure would have shot up and I could have had ill effects from it. I threw all the Strawberry packettes in the trash so I did not feel I got the value that I paid for because in the discription there was nothing about caffiene. crystal light on-the-go variety pack..44 count 3 2 
These are not the famous ghost chilis that send you screaming in pain, they are a smoked chili of mild heat. I was unhappy with them because I wanted fire and got a fizzle. I will say they add a smokey element to what you are adding it to but not much heat. If you want a little extra flavor they work but if you want heat keep looking. I have a bunch of hot sauces way hotter and a bottle of 1,000,000 scoville unit capcacin extract that made everyone that tried it totally light up in pain. Now that's what a ghost chili is supposed to do. not ghost chilis 3 2 
Not what I expected. From the taste I honestly thought it might be a vegetarian concoction.<br /><br />I will not buy again. Bland 1 2 
I will start by being kind, It is a good idea to save money with an item or concept like this. It makes good sense to use your own coffee beans and avoid the cost of the pre-filled commercial K-cups you buy at the store.<br /><br />Now, I received my DisposaKups over a month after ordering them and put them to use.  I was immediately disappointed, filters did not hold very much coffee, It was a struggle to get the lids to fit together with the filter and outer plastic cup.  The coffee was very weak.<br /><br />This product actually creates more waste in a landfill than the commercially made K-cups. The body and lids are plastic.  Normal K-cups do not have a plastic lid.  Notice they say 100% disposable....So put them in the trash. They are not recyclable = landfill.<br /><br />They are not convenient, they are a bit messy, a pain to put together and still expensive.  Not worth it! There are better alternatives out there that will save you money, make better coffee and not go into a landfill.<br /><br />Sorry, I wish I had better news, I think I will return these. Liking things that make sense and work 1 2 
I have been following directions for about a month with the kefir I received--which by the way was a very miniscule amount, looked to be a little less than a teaspoon!  It does something--resulting in curds resembling cottage cheese, but so far I see nothing like translucent "kefir grains" developing. I have an excellent source of fresh raw cows milk and I've tried 24 and 48 hour culturing.  I've tried draining it using a plastic can colander and straining it in a regular plastic colander.  Maybe kefirs vary from source to source.  I am still new at this.  So far I just mix part of the curds into already made yogurt and put the rest back into the jar to make more of this stuff. I did appreciate the referral to Dom's site Maybe Kefir 3 2 
Not really the best tea but not awful either. It is good if you just feel for a cup of tea and don't have anything else. It's okay 4 3 
I enjoyed the vanilla flavor of this shake.  It was smooth, not gritty.  Although I am not sure I would be a regular user of this.  After a workout I am not concerned with replenishing calories.  If I am I will have a piece of chicken.  Usually I am more concerned with hydration.  I am not knocking this product for its lack of hydration (it is not meant to be used for that), I am just explaining why I would not use it regularly.  I could see that it would be nice if I know I have to run off somewhere and I can having anything to eat.<br /><br />That said, I did not find this shake very filling.  Within the hour I was looking for something else to eat. Good tasting, but not that filling 3 4 
The names of these juice drinks rarely really reflect the majority of what is actually in them.<br /><br />Ingredients: 100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, kiwi, acerola, raspberry and strawberry juice concentrates), natural flavors, ascorbic acid (vitamin c).<br /><br />I've never heard of acerola and I want to know what the "natural flavors" are.  Anyway, its really mostly apple and grape. Of course, you probably don't want to drink pure kiwi and berry juice, they are just the "flavor".  So, this is a lighter flavored alternative.  I like that the carbonation isn't overdone.  There's just a bit of fizz.  Its sweet, but not horribly.  Its definitely better than soda and I like it better than the other carbonated juice drink that I have tried (other one had too much carbonation).<br /><br />I get irritated that the nutrition facts are so brief.  Surely this stuff provides more vitamins and minerals than vitamin C.  Did they kill the vitamins in the manufacturing process or are they just not telling us what is there.  If its there, you'd think the company would want to advertise it.  If it isn't, where did it go?  (BTW I have this gripe about most nutrition labels).<br /><br />So, its a good drink, probably good for you and definitely better than soda. Its a pleasant fizz 4 2 
Ordered it, but they didn't have it in stock, luckily they promptly gave me a refund. never got it, was refunded quickly though 3 2 
I usually buy this at our local Whole Foods or Harris Teeter it's a great product but when I ordered it from Amazon all but 2 out of 12 cans arrived dented. Amazon quickly replaced the order but in the replacement case 9 cans were dented. That is really unacceptable. They did refund my $ but I really want the pumpkin so I am going to try one more time and order it again and see if I can get a case of undented cans. Too many dented cans 3 2 
This is just fat, pure fat, made from soy bean oil.  And, it's too hot for me.  If you don't care how many calories you pour over your food, and that those calories are all fat calories, you won't care that this is so incredibly high in both.<br /><br />I don't like hot stuff.  A little bit of tang is a good thing, but all I tasted in this is hot.  I really didn't taste the flavor at all.<br /><br />This is a pass for me. High Calorie, High Fat - Hot 2 1 
Hmm. I don't doubt these ingredients are good! But my cats don't love this and one of them only eats the 'gravy' part and ends up with really bad diarrhea. So...I guess my two are just picky since it seems to be a hit with others! Diarrhea and such. 2 3 
DESCRIPTION:<br />> Blue Diamond Roasted-Salted Almonds are moderately roasted with canola, safflower, or sunflower oil (but not oily or greasy), and lightly salted.  These are "heart healthy" oils which are actually good for you, as is the almond oil itself.  Roasted Salted Almonds are available in bags or small cans small.<br />> Blue Diamond Smokehouse Almonds are similar with wonderful smokey flavor.  At this time Smokehouse Almonds are available from Amazon only in 16 oz (and smaller) bags.<br />> I have not tried the "lightly salted" variety but I presume that they have almost no salt.<br /><br />CANS vs BAGS<br />Various types of Blue Diamond Almonds are available in bags or small cans.  The small cans (3 1/4" in diameter by 2 3/8" high) are very convenient and assure that the almonds stay fresh until openned, and afterward, because they don't stay "openned" long (it is easy to eat a whole can at one setting).  Arguably the bags more environmentally friendly, but you don't get much of a price break for the much cheaper packaging.  I prefer the convenience and freshness of the cans.<br /><br />EVALUATION: Excellent and flavorful.  Well roasted and crunchy.  I cannot decide which I like best: the Roasted Salted or the Smokehouse.  Although not oily, the roasting oil does effect the flavor.  Whether that's a good thing or not is a matter of individual tastes.  I happen to like the roasted-in-oil flavor.<br /><br />LESS ROASTED ALMONDS<br />If you prefer less-roasted almonds, roasted without added oil, consider <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001COJ85G">Back To Nature California Almonds, Sea Salt Roasted, 11-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3)</a><br /><br />UNROASTED ALMONDS<br />Unroasted almonds are available <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001COE1AI">Back To Nature California Almonds, Unroasted & Unsalted, 11-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3)</a> but beware that thorough roasting makes almonds more digestable.  Unroasted almonds are susceptable to fungus which can be carcinogenic.  While commercial domestic almonds sold in the US do not contain significant levels of cyanide, bitter almonds, (which have a much richer almond flavor, particular in baked goods).  Indeed natural almond extract is made from bitter almonds---artificial almond extract is safer.  Bitter almonds are sometimes illegally sold in the US and are often encountered in other countries, and do contain dangerous levels of cyanide when raw.  7-10 raw bitter almonds can kill a child.  Moreover, a child raised on raw almonds may conclude that raw peach pits (essentially a variety of almonds) are safe to eat---they are NOT.  The safest practice is NOT to eat unroasted almonds.

I recently purchased these capsules because some of the reviews were positive.  I was excited to order them so I can use my own real Italian espresso beans.  Nespresso does not quite understand the consumer yet.  The consumer wants options not restrictions on having to order nespresso coffee only and very very limited where you can buy them.  So when I saw these capsules, it was excited.  Unfortunately, they don't work.  They are too thin that they crush when you put the lever down. Good idea but it would be great if they work.  Maybe, next time. Not Worth the Money 1 2 
A diluted hot sauce derived from the jalape&ntilde;o pepper. A 5 oz bottle is far too small given its diluted nature. You might use close to a bottle for a single family sized meal.<br /><br />Ingredients (as listed, in this order, from the product label): Water, acetic acid, jalape&ntilde;o peppers, carrots, sugar, ...etc<br /><br />Tasting notes - diluted heat along with a heavy vinegar taste and, at best, a vague jalape&ntilde;o flavor.  The vinegar flavor dominates (acetic acid is a component of vinegar).<br /><br />As noted in the title of my review - a below average hot sauce. I'd pass on this one. The vinegar taste is over powering. Note that the second ingredient (after water) is acetic acid (a chemical component of vinegar)!<br /><br />I'd recommend the El Yucateco Hot Jalape&ntilde;o Hot sauce which uses the same Jalape&ntilde;o pepper but it has a much purer and fresher taste. I love the Jalape&ntilde;o pepper but this sauce does not feature its fine qualities very well.<br /><br />PS - As should be evident -- I enjoy taste testing hot sauces and writing up my results. I've tried about 50 different ones to date. I try very hard to describe flavor notes and list the actual ingredients. A Weak, Sweet and  Heavy on the Vinegar hot sauce. Far below average. You can do MUCH better! 1 3 
I bought these because I'm a sucker for low calorie carbs. I just loves my rice, noodles, pasta, etc.and thought these would be a great substitute.  These are a no calorie substitute, but like substituting tofu for meat, the taste is in the myriad of ingredients you cook them with. They have no taste on their own and a rather obnoxiously slimy texture. The fishy smell you get when you open a package quickly dissipates with rinsing in cold water, they firm up a little with a quick parboil, but on their own they are BLAH. I have stir fried them and boiled them for soup with veggies, garlic, sauces, you name it. They aren't worth the effort. I will continue to stir fry and boil veggies, but I probably won't bother with these "noodles" again. A Tofurkey will never be a turkey and these will never satisfy a noodle craving. Different, not unpleasent, but not a treat either 2 3 
These are a pleasing size and retain a good texture, without the "rubber eraser" taste when chewed for a while, but all the various colors taste the same, with no decernable fruit flavors.  The purple (grape?) may have a slight tang.  They are not overly sweet, which is good, but have no interesting flavor(s).  A disappointment. what about flavors? 2 3 
I don't know how they did it, but this pepper doesn't taste like pepper.  I prefer course ground pepper so it isn't just that I am expecting it to behave like regular pepper.  It is bland.<br /><br />The glass jars are nice and I will be able to make use of them or this product might have only got 2 stars. Not great 3 2 
We love the Earth's Best line in our house. Our 9 mo old daughter  will ONLY eat Earth's Best dinners, and I don't blame her. The smell from both of the other 2 brand was nauseating. I've sampled the Earth's best dinners myself, and they aren't half bad... It is baby food.... The fruit blends and veggie blends are great as well. Earth's Best is the BEST 5 2 
My beagle has severe food allergies, especially to anything high in beef and chicken. Alternative meats just give him horrible gas to go along with his itchy skin. This food works WONDERS. A few days after feeding it to him, his itching stopped completely. Not only that, but he has a beautiful coat. I have heard a lot of criticism for feeding my little guy vegetarian food. People say that he's not getting enough nutrients and it's unnatural for a dog to be a vegetarian. I would much rather feed him something with more meat protein, but it would only work if I fed him steroids for the itching. I think the food is the lesser of two evils. His vet says that he's perfectly healthy and there's nothing wrong with a vegetarian diet. My only qualm is this: why does it have to be so expensive?! It's worth every penny, but seriously? And Natural Balance NEVER sends out coupons. Natural Balance - Vegetarian 4 5 
What more can I say. Barley Edible - Crunch on Sugar.  Did come on time but have a feeling that they wanted this unloaded because it didn't sell or maybe bad batch.  Doesn't make you sick or anything like that but you can actually find yourself crunching on sugar like you put a sugar cube in your mouth.  Kids probably don't care.  Hope this helps. Barley Edible - Crunch on Sugar 2 4 
Bought a plastic tub of this.  It was not good.  Folgers I like.  I thought this would be of similar taste.  Too weak.  Threw it out half way.  Life is too short to settle on bad coffee. Not Good 2 1 
For at least a year Amazon has been shipping me two dozen cans a month of Crown Prince Two Layer Brisling Sardines. I happen to love sardines, at least the northern-based sardines, such as from Norway or Scotland. Hence my continuing order from Amazon. However, suddenly, with this month's shipment, the quality seems to have changed, for the worse. The sardines this past shipment are darker in color and with a salty flavor. It's as if the packer has changed his procedures or the fish have come from a different place. I'm going to accept my November shipment to see if it was an aberration, but if it wasn't, I'll cancel my order. Has something changed? 3 2 
While I received what I was looking for, the picture showed six sticks and the description said that the shipping weight would be 12.8 oz.  When it arrived it was ONE 12" stick, weighing ONE oz, and in a box that weighed nowhere near 12 oz.  For this I paid over $5 shipping.  The ad was misleading for not indicating exactly what would be received.  Additionally, this is the same picture that they show for some they sell for 4x the price and a shipping weight of 16 oz.  The shipping cost for this item is the same.  I would be hesitant to order this item for fear that I would not know what I would be getting. Great Product, Misleading Ad 2 1 
I got this to go with the HCG diet - Not much flavor.  I tried chocolate and English Toffee - both had more flavor.  Difficult to find in stores -and much more expensive in stores.  Worth it to have a different flavor - but if only buying a couple buy a different flavor.  Ones that come in packages of 2 are a better deal.  Find a friend and split! Not much flavor 2 3 
I am potato chip-addicted. I don't only enjoy potato chips, but I also enjoy any type of potato product. This product really hit the mark for me.<br /><br />I consider these a full-fledged snack. Each bag is packed with chips. They are moderately seasoned, and full of flavor. The consistency is slightly like a popcorn cake -- but they're crisp and crunchy, not puffy. They have a distinct potato taste.<br /><br />The best part? Each bag clocks in at only 100 calories! And I repeat -- these are not a simple "100 calorie" snack. What you get here is a full bag of chips. What's great about the content vs. calorie content is that these are perfect to accompany your lunch without feeling guilty about eating a 200-300 calorie bag of chips.<br /><br />My personal favorites were the Sea Salt and Vinegar and the Original. The barbecue flavor is sweet, not smoky. The Salt and Pepper, Cheddar, and Sour Cream and Onion flavors are standard fair. But the chips are adequately and evenly seasoned and I did not notice differences in seasoning from one chip to the next.<br /><br />These are a great product, well manufactured, and a treat to eat. I'll definitely buy more of these in the future. Tasty potato chips, low in calories, great flavor 5 4 
Most cats have a hard time digesting cows' milk, as much as they love it.  The problem is the lactose, and Whiskas Catmilk is a reduced lactose milk product with taurine and other vitamins added.<br /><br />Cats need taurine.  Most mammals can make their own, but cats can't.  They have to eat taurine.  However, powdered taurine is cheap, and you can find it right here on Amazon.  These little boxes of brown milk will cost you more per ounce than grass fed organic milk costs.  For me, it makes sense to keep them handy, because my geyser cat can keep this stuff down when no other food product will stay in her, and that keeps her out of a fatty liver crisis.  But if what you are trying to accomplish is as simple as giving your cat who eats normal food a treat?  Try having a carton of lactaid on hand. Save yoursefl some money and use lactaid 3 4 
I wasn't expecting the product to bs packed in water. Has a fishy smell that almost made me not even try it. Kinda a pain to cook, and really had no taste at all. I'm going try cooking with veggies next time to see if that makes it better. smelly 3 2 
This item was cute, but had absolutely no appeal to the 2 five month old Labs I have. They picked it up once and that was it. Basically, money wasted!<br />The company offered to take them back, but the postage would cost about the same as the item, so I declined.<br />Note: I've purchased several of the Nylabone products (toys to bones, etc.) for my pups, from 10 weeks old to their current 7 months, they have yet to use any of them at all.<br />Might work for some, but I ended up giving them all to the humane society. Cute, but puppies didn't use it. 2 1 
Not a good flavor overall. I have only tried the TERIYAKI flavored strips, and hate them. The texture and the sweetness is just gross together. I'm going to try a different flavor before writing this off, but yuck. I'm a vegan by the way, and I've had some amazingly delicious fake-feet products: this is not one of them. Teriyaki flavor primal strips 3 2 
Coconut water not for me, but will keep it in my emergency kit...just in case we get any more of those earthquakes and it nocks out power for awhile....lol! SoSo 2 3 
I personally didn't like the flavor. It tasted okay when you actually toast them, but raw it was an odd experience. weird flavor 3 2 
Fast delivery and packaging was excellent.  The kisses are exactly as expected - excellent taste and plenty of almonds.  The kisses were made with milk chocolate and packaged in 10oz plastic bags.  I wish the kisses were available with with sugar free sweetener and almonds. Hershey Kisses 4 5 
Over the years I've had the pleasure of receiving jumbo cashews as gifts. These cashews, unless the USDA has changed their grading standards are not jumbo. Furthermore, the bags are uniformly filled with maybe 10% broken pieces some in half, others broken and split. The thing is, when you look at the broken pieces it's clear that they are not the same size or grade as the whole cashews. Cheat! The nuts also had a taste that was that of Cashews that have spent some time in warehouses. The nuts are not terrible, but the consumer is being cheated by paying a premium for a very average product. Not recommended. Over priced, and underwhelming 2 1 
*Previous lists don't mention the French Vanilla, which was incl.<br /><br />I've enjoyed quite a few varieties of Timothy's (and others)K-Cups and had little to no problems with them. Cinnamon Pastry is one example of a coffee I really enjoy.<br /><br />This variety pack however seems to be a mix of their least popular blends, or perhaps the batches that were slightly "off". And going off this experience I won't be trying any of the coffees in the pack on their own except for the Kona & Breakfast blends.<br /><br />The tastes were dark (burnt), bitter and unappealing, each cup made me regret my choice to reach for the coffee mug. Not to mention the after effects were not pleasant, I actually could feel the crappiness of these blends for hours.<br /><br />The French Vanilla was downright disgusting, I don't think they could decide if they wanted to make a soft vanilla flavor  or a strong vanilla liquor experience and it's a horrible mix of the two.<br /><br />Also, as previously mentioned, nearly half the box is NOT coffee but tea's that sound... more interesting than appealing.<br /><br />So if you're in for an adventure and don't really care about the taste of your coffee or tea, go for it!<br /><br />Otherwise... consider sample packs directly through the coffee company, they cost less and give you better options. Not a fan! 2 3 
My son is sensitive to cows milk protein and I am trying to keep him off of soy.  My milk was not enough for him, and I did not like the ingredients in baby formula (all had soy and most have cows milk protein, not to mention 45% corn syrup solids).  My pediatrician recommended this powdered goats milk because they add folate (not normally found in goats milk).  Since I have been feeding my son this milk, he has been SO happy and growing so much better! Have not had to add any vitamins/supplements to it to make it a whole food, it is fine on its own. Although, I have been using organic brown rice cereal because he is getting close to being ready for solids.  LOVE this milk! (always consult your doctor before changing your babies diet) Great Alternate for Baby Formula!! 5 4 
Just started using this so will update more later, I have an older cat 15 years old, everything she ate she would throw up she pretty much grew up on Iam's Weight Control cat food due to a previous urinary tract infection,and a weight problem (vet recommended) she weighed in at 17 lbs her heaviest the Iams never helped for years for weight control.Later in life she started losing the weight got down to a perfect weight then really started to lose to much then the last bag of Iams I bought her she refused to eat but a couple of kibbles a day, she was starving herself to death because even then she was throwing up,(she went down to 7lbs) I bought the Science Diet Sensitive stomach she is finally eating again, not throwing up so the food is A-OK with me and will spend the price for it, but like I said just starting using it will update on how she does more in to eating the food. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of 5 is the price and since I ordered this food online maybe finding the product in the stores around here I live very rural so getting to a store is a chore in itself at times. Great product 4 5 
So I am a huge Chocolate Peanut Butter freak, and have been looking for a peanut butter cup cocoa for a while. I finally broke down and ordered this after a few months hemming and hawwing about it. Now I aadmit to not reading the directions the first cup and at first was like wow slightly chocolate water and added a few more spoonfuls of the mix to my cup and it improved but was not quite what i expected and this was made with water(I was at work and had little choice) The next day I deceided to try it again at home in my hot cocoa machine with milk and there was a GREAT improvement!! So as a result I'm going to try an experiment tonight and make a shake in the blender with the mix!!! I said im a peanut butter cup freak!!! Pretty good 3 2

This peach flavored diet tea by Snapple is extremely refreshing after a long summer's day! It's truly a diet tea--there are zero calories. It's best served chilled; and it has a mild but not overwhelming peach flavor to it that is just right. Snapple makes this with green and black tea leaves; there's also a mild green tea flavor mixed in with the peach flavoring. They use filtered water as well. This tea is sweetened somewhat with Aspartame; but Snapple adds in just the right amount so that it's not excessively sweet. If you want really tea that is rather sweet, you'll either have to look further or use this with added sweetener. It also contains phenylalanine and it is kosher if these are dietary concerns for you.<br /><br />If you have other questions, the company has a toll free number so that people can contact them.<br /><br />Overall, this tea is perfect for a hot summer's day when you want something cool to refresh yourself and whet your whistle. I highly recommend this product. "Yep--it's a diet !!!" 5 4 
They taste great. Of course they are some what expensive. The lower rating is because of slow order processing and shipment. I ordered this on July 19 it wasn't shipped until July 26 I received it then on July 31. Which was the weekend and we were gone all weekend. So they sat on our doorsept all weekend. But they did put an ice pack in the packaging. So that helped. My daugther came home and found them and put them in refri. right away for me so when I got home and tried one they were fine. I think if you are not in a hurry order them. Otherwise find another source to get these bars. They are good and taste just like a real chocolate bar. Enjoy Life Dark Chocolate Bars 4 3 
I really enjoy this disposable. The only thing that would make it better would be for the cups and lids to be made out of a more eco friendly material. Coffee tastes great. good alternative 5 4 
The package had 2" cuts down the center of the bag. The bag was also wrinkly. When I purchase this dog food at local stores the bags never look in bad condition as this one did. Some kibble had come through the cuts and spilled in the amazon packaging box. Not pleased, who knows how sanitary the food is anymore with the bag  broken. Love wellness brand dog food, but not the seller.<br />About wellness small breed- my toy poodle I was told was underweight even with free feed on  eukanuba  but know is a health weight due to the good taste and small kibble size. After disc surgery I soaked his food and he ate on own, big accomplishment for a picky eater who is in post surgery discomfort. Low low marks for seller, love Wellness brand 1 2 
Buffalo Bills Premium Snacks<br /><br />I realize that taste is an individual thing, but I thought I'd share my thoughts on these products.<br /><br />First, customer service is excellent.  I've always gotten exactly what I ordered in a very timely manner.<br /><br />So far I've ordered the following products:<br /><br />1) Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Mild Short Shots<br /><br />2) Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Hot Short Shots<br /><br />The first two short shots are very similar to Slim Jim's, just not individually wrapped, I just put them in a zip lock bag and find them very convenient to munch on( about a quarter pound per bag.<br /><br />3) Buffalo Bills 1.2lb Extra Smokeys<br />These are very smokey, but a little too dry for my taste.<br /><br />4) Buffalo Bills 16oz Premium Hickory Beef Jerky Pieces (random size)<br /><br />Taste great if you are a jerky lover.<br /><br />5) Buffalo Bills 2.1lb Pepperoni  Short Shots<br />Probably the closest to Slim Jim's of all the short shots<br /><br />6) Big Buffalo Ole Smokies<br />Fatter, crisp not as crunchy as short shots, individually wrapped.<br /><br />7) Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Honey Strung<br />O.K. taste.  My wife hates the smell.  My Brother doesn't care much for them either.<br /><br />All- in- all, I highly recommend these products (in the order listed) and this company.<br /><br />Gunner  January, 2010 A Mild Slim Jim 5 3 
This order of crackers was burned, the entire case! The tops of the crackers were falling off because of it.<br /><br />If you like burned crackers, then these are for you.<br /><br />The price has also increased. Let's see now, burned crackers, super high price. Do you really want to purchase this item?<br /><br />Where oh where is Susie and quality control? Crackers Were Burned 2 1 
I love apple chips but these were terrible. They are rubbery and did not taste any apple flavor. I would not buy them Not good 2 1 
My wife and I shared a can of illy issimo Coffee Drink. I am not a great fan of cold coffee so I included my wife's opinion in this review, since she drinks iced coffee daily. The illy was too strong for both of us, but was not bitter. If it had been hot I probably would have liked sipping it, it seems to be close to the strength of espresso. My wife added ice and a lot of flavored half and half and found it very good. Doing as she did, rather defeats the purpose of a can of coffee that one opens and drinks on the go. I would recommend this drink to those who like cold espresso. very strong 3 4 
I was interested in trying this coffee.  Although I don't have a problem with the acidity in most coffees, when we make a pot of coffee, we often tend to let it sit for several hours while we drink it over time, so we need a coffee whose flavor is able to be consistent for the duration.<br /><br />I was a bit wary of trying a French Roast--my husband and I tend to prefer our coffee on the mild side, and thus we usually drink Breakfast Blend varieties.  Upon opening the package, however, this coffee did not smell overly strong, nor was the flavor overwhelming.  In fact, perhaps due to the low acid, I found it to be a relatively mild-tasting coffee with just a hint of "roastiness" to it.  The flavor did remain fairly consistent over time.  I would not re-purchase this coffee myself, as there are definitely other brands that I prefer, but if you find the acid in coffee to be problematic, this may be worth a try. Makes a decent cup of coffee 4 3 
My cats love it.  It is a bit overpriced though.  And I don't like the epackaging claim that it is made of rice paper.  Now, that sounds all so nice and eco friendly, but the truth is, it is plastic.  Perhaps the outer packaging is layered with rice paper for effect.  This doesn't change the fact that I am stuck with plastic packaging that is not biodegradable, and possible leaching of chemicals into the product.  Nonetheless, I concede convenience of plastic packaging and some inevitability of its use, especially in shipping.  Just, let's not make a misleading claim to give off a wrong impression. a great appetizer 4 3 
I had been offering my housecats the Fancy Feast canned foods with the Fancy Feast kibble always available.  My black Coonie-mix cat would regularly vomit up the clearly identifiable, undigested, highly dyed, cutesy shaped, Fancy Feast bits (usually on my cream colored carpet!)  This cat also had already had to have one tooth extracted and I wanted to try to feed him something that would set better on his tummy.  After doing some web researching, I ordered our first bag of Royal Canin Indoor Mature Cat 27 a month ago.  We went through the gradual change over thing but I don't think it was really needed as the new food was readily accepted.  The first bag has been eaten and joy, and the upchucking has ceased!!! Even his  hairball "gifts" are getting smaller and much more infrequent.<br /><br />My other Maine Coon is 12 and oddly enough, hairballs never seemed to bother her but, she was eating less and less.  She was becoming less active and just didn't seem to be interested in eating kibble or canned and she was noticably loosing weight! Her vet said she could be heading towards a thyroid problem but he wasn't ready to put her on medication yet.  I am happy to report that my sweet girl has really taken to this Indoor Mature Cat 27 diet.  It is helping her get back to her normal, Maine Coon size and she does seem to be feeling much better, even joining in on some playtime with the young'uns!<br /><br />Who knew a change of diet could work such wonders?  Clearly, the attitude of "kibble is kibble" is out the window.  How could I ever return to feeding my cats a food that would make them vomit?! Cat with Sensitive Stomach Stopped Vomiting! 5 2 
I really like pasta, so I'm probably not a good judge of what's "good" in pasta - I like it all.  That said, I liked this product as far as the food, the taste, etc. goes.  However, I have to say that I really prefer the packaged pasta dishes that Hormel puts out.  With the Hormel products everything in the package is already together.  All you have to do is throw them in the microwave for a bit and you're done - and flavor/product-wise the Hormel packages are just as good as this.  So, in a nutshell - while I liked this product, I really like the Hormel pastas better and will probably stick with those in the future. OK, but NOT that easy to prepare. 3 4 
A very tasty little cake. The cake was surprisingly moist, and the caramel rum sauce was very sweet but not too overpowering. We'll definitely be buying this product again. Very tasty 5 4 
Our Cavalier King Charles Spaniel loves these treats!  We purchased soft milk bones to help her with her training but we have to break them up every time we want to praise her.  There are the perfect size and I don't feel too bad for giving her a couple at a time.  We haven't really started training her but giving them to her every time she goes potty outside rather than inside is working out great.  Glad I got the 1 lb bag too because she is going to go threw them.  Oh, my cat even likes them.... Great treats!! 4 5 
This product is the same as I get in Petsmart at a much better price. The service was quick and efficient. We use it for our old wiener dog who has some iron deficiencies and it helped him alot, but I am not a vet. Good Service,  Excellent Price 5 4 
When it says don't leave dogs unattended with this bone they mean it. It also says don't allow them to ingest pieces larger then rice or something like that... they mean that too. My 18 month old Pit was loving this bone and I tried to take every piece that she chewed off away from her as it came off. A few pieces must have got past me and in her tummy and on the floor, because she started having violent vomiting a day latter, then our 8 year old pit started doing the same. We were for sure that we had got some Chinese chicken strips or something then we started going through the vomit (sick what we do for our kids) and found Nylabone chunks in both dogs vomit. Haven't had a issue since. My husband has banned any product from this company from entering our house again.<br />Buyer beware and watch your dogs. Dogs loved it... but made them sick! What's the point??? 2 1 
This canned chicken is the perfect thing to make a quick salad, sandwhich, or toss into a soup for lunch or dinner.<br /><br />While it will never replace a roast chicken in the oven ready to be served, it's got a nice chicken taste. It's just not as firm as regular chicken you prepared yourself.<br /><br />If you remember to keep a can or two in your desk at work, you won't be without some solid nutrition in a pinch. Try it cold with some yummy salad dressing and a few crackers!<br /><br />Swanson Premium Chunk Chicken Breast is an excellent buy. If you have this in the pantry, you've got a quick meal. 5 4 
I've been buying Jet Fuel for over a year and really like it. So, buying the 50 pack seemed to make sense. Amazon's list price is $27. The third party sellers start at $45. Need I say more? Buy it somewhere else. Great coffee but the price is a rip off 2 3 
This canned cat food is my cat's favorite, and I'm happy to be able to feed it to her. Given what I have read about non-organic cat food, I hope this continues to be available.  She also likes the Newman's organic turkey canned cat food, but that's just her second-favorite. Cat food 4 5 
Out of all the commercial grade dog foods, this one is a higher quality, but do not let that fool you. First, the ingredients are listed by weight, not by content so there is not as much chicken in the product as you might think. To make matters worse, there is only chicken and chicken meal in this product for protein. Soy meal is only a filler for dogs so they get no nutritional value out of it. If there were more meats and less fillers I would be more pleased with this product. I have a beagle puppy who chows this product down, however, this really means nothing. Just because your dog eats it doesn't make it good for them. Make sure the first few ingredients are meat, and the product has little to no grain (rice, oats, barley are GOOD; corn, wheat, soy, etc are NOT). Could be better 2 3 
These packets are easy to use.  Loved that.  Used them at a fundraising event.  However, I had no way to gauge how many servings each packet makes.  I would have appreciated some information about that on the Amazon page and on the packets themselves. I ordered 4 boxes and am stuck with 3.5 boxes that cannot be returned. Easy to use - could use better labeling 4 3 
This tasted disgusting and bland compared to the canned pumpkin that I usually purchase. The store-brand savings is not worth the sacrifice in flavor. I typically eat pumpkin straight out of the can because it is cheap, convenient and healthy. tasted disgusting 3 1 
With two, 5 month old Golden Retriever puppies (and an 8 year old), I was looking for a bag of raw hides at a good price. I realize that the description states 2.5", however the picture makes the bones look like tightly knotted, "normal" sized bones - they are not. They are tiny, almost see-through and take up HALF the length of my palm, and are skinny. The pups devoured the entire bag in less then a week (they were given other treats as well.) I swear when I gave them the first one, they looked at me like "are you kidding??" Lesson learned. If you have a teacup breed, these are the bones for you (that is if teacup breeds even eat raw-hides)!! 3 Stars for Poorly Represented in Picture- For Teacup Breeds!! 3 2 
These sticks definitely don't look like ones in the picture.<br />They are much thinner and IMHO not worth the money. I should have returned it but instead gave my dog (GSD) 5 at a time to keep her busy.<br /><br />I'd stick with the Redbarn or equivalent from another website. sticks are toothpicks compared to redbard bully sticks 1 2 
Like the title says. There just aren't that many nuts. The picture shows a good amount of almonds,peanuts and cranberry. But the bars are mostly made of oats w/ high maltose corn syrup......Whatever that is. But those are really the first 2 ingredients. Other wise it's actually a pretty good bar. Probably not as healthy as a kind bar. But a lot cheaper. If you have sam's club member ship look into buying these there. You can get a pack of 30- 1.2 oz bars for  $10. Quite good. Not enough nuts though 4 3 
Hi, this would be better if it was not as sweet with such an aftertaste, it tastes like saccharin and is a bit overpowering. Regatta Diet Ginger Beer has an aftertaste 2 3 
This review is for Zuke's Chicken-Flavored treats.<br /><br />The only problem I have with these treats is their overwhelming smell. It's not pleasant at all, almost like they're on the verge of spoiling. I've left the bag open accidentally and returned to the whole lower level of my house reeking. Even after putting them in a sandwich baggy for training during our walking session, the smell clung to my coat. Basically, anything these things touch, they'll share their smell with.<br /><br />Stench aside, these are fabulous treats. My dog responds more readily to them during our training sessions than any others I've tried so far (guess what disgusts me smells like heaven to him). They're also already the perfect size, which is very convenient.<br /><br />I'll definitely try out some different flavors next time. Chicken-Flavored Treats 4 1 
I was in Peru some years ago, and brought back 2 boxes of Coca tea.  It was packaged like 100 count boxes of Lipton, (as is the Windsor).  It was much stronger than the teas I have bought on Amazon, and I wonder if the Import Quality print on the box designates a weaker strength than what is available in country. Import Quality? 1 3 
We are glad we found this mix as we make pancakes without eggs for my son who has an allergy.<br />They taste fine for our family- we like them many ways! Good for Egg Allergy 4 5 
Recently bought a 24 pack of this new "improved"  stride sweet cinnamon gum.  It tastes more like the Dentyne Spicy Cinnamon gum and gets too soft and sticky in 5 to 10 minutes.  The original stride sweet cinnamon gum is much better and lasts longer. Not as good as regular stride cinnamon gum 3 2 
This might be ok for "taco night" for dinner but other than that this is nothing to write home about. I've tasted other chipotle sauces that are much better than this. This definitely needs some work if they want people to buy this on a regular basis. Why some reviewers are raving and giving this 5 star reviews I have no idea why they would praise something like this. Ok but nothing to write home about. 2 3 
I didn't know it will have such a fishy flavor, I think I've wasted my money on this one.<br /><br />I think I was looking for chile/curry paste, I guess I should have looked at the ingredients. Disgusting? 3 1 
Sometimes, I'd rather have cocoa instead of coffee at work. This meets my cocoa craving. I do not need to add sugar - just add water and brew! This hits the spot! 5 4 
While I find this dish to be quite tasty, those with Celiac disease should be aware that Tasty Bite dishes are not gluten free.  There is a warning on the label that the product is manufactured in a place where wheat is also manufactured, and there is no sign of an official GF label.  I personally tried the dish and had a reaction. WARNING--NOT GLUTEN FREE 4 3 
I've never bought flavored syrups before but wanted to try them. These six flavors are each 25.4 ounces, are sweetened with Splenda and come in plastic bottles.  There is no pump on the bottles, although you can buy one.<br /><br />I think it's generous to call these "syrup" as they are the consistency of water.  But the flavors are bold, and if you're careful pouring they will last a long time.  We've experimented with the vanilla, hazelnut classic, caramel, chocolate and raspberry flavors so far.<br /><br />I've used the vanilla, hazelnut, caramel and chocolate in my morning coffee, and they add a nice flavor without overpowering the coffee.  I'm guessing I added about a tablespoon per cup of coffee.<br /><br />My kids liked the chocolate flavor mixed into hot cocoa.  We mixed some of the raspberry flavor into homemade yogurt, and that was pretty tasty too.  We haven't tried the Irish cream flavor yet, but I've used it in coffee before and I'm sure it will be the same.<br /><br />Overall, this is an expensive indulgence (for me) but one I'm glad I tried. Kind of expensive, but good flavors and they last a long time 4 3 
My cat seems to really like these.  As one reviewer said, they will dry out if the bag isn't sealed.  I haven't had any problems with sealing the bag that I purchased. real jerky! 5 3 
I use treats for obedience and agility classes.  I need a treat that is not crunchy, but chewy and capable of breaking up into small bits.  This product is easily broken up...too easily.  It reminds me of a thin layer of chocolate but does not melt as such. The selling point is the natural dehydration, rather than freeze dried.  I did not find it useful for my purpose. Brittle thin treats 3 2 
After reading reviews on this product I was really excited to get it and start taking it, I imagined all the milk I would start producing and how my baby would be guzzling it for months to come.  Unfortunately for me, the only thing that came true from the reviews I read was that I started to smell like maple syrup almost instantly. But I stuck with it, started taking 8 pills a day as opposed to 6 and after 2 weeks still no increase in my milk production. While I'm sure it works for some, if you're just not makig a whole lot of milk to start with, I don't think taking this will increase your supply much if at all. But if you think you'd like to smell like maple syrup then this is the product for you! Smelled like syrup but no more milk 1 2 
I love the 34 degree cracked peppercorn, wheat, and other varieties so I thought I would try the caramel, cinnamon, and graham as an alternative to cookies or regular graham crackers. True - you can have a lot of these crackers for little calories/carbs, but the flavor is bland. In terms of satisfaction, they don't quite cut it for me as a snack unless I put peanut butter or something on them. They would probably be good as part of a fruit and cheese dessert platter, along with some peanut butter, fruit spread, honey, or cream cheese. Almost but not quite! 4 3 
We use many K cups.This fits in well with the different blends we buy.We ould recommend this K cup for people to try. Great K cup 4 5 
These coffee pods ae from Fair Trade farms that are committed to sustainability.  The box is attractive and each of the pods is sealed in its own little packet.  I used them in a Senseo pod coffee maker as well as in the generic Mr. Coffee.  The coffee brewed up nicely and was a pretty dark color.  Unfortunately, the coffee itself was insipid.  It had weak flavor for a medium roast despite the deceptive darkness.  It was not the worst coffe I've ever had kbut not the best.  In fact it was not memorable at all, on a par with the complimentary packets you get in hotel rooms.  There is alot to like about this company but this brew left me cold. Not Quite Feeling the Love 3 2 
I was surprised how many haters there are for the Lite version. Disclaimer: I've never tried the full fat version and I'm sure it's delicious, but if you're watching your fat intake, there has to be some compromise.  I saw this at the grocery store next to the regular Baconnaise.<br />Lite version: 2.5 grams fat per 2 Tbl.<br />Original version: 9 grams fat per 2 Tbl.<br /><br />I'm used to eating lite variations (though not fat free, yuck) of sour cream, mayo, salad dressing, etc.  So this wasn't a big leap for me. First sandwich, I was not impressed. Second sandwich, meh. By the third sandwich I was hooked. When by bottle ran out I had a hard time going back to plain mayo. I've been eating it so much that I don't even want to try the fattier version b/c then I'll be eating even more, yikes!<br /><br />It may not be a good taste for everyone, and I can understand that. But it's yummy to me :-) Good for being lite 4 3 
Hypoallergenic formula was necessary for our daughter's acid reflux.<br /><br />We found out from a friend that most insurance companies will completely cover the cost of hypoallergenic formula, either by reimbursing you what you've spent on it, or if you get it as a prescription through your pediatrician. Ours did!<br /><br />Many doctors don't know this, so they don't know to give a prescription for the formula. Call your insurance company today! INSURANCE WILL PAY for hypoallergenic formula!! 5 1 
As far as taste goes, this is the best coconut water I've tasted. I have not tried all the other brands, so I am only comparing this to coconut water ordered at restaurants (which I think is usually sweetened, so it really isn't a fair comparison), Vitacoco, and Amy and Brian's. Vitacoco uses Brazilian coconuts while Taste Nirvana and Amy and Brian's use Thai coconuts. It seems like Taste Nirvana and Amy and Brian's are naturally sweeter than Vitacoco, with Taste Nirvana being the sweetest. This is a good sweet though, since all of these three brands have no sugars added. While I've liked all the coconut water I've tasted, Vitacoco can have a slightly more salty and less sweet taste, while Taste Nirvana has an amazing taste with just the right amount of sweetness. I liked the pulp as well, although some of the pieces seem to be from more mature coconuts rather than the young almost gelatin pulps I'm used to at some restaurants.<br /><br />The only reason I took a star off is due to the price. These 9.5 oz bottles are not the most economical way to buy Taste Nirvana. In fact, at the current price this costs as much as I paid at the coffee shop for individual bottles. For the best bargain on this brand, buy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OW342G">Taste Nirvana Real Coconut Water With Pulp, 16.2-Ounce (Pack of 12)</a>.<br /><br />I wanted to try this brand because a lot of people say Taste Nirvana or Amy and Brian's taste the best, and I'd have to give my vote to Taste Nirvana. Hopefully some day I will taste a fresh coconut and maybe that will get my vote, but if you're like me and don't have any coconut trees nearby, try this out. Enjoy! Best tasting coconut water I've tasted, a little pricey in these bottles 4 5 
I ordered these, even though the price was high to see if Necco was still as good, and it's delicious. Beware, however, if you want nice whole wafers...about 1/2 the rolls in the bag contained all/part broken pieces. A bit pricey 4 3 
I'm a big fan of Jack Link's beef jerky, especially their flavored jerky's. I hadn't seen this one in the stores so when it went on sale on Amazon I scooped it up. Generally the beef nuggets and tendercuts style jerky's are not my favorite, for some reason the beef gets very rubbery compared to the regular style cuts, but I knew this diving into the bag of jerky.<br /><br />At first the taste was like the beef had been dropped in a pile of debris on a smokehouse floor, smokey, meaty and ashy tasting. I thought maybe it was just the initial taste  and continued to chew. It only worsened as I continued and eventually I swallowed and was met with a disgusting taste left in my mouth.<br /><br />Now that I have all four bags remaining I'm not sure what to do with them. I may give them away as a gag gift for the holidays and literally watch people gag as they try to eat this. Like Beef Dipped in an Ashtray 1 2 
I bought this from a brick and mortar baby supply chain, and I was so excited to use it! I peeled, I chopped, I steamed and pureed. I was so happy! Then I realized it took me all day to make one regular sized batch of baby food. Still, it was so easy to just throw it in and walk away, so I kept making my baby food, one tiny batch at a time. Then, the fourth time I tried to use it, it would not steam. The start, stop, and steam buttons do not work. I'd had the machine less than a month. Then I noticed (as I was dumping out my unused water) that there was a bunch of metallic looking crap floating around in the water chamber. Unfortunatly the box had been thrown away otherwise I would have just taken it back to the store. I emailed customer service and about a week later received an email that said "please provide us with a number to reach you". By looking at some more recent reviews I can see I'm not the only one having a problem with their customer service. The idea behind this product is amazing, the product itself is garbage. I don't understand for the life of me why they couldn't make the blender cup bigger than a coffee cup. Even if this product had worked beautifully I would have eventually gotten tired of making tiny batches. I've been using my food processor and steaming on the stove in a pot. It's more to clean up but I can make a large batch of baby food in much less time. I wanted to love this thing, I really did. It's just not worth the money. I Have Buyers Remorse! 2 1 
I am becoming one of Goya's biggest fans. I had seen these on the shelves,<br />and they were really inexpensive, but I opted for a test can of Vienna<br />sausages instead. They were so good I went back the next day to get this<br />tin of sardines.<br /><br />They have a great sardine flavor, not fishy or oily at all, and the tomato<br />sauce is thick and rich. I am of the opinion that sardines make everything<br />taste better, and these go great just on a regular saltine. Great for snacks<br />or a pack lunch or road trips. I'll probably edit this review sometime in<br />the next month to give this product 5 stars cause I see addiction ahead. LOL Very tasty! 4 5 
I purchsed this door about a year ago.  I dont know how I lived without it.<br />Since the purchase neither My 8yr old German Sheppard or 5 yr old Husky have<br />made one "mistake" inside. It took less than a minute to train them to use it . The<br />door is transparent yet is tinted to add privacy.<br /><br />I had this professionaly installed / hardwired so I didnt have to fuss with battery charging<br />every month, but do have the battery backup as well.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this 4 Stars , not five is because I have run into just one issue the transmitter<br />collar is prone to snap apart when the dog scratches neck area xtra hard and the foot hits the transmitter<br />cover causing both the cover & battery to fall off. Between the two dogs it has happened only 3x total / in the past year<br /><br />Other than that I have not had one problem.  It is about as attractive as it could be for a dog door.<br />It gives me the freedom as well not having to  rush home knowing my dogs are doing the potty dance.<br /><br />see my 3 customer pictures attatched to item. A MUST HAVE !! 4 3 
We fed Canidae to our two dogs for almost 5 years--they always ate it eagerly, never had stomach upset, and got raves from the vet for their muscle, weight, and coats.  It *was* a 5-star food.  But last summer we opened a fresh bag of kibble (same exact packaging bought from our usual store) and immediately noticed it was much lighter in color than previous bags, but we fed it anyway. Within a day our Aussie, who has a bulletproof stomach with absolutely no digestive issues, began to have horrible gas, softer stools, and really loud, liquidy gurgling noises in his abdomen.  We continued to feed the entire bag, thinking that he'd adjust to it eventually because our other dog was fine.  Well, our Aussie never did adjust to it; he spent a month having those symptoms, and we dreaded mealtimes because of the stench and sounds he'd create.<br /><br />The kibble in the next bag we bought was the old normal shade of brown, and our Aussie's stomach noises, soft stools, and awful gas went away practically overnight. But by then I was hearing and reading that Canidae had developed a new formula that was making dogs sick. The stories about people whose dogs got *far* sicker than ours, and the dodgy responses that those long-time customers got from Canidae when they called to complain about the unannounced change, made us decide it was time for a new dog food.  We went with Healthwise, a premium kibble made by the same company that makes Innova, California Natural, and Evo.  It's not worth it to continue to be loyal to Canidae and to risk our dogs perhaps getting as sick as many others have.  Read Canidae's new formula horror stories at consumeraffairs.com. After feeding for 5 years, we're done 2 1 
These anchovies are first rinsed, then filleted and then melted in olive oil in most cases and used for flavoring dishes such as Pasta Putanesca sauce. If your plan is to just rinse them and fillet them and then down them with a piece of pugliese bread dripping in extra virgin olive oil and a glass of chianti then these will work for you also. Putting them on pizza is not what they are intended for. The variety of their uses is vast if you have any knowledge of Meditteranean cuisine, if not get yourself a good cookbook and learn, the flavors they impart are without comparison, not to mention the aromas they send out floating around the neighborhood. Must use correctly. 5 3 
Just tried the Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers Chicken Teriyaki for lunch today. It's easy to prepare. The rice was fine. However, the "sauce", a brown mixture of mushy, small cubes of chicken, and small tidbits of pineapple, was bland, soft, unappealing and fairly flavorless. I wouldn't buy it again. It wasn't bad; it just wasn't tasty, either. At least it's only about 400 calories. I guess I'm not alone ... 2 3 
okay so this one I did not care for. I HATE packaged banana flavor so this is actually still sitting around with an experation date of Oct 29th.... seems like it can sit for a good while. Not sure how I like that but I'm just weird about food like that. dont like banana 3 2 
this little plant survived being put though the mail and it survived the trip it took a little work to get this one on its feet, but it made it and is growing I like it and will look forward to seeing it grow thanks Interesing little plant I named this one amazon plant mailed 2 4 
Anything applesauce-based you can usually get a great deal in the store and combine fruit flavors yourself.  But pears and mangos take just enough extra work that I appreciated the ease of getting this one through Amazon.<br /><br />My twin 10-month olds turned out to be quite cooperative when it came time to eat this flavor brand!  Now I get it by subscription and they'd eat it instead of vegetables if they had a choice.  It is a consistency similar to applesauce, so you have to serve it in a similar way (it's runny).  I have the subscription to the Earth's Best Rice Cereal, so I always have plenty of that to mix in with it if I want.<br /><br />Ingredients per the label: Organic pears, organic mangos, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), citric acid.<br /><br />This has 70 calories, 100% vitamin A, 45% vitamin C and 2% iron.  I've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult. Great!  This is the easiest way to combine pears and mangos for baby food 3 4 
I have to say the new offerings are great. the french roast and the Italian roast have a nice strong coffee flavor. I would say remember your first cup out of a keurig, the reason you bought a machine, these two flavors remind me of that.<br />Those first few lines are from my review for the Italian roast, they are both excellent. i really like it 5 4 
We use the K-caps so that we can re-use our K-cups by refilling them with the coffee we like.  We have lost or given away several of the caps over the 2 years that we've been using them; so I thought I would buy some more K-caps.  It turns out, the prices for them have increased substantially; so I went in search of another alternative that would be less expensive.  I found these and thought I had found the answer; but they don't quite work as well as the original K-cups.  They actually caused the Keurig to spew water in directions other than the intended direction and then allowed enough coffee grounds to escape that the holder for the cups became clogged and had to be disassembled and thoroughly cleaned before it could be used again.  Good idea - but not quite right. Almost; but not quite 3 2 
I really  like this dental treat and my dogs love them.  They are wheat free which is great for my German short=hair pointer who is wheat intolerant.  Only problem is it is hard to find this product in my local pet stores and on line.  I even contacted the manufacturer, who was not very helpful in locating it and just referred me back to my local pet store who hasn't had this in stock for EVER.  I have since given up on finding it.

We have a little Pekinese/Shitzu mix, mixed with something else too but we're not sure what. My dog is a bit of a finicky eater there are dog biscuits that's she's refused to eat and dog food that she's raised her nose at. But she really likes these treats, she had a couple then sat by her snack drawer until she got another one. Yes, we spoil her but good healthy treats like these are much better then most of those name products that you get in a grocery store.<br />Two woofs! woof..woof.. 4 5 
Good but not my favorite.........Newman's Own Organics Adult Dog Food Formula, 7-Pound Bag....I now buy my dogs Taste of the Wild Salmon just great stuff buy it on Amazon!~ The less fillers the better not meals for my doggies!~ Good but not my favorite......... 2 4 
I thought I was doing the right thing by buying organic and thought Similac was a brand I could trust to be good for baby. That is, until I came across this NY Times article about the sugar they use... [...] Needless to say I'm switching to another brand.<br /><br />From the article:<br /><br />Parents may be buying [Similac Organic] because they believe that organic is healthier, but babies may have a reason of their own for preferring Similac Organic: it is significantly sweeter than other formulas. It is the only major brand of organic formula that is sweetened with cane sugar, or sucrose, which is much sweeter than sugars used in other formulas.<br /><br />No health problems in babies have been associated with Similac Organic. But to pediatricians, there are risks in giving babies cane sugar: Sucrose can harm tooth enamel faster than other sugars; once babies get used to its sweeter taste, they might resist less sweet formulas or solid foods; and some studies suggest that they might overeat, leading to rapid weight gain in the first year, which is often a statistical predictor of childhood obesity. Read this article first 2 1 
only $13.29 a case on the petco site (Oct 20, 2011) - not worth the .70 cents a can they're charging here. Cheaper on petco's site 1 3 
When I ordered this product I was under the impression that there were 5 one gram boxes....In fact, it was stated as so in the first review.<br />When the product came, it was on big plastic clear box with all 5 grams.<br />Let's hope the saffron is good. saddened 3 1 
I did not like the flavor at all.  A bad aftertaste.  Love the other flavors but this is not a favorite apple orchard blend 2 1 
I'm a novice rice-roll maker, but I was completely unable to make this rice come out correctly.  I tried a rice maker, on the stove top, tried less water, tried more water, tried less heat, more heat, longer simmering--all a cup of rice at a time.  I'm almost done with the bag and won't buy it again.<br /><br />My rice doesn't soak up enough water.  It's hard in the middle and slimy on the outside.  I bought similar rice at the local grocery store and have had perfect results with it almost every time.<br /><br />Looking at the other reviews makes me think it's something I'm doing wrong, but I have tried every combo of preparing that I can think of. Unable to make work 1 2 
I purchased this hoping that it would taste like Seattle's Best Henry's Blend.  I was very disappointed.  At the time, it was not offered in whole bean form.  After looking all over for Henry's Blend, I finally settled on Ruta Maya -- which requires grinding but is so much better and less expensive than "Level 4." Poor substitute 1 2 
i'm giving this a solid 5, because my old but healthy cat loves this stuff and it's wicked good for him, but i'll tell you right now that this stuff looks and smells quite gross; as long as i don't have to eat it, it's all good. as long as he likes it... 5 4 
They're alright. But not what I expected. I was hoping it would be more like the other brands of dried apples - crispy, but then melt in your mouth. I bought these for my toddler, but the pieces are big, hard, and do not melt in your mouth. I'm afraid they present a bit of a choking hazard for a one year old.<br /><br />On the bright side - they are NOT made in China! I suppose if you're into dried apples for yourself, they should work. Not good for a toddler 4 2 
It was a hit/miss, and I think I missed on this one.  Tastes a bit different than I had hoped. Not that there's anything wrong with it, just doesn't taste good to me. :( Not as good flavor as I hoped for. 3 2 
NOTE: This review is for the Chili and Lime Flavor Popchip.  Amazon had a separate page for it but then merged the product and its reviews into one.<br /><br />It's hard to objectively review food since everyone's palate and tastes are different.  So what I can say about this particular Popchip flavor that should be useful for most folks out there is that it doesn't really taste like Chili and Lime you're "probably" expecting.  The Chili and Lime most folks probably are expecting if they grew up on Frito Lay products is very sharp and sweet (and of course artificial) - but it's what we liked if we ate more than a bag.<br /><br />The best way I can describe this flavor is that it has a "tomato" like taste to it with a somewhat tangy sour note that is suppose to be the lime component.  Together they turn into an odd combination that registers other flavors in your mind than Chili and Lime - at least it did to me and others who tasted it with me.  If you eat the skin of a green bell pepper, you can kind of get at what Popchips were trying to do with the Chili taste on this version, but I have no idea how some sour salt can be akin to lime.  For myself personally, I thought it tasted like "Tomato and Basil" you would find on Pita chip flavors and baked snacks.<br /><br />Whether or not you agree with my above description of the flavor, I would highly suggest you try to get this in a sample pack and try it out first.  BBQ + Salt & Vinegar Popchips are still my staples for now. Taste more like "Tomato and Basil" than "Chili and Lime" 3 4 
great coffees & I enjoyed the most when friends come over for coffee, it gives lot of fun to try out all the flovor 50 Nespresso Capsules Variety 4 5 
I've made butter chicken and keemah (lean grounded turkey) w/ peas and this paste is great. For the keemah dish, I use half packet just to give flavor. Aside adding a little chili and onions, you don't need anything else. Excellent curry paste for everything 4 5 
i like this soup, it is a little salty for me, but still makes a quick meal when i don't feel like cooking. Good soup 3 4 
I read a great review of the product in The Whole Dog Journal but when I received the product it didn't look anything like the quality one shown in the magazine.  What I received actually looked like the kind of rolls shown that you would not buy.(One that has a nice outer layer but is scrunchd in the center)  A good quality U.S. raised cattle roll is made from a single sheet of fresh, thick, natural rawhide which is what I thought I was getting.  I do commend the seller for the quick service! Wholesome Hide Retriever Roll 2 4 
Satin Ice is more plyable and better tasting (for fondant0 than the Wilton boxed fondant at Michael's and WalMart. If you need colors, they are vibrant and strong--their blank and read are the best.<br />While I have used Satin Ice many times, I will say that whatever fondant is used and marketed as the "Duff" brand (from Ace of Cakes) is a MUCH better product than even Satin Ice. You can re-rool and stretch it to fit like nothing I have ever seen. It really is the easiest fondant I have ever worked with--worth waiting for the 40% off coupons from the large chain craft store and buying the Duff brand.<br />You can find Satin Ice elsewhere on the Internet cheaper than here, but at least you know Amazon is pretty dependable. Better than WIlton fondant, but not the best. 3 4 
These were tasty noodles, but easy to overcook. Followed package directions exactly, but ended up with a mass of overly soft rice noodles. Managed to make them work when I mixed them into the sauce, but would recommend undercooking them prior to use to maintain the integrity of the noodle.<br /><br />Also, they were a thinner cut than I was expecting - I was hoping to get a wider noodle.<br /><br />Was able to make a delicious dinner with a mix of asian sauce ingredients, so this was a winner in my book. Family was happy - so all is good! Enjoyed These! 4 3 
There are many reasons to reconsider the first foods we give to babies.  The jars and the plastic containers for processed baby food are often difficult to recycle.  The processed food and the dried cereals (wheat, rice, etc.) are nothing more than empty carbs for a society facing a massive problem with the rise of type II diabetes.  Is this anything to give to a 4 month old baby?<br />To complicate matters, the World Health Organization is now recommending that babies feed on only breastmilk or formula until baby is 6 months.  The reason is that baby's small intestines cannot process the iron out of other foods until baby is six months.  As any parent can tell you, by four months of age, most babies are wanting to try other foods.<br />Nurturme baby food can help with all of this.  Each packet makes up about 2.75 oz of baby food, the same amount in a standard baby food container.  The freeze dried food is combined with breastmilk or formula, so baby can try new foods like peas, apples, squash or sweet potatoes and still get iron a form they can use, while eating a nutritious veggie instead of a starchy carb.  I know carbs are important, but they hardly seem like the best foods to introduce when energy can be supplied from formula or breastmilk.<br />The different foods can be combined to make up baby food, for example apples and sweet potatoes together.  Another versatility option is to add a little bit of nurturme to babies bottle, sort of like a baby food smoothy.<br />The freeze dried packets are super convenient.  They are easier to carry around and store than regular baby food.  After baby is six months, if a parent wanted to add water rather than milk or formula, they can.<br />The baby food tastes good, too.  Normal baby food peas tastes like horrible canned peas.  If you ever wondered why baby wouldn't eat peas, try tasting that nasty food.  The nurturme peas actually taste like fresh peas (yes, i tried them for myself). I tried all four foods in this pack, and they all tasted like fresh food.  I think that having good tasting, healthy food would be much better to introduce than nasty tasting food.  I am trying to develop good eating habits in my child, after all. Sensible product, portable and versatile 5 2 
I have long, fine hair, shoulder-length+.<br />If dry it can break when combed/brushed.<br /><br />Before CLEAR, I used shampoos/conditioners by Paul Mitchell [[ASIN:B002N5MI8C Paul Mitchell Extra Body Daily Shampoo, 33.8-Ounce Bottle] and Pantene [[ASIN:B001F51V3E Pantene Pro-V 2-in-1 Shampoo and Conditioner, Classic Care, Packaging May Vary, 25.4 -Ounce (Pack of 2)]. They give my hair shine and satisfactory body. And less breaking. I'd hoped to have it look even better, be tougher with CLEAR. So I took a shot.<br /><br />CLEAR Scalp and Hair Therapy/Nourishing Shampoo with its sales pitch of 'nourishing<br />the scalp' seemed believable, like stimulating/nourishing the scalp. Oops; not-so.<br /><br />Terse instructions say "when using shampoo and conditioner" "apply to wet hair, gently massage into scalp, lather and rinse." (Two statements, connected by an asterisk) Seemed<br />unclear.<br /><br />Before rinsing, CLEAR's goopy consistency made me doubt its sticky white lather could get past the hair (not really a lather; no frothy bubbles). The consistency is like a women's facial creme. I took pictures of my frothy Gorgon-Head scary-odd hair. Pretty funny, kinda scary.<br /><br />I tried finger tips to rub the glop into my scalp. Maybe some got through my hair, but its heavy-consistency turned hair follicles into slimy protrusions like bright white heavy meringue; sticky and thick like tooth paste; both funny and weird. I tried rubbing it into my scalp; it just glopped together in my hair. Afterwards I had to wash my hands twice. The white stuff that couldn't get past hair covered my fingers, palms.<br /><br />My hair doesn't have observably more volume; after drying, the hair seemed sort of frizzed; literally less shiny, healthy. I repeated the treatment a week later, just<br />to be sure. Same effects, problems. And there's more:<br /><br />The label said an ingredients list was on the label's back.'Just peel it<br />off'. And it was, evidently rushed to market, upside down and backwards.<br /><br />Last shot at CLEAR: The plastic bottle has an flat oval top. The container came in a fitted, sealed plastic sleeve inside a padded Amazon mailer. Shipping shakes evidently poked the flat top and inside the sleeve was slopped with the gooey white glop.<br /><br />Back to the lab, CLEAR Marketeers. I'll stick with Paul Mitchell and Pantene. THE WINNER FOR THE NOT YET READY FOR MARKETING IS . . . 1 3 
Perfect for those lazy nights.  My boyfriend, who is Italian and likes authentic Italian food (the food snob), really loves this.  And honestly, it's so hard to mess the dish up.  I've put more water than necessary, left it on for longer than necessary, and both times it was absolutely perfect. Perfect for those nights when you want to be lazy 4 5 
This is a great on the go breakfast or snack. It tastes so good and easy to carry around. I would recommend this to anyone! Yummy snack! 4 5 
This is not true balsamic, it contains caramel, wine vinegar (not just must) and antioxidants. I don't know how I'll use this all up, maybe reduce it for marinade or something. Doesn't taste good. should've known better 1 2 
We've tried many different thinkThin bars and the white chocolate chip bars are the best!  They can be a bit rich, but I really like the taste and texture.  The best part is that they don't make my blood sugar spike and then drop, so these make a great snack and excellent lunch on days that I don't have time to stop and eat. yummy! 4 5

I really was waiting to capture a number of gophers before rating this product.  However, after about 20 settings I have caught 1 mole.  Most the time, no matter what technique I try to use, I come up with a hole full of dirt... 50% of the time the trap is snapped, 50% not.  I am going to try the more substantial cinch traps next, as I don't want to miss the 50% of critters that do snap the trap and still get away. gopher lite 3 2 
I don't think I've ever eaten anything drier than these cookie bars, ever in my life. They taste okay, but I just can't choke them down, even with coffee. Dry as a Bone 1 3 
I used to buy this from the store when it was still called 'Damn good chili'. Someone must have complained about the name, but its one of the best.<br />Just to make it last longer, I add ground beef, onion, tomatoes, beans, cheese and some extra seasoning (chili powder, cumin) and its amazing.<br />Although by itself its still pretty 'darn good' Amazing! 4 5 
This is a product I know I want for my dog ; and not all pet stores carry it. I also like to buy large quantities that are difficult to carry.<br />This vendor sent exactly what I wanted, in the quantity I wanted, and delivered it to the door limiting my need to carry the large bags.<br />The cost of shipping was a price I was willing to pay; particularly because I was able to shop on the net for the best price.zx it comes to you 4 5 
I love calypso lemonades, especially the strawberry and ocean blue but I would have to be a fool to order them for 60+ dollars when I can buy the same 12 pack at the corner gas station for $20.  I went on line hoping to find a better price than the $1.69 I was paying.  This is not a good deal unless you are paying $5.12 a bottle don't be a fool 5 1 
This cereal was just okay. It tasted a little like plastic. I liked Kellogg's other new cereal in this same genre, but this one just didn't quite cut it for me. It was boring and waxy. I wasn't impressed. So-so 3 2 
First of all, this product claims to be "Black Cherry" flavor.  Yes, it is made from 100% juice, but cherry juice is well down the list of ingredients.  The drink has mostly apple and grape juice, and that is what I tasted more than anything else.  There is just enough cherry juice in there to give it a hint of cherry behind the apple and grape flavors.  For a cherry lover like myself, this drink was a disappointment.  Further, I think this drink is tremendously overpriced, considering it is just a little over 8 ounces of mostly apple and grape juice with some carbonation added.  If you can do without the carbonation, buy yourself some apple juice or grape juice.  It is much cheaper ounce per ounce.  You may not look as hip as you will look with this fancy can, but it is no longer fashionable to waste money anyway. Well Whoopty Do!  Not a Good Value.  Pure Marketing Gimmick. 1 2 
I was really looking forward to trying this espresso blend and was very disappointed, the beans were very dry, unlike most espresso lenses we h ave purchased before. Usually the beans look oily or wet and have a nice crema on top where this blend did not. We won't purchase this brand again. not so good 1 2 
I tested this product out on two dogs and a cat. Daisy, my neighbor's border collie, went "absolutely ape" for it, in the words of her owner. I saw this myself; the dog would "walk" for twenty feet if you held the treat up just out of her reach and started walking away. My girlfriend's dachshund Monkey had a similar reaction. Monkey would snatch up the treat and run into the next room away from everyone else, and scarf it down in the corner. The treats were a bit large for her to swallow whole (about the size of Kennedy half-dollars and about half an inch thick), so I started breaking them up for her so she wouldn't choke in her enthusiasm.<br /><br />Speaking of breaking them up, they become very crumbly, so make sure you either break them over the counter or be prepared to sweep.<br /><br />The crumbs actually worked to my advantage with my girlfriend's cat Cleo. She would not eat the treat by itself, even when broken up. However, when I broke it up in her food, she ate it, though she gave no indication that it was any different from her normal food.<br /><br />The Raw Boost Bites package get bonus points for being irresistible to canines and having healthy ingredients. Since it's advertised as a cat treat as well, I can't give it five stars since Cleo was apathetic toward it, but I know what I'm buying the dogs from now on. Dogs went wild for it, cat not so much 4 1 
I did not realize when I had these sent to me that they were for a pod brewer.  I am glad that is that case, however.  It gave me a chance to test these out in several ways.<br /><br />1. Single Cup Pod Brewer- made weak coffee and it just didn't taste very good,  Tasted burned, weak and unimpressive - the price is outrageous for this quality of coffee.<br /><br />2.  Opened bags and used four of them to brew an 8 cup load in the Bunn Phase Brew 8 Cup coffee maker with the Bunn filter.  The result?  A FANTASTIC cup of coffee.  A medium roast coffee, there is a smoothness with a slightly grassy flavor and almost touch of flowery finish.  This is clearly a low-acid coffee which again was very enjoyable.  This made the perfect strength coffee and we all enjoyed it very much.<br /><br />3.  Aerobie Coffee Press- again made excellent smooth coffee very similar to the flavor of the Bunn brewed cup - with even more silky smooth texture.  I used one pod for one cup of coffee, but I opened it first and used it with the Aerobie Espresso Coffee Press.  Using one pod (opened up and used loose) makes a good small cup of coffee, but to make it stronger, two pods were necessary.<br /><br />There are about 3 Tablespoons of ground coffee per bag.<br /><br />All in all, when used loose, this is a really wonderful cup of coffee.  At the price that it is, however, it is ridiculously expensive.  If they took the Marley name off of it, perhaps they could lower the price down and sell it in loose foil bags, better pods of coffee, or un-ground beans foil packed.<br /><br />As dumb as this may sound, there is not one bit of information about this coffee on the box or the foil envelopes.  There are no instructions whatsoever. If someone had never used a pod coffee maker or heard of one, they might not understand this process at all.  Surely they should have SOMETHING on the box and packets saying that these are only to be used with pod coffee makers.<br /><br />Again, it might sound fussy, but not everyone knows everything, and it would help to avoid mistaken purchases for someone who has no idea what a pod is for coffee.  As you can see from some reviews, the tea style bag is easily misunderstood and used in a fashion like making tea. Pod Brewing - Bleh;  LOOSE Brewing FANTASTIC 3 2 
We purchased a Keurig last Christmas holiday, and have been very pleased with the purchase.  It came with a sampler of different coffees, teas, and chocolate milk.  And for the most part, I enjoyed most of the sample options.  The chocolate milk in the sampler (which was not Cafe Escapes) left me disappointed.  It was a rather water-down version of chocolate milk, with very little flavor.  Unfortunatley, I had bought a whole box of that same chocolate milk in the store before I had a chance to try it.  After some research, I came across the Cafe Escapes brand, which makes a chocolate milk for the Keurig, and in my opinion, is the best of the chocolate milks available for the Keurig.  It has a creamy taste, like chocolate milk made with milk, even though you're using water to create it.  It's full of flavor and in my opinion, what a good chocolate milk should taste like.  Now I've read opinions where people think it has an after taste, which I didn't perceive, but to each their own.  I thought the flavor was amazing.  My only regret about Cafe Escapes is that it's seems to be harder to find and is sold out a lot, although I've consistently been able to get it through Amazon.

The ingredients are great but my cat's litter box smelled HORRENDOUS all the time that she was on this food.  I know diet changes sometimes cause a temporary issue, so I kept on giving it to her hoping it would resolve itself after her digestive system had time to get used to the new food, but it was equally stinky all the way to the end of the bag.<br /><br />She was on another high quality grain free food (Wellness Core) before this, I just wanted to try something different so she'd have some variety, but unfortunately this won't work.  Maybe it's just my kitty and maybe it'll work for some other cat.  The ingredients seem really good.  Good luck! Stinky poo 2 3 
A nice case of chips that are quite tasty. I definitely enjoy the Kettle Sea Salt and Black Pepper. I just wish they were bigger bags :) Tasty! 5 4 
I received the two "Mission Pack Space Food Sampler with Astronaut Ice Cream and Space Food Sticks" packs I purchased in the mail today. I initially panicked when I saw them - both were packaged in "Astronaut Mission Pack" boxes that said they contained "3 Assorted Freeze-Dried Space Foods." This is not the packaging shown in the picture, and there is nothing on the box about Space Food Sticks (I wasn't too concerned about the magnet). The Space Food Sticks were the whole reason I ordered these samplers, as a surprise gift of nostalgia for a friend. When I finally opened the boxes, I saw that 2 Space Food Sticks and a magnet had been added each, so I DID receive the product that was promised. However, I still feel a bit cheated and deceived - I was expecting a fun gift box to present to my friend, as shown in the picture, and the boxes had some tears on them, perhaps from being opened to add the additional Space Food Sticks and magnet.<br /><br />In terms of the food items themselves - pretty much what I expected and I'm happy with them(and definitely what I was prepared for based on what other reviewers said).<br /><br />On a side note - because many of the older reviews for this product refer to additional items that are no longer included, it would be nice if they were updated or removed. I was sort of bummed to learn that this product used to come with freeze-dried food (that many reviewers seemed to love!) that are no longer included.<br /><br />Overall, I'm OK with the product - I got the food items I was expecting and most wanted - but the product picture needs to be updated, and the reviews should match the product currently available. Not quite what is promised... 3 2 
I got this to hold us over because our usual supplier was sold out right when we needed more Himalayan salt. The quality is good, but the salt is most certainly NOT finely ground. The crystals are the same size as previous Himalayan salt that we purchased in the past, which is coarser than regular table salt. When described as finely ground, I was expecting smaller sized crystals. Our usual supplier is in stock again, so I probably won't be purchasing this brand again if not necessary. But the price is pretty good and the quality seems fine, so I would recommend this to people who are looking to try Himalayan salt. good salt, good price, but not fine! 4 3 
I'm a crunchaholic! I have to have something during the day to crunch! All other chips are so high in fat or sodium that it makes it very difficult to be eating healthy and still get my crunch on. PopChips is the answer and the individual bags are a great way to control your calories too! I highly recommend them all, but the salt and pepper are my least favorite! A yummy alternative to high-fat chips! 4 3 
If one reads this products ingredients they will find that the first ingredient is cows milk, then SUGAR (diabetic maker), then milk, again. The fourth ingredient is sunflower oil, fifth ingredient is maltodextrin which is starch produced from grain containing the sugars maltose and dextrin, with the seventh ingredient being, get this, tuna fish oil. They even feature vitamin D3, which is animal derived. There are four different sugar sources in it and some artificial flavor for good measure. If we really think about what we are feeding our babies, would we use this product? I know I wouldn't. Know your food sources. Read and read well. 1 2 
The makers of Taco Bell Home Originals Bold and Creamy Chiptole Sauce did get the "creamy" part right - though there is no cream anywhere to be found in this bottle, just copious amounts of soybean oil.  This is why this sauce has a whopping 110 calories per 2 tablespoon serving, on par with most regular salad dressings.<br /><br />Unfortunately (or more unfortunately) the "bold" part of the name is an extreme misrepresentation.  Oh, there is some chipotle puree way down on the ingredient list (listed under the label "contains less than 2% of"), but it only lends a hint of chipotle flavor to the sauce.  It's more akin to mayonnaise with a few dashes of pepper added than to a real chipotle sauce - nothing "bold" here at all.<br /><br />As it does have a somewhat pleasant (though overwhelmingly bland) taste, I'll give this Taco Bell sauce a bit of credit.  But I suspect that it would be much better and healthier with a bit less oil and a lot more kick.<br /><br />Note - since people have varying responses to spicy foods, I'll let you know that when I'm at a Taco Bell the "Fire" sauce is my usual choice, and I consider "Medium" and "Mild" to be about as spicy as ketchup.  Perhaps those more sensitive than I to spicy heat will have a better opinion of this sauce than I do. Well, they got half of it right ... 3 2 
These were inexpensive and delivered promptly. Don't buy 'em, though, unless you know for a fact you already like this brand/flavor. No amount of seasoning, butter, or even intoxicants are likely to make these edible. Meh 2 3 
I just cancelled my subscription after learning that 1 pack (5.5oz) contain 135mg of sodium. Way too high for 13 months old child! Its like feeding her cheetos for dinner Sodium is Way TOO HIGH - 135mg 2 1 
I had never tried this type of product before and got it because I was curious after reading the reviews.  I am not an Expresso drinker and I think I was in for a bit of a shock with the taste.  It had a 'pop' to it, but I found it to be bitter for my tastebuds.  I tried it room temperature and chilled, but neither one really appealed to me.  I would not say it was distasteful by any means, and for the person who enjoys this type of drink, it most probably would be quite good.  I did not experience an unpleasant aftertaste, but I did experience a lingering one.  For me, a person who enjoys a mild cup of coffee with raw brown sugar and cream, no :) Good, but a bit strong for me! 4 3 
Nifty hot chocolate discs added to your warm milk or milk alternative is simply yum! Made in Ireland so you know the chocolate is high quality.<br /><br />Ingredients for those that desire it (I think it should be a requirement on any listing):<br />Milk chocolate 29% (sugar, whole milk powder, cocoa butter, cocoa mass, emulsifier:soya lecithin, flavouring: natural<br />vanilla), Cocoa mass 25%, Invert sugar syrup, Sugar syrup, sugar, water, preservtive:sorbic acid), Sweetened condensed<br />milk (milk, sugar). Milk chocolate contains 32% cocoa, solids minimum, 20% milk solids minimum.<br /><br />Shelf life is about 18 months. Butler's chocolate is the real deal direct from Ireland 4 5 
I love Hunt's sugar free vanilla snack packs.  I frequently take a cup of raspberries or sliced strawberries and mix them with a pudding cup for a tasty, low calorie snack that keeps me satisfied between meals.  The cup itself is 60 calories and when paired with a cup of fruit you are looking at a 100-120 calorie snack. Each cup also has the equivalent of 10% of your daily calcium. It doesn't get much better than that.<br /><br />Eaten alone, the flavor of the no-sugar added cups is not as intense as the regular Hunt's pudding cups.  With my preferred way of eating the no sugar added cups, I don't even notice.<br /><br />I like that these are shelf stable and can be left in an office drawer when the need for a snack hits.  They are a good treat for those who enjoy pudding and don't mind a flavor that is a little less intense than the regular Hunt's pudding cups.<br /><br />It should be noted that most grocery stores carry the Hunt's snack packs for the equivalent of .25 a cup. a nice treat, especially with berries 4 3 
It has been no problem to use it but there are not any date of production or expire.<br />Amazon sent me them again but still no date.<br />I can not understand. I just gave up... Good but... 2 3 
This is good as it doesnt have any sugars added. However i found young brand coconut juice better, it does have sugars added though. good but not the very tasty 3 4 
This tea is strong and has a smoky flavor - you can feel the leafy greenness though. It's not very bitter. I think it's a bit expensive for it is - but I haven't found a replacement. I guess we're paying for the fancy packaging, which in my opinion is a real waste, especially when you go through 3-4 cups a day like I do. Ahmed's Gunpowder green tea is stronger and is pretty good, but is available for cheaper than Dilmah's in the local Indian stores. Strong Green Tea 4 3 
These sugar pearls are used for makign Belgian "steet waffles" common in the 18th century, (and now resurrected by foodies).  The waffles are properly called "Gaufre Liege" and are made using this type of beet-based sugar pearls which melt and carmelize using a dough recipe.<br /><br />The more common gooey batter Belgian Waffle recipe is called the "Bruxelles" type, and it would be very odd to use these sugar pearls when preparing them.  Ordinary Belgian "Bruxelles" waffle batter can be made perfectly using common cane sugar. NOT for making ordinary Belgian Waffles! 2 5 
These haven't been available at the stores near here, so I took a chance ordering them. I'm glad I did. When I just want a little chocolate flavor, this is a crunchy and tasty alternative. And they're really good with peanut butter sandwiches--just sweet enough but not overpowering. chocolatey goodness 3 4 
I bought this thinking some of the reviews were old and must have changed the formula by now.  Wrong!!  I don't like the taste and probably will throw two full bottles away - I was using the DaVinci Original sugar free and that was very good, will go back to that brand and buy it at Sam's Club. Bad taste - 2 1 
After finishing off a box of these over Labor Day weekend on the road, my husband and I agree that these are tasty snacks.  I will buy these again.<br /><br />I'd categorize these as soft and crumbly after the first bite.  It's predominantly an oatmeal-chocolate-coconut taste although I will admit I thought the chocolate felt more like raisins the first time.  These are not so heavily sweet, either as many standard granola bars are. Best of all, there's no chalky aftertaste.<br /><br />Each bar has 180 calories, a nice pick-me-up after my morning cappuccino. Yum! 5 4 
This is one of those matcha that you will want to have around for the kids, their friends, and when you want to make smoothies, or have a sweet treat. Its not my favorite from Red Leaf but its not bad at all it just reminds me of circus peanuts. Do you remember those things? Sort of like slightly hardened dried out marshmallow like candies. We used to get them at the dime store. Remember when we had "dime stores" ... haha anyway I do enjoy this tea - takes me back to the good ol days, and really where they all THAT good? Oh well the point is - this is some good stuff and I do like it but its more of a banana candy like flavor rather than fresh ripe banana but at the same time I just don't know how natural of a banana flavor one could possibly get - I don't know if I have ever had a better banana flavor in a tea or anything else for that matter that was not a banana itself. I think that banana flavored things always tend to have that slightly strange flavor to it.<br />Now, this is where things get really good ... I mixed my banana matcha with macadamia nut matcha to make a banana nut like matcha and it was excellent! Made a smoothie out of it that way too! It was QUITE yummy! Do you Remember Circus Peanuts?? 5 4 
It's really, really sweet, as are most Stevia-based sodas.  I'm not a fan of sugary stuff in the first place, and this just ruins it.  It does taste like root beer, but like I said, way too sweet.  Diet A&W is much better. Weird 3 2 
First, I love Spry gum...high % of xylitol per serving, no gross/weird ingredients, great flavor. The flavor may fade a little faster than some conventional chewing gums, but it's better than consuming the carcinogenic, disgusting artificial ingredients they use. Also, this is an amazing value for Spry gum...previously I was ordering the 100 pc. tubs from a popular online herb store; that worked out to about $1.10 more per 100 pieces. At local health food stores, a 100 piece tub is even more expensive at about $7-7.5 each before tax! This is a good value anyway, as I have seen tubs of conventional chewing gum cost more than this per 100 pcs. The only thing is, I can not tolerate the cinnamon flavor for some reason! I can eat cinnamon no problem in other foods, but this gum triggers canker sores for me. I keep forgetting that and order it now and then because I like cinnamon gum, but it's really a bad idea for me :( Love Spry, love cinnamon, can't tolerate this gum 3 5 
I really love these.  They are fruity and tasty.  I received them fresh.  The only problem with buying such a big bag, is that you must put them in something to keep them fresh if you are not going to eat them right away.  These are also nice to fill canning jars and put a bow on them to give as inexpensive gifts. Fresh and gummy! 4 5 
I always stock a variety of items on my kitchen shelves that might be used as an instant lunch in times when I'm in a hurry and don't have any time to prepare things. One of my long-time favorites is the Maruchan Instant Lunch cups and I presently have the beef flavor. They also come in several other flavors. The cost is minimal. They're real easy to prepare real. Just peel back the top, add hot water and let it set for about three minutes. Have a few things like cheese, fruits, meat along with your noodle soup and, viola, an instant lunch. Works real well and is tasty. My only reservation is the very high salt (sodium) content. It's listed at 1,200mg, which is about 50% of the daily recommendation. In one serving! Wow! It's an easy and quick lunch, but you'd better watch your other salt intake.<br /><br />Gary Peterson Watch Your Salt Intake. 3 4 
I have tried Herrs, UTZ, wise, pringles, lays etc....but Kettle tasted the best. The quantity of salt used is the optimum which is required.<br /><br />Although they say serving size 1 ounce, you will finish the whole packet in no time. Total calories is 300 for 2 ounce bag. This is slightly on the higher side. But still it is ok, as they have not compromised on the taste.<br /><br />Only issue was that all packets have some burnt chips, which taste bad. Kettle should take care when packing to ensure no burnt chips are there.<br /><br />Thanks to Amazon to get 24 bags for just 12 bucks with free shipping using their coupon. Best Chips out there!!! 5 4 
These are not awful if eaten with a cup of tea, coffee or milk -- but they are very dry if eaten plain.  I do like how they have less sugar than most granola bars and are not a choking hazard for toddlers like hard snacks can sometimes be.  I am a fan of the oatmeal raisin mini cookies, and of the regular size EB cookies, but this flavor tastes very fruity to me and not very chocolaty.  I think the double choc cherry tastes better than these.  Happy to have them for last resort snack-on-the-go needs, but not my favorite. Dry and too fruity 3 4 
To be honest, although I've always enjoyed anything with Paul Newman's name on it and have always reordered things, this time I would not. I really like coffee. This reminded me of instant. Green Moutain Coffee Newman's special blend 1 2 
A very interesting and fun way to spend an evening. The tablet itself has a somewhat tart flavor, we sampled everything from cottage cheese to beers to fruits to salt and vinegar chips to warheads. Some differences were astounding, some not so much, great little adventure for your mouth. Fun little experiment 5 4 
I have to completely disagree with a previous poster who said that Earth's Best has an unappealing smell and taste compared to Similac Organic. Similac Organic tastes terrible, and smells like spoiled milk when mixed. If you're wanting a quality organic formula, go with Earth's Best. My baby has terrible gas on Similac Organic, and the only reason we buy this, is when we've run out of Earth's Best and have to order more and are in a pinch. Furthermore, Similac Organic doesn't dissolve and leaves a very nasty residue on the inside of the bottle and nipple. It's gross if you ask me. I gave it more than two stars only because it's tolerable. Garbage 2 1 
Let me preface this review by saying that in the gluten-free world, baked goods tend to be a bit on the crumbly side because they are missing the "glue" (gluten) that holds them together.  Taking this into consideration, Nana's gluten free cookie bars are one of the tastiest gluten-free treats and one of the only brands sweetened with fruit juice instead of sugar.<br /><br />At only 130 calories, 4.5 grams of fat, and 7 grams of sugar (natural fruit sugar), the Nana Banana flavor of cookie bars makes a great treat for kids and adults.  The amount of banana is just right, and you even get a few tiny bits of crunchy banana inside.<br /><br />Each cookie measures approximately 3.5 inches long by 1.5 inches wide...perfect for a light snack or dessert, especially for kids.  Amazon has the best price around on Nana's Cookie Bars, so rest assured that you are getting a good deal, even though they are pricier than "regular" cookies made with corn syrup and sugar.<br /><br />Good cookies aren't cheap, and cheap cookies aren't good!  Give Nana's banana cookies a try.  (No, I don't work for Nana's but am a happy, loyal customer!) Nana Banana - a delicious gluten-free treat for kids or adults! 5 4 
I was drawn in by the Spartan graphics, but,I<br />like this product much better than the more well known competitors.<br />No overpowering "sweettart" smell or taste.<br />Good balance of sweet and sour.

Being new to the K-cup world, this variety was a good introduction to the flavors out there.  However, my husband uses it mostly, gravitating to the strong flavors and there are no decaf drinkers in the house - so we are waiting for guests to comment on those. Good for a variety 3 4 
As advertised, Crunchy Nut smells and tastes like peanuts -- something I don't find very appetizing when mixed with milk and ingested in the morning. I eat peanuts with beer at bars, not at breakfast. I'm guessing that the honey is supposed to cut the flavor of the peanuts, but it is hardly detectable.<br /><br />People will of course disagree with my thoughts on peanuts in the morning, but let's take a look at the side of the box.<br /><br />To keep the calories per serving at 100 (without milk), Kellogg's has shrunk the serving size to 3/4 of a cup. That means with milk, a bowl of Crunchy Nut is going to be 300 calories or slightly more. So if you go back for a second bowl, that's a pretty high caloric breakfast. Further, the base ingredient is yellow corn meal, which doesn't have much nutritional value.<br /><br />While there are certainly much more unhealthy cereals out there, in this day and age I'd like to see a more healthy, lower caloric cereal. Why would I want to eat peanuts with milk? 1 3

I really am grateful Kashi makes this bar.  It has 19 g of carb, 7g pro, 4 g fiber, 5 g fat (mostly from nuts and seeds).  It's fairly balanced, has no artificial ingredients or sugar alcohols, and really hits the spot.  I've tried all the Kashi varieties, and this remains my favorite.  My mother agrees.  If you're looking for a sweeter treat, this is not the Kashi for you, however. My brother thinks they taste like cardboard.  In any rate, the Amazon price is still higher than the grocery store price.  I'm hoping it will drop soon. medium carb alternative 5 4 
This is not real beef broth, It is vegan. (the label says so)<br />I TBS (table spoon) contains 250 mg Sodium ! although beef bouillon is probably the same.<br />Maltodextrin is listed twice, as the first ingredient and as the fourth. maybe a typo?<br />It doesn't say what TYPE of maltodextrin (wheat,rye,oat,rice) so it probably contains GLUTEN.<br />Also contains SOY. Soy is a poor substitute for beef.<br />Contains Hydrolyzed Plant Protein! which contains MSG! even tho the label says no MSG!<br />Not a bad price for cheep soy broth tho, If you don't mind MSG.<br />If they would label the type of maltodextrin and drop the Hydrolyzed Plant Protein then it would be a good (but cheep)product. As it is I cant tell if I'm allergic to the malto or not, and I don't like MSG. I wont be buying this again.<br /><br />To be perfectly honest I can get MSG laden Mexican bouillon at Walmart for 65 cents!<br />In four different flavors! Beef,Chicken,Ham,Chicken and Tomato!<br /><br />Updated 03/29/11 You get what you pay for ! 3 2 
I was trying to increase my consumption of coconut products without increasing my intake of sugar.<br />Unfortunately this pina colada mixer has ~ 22 grams of sugar (sorry I don't have it<br />in front of me, but it was way over what I allow in a day), so I won't be buying it<br />again! Tasty but too much sugar 2 3 
Very good waffle mix.  Simple and turns out the same every time.  Healthy and comparable to any more expensive mixes.  Just follow the easy instructions and enjoy the results. hdbiker 4 5 
I'm recently widowed so have to learn to fix for a single person. I hoped this microwaveable bowl of "Beefaroni" would provide a tasty lunch. To my surprise, I found that it was nearly all macaroni, with some tomato sauce and a very small amount of beef. The taste was OK if you like macaroni and a rather strong tomato sauce, but I expected more beef. Also, as with so many canned food these days, be prepared for a high dose of sodium -- salt, that is -- 31% of average daily requirement in one small serving. Overall, no so good. Beefaroni mostly macaroni 2 3 
I'm a fan of Larabars and the peanut ones are my second favorite.  All of them have only a few ingredients (less is better) and no preservatives or additives. Although I was quite surprised by the price of a box of 16, which pretty much equals over two bucks a bar.  My local grocery store sells them for one dollar, thirty-nine cents.  The health food store sells them for a dollar fifty-nine. That can mean a lot of savings. Good taste, all natural, very few ingredients 4 3 
I'm a noodle lover. Can't live without noodles at least once a day. I have more than a dozen different types of noodles stocked in my pantry & I love trying new ones too. I've a subscription to 30 packets of Nong Shim's Gourmet Spicy noodles & was expecting this to be much better. Really, the taste is great. Same type of noodles, texture, etc..same spicy flavor packet but there is another packet of soup seasoning included. There's no dried vegetables packet like the Gourmet Spicy flavor has. No dried vegetables flakes & no beef chunks like the description stated, thus false marketing. The price is too much for this. If this is the new & improved Gourmet Spicy noodles, I'd give it 4 stars. I took off 2 stars because of the unworthy price tag & another star because of the false marketing. I read a comment reply in another review here - A Korean reviewer... I agree entirely. Big hype & price tag but disappoints. I'll stick to the Gourmet Spicy if I were you. Worth the try but not 24 packets!<br /><br />Edit: Not false marketing since it seems like only the very first packet had no dried beef & vegetable so I changed the rating to a 3 star. However, the beef "chunks" are just flakes. Not enough flakes to notice. There are also dried mushrooms. Now, the mushroom pieces are bigger than the ones in the Spicy Gourmet vegetable sachet. Still, not impressed. 1/29/2012 Taste is Great but... 3 4 
I ordered a 12 pack for $24. Pretty expensive considering its a bulk order.<br /><br />I rolled the dice on this flavor. I dont care for it at all and its only 20% coconut water (from concentrate)<br />Maybe the other flavors are better, but I wont be paying another $24 to find out. Not a pleasent taste & only 20% coconut water (from concentrate) 2 1 
Is not bad but is not that good neither, for me it taste like a cherry juice, the taste of the black cherry is strong very strong sometimes taste like fermented cherry I didn't like the flavor. Taste like fermented cherry 2 3

Before my husband retired, he would bring these alfajores back for me when he went on business trips to South America.  I would, however, request the box that contains only the chocolate-covered ones.  The meringue-coated alfajor has a shorter shelf life and dries out more quickly.  (The "mixto" box featured here on Amazon has 6 chocolate and 6 meringue.)<br /><br />Besides beautiful architecture, irrigation systems, science, mathematics and medicine, another great contribution the Moors made to Spain (and hence to Latin America) was the "alfajor".  It's a sandwich cookie like no other.  The cookie itself is flaky, soft and delicious and the filling is "dulce de leche", a yummy, soft, spreadable caramel.<br /><br />Of those alfajores I have purchased, Havanna's are the best and when I say this I am referring to the chocolate-covered ones.  Unfortunately, the price here is exorbitant for a box of 12 cookies but, of course, that's a great reason not to eat too many at 375 calories each.<br /><br />The chocolate-covered Havanna alfajores are a 5-star treat.  I gave this lower rating to the Amazon offering because this is the assortment box which is only half chocolate and also because of that high price. Excellent cookies but for that price they should be wrapped in gold. 3 4 
The thing I like most about this brand of hot chocolate is that once I remove it from the keurig, it doesn't leak all over the place.  For some reason, all the hot chocolates I've purchased before leak all over when you remove them from the coffee pot.  My coffee doesn't do that so not sure why that is.  This is a great deal for the amount you get as well, and taste yummy! Yummy! 5 4 
I order the 192 box of these every month.  I'll get them the same time of the month for a couple of months and then they send me an email that they have canceled my order due to payment problem and I have to reorder and loose a month.  I don't understand since I havent changed my address, card number or anything. Does anyone else have this problem? canceling my shipment 5 2 
I had such a hard time with this fondant.  I have used Wilton for years and have done many good things with it so I decided to "step it up".  Boy am I sorry I did.  I had a 4 tiered anniversary cake to do in ivory.  I HATE coloring fondant so I figured this was as good a time as any to try a new fondant that was already colored so I ordered Satin Ice (...or SATAN Ice as I now call it).  I took it out of the tub and set it on the counter.  My 9 year old twins both said WHAT is that?!  I said "It's fondant!"  Having seen me work with fondant for many years, they both said "It looks too GOOEY to be fondant!!".  Boy... even at 9 they are VERY observant.  It was very easy to roll out, but getting it ON the cake was a different story.  When I picked it up to put it on the cake it fell apart in my hands.  I attempted this 4 times.  Finally I put wax paper underneath it, rolled it out and flipped it onto the cake.  Easy enough.....or so I thought until I saw all the wrinkles transferred from the wax paper...back to the drawing board.  I ended up putting wax paper underneath, rolling it out, putting wax paper on top, flipping it over, THEN putting it on the cake....only to find that it still tore in the process.  UGH.  I'm exhausted!!  Never again. Difficult to work with 1 4 
I use baking soda for a LOT of household things (cleaning, cooking, personal care, etc).  I was first tempted by this seemingly economized 12 pound bag.  However, when I compared to the smaller containers at my local grocery store - I realized this was not the best way to purchase baking soda.<br /><br />Right now for 12lbs of the generic brand (12, 16 oz. boxes) I would pay just 10.68 (13.08 regular).<br /><br />For the A&H brand I could buy 12lbs in the following ways:<br />12, 16 oz. boxes for 13.80<br />6, 32 oz. boxes for 10.62<br />3, 64 oz. boxes for 8.97<br /><br />That's nearly ten dollars less for the same amount of the same product.  Although the bag is probably more convenient than 3-12 boxes - the boxes are recyclable and the bag is not.  Just some things to think about! Great Product, Bad Price 3 2 
I wasn't crazy about the Chicken and Broccoli Skillets Dinner Kit, but mostly because it only had a tiny amount of broccoli. I added a package of frozen broccoli, and that improved things considerably. I wish it had a bit less sodium and whole-grain pasta, but it isn't bad the way it is. The Velveeta that was included did improve the overall palatability of the dinner. Needs more broccoli! 2 3 
Buttons were much smaller than expected and did not receive before St Patrick's Day even when I requested priority delivery and was willing to pay for faster service.  No response from seller when asked if shipment could be rushed. St Patrick's Day Buttons 3 2 
i have enjoyed this product for quite some time.  however, i am disgusted by the fact that the price keeps increasing!  at $35 per case, customers are paying more than $4 per box for 5 small cookie bars - ridiculous!  i will find a healthier, more reasonably priced snack to munch on. shame on nana and amazon. . . price keeps increasing. . . 1 2 
The price certainly is right but for our two dog's (Lab and German Short Hair) chew treat experience nearly half of the chews are too large and much too thick. In competitor's products there are always some of the large/thick chews that I need to cut in half using a tin shears. With Green Cow many chews are so thick they will have to be sawed. We will use them up eventually but I have cancelled my subscription for periodic repeat orders. Just didn't work out for us!! Chews Blues 3 2 
My rating of 1 Star does not reflect my opinion of Peppadew peppers, it is intended to cause Amazom (and Divina) to edit their ads for the 70 oz. package to identify this 70 oz. package of Peppadews as either mild or hot. This is important, if not critical information to the customer when deciding whether or not to purchase this item. Mild or Hot? 1 2 
When I ordered this I wanted whole chia seeds.  There was nothing in the description indicating that I was ordering anything other than whole chia seeds. The product that arrived at my house was milled chia seeds.  This was not what I ordered and not what I wanted. Not what I ordered... 2 1 
My dog loves these snacks and they don't have artificial ingredients.<br /><br />They come in a resealable bag which is good - they do get a bit hard if they are not kept sealed up. Great snacks 5 4 
What's to say about Oreos?  The originals are still the best & I don't get them often because gluttony overcomes me.  One, two, or even a few isn't possible for me. Yay! 5 4 
Ads a very pleasant taste to my stir fry experience. As tasty in my home cooking , comparable to that in a chinese restaurant. A product that I will always keep on hand for my cooking pleasure. kadoya pure sesame oil 1 3 
I like these peanuts. What impressed me most was that there was an oxygen scavenger inside the tins thereby maintaining the freshness. Also, the manufacturer recommends storing the peanuts in a refrigerator which I think is a good recommendation especially since peanuts are prone to becoming rancid.<br />However, I would like to add that since these are lightly salted peanuts and if you are used to eating the regular salted peanuts, there is a marked difference in taste.<br />A beautiful package too. Recommended! A nice product 5 4 
This product is indeed fabulous and you can get it at many grocery stores for a lesser price.  Overall a great product and makes awesome red sauce!  TO SQUISM:  I find it very disturbing that you casually refer to hitting your wife, even if you are joking, this is not the place for that sort of behavior!!!!  If you really hit your wife your a punk coward.  Domestic abuse IS NOT a laughing matter and I was personally offended by your review.  Try to maintain some amount of class when posting on here.  I am sure that is something you are incapable of doing, judging by your disgusting and classless review. Squism needs help! 5 3 
These things are awesome. Period. I started replacing one of my floss filters with this medium per one of the girls at my local pet store, trying to remove tannins from my driftwood. This does so much more, and is super efficient. For tank critters with super clean water requirements, these are a must. Only wish they weren't so expensive. Great Filter!!! 4 5 
The flour is amazing but the customer service sucks. I have emailed and called the company numerous times with no response. Awesome Flour Crappy Company 3 4 
Of all the sugerless stuff in the world, this hard candy is a miracle in taste. Can't work out why so many outlets have stopped carrying it, but it is worth more than a casual glance. Yum 4 5 
The Coffee maker is o.k.  but we are annoyed to find that the only way to get refills in on-line.<br />Calls to Nescafe's customer service assure us we can get them at Walmart - NOPE! can't get Nescafe in stores 2 1 
This is an instant powder that you mix with hot water.  The strongest flavor by far is ginger, which has a nice, powerful bite to it.  Behind that, I can taste some lemon and honey flavors, and the aftertaste is mostly lemon and honey.  The lemon and honey has a little bit of an "artificial" taste to it, but not terrible.<br /><br />This would clear your sinuses well, and if a drink made from a lot of ginger and a little lemon and honey sounds good to you, you will probably enjoy it.  Still, I think that I could do better with real ginger (either grated or jarred), lemon juice, and honey. Strong Strong Ginger Flavor 3 4 
This took over a week to receive so if you have an ill cat choose another source. This one is too slow. Too late 1 2 
I cannot say how much I love Kettle brand potato chips. Kettle brand has a large variety of unique flavors, and the quality of the chips themselves blows all other potato chips out of the water. The ingredients list is printed on each bag and the only thing really bad for it is the oil they are frying the chips in. I love that these aren't filled with nasty chemicals. I ordered the cheddar and sour cream krinkle cut ones which are great but I was torn between the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048IFUSC">Kettle Brand Potato Chips Fully Loaded Baked Potato, 2-Ounce (Pack of 24)</a> and the Jalapeno flavor. While I know the jalapeno flavor is good but this is way better. They include liquid smoke instead of actual bacon which I'm fine with since I've a vegetarian. I ordered this to give to guests coming from out of town for my wedding this spring and I can't guarantee how many I will have left. My fiance and I love these. The packaging is perfect for anyone who is giving these to kids to take for school lunches, or handing out in gift bags, even just for portion control. Ridiculously Good 5 3 
These K-cups are good when they don't explode - but a lot of them have exploded during brewing and made a mess all over my kitchen. Exploding K-Cups 1 2 
Although the cereal is a great tasting cereal I gave this one star because the price of $41.50 that they are selling it for here on Amazon is rediculous!!! That's almost $7 a box. I don't know about you but I know I've never paid $7 for a box of cereal. Wal-Mart sells the 21 oz. (6 pack) of Life Cinnamon cereal for $19.68. Just make sure you shop around because when you see a deal that you think may be to good to be true, it probably is NOT a good deal. Don't be fooled by the price!!!!! 1 2 
After trying the Chocolate Peanut Butter flavored Arctic Zero which was pretty good, the Cookies and Cream flavor was a huge disappointment. As previously noted it is a strange color and the taste is absolutely nothing like Cookies and Cream. It is really sweet but in the worst way possible and I will not be purchasing this pricey product again. Would not buy again 2 1 
I tried many gluten free breads. Flavor-wise, this bread is good. But the real issue I had with this bread is that it caused me quite a lot of discomfort because of bloating and gas. Yes, it's awkward to admit that, but I wanted to warn others from potential painful symptoms.<br /><br />I have celiac as well as ulcerative colitis, so my digestive system is sensitive. I bought the 6-pack from amazon, and with the first loaf I baked I thought the symptoms might be related to something else I ate. By the second loaf my suspicion grew stronger. With the third, I decided to do a little experiment and just eat the bread by itself and see if it's really the source of the discomfort/gas. The answer is yes.<br /><br />I should note that I did not have these symptoms with Bob's red mill<br />gluten free bread (which is also tasty). There is definitely something in Pam's bread mix that the digestive system of some people might disagree with.<br /><br />Hope it help, May cause discomfort 1 2 
I am posting this because unfortunately Amazon does not show the label, ingredients on many items.  Since you can not see it, many would assume that this is just dried fruit.  It is not.  It is fruit dried with sulpher.  For some this may not be an issue (but you should know that it is there nonetheless).  I have developed sulphur allergies over the years (you develop allergies via exposure) and with more and more mass produced bulk items containing sulphur, likely many more people will too.  I have had some pretty serious health consequences of same.<br />We can get these locally very inexpensively (I am in Hawaii) and would never purchase this particular brand because of the sulphur.  I did buy it once without thinking, and they tasted bitter, acrid, nowhere near as good as we get in local shops, health food stores.  I realize that tropical fruit is not easy to get everywhere, but there are good healthy alternatives.  Consider, for example: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HN5O3C">Woodstock Farms Mango Slices, Unsulphured, 8.5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a><br />i was browsing here, hoping to get better prices (and access) on bulk dried fruit, but can see that the lack of labeling info is going to cause me a problem :(  I guess my only alternative until other customers specify what is on the label, is to buy things specifically labeled "unsulphured".<br />If you do not have allergiews or sulphur related health problems (yet) maybe consider comparing the 2.  Sulphured fruit is bitter, leaves a chemical aftertaste and is overdried making it taste a lot less fresh (which it generally is) and tougher.  In my experience, this particular product is the worst offender (at least that I have encountered).  It is heavvily sulphured and really tastes off. SULPHERED! 2 1 
This is a good product, especially for iced coffee, but why is it twice the price as it is in stores?  This isn't a fluke--within the past two months I've bought it for $5 a jar in Seattle and in Nevada, so it just looks like good old-fashioned gouging.  Try harder Amazon. Twice the Price as in Stores 1 3 
I feel that the picture misrepresents the product that I received.<br />Approx.80% were black and 5% each of the other colors.Not good value.<br />Seller does not disclose % of each color so no recourse. Disapointed 2 1 
i have 3 cats here at home and they need to dosome grazing so i baught  this to see if they like it :) even though its just out grass lol kitty grass 5 4 
I am a big tea drinker and LOVE Ginger tea b/c it works great for stomach sickness, queasiness, and overall digestive health.  I like the flavor of this b/c it's got a strong lemon flavor and it also smells wonderful, however, the b/c it's in powder form it leaves a little bit of a weird after taste and kind of coating in your mouth.  Overall, I would choose ginger lemon tea over this b/c tea has a cleaner texture and doesn't leave a coating in your mouth like this powder version. Not bad, but I prefer traditional tea 3 4 
I love these noodles.  They are really great for a midnight snack.  It's not really something that will fill you up for a dinner.  If you do eat it for dinner, you will be hungry later.  Maybe some people wouldn't!!!!  But, it just doesn't stick to my ribs.  I love them though and Amazon has a really good price. Great and good price! 5 4 
Well, lets say that I wish that I had heeded the warning of other reviewers. Since there were so many great and so many bad reviews, I didn't know what to make of it all - thought that possibly this was a fair cup of coffee, but that other reviewers had above average tastes in coffee. Nope. They're just regular old coffee drinkers like me that just don't want a funky taste, and funkier aftertaste. Not too much to ask from a finely brewed cup of coffee. I bought the French Roast...reviews of Fog Chaser were worse stating it tasted like dishwater, ashtray, etc.<br /><br />Let me start by saying, other reviewers are correct that once you open the sealed bag, you must contain them in something else because it will not stay fresh. I just put mine in an empty coffee container because I am just lazy with my coffee...that is afterall why I own a Keurig...ease of use and a quality cup of coffee. Once I opened the outer sealed bag, I couldn't help but think it smelled like something that may have washed ashore on the San Francisco Bay!! I did approach it with an open mind, however, and brewed a cup of coffee.<br /><br />It is easy to use just like traditional k-cups, despite the uniquely different design. I did get coffee grounds in my cup (really just a few), and that has happened to me before so I did not want to fault the product for that. As for the taste...that's where I fault the product itself!!! I gave this two stars because it is drinkable. Barely. I will fight my way though this pack, and never order again!! Let me put into this context for you...the coffee that I have drank at work from the old, stained coffee maker with some cheap store brand grounds thrown in tastes way better than this.<br /><br />There are other ways to save a buck with your machine...there's that giant gray bullet looking filter contraption, there's a small red plastic version, there's the snap on lids, and then there's the aluminum foil that someone recently introduced me to. So here goes...I'll give you a break down of all that I've listed.<br />Giant Gray Bullet Filter - Does NOT taste anything like a traditional k-cup brewed cup of coffee, but by FAR better than this coffee here! The downside with this is that you have to push out the inner part of the machine that the k-cup usually rests in. Dishwasher safe though.<br /><br />Small Red plastic and metal mesh filter - tastes closer to a traditional k-cup, and no popping out the machines inner parts. Have to dump grinds into garbage, but it is dishwasher safe. Good option. Also sold on Amazon.<br /><br />Snap on lids - Amazon sells snap on metal or plastic lids. I have the metal ones. With these, you have to peel the foil off of your k-cup after first use and dump out grounds, and clean them out. Sounds like a hassle, but I guess that I've gotten used to it. Put two scoops of any coffee grounds that you like, snap the lid on, put it in your machine and brew as usual. Out comes a good quality cup of coffee that tastes the same as the traditional k-cup. Possibly because the filter and the cup are what you are reusing. Now someone recently told me that you can reuse the same k-cup over and over again, until the filter gives out. Haven't tried yet.<br /><br />Aluminum Foil - first of all why didn't I think of that!! A k-cup only has a small piece of foil on top that the machine pierces. Really. So obvious that I can't believe that I never thought of it. Tried it the other day. Here's the scoop...still have to empty out a k-cup as you would with the above methods, add coffee grinds, etc. Tore off a small piece of foil, tried to get it just right around the lip because you can't just slap foil over it and have it fit in the machine with all of the excess foil...so it started to feel like a bit of a craft project. Once I got it to fit, I brewed a cup of coffee that tasted like what I have come to expect from a Keurig machine. There were a few grounds that fell into the coffee, but no more than with this crappy coffee!! I will perfect this aluminum foil method...measure, and pre-cut circles one day when I have time.<br /><br />Truly, I have no spare time, which is why I RARELY review a product, but I felt strongly enough about this terrible product, that I should save someone else the palatal distress! Not worth the money! Not worth feeling like you wasted your money when you throw them away! Not worth having to endure 36 cups of sub-standard coffee!! Again I'm no no connoisseur...just a regular coffee drinker! There are other ways of saving money with a Keurig machine! 2 1 
These Kitchen of Indian meals are great for a quick and easy meal. They are not as good as going to a very good Indian restaurant, but they are close enough to give you a satisfying fix if you love Indian food and flavors as I do. Just make a few servings of rice to go along with this and you're all set.<br /><br />One of my local grocery stores actually sells these a little cheaper, but they never have carried the Navratan Korma flavor, so that's why I get them from Amazon. I also really like the Rajma Masala (with the red kidney beans) and the Palek Paneer (with the spinach and cottage cheese) flavors.<br /><br />Whether you already love Indian food or just want to try something new, spicy and flavorful, I can heartily recommend this brand. Quick, easy fix for Indian Food 4 5 
The product is advertised as "6-7 Inch" bones.  Printed beneath the UPC code on the bags is "8 PK 6-7" Bone".  But I could immediately see without opening a bag that the bones were not the advertised size.  The real size range was 5 to 5-1/2 inches (to confirm my visual estimation, I grabbed my tape measure and measured their lengths).  Not ONE single bone was 7, or 6-1/2, or 6 inches.<br /><br />When you have a large dog, the size of their dog chews determines how long they will last.  I hate being lied to - no matter what a "deal" this product may be for others.<br /><br />If you want true-to-size 7" rawhide bones, get "Healthy Hide" brand beefhide treats.  They're made from free-range, grass-fed beef, and are HACCP & ISO certified.  And you also won't be ripped-off by deceptive marketing. Bone sizes not as advertised. 2 1 
This is what I was looking for and was missing it. The taste is exactly the taste as the one made in India so just loved it and remember my days back in India. Definitely recommend it. great taste 5 4 
I was really hopeful when I ordered these Fruit Slices.  It had been a long time since I had eaten any Fruit Slices, and was hoping to spark a delicious memory from my childhoood!  BUT, I was so disappointed when I ate my first slice - yes, I ate the entire piece, HOPING that the flavor would get better, but alas, the flavor did not improve.  The slice I tasted was supposedly watermelon, but all I could taste was a bitter, sour fruit.  I took one bite tastes of the other flavors, and couldn't tell much difference in any of the flavors, other than a bitter, sour fruit taste.  So - save your money, and look for a different brand of fruit slices to buy! Worst Fruit Slices I have ever tasted! 1 2 
Bought these Jack Link's Beef Sticks a second time because I was so pleased the first time I purchased them. This time the quality had gone down significantly, they were much greasier tasting and less flavorful. Then, they began to get moldy... within two weeks of receipt! Needless to say, I was not happy with this purchase. Second purchase not as good as the first. 1 2 
If you don't like ginger then don't pick up a ginger drink, but if you like ginger then I do suggest Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger & Lemon Beverage. It has a very intense ginger taste to it, much stronger ginger flavor then I was expecting and a very very mellow lemon flavor that is so mellow because the ginger just takes everything over.<br /><br />The smell of the drink when you first open the package it ginger overload, to me smelled like a gingerbread cookie with some lemon on top. Getting your drink just right is very easy, just open and pour your contents into a cup and add your choice of water and stir. Easy as 1 2 3 and your done. No need to sweeten your drink as it is already sweet with honey already inside.<br /><br />Can be served two different ways: hot & cold but I have to say I would prefer the hot way as it is very soothing to drink. Ginger is a wonderful way to settle your upset stomach and the fact that this drink mix is caffeine free is another bonus for that means I can drink it at any time and not have to worry about it keeping me up at night.<br /><br />If you like ginger check it out, for as a fan of ginger drinks/teas I have to say this has to be one of the better ones that I have tried. Strong Ginger But It Works 4 3 
This is one of the best choices, in my opinion.  I also adore Amazon, but they need to negotiate a better price for their Tassimo Disks.  These are available at BedBath & Beyond for $10. and I always get 20% off which brings it down to $8.00 --- they were $7.50 (before the 20% off readily available coupons) until about 3 months ago.  Again, this is an excellent blend with full flavor - not bitter - I think it's my favorite. great coffee - terrible price 5 4 
I like the sparking refreshing taste of Kiwi in combination with Strawberry but I probably would not sacrifice my thirst for the traditional diet free soda drinks that I got used to. Cool refreshing Kiwi taste 4 3 
This gardenia tree looked so cute online and we love gardenias. It arrived with a note to hurry and purchase a tray to go under the pretty pot which has 2 draining holes. It was a surprise this was not included. The plant did however come complete with ectoparasites (something like green scales clinging to the branches) and white flies. It was also not as mature as shown in photo - more like 3 branches with scant green and yellow leaves. came complete or did it? 1 2 
I have two cats, one who eats wet food as a last resort (mostly she licks up the gravy), and one who has food allergies (grains) and is incredibly picky (won't eat any grain free cat treats i've found so far--greenies, the tasty junk food ones, wellness cat jerky bits, shaved salmon, etc-- doesn't like catnip, and turns his nose up at anything that costs less than $1.29 a can it seems, to include spots stew; authority; organix; most flavors of avo-derm, holistic select, and innova; max cat; and natural choice).<br /><br />she still licks up the gravy, and eats about half her bowl. He eats his portion and finishes hers, with no vomiting or retching (so nice!). He also wakes me up in the morning if it's breakfast time and i haven't gotten the memo yet, and looks at me like i just kicked his grandma cat when i've run out.<br /><br />this has quite a bit of juice in it, which is good since most cats don't drink enough water anyway.<br /><br />as for me, i love this food b/c it doesn't smell to high heaven, and i haven't died from litterbox duty as of yet. ;) (get it? duty--dooty? hehe) thank goodness for grainfree 5 3 
I don't know why everyone loves these chips. They are healthy but taste disgusting. Only the original flavor tasted good, so getting the variety pack was a very bad idea. I would not buy this again and would rather go with baked chips than these. Pirate's Booty makes popped chips that are way better. Tastes disgusting 2 1 
This simple yet tasteless product did what it said it would, thicken gravy and soups. This product in my opinion should be used in the morning before work or people who are studing late nights as Chia makes you energized. Chia 3 4 
Either I got 15 tubes that came from a bad batch lot or they are not selling the right Harissa. I bought 15 tubes thru Amazon from Parthenon Foods and used 4 of them so far and after putting the whole tube it still isn't spicy at all. Normally a whole tube would get you to sweat a bit!!!!! This seems to be a case of false representation. I buy these tubes in Canada at the grocery store all the time when I am up there and they provide a nice kick and spice (as they should). What's up with dat? Not spicy at ALL! 1 2 
UPDATE: KEEP YOUR RECEIPT.<br />The product is guaranteed...but the process to get a refund is onerous (in my opinion).<br /><br />"I am sorry that you were not satisfied with our "XXXX".  Please send a proof of purchase, a note with the expiration date of the product and an explanation as to why you were not satisfied to the address below and we will gladly refund your money.  Thank you and again, my apologies."<br /><br />Walden Farms<br />1209 W St Georges Ave<br />Linden, NJ 07036<br /><br />I spread this on Wasa sourdough crisp as part of an HCG Very Low Calorie diet. I thought it was tasty..and very peanut-like for ZERO CALORIES. It is thin. Goes well with Walden Farms blueberry fruit spread.<br /><br />NOW if you are NOT looking for ZERO calories..look elsewhere. If you can spare a few calories try PB2...it is a powdered peanut butter with fat removed. (I have not tried it..but I expect it will be better...when I get to phase 3...I'll try it).  But right now I'm on a low complex carb, low carb, Very low calorie and no sugar diet. THIS is not a lifestyle change diet..it is a rapid weight loss diet.....then you slowly introduce carbs, a little sugar and flavor.<br /><br />Walden farms fits in HCG diet Phase 2, when you are restricted to 500 calories  a day. (Some HCG folks allow 600-800 calories).<br /><br />IN a very low calorie diet phase..Walden Farms products are great.  BUT TRUST me..don't even think about Walden farms ZERO calorie products unless you are on an extreme diet....<br /><br />I don't think I'd enjoy the sourdough crisps without something..so I view the Walden farms spreads as a nice treat. If you are on a HCG diet, buy it.<br /><br />Just found a recipe. 1 T. peanut butter. 2 T.  ground flax seed and 1/4 cup water (or splurge and replace some water with zero calorie vanilla, butterscotch or caramel flavoring). Heat water to boiling & pour over flax seed & "peanut butter". 75 calories.<br />Some eat this as a "cereal". I cut up apples and used as a dip.  It was actually more than I wanted for one apple. You can half the recipe.<br /><br />Hope this helps folks. Good and tasty if you want zero calories 3 1 
Way to powdery tasting and bad aftertaste.  Plus the price I could not believe for this junk!  Skip and stay with Countrytime Lemonade!<br /><br />Yuck! Bad Aftertaste! 2 1 
I ordered this as a christmas present for my Daughter and Son in law. He tried it the day after Christmas and gave it 2 thumbs up. hot cocoa 5 3 
They're not as sweet as I expected.  They are very good corn flakes but don't buy them thinking they'll be a frosted flakes kind of substitute because they are not sugary at all.  And that's not necessarily bad, I like regular corn flakes, it's just that the "Honey'd" part of the product name is a bit misleading in that respect. Just plain old Corn flakes 4 2 
A friend's doctor recommended this to her for weight loss after having a baby.  It is good, better with a little artificial sweetener added.  Note:  Be sure to drink some of the water out of your bottle, when you add the drink mix, it will fizz up some. Zipfizz 3 4 
I bought two of these for Christmas to give to my husband.  The chocolates on the inside were Ghirardelli's typical high quality individually wrapped chocolates.  The problem was with the ornament.  It was extremely hard to open.  I wouldn't suggest this as a gift idea for anyone who has trouble opening containers, like grandmas and grandpas with arthritis.  It's about the size of a softball so it does make nice decoration for people who can utilize all the muscles in their hands and are up to the task of trying to open the thing. Delicious Ghirardelli Chocolates That Are Nearly Impossible to Get Into 4 3 
I don't usually like domestic lagers especially from large brewing companies.  This however is a wonderful example of the fuller European style, something akin to a full bodied Belgian Lager.  So easy to make. I recommend getting the full kit which has appropriate malts and sugars and the carbonation drops!  I live in New Hampshire and I brewed this in January when it was very cold.  After the initial fermentation it's been sitting in the bottle at around 50 degrees for a couple of months. The larger yeasts can survive at these cold temps where an ale yeast couldn't.<br /><br />This is so good I think I'm going to have to brew another batch so it will be ready for summer! Shockingly good! 4 5 
This peanut butter is what one would expect for the brand: good peanut flavor and nice creamy texture. However, upon reading the ingredients list I noticed it had hydrogenated oils so I don't think in this day and age one should consume that. There are plenty of other peanut butter options out there just as good but without funny ingredients. Good taste and texture but don't care for the hydrogenated oils 2 3 
The noodles have to be cooked for 10 minutes, and the sauce must have sauteed meat added (according to the package) and would be improved with the addition of some vegetation (according to me).  Therefore this item is neither quick nor complete.  If the sauce was REALLY great, that might make it worthwhile- but it isn't, its just OK. Just not good 1 2 
I tried Zico in the plastic bottle, never in the tetra pack.<br /><br />Zico in the plastic bottle tastes like watery skim milk with a really really slight hint of coconut flavor. If you ever tried Taste Nirvana coconut water before, Zico pales in comparison. Zico is less sweet and saltier version of Taste Nirvana coconut water. I've also tried VitaCoco. Compared to VitaCoco, Zico tastes creamier than VitaCoco and doesn't have that sour taste.<br /><br />However, in all honesty, Zico tastes like skim milk and nothing like real coconut water from a fresh coconut. Tastes oddly like watery skim milk... 3 2 
SHORT VERSION: Get the 2" version instead, but these are great!<br /><br />--------------------------<br />Preface: I'm a *HUGE* sour gummi worm lover.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-Actually SOUR (they use that "sour patch kid" sour powder)<br />-9 lbs for $10..<br /><br />CONS:<br />-4" Worms are too big/thick<br />-Jaw hurts from chewing :x<br /><br />I would definitely buy these again, but next time I will buy the 2" versions instead. Everybody loves these, esp that they are actually sour, but the worms are so thick/big that your jaw starts to hurt from the chewing them. Too thick but otherwise great 3 4 
My dogs didn't like these as well as other Smokehouse products.  They much prefer the chicken tenders or the duck and sweet potato treats.  They still liked them, but just didn't appear as excited as they do with the others Smokehouse products are a great buy 3 4 
Met expectations--filling, flavorful, one bag is very generous portion, non-greasy.  Flavors are not very distinctive.  BBQ was best, but not well distributed.  Six adults tried them and Six adults liked them. met expectations 4 3 
I ordered this product for cocoa-antioxidants that do body good. To my surprize when I received the order, the product's cans indicated that this cocoa's antioxidants were fewer than its cousin product-Hershey's Cocoa, Natural, Unsweetened. Had this fact been described in the promotion ad, I would not have ordered Hershey's Cocoa, Special Dark. Not All Hersheys Cocoas Are Created Equal 3 2 
Might be me, but I am sorry I bought so many packages/how I'm going to eat this is still a mystery. Perhaps cutting the product up in 1 inch pieces. Unless You have razor teeth, this is impossible to chew. Made a batch that has been sitting in tomatoes, and still like rubber bands. I was raised on 'scratch' cooking,might be a personal issue.<br /><br />Reporting back: I used a new pair of scissors and cut noodles up in 1/2 inch pieces. The solution is to swallow the bits w/o chewing. I couldn't throw product on compost heap as I believe the MIRACLE noodle would not break down.<br /><br /> The Miracle in the product name is-if you can get them down without the noodles wrapping around your tonsils,it's a miracle. My father said a hungry man will eat anything,if he is hungry enough/ first time my father was wrong. I also have a sneaking feeling that there might be paid reviewers for this company. Also, I haven't watched a Doctor Oz show since. 11 more pkgs to go/good thing product has long shelf life 1 2 
I keep a case of these in my office and always have at least a tin or two on my desk for visitors to help themselves to. Some folks stop by just to grab some mints and others pop them like candy while we meet. When I find someone who keeps coming back for more I just give them their own tin! One co-worker asked me to save the tins for her so she could use them as pillboxes and safety pin boxes. Like I said, theyre a real hit. Since I wouldn't be able to keep my hands off a candy dish, this is a good alternative to have around and it's nice to have them around if I have garlic for lunch! I gave the item 4 stars because they aren't as tasty as the sugar version of the mints  but what sugar free item is as good as it's full sugar counterpart?) and because of the fact that each tin is wrapped in plastic which seems like a waste and is irritating to remove (although I totally get why they wrap it - it still doesn't make it easy to deal with). A huge hit at the office! 4 5 
I have three cats... have had cats for years, this food smells better than most, my cats like it, the ingredients appear to be better than the average cat food. So far, so good! i'll continue to use it for my cats Cats seem to like this food, nice to have it delivered! 5 4 
I generally buy the Blue Dog bakery dog treats, but I thought I'd try these out. Overall, I like them, and so do my canine family members.<br /><br />Pro:<br />- The dogs really like them.<br />- They are thick and crunchy - the dogs chewed on them for a while, unlike most treats where they were consumed more quickly. I think this is better for their teeth.<br />- Resealable pouch is a nice touch.<br />- Treats have no odor to them, even after handling them to break apart.<br /><br />Con:<br />- The package was a bit difficult to open - it has an indentation to tear, but the first side I tore did not open the bag. I was more careful on the other side, and tore it towards the zipper opening.<br />- The treat come in bunches of two, and since they are pretty thick (over 1/4 inch or so) I found it difficult to split them into individual services. Two would be too much for small dogs. However, if you have a larger animal they might be more appropriate.<br /><br />Summary: A good choice for dog treats. Recommended. Dogs love 'em 5 4 
This was my first time ordering something from the Vine that I could not really review myself.  And our dog, Lucky, can't speak...English.  I do, however, understand a little Dog speak.  When first presented with one of Newman's Own Lamb and Barley NZ Style Dog Treats, he snarfed it down just as expected, just as he does with all treats.  But the next day, as he  saw me go for the bag a second time - he went ballistic.  When I gave him the treat, he retreated into the den with it as if it were a bone.  Same thing happened the third time. Conclusion:  Lucky says "Big Yum! to Newman's Treats.<br /><br />JMT Lucky says yumm! 5 3 
It is my 7 yr old lab/basenji mix's favorite food, which we mix 1/3 can together with her dried food, making a single can last a week as a special treat.  However, after shipping, it is cheaper to go to my local pet store Cheaper at local store 5 4 
I was going to buy the 3 pack Torani Sugar Free Caramel Syrup offer from Amazon, but decided to try one bottle first, from my local grocery store. Glad I did. The reviews are right, not sure how to put it, but the taste is "off". Kinda makes my coffee taste like ther're is a chemical in it. Kinda bummed, but glad I did not get 3 bottles! Stick with the sugar free vanilla, it is very good. Ill give another flavor a chance in the future, but Sugar Free Caramel is off the table for me. Weird taste 1 2 
Third time I've bought this brand,,,it is STALE,,not gonna bother to return it,,,no second chances, will find another brand. I'm sure another brand offers the same size. To be clear, the first boxes were fresh. Take your best shot. STALE 2 1 
My two cats must not be interested in grass, because it grew but they ignored it. Had no problems growing it. Ignored it 5 4 
Tasted a bit stale.  Not nearly as good as the "waffle" cookies that I loved in Europe, but maybe the product was just not as fresh? Okay - not great 3 2 
This food has worked fairly well for my two not quite senior feral rescues, one of whom has CRF and one of whom has IBD (eating pigeons and food left on the ground apparently isn't so good for young kitties' digestive systems and other internal organs, I guess).  It is a lower protein and phosphorus food, but the first ingredient is real chicken (unlike some renal foods that are made with mostly by-products).  It also doesn't cost an arm and a leg, compared to other special foods, and my CRF kitty, who often rejects a perfectly delicious food once she has tasted it in reverse, has been willing to keep eating this even though she's been sick on it more than once. Well Tolerated by CRF Kitty and IBD Kitty 5 4 
I purchased the White Cheddar flavor based on the good reviews and really wanted to like it, but the salt in the product is too much for my taste. Thank you Too salty for me 3 2 
I don't know if I got a bad bag or what from the good reviews I have read but these were the toughest gummi bears I have ever had.  They were hard to chew to the point where your mouth would begin to hurt.  I still have about four pounds remaining after a couple months now since they aren't enjoyable to eat.  The taste isn't the greatest either unless you let them set in you mouth for a while but the toughness just makes them very unenjoyable.  Maybe its just a bad bag but I have no reason to say these are good if they weren't and that is my experience so far. Very tough to chew 1 2 
Before I bought this product I read several reviews saying that this stuff was amazing, that it made everything super sweet. So I thought I would try it out, and it is pretty cool, but not worth the outrageous price. About one minute after I sucked the tab I tried eating numerous things like limes, lemons, and oranges, just to name a few. It did make everything that's sour sweet. Not to the point of "oh my god, it's amazing" but it did work. So to sum this up, this stuff was good for a one time deal, but after doing it a few times it lost it's appeal. It's cool but no miracle 4 2 
I don't think any gummi bears are really better than others. I just wanted to note that this product is listed under "Vegetarian" foods, but they are not vegetarian because they contain gelatin.<br /><br />Just a note. Now, back to your regularly-scheduled Amazon shopping. Not Vegetarian 3 1 
I read an article rating this the best instant Risotto, but I actually prefer the flavor of the plain saffron one. Not my favorite 3 2 
With Subscribe and Save, these are about the same price as they are at the local Family Dollar so I went ahead and ordered a pack of 4 for myself and friends I have over for the holidays.<br /><br />These are just average. I thought there'd be more to them. Very small layer of cheese but I guess that's about how everything is nowadays. But these are just average. I won't be purchasing them again.<br /><br />They aren't bad if you used them in dip. Not very flavorful. 3 2 
I want to make my own black sesame ice cream because I don't trust store bought ice cream.  These bags were priced well and arrived without any seeds in the Amazon box.<br /><br />Sesame paste requires toasting cleaned and dried seeds on medium and then grinding it into a paste either with or without sugar.<br /><br />gdz Arrived without Leakage 3 4 
I tried this coffee on a half dozen quests this weekend and they all loved it.  For those that like their coffee mild, I brewed 7 oz cups.  For those of us that like it bold, I brewed 5 oz cups.<br /><br />As an earlier posted noted, it does have a slightly flavored quality to the taste that makes it stand out from other coffees.  The taste isn't obvious enough to turn off drinkers who want their coffee "regular and black" but strong enough to note for those of us that pay attention.<br /><br />I plan on trying all of Wolfgang's line.  Wish he'd offer a variety pack. Exquisitely Flavored Medium Coffee 5 4 
We love the big bold flavors we typically find in the dark roast coffees available for the Keurig.  However, my family and I found this one a bit too bitter.  The flavors are strong and this is definitely a bold coffee, but the lingering flavor was not as smooth as some of our more favorites.<br /><br />We've tried this on two occasions, once from a sample pack and another time from a box of 24.  We all consistently agreed across the two times.  So I feel pretty confident in our assessment.  Perhaps others will like this if they put more sugar or cream in it to knock a bit of the bitterness off.  Since I use no cream and only a little sweetener, this is just a bit too strong for us. A bit bitter 4 3 
The order of three different plants arrived as advertised.  They were packed well.  Unfortunately, they didn't last a week. i contacted the seller and wrote him it was my first experience at growing plants and requested a refund.  He e-mailed and wrote he preferred to send replacements and asked questions, as well as, pointed out the plants go into hibernation around Sept. and last some months.  Over this weekend, i decided to scope out other plant sites. i decided no refund and no replacements. Lesson learned. Lesson Learned 3 1 
there is very little taste, from the herring or the lemon...but there is a hot pepper kick. the fish meat is whitish, soft and flaky. it is not firm nor does it have the fish flavor as in the other kipper product we bought.<br /><br />it just seems that they used whatever was left over , the broken and the flakes....added some lemon and pepper to make it have an appeal to a buyer. a good way to use otherwise less valuable parts of the fish?<br /><br />this will not be re-ordered by us.<br /><br />we buy a LOT of such fish product at amazon and rate each one, this gets our lowest rating. very mediocre 1 2 
I used to get these from Sam's Wholesale Club, but with this economy, I have not renewed my membership .. so long story short, I bought BumbleBee canned clams and they were HORRIBLE .. so then I bought Geisha Baby Clams and they were not as horrible, but I certainly would not put them in MY clam chowder, so I returned all the unopened cans of BumbleBee and Geisha and am never ever gonna buy them again ... oh, you go right ahead and try those other brands if you don't mind eating POOP .. 'cause that's about all you get .. Clam Juice, and Clam Poop.  Doxee Snow's Clams are ALL CLAMS and CLAM JUICE no clam poop. will never buy a different brand again 5 1 
It tastes the same as the first original "International Instant Coffee". With a little sugar, it tastes ok but it's not smooth enough to call it cappaccino. Mostly I taste the powdered creamer. It would be ok to use as a base flavor to add other flavors in; especially if you added the same spices you use to make chai latte. A grocer around here would charge about $3.50 a can for it. I have to say that it tastes better than the House Blend they make for single cup coffee makers. I wouldn't buy this again though, and I'm not interested in finishing the can. Cappaccino? 2 3 
When I gave this to my dog he instantly went to town. As I sat and watched him I noticed the white t-rex had cut my dog's mouth from the sharp edges. He is an aggressive chewer and didn't want to see it go, but it really required too much supervision than I felt comfortable with. Cute Dinosaur Not Cute Dog Teeth 1 2 
I ordered these as a gift in June. They tasted great! They did not arrive in picture perfect condition due to the heat but I was contacted by the company to see what they could do for me.  The strength of a company is not found in things that go correctly but rather in the things that go wrong and what they do about them.  I would recommend them highly Very Tasty 5 4 
There isn't much to say other than the delivery was great and the candy was fresh and chewy. Eating alone the bag lasted me 2 months. Great for the price and I'd order again!!! First time buying candy over the net 5 4 
I was initially delighted with this gum for I thought I'd found something I could<br />chew without the attendant gas and GI upset.<br /><br />It wasn't too long though before I noteced that I really sort of craved the gum and it<br />sort of turned into an addiction I'd say.<br /><br />The craving, and chewing continued until a sensation of intraoral ulcers developed which took about a week to resolve. I'm off the gum now but still crave it.<br /><br />Interesting.<br /><br />Probably just me. Not all good... 3 2 
I bought this thinking it would be a lot like regular whipped cream. Just tried it and the taste is nothing like it. Not what I expected it tastes really bad Taste is not what you think 1 2 
Pros: Easy to use. Plug it in, set your levels and go! Works well with Condenser Mics. Has 48v Phantom Power. Runs solely off USB (No need for a wall wart).<br /><br />Cons: Very plastic. Feels like it could snap with the slightest bit of rough handling! I wouldn't try to plug it directly into a mic. Use an XLR cable. No headphone monitoring jack and quite a bit of latency when monitoring with a separate interface. I would not recommend it for Dynamic mics. I tried it with my Rode Procaster Dynamic Mic and could not get high enough levels without practically yelling into the mic. I also tried it with an old V-Tech handheld stage mic and levels were a little better, so dynamics with a higher line output might work better with it.<br /><br />Overall, it does what it's supposed to, but it could be a lot better. For about $30-40 more, you can get better interfaces with 2 mic inputs, but this one is nice for situations where running off of USB power is a must. Could be better, but it works and it's inexpensive 4 2 
I bought this puzzle toy for my mini aussie pup.  While he was able to figure this one out rather quickly, he still gets excited when I put it on the floor.  I love that it's plastic and easy to clean.  I have several other interactive treat toys that I use mainly for feeding purposes: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KV7ZGQ">Premier Busy Buddy Tug-A-Jug, Medium/Large</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002I0RLW">Premier Pet Busy Buddy Twist 'N Treat Dog Toy, Small</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ALMW0M">Kong Wobbler Dog Toy</a>,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ARUKU0">Smarter Toys 3-Inch IQ Treat Ball Dog Toy</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JVDV30">KONG Genius Leo Dog Toy, Extra Large (Colors vary)</a>, and other assorted Kong toys.  One might say that this pup is spoiled, but he's got so many toys to explore that he seldom gets into puppy mischief. Easy but engaging 4 3 
I was hoping to enjoy a raspberry iced mocha with this but, it tastes like cough medicine. Stick with Monin and Torani if you want to enjoy your flavoured mochas. Cough medicine 2 1 
I purchased this as a Christmas present for my father. It arrived quickly, but the expiration date was too soon. For someone used to complete, just add water mixes, I thought this might be a nice change. With such a short expiration date, he didn't feel he would get the time to make this special breakfast before the mix expired. It was a waste of money. I wonder how long this sat on the shelf before it was shipped out. Short shelf life 1 3 
I tried this, just one can, and am glad I had not bought more.  I do admire the company for coming up with an alternative to typical soft drinks but it's not for me.  I'd describe it as a sickeningly sweet syrup with very little carbonation added.  Plenty of carbonation is essential to a soft drink, it makes it sparkly and refreshing, plus it counteracts the sweetness.  As I said I'm glad it was just one can, my only regret is that I wasted 1.5 ounces of perfectly good vodka trying to make it more palatable and it didn't. WAY sweet 1 4 
The bottle I was unlucky enough to sample was imported by Moet Hennesy. I'm curious if the importer swapped the contents of the bottle. It must be that or Ardbeg has the best hype machine on the planet.<br /><br />The initial aroma is that of rubbing alcohol with a hint of fusel alcohol, although my friend likes the aroma. On tasting, it doesn't have much flavor. The aftertaste is another story entirely. It's hard to describe. Initially it's just a hint of medicine that progresses to a NyQuil type flavor and then on to.... something.<br /><br />I've had peaty flavored scotch but I cannot recommend... whatever that was. Did the importer swap the contents? 1 2 
Received the shipment promptly but to my dismay, it did not contain the mini treats I had ordered, but "small", which were not that small.  I have very small dogs and I really wanted the minis. I contacted the seller (Petco) and after several days, they responded that I could return them but if I reordered minis, they would still send the small because Amazon had the item numbers wrong and they don't have minis. They said the simplest thing would be to return them for credit. This did not seem economically feasible, so I am breaking each one into small pieces which is very inconvenient. My dogs love the taste! 3 2 
I buy these cookies for company.  I opened one and the chocolate was melted to the wrapper and the cookies were broken in three places.  I am not serving this to my company.  Not happy with the way they arrived.  That's okay I only have 25 to get rid of.  They should know their product and that it wouldn't be good to send it to Nevada in 104 degree weather.  I don't know what to say about the pieces they showed up in.  ASfter putting them in the freezer the chocolate was still stuck to the wrapper.  People in the SW don't buy these cookies in the summer. Not fit for company 2 1 
I have been struggling to find them in the shops nearby.<br />Much more convenient to order them through Amazon (slightly more expensive, but I save the gas and the burden). Finally 4 5 
I recieved this item the other day and while the packaging looks really nice, It was much smaller than expected, although the "brews 60 cups" is right, only if you use the super tiny 6oz cups that are on your coffee maker or like your coffee pretty weak.<br /><br />I would say that these bags are pretty small and you "might" get 3 coffee maker uses per bag if you're lucky, probably more like 2 uses per bag as they are much smaller than expected.  The quality of the product is VERY good however and I'm sure my brother in law will love this gift since he usually drinks awful folgers!<br /><br />Shipped fast and I would order from them again for gift purposes! Nice but small 4 3 
This is a great, yummy snack! It's healthy and easy to grab on the go AND still tastes great. I would recommend it to anyone, especially if you love Banana Nut Bread... it tastes just like the real thing. Yum! 4 5 
I have tried many "energy drinks" and try to use them sparingly, but with everyone's overloaded schedules these days, it's easy to see why people buckle under for some "magic" pick me up sometimes. This particular drink is one of, if not the worst I've ever tried! It's so sweet that you will wince while swallowing this stuff. It also has a terrible taste(whatever flavor it is?)that will not leave you wanting more, but will leave a "I can't wait until it's over" sensation. If you want a good one that doesn't effect your stomach(like me, if I drink three cups of coffe, my stomach is wrenched!) try Celcius, it's very low carb and doesn't make you run out of gas. Like all of these drinks, it's easy to become addicted to them, use only when you just need a boost and not just because you like to ZING! ha-ha! ....Oh yeah and you all know the "magic" is caffeine... right? ;-b WAY TOO SWEET AND TASTE TERRIBLE! 1 2 
I am a FULL-ON tea drinker.  I drink green tea and black tea all day long and when it comes to my breakfast tea, it HAS to be a one-two punch or I'll revert back to my bad coffee habit.  I quit about a year ago but I do still ache for that incomparable aroma that only coffee can give!!  I am having a pretty good go of my Twinings Breakfast Tea and TAZO's Awake still does it for me but I'm always on the look-out for a stronger breakfast tea and TAYLOR's is NOT IT!  I wan't the equivalent of starbucks for my black tea so sometimes I double-up on the tea bags.  I could have dumped the entire box of Taylor's in my cup and it still would have been too meek and mild for me.  So, if you enjoy a cup of flavored water with a tinge of black food coloring, this is just the tea for you :) A wee bit mild 2 3 
After drinking some most excellent coffee in Hungary, I discovered it was Douwe Egberts coffee, so I ordered some from Amazon.  After paying almost as much in postage as the package of coffee cost, I was extremely disappointed in the coffee itself.  The package I received was stale and flavorless.  I can buy Tully's French Roast at the supermarket for about $7 per 12 ounces, and it is far better coffee, fresh, with a rich aroma, full bodied flavor and no harshness or bitterness. Not worth the cost 1 2 
Definitely not extra bold...medium roast at best.  Not particularly memorable...doesn't have a good coffee aroma...but it's pretty decent tasting.  At this point I'm not sure if I would reorder. Not Extra Bold 4 3 
While I knew that the product was small and expensive I also knew my dog would love it. Here's the problem as I see it. The elk rack is realy an excellent product in and of it self, but when you add the cost o f the product and the shipping it is way too expensive. So I checked around both on line and off-line. I found many other sites and places which have the same produc at a much more reasonable cost. So much for believing that Amazon offered a good value. Hope you find this informative. too pricey 2 3 
You might want to see a video on how to open this bottle before you order it.  There is an instruction on how to open this bottle but their hard to see due to small words.  Taste like Seven Up.  Quantity is very small. Hard to open 1 2 
The noodles are cracked and brittle when you mix in the hot water. Taste was fine but I couldn't get over the inconsistent texture of the noodles. Good attempt for udon but there's definitely room for improvement! 2 3 
As our household attempts to eat better quality products, we've taken to trying to do the same for our favorite four-legged friends...unfortunately, the dogs seem to prefer hot-dogs over organic treats every time. We've tried local home-made peanut butter ones that seemed to rank one wag and a yawn. We tried another major brand organic treats that resulted in a look like "are you kidding?". We even tried a different Newmand's that ended up getting tossed - the dogs literally wouldn't touch them and acted outright offended at the suggestion this was their "treat". On the other hand, these were a hit. Rather than acting offended, they actually seemed to enjoy these. Bottom line - pooch approved. Pooch Appproved! 5 3 
These chips remind me of a long obsolete brand of chips we could get in middle school. They are by far the tastiest chips I've had and it's impossible to walk past the aisle without picking up the trademark blue bag and then putting the bag clip on the bag! These chips make me weak at the knees 5 1 
I bought 2 cases of these chips because I heard nothing but great things about this brand and this flavor of chip in particular. However, upon receiving them today, I saw that although they state NO MSG, they DO contain Yeast Extract which acts exactly as MSG does and therefore I cannot eat them. Unfortunately ALL Kettle chips contain this ingredient so I am unable to eat any of them. I don't think I can return them but I got them at a cheap price so I will donate them or see if Amazon can let me return them since the description was a bit misleading. These chips are MUCH healthier than many other brands, so if you are not MSG sensitive, I say dig in! Taste good but NOT truly MSG-FREE 3 1 
My love affair with miso, the flavorful paste made from fermented soybeans, started when I lived in Tokyo several years ago.  So, since then, being the miso snob that I am, it has been unimaginable to me to try any instant variety.  But I have to say that when I finally did break down and try Kikkoman Instant Tofu Miso Soup, I was amazed to find that it was practically indistinguishable in flavor and consistency from miso soup made from the actual paste.  While I would still choose the actual product whenever time permits, I would now not hesitate to substitute this great product when I am on the run. Almost Like the Real Thing 3 4 
As you can see by my name, I am a green, organic mom blogger, and always try to shop accordingly.  I was already a big fan of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5DZU2">Zoe Extra Virgin Olive Oil, 1-Liter Tins (Pack of 2)</a> and was glad to see an organic version.  Unfortunately, though how much we tried to like this, the organic Zoe Organic EVOO just doesn't taste anywhere near as good as the non-organic variety.  This organic one definitely tastes like it's made from a whole different variety of olives, leaving it with a pronounced sharper, greener flavor with a bit of a bite.  It's very distinct, and totally overpowers my cooking.  The non-organic Zoe EVOO doesn't do this; it blends in perfectly as a marinade, for dipping bread, drizzling as a final touch on cooked dishes, etc.  So, unfortunately, in this case, go with the non-organic, which I have on Subscribe & Save reorder, and is a pantry staple in our house. Regular Non-Organic Zoe EVOO tastes better 3 2 
PROS<br />-great to start as finger foods (easier than cheerios to pick up and eat)<br />-dissolves quickly (less of a choking hazard)<br />-baby loves them!<br /><br />CONS<br />-stains!  As the baby drools on his hands or loses a half-eaten puff, it leaves a bright orange stain on clothing, rugs, etc.  Not easy to get out, and a lot of the other flavors are more neutral colored and do not stain as much as the sweet potato.  The last thing I want to do is have to wash his highchair cover and straps, rugs, clothes, etc because of bright orange stains all around.<br />-cheaper versions available (ie, at Target they have their own brands)<br />-does have sugar (I wish they can make a low or non-sugar version, because I'm pretty sure the baby will still eat them.  Why add unnecessary sugar into everything?)<br /><br />I started with the Gerber sweet potato, but I'll be sticking to the Target blueberry (because it's cheaper and doesn't stain) good, but there are alternatives 2 4 
I was really looking forward to having this little snack arrive.  However, when I tried it for the first time, I tasted an unexpected flavor.  After trying it a few times and then disecting it, I realized that there were raisins in it.  Unfortunately, no one in my family likes raisins.  After checking the list of ingredients on the website and the product package, there is no mention of raisins. Putting all of that aside, I think this product would be tasty to those of you who like raisins.  I must warn you that I think the presence of the raisins make this Pecan Honey Crunch more like Pecan Honey Chewy.<br /><br />Amazon's cutomer service was quick to respond and helped me fix the problem.  Thanks, Amazon! I wasn't expecting raisins in the product 2 1 
I was disappointed in this product.  Too vinegary.  I was expecting fresh asparagus stored in water.  Gave all of these away as we didnt care for the taste. White asparagus 1 2 
My dogs eat this product every day, and I rather other the pack of three because I have 4 dogs.  Thanks again Amazon. Dog snack 5 4 
I love Cheez-Its, and it makes sense to get multiple boxes instead of one big box because they stay fresher longer. I used to have a Subscribe-and-Save subscription to this item when it was 4 boxes, but then it dropped to 3 boxes and the price stayed the same. Now it's just not worth it to buy here. Delicious crackers, disappointing pricing 1 2 
I must be one of the unlucky ones: mine arrived pulverized!  Bubble wrap on the top only, with no second, outer box. Unlucky 3 1 
I liked the convenience of this product and the quality was very good, however, you have to be label-savvy to realize that the bowl holds two servings (although it looks like a single-serve package).  So just be prepared to multiply those calories per serving by two (unless you're sharing with a friend). But it's two servings! 4 3 
The taste is definately not my thing.  For me it started out bland and as the chill wore off it went downhill from there.  I had to force myself to finish the container.  I did not think that the listed health benefits of the drink made it any better than other drinks of the electrolyte replenishing variety on the market today.  I do like the design of the container and although I was tempted to suggest a straw would be nice it is not absolutely necessary and would just add to the landfills. Not a winner for me... 1 2 
Walker's Highlanders are my favorite purchased cookie, so it was great to find them pre-packaged into 2 biscuits. Keeps them fresh longer and limits my snacking! Nicely packaged for a serving 5 4 
My teens loved it, my husband and I did not. The younger ones liked the extra crunchy peanut taste. Of course what they liked the most was the sweetness. My son felt it had more of a honey taste than sugary and I would agree. They commented that they would like it more as a snack out of the box then in cereal. They still felt that Honey Nut Cheerios was much better tasting with less aftertaste.<br />I thought I was eating caramel corn which I can only tolerate once in a great while and in small doses.  What I was hoping for was that Kellogg's would of listened to all the latest media hype about too much sugar. They didn't. This is way too sweet. I also wish they had used almonds or walnuts in this cereal. The protein to this cereal is only 2g per 3/4 cup. My teens may purchase this on their own but I will not be. I will continue to eat plain Cheerios, adding our own nuts to get some breakfast protein. Mixed Family Review 3 4 
I just ordered this product for the first time and I was really bummed when I got it yesterday. 7 cans out of 12 were dented pretty good.  Amazon was nice and gave me a full refund. Really sucks the can were damaged i was looking forward to making some organic pumpkin pie. Damaged cans!!! 1 2 
When I bought this I was hoping it would be like peanut butter but almond flavor.  Its not close.  I suppose if you can't eat peanuts this might be an alternative but I would look at other nut butters. I did not like this 1 2 
This is an edit so I was unable to change my star rating.  At first I was happy with this canned cat food until the trouble began.  It has caused severe diarrhea in both of my cats who were eating it.  Now I'm in the process of trying to get things back on track.  As anyone who has been in this situation knows, the negative impacts of the situation affect the entire household, not just the poor cats who are suffering from it. Got Diarrhea? 4 2 
I recently went gluten free and this is one of my favorite mixes.  I used it for biscuits and pancakes and it's very good.  You can also use it for pizza dough and to make fried chicken - it's about average for that. Keep this stock on my shelf 5 4 
These are definitely not the best taste breadsticks I have ever tried. I wouldnt buy them again. Altough, we also have different tastes.... So So 3 2 
Bacon Salt isn't a terrible food additive standing alone.  To my mind, however, nothing that costs over two dollars -- I paid $5 for a little bottle -- should contain both corn syrup *and* trans fats.  (Why does a spice need fat?)  I probably shouldn't have paid for it, but I heard rave reviews and was sucked in by the prospect of making my spinach salad taste like hot, salty, fatty pork.  For the money, I can't say it's worth the price.<br /><br />Also, it's a major "caker."  Don't use it for a month, and you've got a brick of barbecue potato chip seasoning. It's all relative 2 3 
If you put a bowl of this in front of my dog, he will gobble the whole thing up - he really likes, it.  I'm not too sure that is a good thing as, for example, he usually is a self-regulated eater and eats when he is hungry vs. sitting down to what I would compare in human terms of a bowl of buttery popcorn.  I am now only giving him a small portion of this food as a "treat" every now and then and have put him back on his normal, healthier dog food. Dog Wolfs This Down and Need to Monitor the Intake 3 4 
Although my dog loved this, it was really nothing but a canine snack.  The ingredients are appalling, although there are a few  nutrients.  I compromised and gave this a 3-star rating because a) my dog really enjoyed it and b) the lack of nutrients cost this product 2 stars.<br /><br />Even so, while I am glad my dog liked this product, it is doubtful I will get it again as it does not appear to be all that nutritious.

Good stuff, take it easy if your not used to it. it improves taste of food, better breathing, better circulation, helps with arthritis a bit great stuff 5 4 
Chef Michael's Sirloin Steak dog food is candy for dogs. They, mine included, seem to snarf it up like kids love junk food.  The problem is that it IS junk food. It's filled with ingredients that should be avoided but are likely to be highly palatable to dogs and may also be appealing to their owners. Doesn't Grilled Sirloin Steak sound yummy?<br /><br />Let's start with the easy part, price. I feed my dog dry Eukanuba. To compare,  Chef Michel's costs 14 cents an ounce vs. 9.4 cents an ounce for Eukanuba. It is even more expensive considering that it contains 2% more moisture than Eukanuba.<br /><br />Now, what's the problem with the ingredients in Chef Michael's?  Here's the list of what's in it:<br /><br />Beef,  soybean meal,  soy flour,  animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), brewers rice,  soy protein concentrate,  corn gluten meal,  ground yellow corn, glycerin,  poultry by-product meal, ground wheat, animal digest, pearled barley, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, salt, grilled sirloin steak flavor, dried green beans, dried potatoes, sulfur, Vitamin E supplement, choline chloride, zinc sulfate, ferrous sulfate, added color (Red 40, Blue 2, Yellow 5, Yellow 6), niacin, wheat flour, potassium chloride, L-Lysine monohydrochloride, manganese sulfate, Vitamin A supplement, calcium pantothenate, thiamine mononitrate, copper sulfate, riboflavin supplement, Vitamin B-12 supplement, pyridoxine hydrochloride, garlic oil, Vitamin D-3 supplement, folic acid, calcium iodate, menadione sodium bisulfite complex (source of Vitamin K activity), biotin, sodium selenite.<br />Here are the questionable ingredients, in order of volume in contents:<br /><br />Soybean Meal and Soy Flour: the second and third largest ingredients in Chef Michael's. After removing most of the oil from soybeans by a solvent or mechanical extraction process, grinding the remaining flakes gives you "soybean meal." "Soy flour" is another byproduct of soybean processing. These are cheap sources of protein filler used to boost the protein content of dog foods. This type of protein does not provide the dog with as much usable protein as does fish, chicken, lamb, beef or other meats. All proteins are not equal in value to the dog.<br /><br />Animal Fat: the fourth largest ingredient, according to the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO), animal fat in dog food is obtained from the tissues of mammals and/or poultry in the commercial processes of rendering or extracting. This means ANY animals, including the "4-D animals" (dead, diseased, disabled, or dying prior to slaughter), goats, pigs, horses, rats, roadkill, animals euthanized at shelters and restaurant and supermarket refuse. This is NOT a quality ingredient.<br /><br />Brewers Rice: the fifth ingredient, is the small milled fragments of rice kernels left after milling whole rice.  Although it has calories, it has little nutritional value.<br /><br />Soy Protein Concentrate: what remains of soybeans after removing the water soluble carbohydrates from the beans.  Similar to soybean meal and flour, this is an inexpensive way to boost protein, but contains a very low quality of protein.<br /><br />Corn Gluten Meal: yet, another plant-based protein booster. Gluten is the residue remaining after corn has had most of its starchy carbohydrate washed out of it.  It has little nutritional value, and is used mainly as a filler and binder.<br /><br />Corn: an inexpensive filler with little nutritional value for the dog.<br /><br />Poultry Byproduct Meal: a dry rendered product of slaughterhouse waste made from what's left of slaughtered poultry after all the prime cuts have been removed.  This includes almost anything left after the actual meat has been removed: organs (the nourishing part), feet, beaks, undeveloped eggs -- anything except quality skeletal muscle (real meat). Although, by-product meals are meat concentrates and contain nearly 300% more protein than fresh poultry, they are less digestible than chicken meat. Also, there is absolutely no control over the quality and consistency of poultry and other meat byproducts.<br /><br />Wheat: See the comments for corn, above.<br /><br />Animal Digest: a broth made of animal by-products that is usually sprayed onto the dry kibble to improve its taste.  Although it cannot contain hair, horns, teeth, hooves and feathers, except in such trace amounts as might occur unavoidably in good factory practice, it is made of unspecified parts of unspecified animals. As with animal fat, there is no control over quality or contamination and may include "4-D animals" (dead, diseased, disabled, or dying prior to slaughter), goats, pigs, horses, rats, roadkill, animals euthanized at shelters and restaurant and supermarket refuse.<br /><br />Artificial Colorings: solely to appeal to the dog owner. These ingredients are of no nutritional value and are controversial.<br /><br />Menadione: a controversial form of vitamin K linked to liver toxicity, allergies and the abnormal break-down of red blood cells.  It is unnecessary in dog food. Candy for Dogs 1 2

This was not what I thought that I had ordered.  When I read "24 oz. Jar" I assumed that these were shelled and in a brine liquid.  These were just dried fava beans and required a lot of work to prepare.  I must say that if the dried beans were what you were looking for, they were good. "Jar" Description Fooled Me 3 2 
The pops arrived when quoted and was fresh.  I sealed them and refrigerated until I need them.  Good price and available when I needed them. Fresh and just as described 4 5

Well, I'll begin by saying that I was really looking forward to this product. I tried TruVia's erythritol/stevia sweetener when I ran out of the stevia sweetener that I used before and wanted to get something instead of plain sugar. I figured that I liked the mix and wanted to try this powder because I had already ordered stevia from amazon. When it got here I used it right away, and did not taste the difference. I was very conservative in adding this to my coffee because I didnt know how sweet it was. After adding 3 large spoonfuls into my coffee I gave up, and I usually add 1 spoonful of sugar to my cup. if you want a sugar free sweetener that you can even make at home, get stevia. I have used it from local health food stores and always ended up with that funny aftertaste from stevia. the one I ordered from amazon, sweetleaf vanilla creme didnt have that aftertaste, and I used 12 drops in my coffee looking for it, typically I only use 4 drops in my coffee. What is this again?? 1 3 
when i recieve this item, the jub was split down the middle and ketchup was all over inside the package it came it. package was damaged 2 3 
This soup is very very sweet.  They left out the salt but it is full of sugar.  There is 14 grams of sugar per serving with two servings in a can.  Too sweet for me.  Also there is dairy butter in it so it is not vegan or for someone with dairy allergies. Not a vegan soup 1 2 
I tried 'em, I liked 'em.  I'm not normally a big consumer of cookies or similar products, but these are most definitely worth a try.  They are a curious cross between a graham cracker, both in taste and texture, and an oatmeal-raisin cookie, but with figs instead of raisins.  The result is decidedly yummy.  They're kind of on the dry and brittle side, so you'll want to munch these with a glass of milk close at hand.  Not a whole lot of nutritional content, but not particularly bad for you, either.<br /><br />My only problem with them is that the fig bits are more than a little annoying.  They tend to be excessively firm and chewy in that "stick to your teeth like hard candy" kind of way, and in one instance I bit into what felt like a piece of pit.  I shrugged that off and kept munching away with great delight.  I vacillated between three and four stars, but opted for three due to the figgy mischief already described. A tasty snack, with one small caveat. 3 4 
I like the fact that this product is all organic and tastes OK but is very salty.  If you use this product, you pretty much can't add anymore salt to your dish.  I prefer the taste of Seitenbacher's vegetable broth powder over this - it has more flavor and is far less salty.  Don't get me wrong, this is a fine product but if you want more flavor, less salt, go for Seitenbacher (I wrote a more in depth review on that product's page). Tastes OK but... 4 3 
It is fascinating to watch these tea bulbs open.... bloom. Has a nice fragrance and delicate taste. One bulb makes a pot of 6 cups.<br />More exciting brewed in a clear glass teapot with candle underneath to light-up the tea at night! Mmmmmmmmm Calming Love this gentle tasting blooming/flowering tea. 4 5 
I like sticky rice and couldn't find it in local stores. This rice is nothing like the sticky rice in the restaurants. It's very small rice that is so sticky it clumps together in blobs.  It literally bonds to the utensils and dinnerware and is difficult to wash off.  Big Disappointment, will not buy it again. Sweet Rice 3 1 
Use this powdered peanut butter in smoothies.  Easy way to use for this purpose.  No messy clean up.  Saw the Hungry Girl use it and decided to give it a try. Easy to Use 4 5 
This just did not smell or taste like real olive oil.  And the smoke point was lower than it should have been.  Perhaps it was a bad batch, diluted with some other oil, but I'll never use it again. Bad bottle or bad product? 2 1 
There is something in the jelly which makes it harden to the point it can't be spread on toast, just won't come off the knife. Welch Jelly Assortment 1 3 
I rescued my dog a year ago. Ever since then, I've been feeding him Newman's. I like that the main ingredient is a form of meat and there isn't a lot of grain type of ingredients. All of the ingredients are organic, so it's really good for my dog. I've tried several other brands with my dog. But I don't think he's really allergic to anything or has a distaste for anything in particular. And since this is one of the cheaper brands out there that is still nutritious, I decided to stick to this brand. Ordering it on Amazon is very convenient because I can use the Subscribe & Save feature and set the schedule of when I want the dog food delivered. I never have to worry about running out of dog food! Great dog food! 5 2 
Came quickly and good value for the price. Product was fresh and of decent quality, I would  order this again. Good price. 5 4 
Tasted good. Spicy. Those that don't like spicy should stay away from this. For the price paid, very good buy. Yummy! 5 4 
Hi, coffee doesn't smell or taste great. I recommend Senseo Vienna. Still have packages of "Paris" and nobody wanna drink it. Guess I just have to throw it away. smells and tastes funny 1 2 
This is based on the Donut House base coffee flavor with a supposedly chocolate donut taste. The base Donut House coffee flavor is mild/smooth with a strong bitter aftertaste. It smells great while breaing, like you're in a donut shop but that's where the similarity ends.  The "chocolate donut" flavoring doesn't really come through in the coffee except that the strong bitter aftertaste becomes a strong bittersweet aftertaste.<br /><br />I tried this on both 10oz and 8oz sizes thinking the flavor was being diluted but it only made the flavors more intense... It didn't change the taste of the coffee.<br /><br />If you like the Donut House coffee flavor you might want to give this a try but if you dislike the Donut House coffee I don't think you'll find this any better. Smells great and that's about it... 3 2 
I purchase a lot of baby food in bulk through Amazon.  This is the first food that I've found that not only would my little one not eat, he literally gagged on it.  I tried it myself and found that it tastes terrible.  There's something in it I can't quite put my finger on, but it is wretched.  In an attempt to see if it was just us, I gave the remaining case to a friend of mine whose daughter is 3 weeks younger than my son.  He also said she gagged on it and wouldn't eat it.  It 20 pouches ended up in the trash.  I wouldn't recommend this unless you've purchased just one and know that your little one will eat it. Horrible taste and smell 1 2 
If you are looking for a practically "no calorie" filler to your meal, this is the product for you.  There is no flavor and the texture is kinda slimy[sp]well like flavorless jelly.  I applaud the<br />idea and I have eaten a lot of it.  I just add a lot of seasoning, vegetables, including garlic, mushrooms and<br />onions and I generally top it with shrimp and parmissan cheese.  It is shipped promptly and in good condition.  I plan to try a new variation on this product made from spinach. No flavor filler 3 4 
I love this product, and I wish it was easier to find in the stores.  For some reason, I can never find it. Our local stores will order it, but they won't call and let you know it came in.  By the time I get there, it's already all been sold.<br /><br />This is a great side dish with a piece of chicken or a green salad.  I love it with vine ripened tomatoes, but my favorite way is to substitute Del Monte brand Italian Style Stewed Tomatoes. It amps up the spicy factor by quite a lot, but it's not hot spicy, just very flavorful.  Try it this way during the winter months when decent tomatoes cannot be found. My all time fave boxed pasta dish 4 5 
This is NOT equal to doughnut shop coffee.<br />This is a STRONG coffee. Not to my likeing!!!!<br />I would NOT recommend it... fog chaser!! 1 2 
The item itself is in a squeeze pack and that does not work very well with peanut butter. The instructions say to knead the individual package before opening... whatever that means?  I did move the content of the package around before opening.  But so much of it remained in the package when I tried to use it. Effectively I got about a spoon full out of the package and could not squeeze the rest out.  So I opened the package and licked the insides to enjoy the rest.  It got quite messy.  The taste was okay, but not great, and no funny aftertaste of anything. If I tasted it in the store, I would not have purchased it.  I will eat the rest of the squeeze packs, but I have no plans to order them again or recommend them. To others that feel the need to eat this stuff, I would recommend a bottle and specifically not the squeeze pouches.  I also believe it would be too difficult for a child to use at school, even a middle school child.  With normal items such as juice/toothpaste in a squeeze pack, when you squeeze the contents move away and your fingers come very close to each other.  With peanut butter, you squeeze your fingers but the peanut butter does not move towards the top. So it just does not work well.  I wanted to love this stuff -- oh well.<br />---<br />A month later I have come back to re-rate this product.  I have about 13 packs left out of the initial 20.  I hate eating them, it makes a mess, it is hard to use, and the taste is not that great.  I will likely be throwing them out soon.  I do not recommend this product.  And I LOVE chocolate!!!!!!!!!!! Taste is okay, squeeze packaging is not recommended 1 2 
Low Sodium, Low in Cholesterol. Less empty calories than candy & can make a quick decent breakfast. I would buy them again. Great substitute for candy bars 5 4 
I have used these on fondant and on royal icing.  They have worked for me every time.  I have read a lot of reviews about the ink running out, but they haven't on me.  I have used the same package of pens and they have decorated over 100 cookies so far and they are still going!  I'll post a couple pictures of cookies I have actually detailed with this product.<br /><br />Only caution is that they can be wet, so you have to be quick and precise with your writing.  And use light pressure.  If you need to repeatedly go back over your lines, you'll have issues. Great for outlines and fine details! 4 5 
We've tried Newman's Own dog treats before, and our 26 lb. French Bulldog loves them. When I saw this new flavor (at least new to us), I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting the treat to be so big, but that was my fault for not reading the package. My dog was a bit overwhelmed by the size at first, but quickly grew to love the treat. Of course, I never sampled the product myself, but I can only assume from my dog's reaction that both the flavor and texture are good. I would definitely purchase these treats for him again. great treat, though a bit big for smaller dogs 5 4 
Nature's Recipe is now a division of that mega company Del Monte Foods.<br /><br />The Test<br /><br />The neat thing about this food is that it really does look like the photograph on the bag. It consists of smallish kibble with pieces of dried carrots and peas mixed in. When the bag was first opened the girls ate small amounts of Farm Selects unmixed and readily took to it. Since then they've been eating it mixed with their Blue food.<br /><br />I thought Evie and Piper might fuss with the dried vegetables in there, but they don't specifically target the vegetables to leave behind.<br /><br />The quality of this food is obvious to one who reads the ingredient list. Only one ingredient, that animal digest, makes me cringe a little. The girls don't mind it a bit. For goodness alone I can heartily recommend this natural food, but the price on it is relatively high. Rachel Ray's dry dog food, for example, is about half the price of Farm Stands Selects, and Buffalo Blue is about the same price. For a household like ours with three dogs, the Farm Stands Selects is too pricey  to feed the girls exclusively. We'd feel obliged to mix another good, but less expensive food with it. For those with one pet and for whom money is not an issue, I say you can't go wrong with Farm Selects. Great Ingredients 4 3 
tastes great at first.. then the after taste starts...yyuuukk. I think it is the cranberries. My friend spit it out. yuk 1 2 
This is my favorite coffee candy.<br />The quality is good and it is small and low calorie, a little bit expensive here though! Good coffee candy! 2 5 
We bought two of these machines. The first one was put into action without running the flushing cycle, so understandably it gave off the plastic taste. But you would think that after a few months, the taste would go away.<br /><br />A few months later, the second unit was bought. This time we meticulously ran it through the flushing cycle. The plastic taste was minimized, but still there. Now after about one month of usage, the coffee it makes still tastes bad.<br /><br />We use the Green Mountain Keurig cups, so I doubt it's the coffee itself. For comparison, I went out and bought McDonald's black coffee (they use Newman's Own), and added sugar and creamer myself. The McDonald's coffee tasted much better, just pure and clean.<br /><br />For another reference point, we used to have a different model of Keurig, and that machine definitely made better coffee than this one. I wouldn't say it made great coffee, but it did not impart plastic taste.<br /><br />I have since resorted to buying my own coffee whenever possible, so it's difficult for me to give this more than one star. It imparts plastic taste 1 2 
I was so looking forward to enjoy this tea and was imagining how wonderful it would be to have a cup of hot sweet ginger tea in the coming winter....unfortunately my stomach was not up to the `task'.  I have a sensitive stomach and get heartburn and acid reflux if I drink coffee or most of the over-the-counter orange juice.  I thought it's safe to drink this ginger tea but I ended up having mild heartburn every time after I drank the tea (even use just half bag of the powder).  And the same condition occurred after all three attempts, so I had to give up...  I did find out that I am ok with drinking the home-made ginger tea (three slices of ginger in boiling water and some sugar).  I would still recommend this to people with no stomach problems!! Not for super sensitive stomach 3 2 
As a confirmed chocoholic, I am always on the lookout for something chocolate that might legitimately be eaten as a breakfast food.  When I found Nature's Path Love Crunch Premium Organic Granola, Dark Chocolate and Red Berries, I thought I had reached the end of my quest.<br /><br />The granola portion of this cereal is excellent - it is flavorful and tastes good.  However, the red berries - which appear to be dried strawberries - were lacking in flavor and added little more than some color to the cereal.  I found the tiny chocolate squares to be grainy.<br /><br />This product would be excellent used as a basis for a cheesecake crust or as a layer in a dessert parfait.  It might work well as an addition in basic chocolate chip cookie dough as a substitute for oatmeal and chocolate chips.  It is a granola that allows you to use your imagination andd to enjoy it in multiple forms. More Than Just A Breakfast Cereal... 4 3 
I was dissapointed in this one. The only way to get the treats out is to tug it on the ground but the rope encourages the dog to carry it around, throw it around etc... You have to fill it up to get the treats to come out and sorry but I don't want to give my dog 2 days worth of food. Maybe I would have been better off buying the smaller one. great idea but... 3 2 
I LOVE dark chocolate so when I saw the reviews of this kind I figured I'd give it a try.  Now taste is a matter of individuality so I'll give you the difference in this Belgian Dark Chocolate by Stephen's and my usual Nestle Rich Chocolate:<br /><br />Belgian:150 calories per serving,  serving is 3Tlb mix and only 3/4 cup water or milk.<br />vs<br />Nestle: 80 calories w/water per serving, serving is 2Tlb mix and a WHOLE cup of water.<br /><br />Belgian: Total Fat 3.5g,  Sodium 240mg, Total Carbs 27g, Sugars 22g, Protein 2g<br /><br />Nestle: Total Fat 3g, Sodium 170mg, Total Carbs 15g, Sugars 12g, Protein 1g<br /><br />I first mixed the Belgian mix as directed but couldn't finish it due to the fact that it was just too sweet for me.  It IS creamy, but just too sweet.  When I use the Nestle I only use 1/2Tlb and a squirt of dark choc. syrup and I'm happy with that.  So I then mixed the Belgian as I do with the Nestle and it's ok.  I can't rave about it due to the fact that it's higher in sugars and sodium than the Nestle and if you are trying to watch those things you might want to take that into consideration.<br />To me dark chocolate shouldn't be as sweet(or sweeter) as milk chocolate, I'm sure that's why I prefer dark chocolate.  I'll even add some unsweetened chocolate powder to my mix at times.<br /><br />But as I've said it's all in your individual taste, I just wish they would have listed the Nutrient Facts along with their ingredients.<br />Not bad, just not all that great if you don't like REALLY sweet hot chocolate. Taste is individual 3 4 
Great, I bought the 6 pack of these things, not realizing how awful they taste!!  The reviews gave me the impression they'd be good, but trust me, these are nasty!!  They are not sweet enough, and have a weird after taste.  Sort of like a peanut shell aftertaste or something.  Not very pleasant.  Not a lot of chewy-ness to these either, just big pieces of rice and very little chewy texture.  The berry variety of these seem to have great reviews, stick with those ones if you HAVE to try the Crispy Rice Bars!!!! YUCK! Do NOT buy this flavor!!! 1 2 
Amazon.com packed this product very well and the package was not damaged during shipment.<br /><br />The Vito Coco product I ordered and received (as titled) was not as good condition.  On 4 of the 34 oz boxes, the seals were broke slightly.  All 4 with broken seals were dripping very slightly - very noticeable as I held onto them.  The slight pressure used to hold them caused the dripping out of the seal before ever removing the seal. Two of the containers was smashed on the top - both of which were 2 of the 4 with broken seals. When I opened some of the shipping packages of these products, it smelled moldy.<br /><br />The seal for the opening is flimsy and could easily be damaged. Some of the seals were far too easy to remove - not the kind of seal you want to use for this heavy weight - 34 oz product.<br /><br />I only have one other coconut water to compare this product to, and that is the brand O.N.E.  Compared to O.N.E., the taste of this product was off - a taste of decay or mold. Some tasted moldier than others. I drank them all anyway (with no apparent ill affects), except for 3 of the 4 in which the seals were broken.  3 of the 4 with broken seals, I poured down the drain.<br /><br />The price of the 34 oz 6 pack product of Vita Coco is excellent in comparison to other coconut water brands on the market, but is it worth it?  Not to me.  I will not be buying this product again unless they improve IF the price remains the same. Vita Coco 100% Pure Coconut Water, 34 oz  Boxes pack of 6 2 3 
Cotechino is a staple on italian dinner tables, especially on or around New Year's Day when it's traditionally served with lentils. Parmacotto is a popular brand in Italy and the cotechino did not disappoint, but the price ($25.00 plus $7.99) was ridiculously high -- the typical cotechino sold in Italy is usually at least twice as big as this one.<br /><br />As cotechino seems to be very hard to find in the US outside of a few metro areas with big italian communities (NY or SF), this may be your only option to try it but be aware that you'll be paying a lot of dough for a pretty small sausage. Good but overpriced 4 3 
Okay, I admit that I'm a bit of a coffee snob. Enough so that I roast my own beans and grind them fresh before each cup and I look down a bit on Starbucks and Peet's. Still, just like I believe wine in a bag or box could be good if you actually use good wine - better, maybe, depending on the wine and what you intend to use it for - I also believe that using good beans and processing them properly you could, maybe, get an excellent cup of coffee in a can.<br /><br />Normally I wouldn't be trying coffee in a can simply because it usually seems to have milk in it and I don't consume any dairy, but this illy issimo contains just coffee, sugar, potassium bicarbonate, and potassium citrate. I'm not sure what the last two ingredients are for, but wikipedia says they both impart a slightly salty taste and are used to regulate ph...so maybe it's either of those or both. The can says "100% natural arabica". Not sure what the "natural" part is supposed to mean - maybe it's just a way to sneak "natural" onto the label - it's a term that's not really regulated so it's slapped on a lot of stuff without really meaning anything. Not too impressed with the "arabica" part...75% of all coffee produced is arabica and some of it is pretty nasty dross. Still, illy is supposed to have a good reputation, so despite the meaningless hype on the can I have tentative high hopes for it.<br /><br />These cans are kind of small, closer to a Red Bull than your traditional can of soda. I put my can in the fridge to chill it, then opened it and took a sip. Well, blech...I did not like that at all, but then I normally don't like coffee and sugar without any (non-dairy) milk, so not really a surprise. I put four ice cubes in a glass and then the coffee and it filled my glass most of the way. The rest of the glass I filled with one of my two favorite soy milks, Sunrich Naturals (which is the one they use at Blue Bottle) gave a little stir and sipped again. This time, it actually tasted good! Good enough to drink the entire thing, even though really I'd had my coffee for the day. Oh yeah, and better than an iced latte from Peet's or Starbucks!<br /><br />Would I drink this again? Yes, actually I would. The main thing stopping me would be that I'd only want to drink it if I had access to a glass with ice and some soy (or other non-dairy) milk, which certainly could happen but if I'm at home I might just as well roast and grind my own beans and if I'm not at home all of a sudden the whole ice/glass/soymilk thing requires some pre-planning. They should make illy issimo canned coffee drinks with soymilk right in the can...then I bet I could think of lots of reasons to keep a case of it on hand. it's coffee. in a can. it's illy issimo. 3 4 
My dogs like these.  The only drawback is that the bite sized morsels tend to disintegrate, leaving you with about 1/3 bag of crumbs.  You can give the crumbs to the dogs, but its kind of a pain. Dogs like. 3 4 
I like to make hot cocoa from scratch using Hershey's cocoa, milk and 2 tablespoons of sugar (sometimes with a pinch of salt and vanilla). But I was falling asleep about 15 to 20 minutes after drinking the cocoa, regardless of how much sleep I had the night before.  I had this problem years ago when I used to eat cereal for breakfast, switched to eggs or other non sugary breakfasts. I'm not a diabetic, but sugar sometimes makes me sleepy. As an experiment I bought this Agave Nectar and used it to sweeten my hot cocoa every night for the past week or so. I have not fallen asleep once. So, based on my results, it would seem that this is indeed low glycemic and does not trigger an insulin surge. I'll use it to sweeten Oatmeal from now on. I also used it to sweeten a Latte today and it was great. In the past I've used a small amount mixed with an once of filtered water, 100% Agave Tequila, and fresh squeezed Lime Juice to make an excellent Margarita (without Triple Sec, which is garbage).

I bought this tea because I loved Numi's Chocolate Puerh tea in teabag form. Having tried it loose I think I'd recommend getting it in bags unless you are considering making this one of your staple teas.<br /><br />The tea settles in shipping so it's hard to get a proper mix of ingredients when you are brewing a cup. I really enjoy this tea... when I can get the right ratio of leaves and spices. I'd stick with the bags... 3 4 
I've made other Bear Creek soups and liked them. The chicken noodle was on special at a local grocer, so I tried it.  It tasted fine. Although 'chicken' is listed in the ingredients, there is no discernible meat in the mix. Misleading ingredients 3 2 
After black licorice Turkish Delight is my favorite candy. Unfortunately, this batch I bought arrived stale, very tough. The flavor was good otherwise, so if you can get some that is fresher they would be good. Too bad there is no way to tell that before you order them. So, I won't be buying this product again.
