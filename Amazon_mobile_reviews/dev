The product itself is good however the companion app that runs with it is not up to par. The companion app continues to crash and keeps wanting to update after running updates the companion app then continues to crash more conductivity between the device and my smart phone is non-existent. The device in and of itself is very nice and functions very well however the device is practically useless to me without the necessary companion app. 2
The Phone is beautiful, unfortunately I got a defective unit with dark shadows at the upper end of screen that can be clearly seen when the screen is light,( it is a manufacturer's issue not Deal fisher, their service was excellent and I would buy from them any time).I will be returning the unit for a refund or exchange. 2
This phone is part of a 5-Way "$300 Phablet Showdown" which includes the following devices:6.4" Sony Xperia Z Ultra $2996.0" Sony T2 Ultra $2995.7" LG G Vista $3095.7" ZTE ZMax $2526.0" BLU Studio 6 LTE $279and the winner is....NOT the BLU Studio 6 LTE!!! (NOT BY A LONGSHOT)Sorry, BLU! In My Opinion, this is another wasted opportunity to show that your company CAN be relevant.It's not all bad, but it's not good enough, either!PROS:- The 6" 1080x1920 screenIt is BIG It has a VERY Sharp picture with deep colors, and it's just plain BEAUTIFUL!- The build quality is as good as ANY phone on the market.With its anti-slip back and rounded corners, this phone just fits my hand, and feels good. The buttons are well placed and they have a great feel, even through the TPU rubber case. With the capacitive buttons below the screen, it allows the usable area of the screen to be just that much bigger. Some people don't like the capacitive buttons, but I prefer them.-16 GB of on board storageExcellent storage for a mid-range phone.- It can use an SD Card up to 64GB...compared to 32 GB for many others in this segment.- Apps can be moved to the SD card to further expand storage.Not all manufacturers get this! Sony phones require a software update to make this work, and the ZTE doesn't get it at all. LG gets it, right out the box.-The Camera takes OK pictures and is responsive...although it's a little difficult to use.So it doesn't have the wiz-bang features of the Sony, but the picture quality produced by this 13MP is MUCH better than the 13MP on Sony T2 Ultra. It far outweighs the 8MP offerings on the other 3 phones in this test, as well.- It has an impressive Antutu Benchmark score of approx. 19000.Higher speed processor and 2GB of Ram help this phone rule the Benchmark score. Only the Z Ultra with it's REALLY fast processor and 2GB Ram scored better.- The screen covers an impressive 73% of the surface area of the phone. This is on par with the best of 2014!- In the Box Accessories!Just like the high end units available today, this phone comes with a wired headset. And, exclusive to BLU, the box also contains a TPU Rubber case, and 2 Screen protectors are included, in the box! (at least $30 value, based on Amazon prices) Some would argue that BLU has to do this because you can't buy aftermarket cases and screen protectors for their phones! This may be true, at least for a while after launch (and this phone is BRAND NEW as of December 8th, I believe!!). Historically, though, BLU phones don't get a lot of attention from aftermarket accessory companies. To be fair, the LG G Vista and the ZTE Zmax will probably never get a lot of aftermarket accessories as well.CONS:-It doesn't operate very smoothly!Paging from one homescreen to another should be a lot more fluid. Pulling down the notifications shouldn't feel 'notchy'. Apps should open more smoothly.... and THEY DO, when you use any of a number of Launchers available on the Play Store. (I had my best results with the Nova Launcher- paid edition for $4.99., but the free version was ok, too.) This tells me that a software update may fix this phone's biggest downside, and and it appears that BLU has made provisions for that with the "Wireless Update" link under the "About Device" menu in "Settings" (I could be wrong, but I don't remember the BLU Studio 6.0 HD having a similar update link.).-Bluetooth v.3.0The specs for this phone are hard to find, but when you do find them, they show that it only supports Blutooth v 3.0! That means it won't work with smart watches and most fitness trackers! Low-energy Blutooth v4.0 has been out for a very long time. The BLU Studio 6.0 HD even had BT4.0! I hope this is simply a mistake in the marketing material. If not, this is a tragedy!-It doesn't have very many LTE Radios.It does have the right radios (BAND4 on 1700/2100AWS) for T-Mobile, but it doesn't have the right radios (BAND17 on 700MHz) for Tmobile's upcoming high speed LTE. It also, doesn't have the correct radios for LTE service in most other countries, or on At&t in the US! Not cool BLU. (again, I hope that these stats are mis-quoted but I don't think they are.)-NO aftermarket development community, that I could find.ROOT and ROMS may never be developed for this phone.- Aftermarket accessories may not ever be made for this phone.It would look REALLY sexy in a Terrapin, Ultra Slim Flip Case, like the one available for the Xperia Z Ultra! Will they ever make one that fits this phone? Probably not.- The specs don't indicate Gorilla Glass!Other BLU phones do have it, so if this is their Flagship, I expect it here... BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE IT!- Finally, BLU Tech Support is hard to get in touch with, both on the phone and via email, and THEY DON'T RESPOND TO EMAIL within their 2 day promise!I have asked tech support for info about upcoming fixes and spec clarification (BT3.0???), but BLU has yet to respond.With all these shortcomings, this phone offers a good value in the Sub $300 Phablet Arena, BUT IT's FAR FROM THE BEST VALUE!!! Avoid the frustation and anxiety you get wishing this phone was better, and hoping for fix from BLU that will probably never come!BUY Last year's flagship on Amazon without a warranty. YOU WILL BE GLAD YOU DID!!! 3
Only rating it 5 stars so you can see this thing is junk! Don't waste your money the screen came all kind of messed up. Couldn't see anything on it!!! 5
I ordered this phone expecting a 5s. Imagine my shock when I opened the box to find a 5 in there. The phone is in good condition, but WAS NOT AS LISTED! 1
The phone is NOT unlocked, locked with AT&T and will not work with any other service provider. 1
I got this phone to replace a cheap Tracfone I picked up at Walmart after I fired my Cellphone company.I just liked how easy it was to switch to Tracfone and shop for plans later so that is what I am doing.I did shop around a bit before I bought this phone and really liked the HTC 530. But to get an HTCphone with the same specs is double the price. Not even kidding.Pros:Stylish all black with a simple styleSleek lookLight although just a tad heavier then the HTC 530 IMOSmooth feelFits in my hand I actually ended up liking the feel more than the HTCScreen brightness is very adjustable it will not disappoint youDual sim card slots if that's your thing. I will probably use it in the futureWas unlocked my Tracfone sim worked flawlessly with itCons:First thing I did was pop the sim card out of my Tracfone and into this.I could not for the life of me get it into the first slot so the sim card going intosim 1 was tricky but it works just fine in the sim 2 slot. I was slightlyconfused because I thought maybe there were different international kindsor something. That wasn't the case and later I figured it must just be anoddly shaped sim so I did get it into both slots in the end.Battery life is not as expected. I guess if you kept it in standby it wouldlast for approx 5 or 6 days? I have both Wifi and Bluetooth on thoughand that starts to drain it maybe 3 or 4 days on standby thenbest guess anyhow.Edit: I have to edit this review after a lot of experimentation and use of the phone.I am happy with the phone itself but I want to warn anyone planning on using thiswith no contract providers inside the USA. You cannot go to Walmart or somewhereand buy a SIM to add this phone to a no contract play. At least not most of them.I have already bought and attempted to return two plans to Walmart with no success.After you purchase a prepaid card they are not refundable by Walmart even thoughfor Total Wireless or Tracfone it clearly states it works with unbranded phones.Not the case here. Unless you can activate the SIM in another phone it will notlet you activate it with this phone. Beware Tracfone and Total Wireless are nowusing bait and switch tactics to steal your money. I suspect you wouldrun into similar problems with other prepaid services.So to sum it all up I would not purchase this phone again and its not because ofits mechanical ability because it works well, but because US cellphone companiesrefuse to accommodate it. 3
because the iphone is fiddled,,, and has many damaging and this product is not fit for the work he cheatDishonest seller and I have sold my iPhone 4 32 GB and has many malfunction in the device like Sbakr and headsets and order 1
arrived on time, had a bit of an issue activating it since the box it came in had a t mobile serial code. No cosmetic issues or anything otherwise. 5
Phone accessories doesn't work and the doest last over 3 weeks 1
Fake. Chinese knockoff. Not a real IPhone 1
Phone is good but they could do better with the charger. 4
In box, there is no USB cable, The other is OK. Worked perfectly for me. NO CONTRACT + Unlocked is good. 3
The phone is keeping charge, but whenever my phone rings it is difficult to answer. I cannot answer the phone 3
beware, it says new and unlocked, but when I turned on, Cincinnati Bell logo came up on the screen. So it is a branded phone. 3
Update, October, 3rd 2015... I love the phone but the battery life is probably the worst of all smart phones I ever had-doesn't last a day with nothing but wifi on and reading on kindle apps.The zen UI grew on me and can't wait to get 5.1 LP...Camera is even better with software updates...SPEAKERS ARE BAAAAD-a lot of buzzing and crackling noise !Really good for the money with a few flaws!Amazing specs"ON PAPER" for what I paid for, a black, 2GB RAM/16 GB internal storage used very good condition Amazon warehouse deal($194).I really like the phone so farPros:Fast, responsive with big decent 5.5" display, Lollipop experience, dual sim.. you get a lot for your money.Cons:Battery is below Par and leaves a lot to be desired, Display is quite dim and there's not much you can do to make it better other than vivid mode andCamera is average with a mediocre sensor, A LOT of bloatware is another annoying thing to live with unless you want to root the device which you can.Speakers and Battery are BIG MINUS! 2
Had to get camera fixed when it come in. Phone works good. Won't buy another from them. 1
It Worked fine for like two weeks and then it stopped working I had to go to the Apple Store to get a replacement because lucky it had warranty 1
Wasn't unlocked so had to return it. The product is still great though 3
Overall a nice little phone though the antennae seems a little week to me. I was up in the mountains near my home and my sons cheap go phone had better reception. Both phones are AT&T... 4
We are returning this product immediately - a very sad and sorry excuse for a "respectible product iPhone."We want our money back - a full refund. 1
i use a micro sim and it does fir well the phone is made for standard sim size. but is a nice phone. good quality and good features. 3
I have one and my son had to have one. I have been supporting Apple since 1983 and they now have all #1 products. The nice thing about this is you have lots of options with AT&T. We use the pay as you go plan, no 3g and we get online at hot spots which are everywhere these days. No need to spend that extra cash if you don't need to. The 4 still is new enough to get all of the upgrades from Apple too. All that I can say is that it is a great phone or as I sometimes call it my mini ipad. I use it more than I use my computer these days. I will make one recommendation, if you buy one, get "The Otter Box case" as it will save your phone from lots of damage and breakage.Apple iPhone 4 16GB (Black) - AT&TAfter 3 weeks the camera stopped working and music would go on and off and loose calls left and rightI am sending it back 5
DONT BUY IT keep you time "Refurbished NEW " UFFF yea people rigth about the battery only 1 hour hold battery 100% to 0 WATH what is tha No good for the price 200$ Naaa is used scratch dent dirty Naaa Of course I return 1
janky... not worth it buy the real thing 2
The phone was in great condition but locked to sprint and impossible to unlock the carrier which is disappointing. 4
great for for the price 3
Awasome as I need work worldwide 4
Great phone, great price. I shopped around for a budget-priced phone with up to date specs. I spent days on this, and decided on this phone because it was $100 less than I was willing to spend but it still had everything I needed. My only concern at purchase was I thought battery life would be an issue coming off a phone with a 5000 MaH battery I had with the BLU Studio Energy 2. What I do is go into settings and turn on battery saver immediately after taking the phone off the charger. That way I get about 18 hours of fairly active use, calling, texting, streaming video, listening to audio. Then I put on charger and am ready for the next day. It has a 2950 MaH battery but lasts more like a 4000 MaH one on battery saver mode. Phone is super fast with octa-core processor, even running on battery saver - I can't really tell the difference in performance, but it's limiting the background processes that drain the juice out of most phones. Phone ships with Android 5.1, but it quickly upgrades to the newer Android Marshmallow 6.0 software upon initial bootup. Also, phone has an 8MP selfie camera, 5MP is standard on many phones which is ice. The front camera is decent at 13MP, on par with a Samsung S6. Nice display and beautiful video. At 5.5" it's the right size and the build quality is impressive. Good sound from the JBL twin speakers, you can actually hear. Call quality seems to be good (I'm on Cricket), and the speakerphone comes in loud and clear. It even comes with NFC built-in if that's important to you. Overall, it's a 5-star phone at a 3-star price point and it has my highest recommendation. 5
Lower Speaker stop working two days after I got it 2
This phone freeze alot, I can be on different apps and it cuts off. 3
Lighter than the previous model (iPhone 4S) apple again innovates with this new model.Faster, better screen touch and with the brand new connector without loosing the original speed. 5
After much hesitation regarding purchasing anything electronic on the Internet, I decided to take a shot. Glad I did. This product came exactly as described and worked perfectly. Had to change it from Chineese to English but that's all. 5
Ok phone but won't work with Cricket wireless 3
Good night I write you because Lenovos buy two phones A850 .As can be seen in July and after three months the phones began to fail presenting several problems, guindaban , were paid , was reteaban and could never communicate with vendendor , although they wrote repeatedly , nobody gave me answer or solution to the problem .For this reason the phone never served and lost my dollars.I really think a lack of respect.Waiting for your good offices ..Hoping that the company amazon take action.since Mr. YOMIKOO , I never gave me a solution ...Eulises carefully Peña 1
Goog value for mony, great support from the seller 2
The device received was new, however the track pad was found to work intermittently and then failed completely. Device was returned as defective. Otherwise, it worked as advertise. 2
best Phone for the price 5
The phone started to run very lagging after 6 months of usage >_<* 2
was not a new phone, did not work, was a waste of my time sent it back and bought phone straight from apple. 1
Purchases a used iPhone and that's what it got. Looks used with scratches on screen. I put an Otter box on it for protection but it also works to cover used look. Phone works great. Good phone for kids. 4
without earphone, but phone is OK 3
I love the cellphone but it has T-Mobile written on it . I dont Know if it is new or not. 2
Lets face it the last few versions of the big name smart phones just added bells and whistles to get you to spend a ridonculous amount of money on basically old news. This is a basic 4g smart phone for a good price. Coming from a Samsung galaxy S3 it handles all my apps just as well. the downside is it is a little big and I had 2 issues with the software update because it doesn't like to install from your previous back up versions, so I had to start from scratch which really isn't that hard but it took a minute to figure out because their customer service kinda blows too hence the 3 stars. Either way for the price it does all the things and if you don't need the shiniest newest thing to take your pulse and watch tv in high def because you actually have a life, it's a good phone. 3
As of November 2015 this phones memory is just about full. 16 GB is simply NOT enough space....and I'm not a big "apps" person, but I do like to save my pictures. Otherwise I have no complaints. 4
thought I posted the review before. but I love it. 5
Love the phone no problems 5
So far there has been no problem with it what so ever. 5
NOT A T-MOBILE IPHONE. ITS UNLOCKED! SERVICE IS POTATO AND THE PHONE IS SLOW AND LAGGY. THE SIDE BUTTONS WORK AND DONT WORK. BOUGHT 2 BOTH GAVE SAME ISSUES 1
. The phone didnt work. Kept shutting off while in apps. It wouldn't turn back on unless hooked up to the charger. Sent it back this morning. 1
The display is actually quite impressive even for a 200 dollar phone. Change it to Vivid settings and i kid you not looked amoled (which i prefer) But that was the only good thing. This phone is thick. no joke and heavy. with no apps running and eveything completely closed my RAM was running ar 2.3 gb our of 3. Do ANYTHING for more than 5 minutes and its boiling hot. Did i have a lemon maybe but between the size, heat and a horrendous camera. if its not perfect lighting it will look like a flip phone picture. I would not buy this phone. lose a gig of RAM and get the Honor 5X. its what i did. 2
Apple iPhone 4 16GB (Black) - VerizonI feel really stupid. I should have read all the reviews about Wireovia. Like so many others the home button is locked and the only way I can move from app to app is to turn the phone off and on. I am surprised that Amazon is still allowing them to sell on their site. 1
Came like it was described and fats and free shipping no complaints. 5
It was on the black list. I found that disrespectfull. 1
I bought this phone "new" only to find out it is not. The battery percentage was going crazy so I took it into the apple store, only to find that it had been used for the last year and a half and the battery was failing because of it. Also, the software did not pass the apple test when I took it in. So if you want a failing phone with bad software this is the right place for you! 1
It's not 4G, we bought 3 of the same phones in different colors for the kids. One is 4G and the other two are 3G. 2
It's better to text on than what I had 4
Incredibly disappointed and angry. Bought phone for son (his first) who was very excited to get. Took to Sprint store to get added to plan only to find out phone is reported as stolen. In process of return which I hope goes better than the purchase itself. Yet to be determined. 1
I just received the phone in new condition, but cannot get it to charge. the red light comes on when you plug it in but goes out after about one minute. Doing the same thing everytime I try. Seems like the battery is not good - so I have not been able to see it working. I will buy a new battery and see if it works. I like the phone, if I can get it to turn on. Dissapointed. 2
It looked good, but the battery is shot and it won't charge very fast. Now we are stuck. That was all her Christmas money. Don't buy used! Or refurbished...it took an hour and a half in the Sprint store to get all the updates loaded. 2
this phone was a replacement for my niece, hers broke down. The shipping was fast. It took her a while to get use to the windows phone, in the beginning she complain a lot. And she was right because the display isn't that big, the rim is about 1 inch and if you use to work with a full display the bottom is annoying and the speaker didn't work that well (the other side couldn't hear you clearly) I think it was a glitch of windows 8.1. But overall it a good phone for my niece because she's broke two expensive smart phone. So this one is just right price for a teenager like her. Till now this phone with stand her rudeness and carelessly. 3
My flash does not work. I receive only the cable, without battery.I don't have the legal document to requist the consert, so now what can i do? 2
im very happy with the phone works perfect battery last good. i would recommend buying this phone!! 5
Just having a bit of battery issues 4
Got the product the same day with prime. It was refurbished but no scratches. Everything was not completely erased, but works fine. 4
DID WORK IT KEEP TURNING OFF 2
lo he conectado en mi pais, Peru, y funciona sin problemas.Lo recomiendo es un buen producto y mucho mas rapido que el iphone 4s. 5
The Leap is a solid phone which offers excellent battery life and call quality. Due to the age old specs there are some occasional OS stutters, but mostly BB10 is smooth and intuitive.Pros:Awesome battery lifeGreat screen (which is new for BB)Affordable BB10Cons:No 5G wifiButtons on side of the phone feel dead (Replacing mine hoping for a better feel)No NFCIf you are looking for a cheap phone with great call quality and a nice screen this is the phone for you. 3
The longer I have it the less I use it. It's nice for reminders of my meetings and seeing weather and such. Was disappointed at the lack of apps written for this. 3
Great phone & Great condition ! 5
Nice phone just as expected 4
Haven't figured out how to make it work yet. 2
Screen stopped working after only a month. Already had to buy a new phone. Never buying another phone from Amazon 1
The pin to unlock the sim card opening was not included in the package. 3
About 3 weeks after I got it, it reset something so that every time I tried to type or use the keyboard, a voice would tell me what I was typing. It's a pain in the glutes having to turn off the volume to send a message privately. I tried contacting the manufacturer to figure out how to turn it off. The first 2 times - no response. The third time, they sent me instructions for performing a factory reset. Just to turn off a feature that turned itself on?? The "instruction manual" doesn't even acknowledge that there is a voice, so it was no help.I could have lived with this if the phone itself had worked. People I called were always telling me that I was coming in broken up and garbled and they couldn't understand what I was saying. Cell tower reception was also pretty lousy. All in all, a bad $100 lesson in cell phone quality.I now use an LG K10 and love it! 2
came in on time seems to be working fine so far 4
Plastic back is thin and brittle. Broke trying to change it. 3
Phone itself is great, but when I bought it used, it said that only the package was damaged, but I also have a nice scratch under the phone. 3
La pantalla es muy dificil de manejar y toca presionar muy duro para escribir, por lo cual se me rompió. No me gusto este celular.The screen is very difficult to handle and plays very hard pressed to write, so I broke it. I dont liked this phone. 2
When I got the phone it wouldn't charge all the time. And the. My mother took it on her vacation since she was going abroad and my plan allowed that with my phone. Well, I wouldn't charge over there or in America. I went to the Apple Store and they couldn't even get it to charge. Ended up having to get it replaced with a new iPhone. 1
WHEN I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT IT WAS BECAUSE THE ITEM MODEL WAS RCN72UW, WHICH WORKS WITH THE 3G BANDS THAT I NEED. THIS PHONE WAS BOUGHT FOR INTERNATIONAL USE SO THE MODEL OFFERED WAS SIPPOSED TO BE ALRIGHT. ONCE I TOOK THE PHONE TO VENEZUELA (THE COUNTRY WHERE THIS WAS GOING TO BE USED) I REALIZED THAT IT WAS NOT THE STYLE ON THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION. SO IT IS BEING USED AS A 2G PHONE. THE SELLER TOLD ME TO SEND IT BACK BUT IT WAS ALREADY IN VENEZUELA SO IT WOULD BE TOO EXPENSIVE TO RETURN THE PRODUCT. 2
I bought this product for my daughter as a christmas present, so it has not been open yet, though, I checked the product before I wrapped, seems to be working properly. I have had good experiences in buying products from Amazon.com. And I think it will not have any problem, thanks. 4
the phone speakers broke after a month and a half. do not buy from them. they are a 3rd party who "fixes" phones with tape to hold parts together. buying from them was the biggest mistake of my life. i thought they were posing as apple and sold me a crapy phone. THEY ARE FAKE!!!! DO NOT TRUST THEM!!!! 1
Amazing phone loaded down with crap bloatware from asus. I hve to dismiss ads in order to login to my home screen.The camera is not great but acceptable, havent taken a photo i could not use yet, just not what i am used to from better phones i have owned in past.Also, when I get Amber Alerts, they are in Mandarin (or Cantonese, I am not sure)Definitely would buy again tho for the price. 3
Everything is fine except the home button only works half the time. But the price was pretty low and it's otherwise fully functional. 3
The volume on the phone is turned completely up and it is still difficult to hear at times. I thought I was getting the iphone 5, but that was my fault. 3
NOT A NEW PHONE FROM MANUFACTURERPhone had finger prints on it upon opening. Phone info was taped to phone not on box as new apple phone. Used bluetooth to setup my phone and add all personal info and passwords phone, internet, and apps. Shut the bluetooth of to set phone sounds and learned the speakers do not work. I plugged the phone in to charge when I checked it, it was dead and found it wont charge. 1
Way to big for me. Might be better for a child.. 3
Cool. bought it as a gift for my son nana 4
ok got the phone in 3 day after ordering. i went with the shipping set up amazon pre assigned. did not pay anything extra. brand new in box sealed. it is just as advertised. t has an update available to iOS 7 upon set up if you go to settings then general and tell it look for update. it comes with iOS 6 . yes FaceTime is available. i would recommend alpha cell via amazon. i am a happy camper. have not set up with verizon yet wanted make sure it worked first. worst case its an iPod.http://www.verizonwireless.com/support/how-to-activate-apple-iphone-4/including activation set up from Verizon. not easy to find. must do this before attempting to make Verizon account. make sure everything you do is on the prepaid account side. last note here the 30 day prepaid account is unlimited talk text and web. the 30 dollar card gets you the whole month. I paid with 2 15 dollar cards to make the 30. 5
The description on the phone was misleading and the phone came with no charges and full of scratches. Still good but description made it sound as if it looks better. I like the phone I bought a case so the scratches are no visible and I'm using it 2
Beautiful phone but having issues with data connectivity. Hopefully issue will be resolved when I visit AT&T tomorrow . 3
The speaker isn't loud enough calls are very low and music is very low 3
Had a few more scratches than anticipated but still a great buy. 4
It works well with apps but Google maps doesn't function well at all. And it is slow with processing becomes very annoying . But for the price it pretty much gets the job done most of the time. You get what you pay for. 3
It does what it's supposed to do, however, trying to get the curved edges to lay flat and outing on a bumper after are very difficult. 4
Since I've got it has black screened and the volume doesn't work I would like a refund on this item 1
Its a great product. But I see no reason why you should buy from here. You can get 8 GB Apple iPhone 4 from apple store for much less. I removed one star as I am unsure of the quality of this phone. I broke the front touch screen accidently and while getting it repaired from apple authorized technician, he informed me that its a refurbished phone. Originally it was a black iPhone which was made white by changing the front and back panel and some other parts. So be aware! 4
The article said 5s this is not a 5s it's just a 5. Disappointed, but it's still a working phone. It also was not in excellent condition like the article said. 3
The phone works fine with my T-mobile sim card and looks new. However it is quite slow (and I'm not sure if I've just grown used to the speed of the newer versions) and sometimes the screen freezes. 3
Works good for the price. I am satisfied with the camera and screen quality. It has its problems-- the GPS crashes the phone, there is often a buzzing interference when using speaker and the battery life is not great. All in all for the price it is worth it. 3
This phone claims to be unlocked. DO NOT BELIEVE IT. THIS PHONE IS NOT UNLOCKED. I inserted my Verizon sim card and it wold not work. I went online for assistance to switch the lines and they could not figure it out. I called Verizon and they could not figure it out and finally took it to a Verizon store where they told me it was not Verizon compatible. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. 1
Received the phone quickly. Everything worked very well except screen has a rattle noise when phone vibrates possibly from loose screen when refurbished. But works perfectly and not a big deal. 4
Awasome as I need work worldwide 4
The phone came in, and I thought it was okay, but the phone turns off randomly and doesn't turn back on until I plug it in, even if it has charge. I have contacted the seller, and have to wait two business days to hear back. 2
I thought the seller would send a new phone.....but it was used....after all...it worked good! 3
The item is very good. It exceeded my expectation. 4
Love my new IPhone and it was a great price there was a small issue with the phone and the seller didn't have a replacement in my color. 5
Flashlight died on me pretty quick so that kind of stunk, but other than that it was fantastic. 4
Is not and geniune Iphone and don't read the Sim card 1
this is not new used scrtch ,bad box 2
The phone would not get service. I purchased 3 phone s on amazon. Only one was not hacked. I will not buy another phone on amazon. 1
Signal drops alot and have a hard time hearing, volume is low but overal its a okay phone. 3
Phone didnt last mor than a month 1
Excelente producto, recomendado 100%, buena atencion por parte del vendedor, sin incovenientes, ni contratiempos, funcional al 100%, el equipo no ha tenido ningun probelma... 4
THE SELLER AND I ARE TRYING TO WORK OUT THE PROBLEMS WITH THIS PHONE. THE PHONE'S BATTERY WON'T HOLD A CHARGE TO BE A BRAND NEW PHONE. THEY ARE DOING EVERYTHING TO WORK WITH ME TO GET IT FIXED. WE BELIEVE IT'S A DEFECTIVE BATTERY FROM APPLE. 3
IT connects to the internet,but has little or no memory,you have to purchase memory card.If you take a picture it tells you memory full. 2
It works well, but some scratches exist on the back of the phone. It can also use in south Korea.(한국에서 잘 됩니다. 언락 맞음) 3
This phone gets so hot that my daughter has to hold it with a towel. 1
Short of memory, could not to up graded 2
This mobile has the very basic features that the price can buy us. It could have had more ringtones. We expected it to be like the basic Nokia mobile models. :(And the mobile keypad is so sensitive and soft that it beeps whenever a button gets pressed when we place the mobile in our pocket. BLU Tank II T193 Unlocked GSM Dual-SIM Cell Phone w/ Camera and 1900 mAh Big Battery - Unlocked Cell Phones - Retail Packaging - Black Yellow 3
I like this cell phone ! 5
Charger got ruined in 2 weeks 4
Ítem is in good condition but it comes WITH accessories from different countries and it Was not announced this way 3
The phone is OK, there have been some sound issues during calls. 3
I was nervous about buying a used iPhone online, but when I received this there wasn't a scratch on it! It looked brand new. Placed my SIM card , charged it and it works great!!! Very happy customer! 5
iPhone 5c is fanatic enjoying it. 4
Like my new little iPhone. Apple said the program was bad why I cannot log into iTunes account an get apps. 4
All is still really good! No issues 5
pristine condition, arrived on time, perfect! Love my new old Iphone 5
This was a gift for my nephew. He's loving his new phone. Much better than what he have before. 5
It was awesome and fun 4
Marvelous screen, camera, speaker sound. 5
The overall physical look and feel of the phone is great, screen resolution, buttons etc. but it really lacks in performance. It had a hard time playing the simplest games and it was pretty laggy like it does not have enough muscle to support the high definition screen. I really liked the phone, it was beautiful and the size was perfect but I ended up returning the thing. I'll probably buy it again if BLU does an update on it or something that will make it perform like the way it should. 2
The phone is awesome but after i used it for a week and a half it got stuck at the boot screen i tried everything from removing the battery to factory resetting nothing happened still to this day my blu studio selfie isnt working i need a replacement 3
The phone made me sound muffled & under water. I also could not hear well and had to use speaker phone. 1
it can't unlock,but the phone is great good.12 more words required. Apple iPhone 4S 16GB (Black) - Verizon How do you rate this product? 4
I love this phone. I like it better than my old iPhone. Much thinner and once you learn Android system, easier to use. A great buy! 5
Well when i got it it looked new and it hasnt fail on me at all 4
The headphone hole doesn't work. 1
I bought this to use overseas. I did not know if they would really work, but it does pick up a signal on the networks here on both SIMS. That part is ok. The battery is typical for this size and cost of phone. The bad part is that the phone is inexpensive and it really does feel and respond that way. The main problem is that the touch screen is very hard to press. One has to be very intentional what you are pressing and apply direct pressure. This phone cannot be used with one hand because of this. The second major problem is that the screen digitizer is not configured and aligned properly. One has to press slightly below the character you want to actually pick what you are intending. If it were not for these two MAJOR problems this phone would be a steal. Right now it is just a hassle to use. 2
Using for a digital music device in my car. Great idea and no complaints about the product itself. It works fine. However, the way the seller packaged it (with no wrapping between device and inside of envelope), I had to clean a lot of sticky adhesive from the envelope out of the headphone jack before I could use it. 4
I love this iphone. It shipped to my home in a reasonable amount of time and was truly in great working condition. 5
Phone worked perfectly with minimal scratches. Very Satisfied. 4
It's a good product but it doesn't last 2
It started off ok, but now it locks up. Maybe a drop of water got in the USB port (right side), but the button is now locked out within minutes of starting. Pretty much a writeoff. 2
Nice phone and great customer service!!! 5
EXCELLENT PHONE and a quality built phone. Having an Apple 4s I wanted another Apple so I chose this one. I'm glad I did! We love it.HOWEVER, please be advised that any phone that is listed as new MUST arrive in original box and factory sealed from Apple. If the white Apple box arrives without the factory seal, it's considered used not new.....just a heads up to future buyers. 4
I got this phone for my grandaughter for Christmas. She loves it! 5
I gave this phone to my wife as a present and she loves it - works excellent! 5
I don't think I've ever received and decided to return a product so quickly.I'm a biker who just upgraded to a phablet, which is cumbersome beyond reason to carry on the bike. An mp3 watch seems like the perfect solution (yes, an mp3 player might be simpler. However I don't always have pockets, I hate arm bands, and I hate clipping things to my clothing. I know, first world problems). An option for communicating in case of emergencies might also be nice, so an mp3 watch it is. So all I'm really looking for is an mp3 player that's easy to wear, with a time function and possibly texting in a pinch, not a device to be my new best friend.I first tried a GT08, which seemed to work nicely but it bothered me when I noticed I had paid twice as much as I should have (the problem with these Chinese knock-offs is the same product is available from different sellers at vastly different price points). Plus I really disliked the "nucleus" menu style, so thought I'd try a different model.There was a lot to like about the CNPGD. Right out of the box, the silver metal finish looks very high quality and the band is much nicer than the GT08, very supple and comfortable. The menus are much cleaner and easier to navigate, having only 4 rather than 8 (mostly useless) options per screen. It let me transfer all my music into the required "my music" folder (something I suspect all these watches have in common to use the music player from your SD card) via PC, much more painless than the GT08 that made me hand select each song from the watch screen individually to move (note: I had to reboot the watch for it to find them, a minor inconvenience since the boot sequence is very quick).However, the love affair ended instantly when I realized to my dismay there was no shuffle option to be found anywhere for the player. I really wish if this isn't to be a standard feature that it would be mentioned in the item description. Who wants to listen to their playlist straight through in alphabetical order? Stupidest omission on an mp3 player ever.Another maybe not so small complaint is there seems to be no way to change the truly ugly watch face -- tapping the screen (which the GT08 required) did nothing, and I couldn't find any theme settings anywhere (not like there are a ton of places to look).So the search continues. Thank goodness for Amazon's painless return process, however I'm now out $12 in return shipping fees. If my third attempt is a bust, I may have to start considering something in a much higher price range (although from what reviews I've read on a few products, that's not necessarily a guarantee of quality either). 2
If I could give zero stars I would. This phone was advertised to me as new but sold to me clearly refurbished with scratches on the back. A week after activating it the lock button became defective and it keeps going to the "slide to power off screen" every 10 seconds which practically makes the phone unusable. I called apple support and they informed me the phone was not new and was 200 days past warranty so now I'm forced to return the phone and go buy a phone from somewhere else for much less since I'm not on a contract and I refuse to pay full price for another defective phone. 1
The wifi is not work. 2
So far so good, it only arrived today as a replacement for my (very) dead Galaxy S4 mini. It took a bit longer than I'd normally expect from Amazon - the very last day of the 'delivered between' note, but still in the time they had advertised.It's a very basic smartphone with all that you need, response time can be a little slow but for what it costs; it's much better than I thought it would be. The camera's are both quite pixelated and don't expect to take any art worthy shots, but they do the job!Still working out the bits and pieces that go with a new phone, but I'm very happy with what it is for the price.Just do note - it takes a regular sized SIM card so if you currently have a micro SIM or anything you'll have to get an adapter (or construct one like I did)Pretty solid seeming little phone and should do the job :) 4
My phone was awesome,,,until I shattered it 😕!! No one could believe the price I paid for it!!! Very satisfied. Will be order tin another soon!! 5
it was a good phoen great price just didnt fit my phone company that was the only problem but great product 5
its good for the price 4
The phone they sent me was manufactured for sale in Japan (or another similar country) and thus I cannot shut off the camera shutter sound. It's very annoying. 2
I am so far neutral on the onetouch. It has a decent screen, expandable memory and a fast enough processor. All of these would have me rating the phone highly for the price it is very nice. However my phone came with a non-functioning gesture keyboard. And if that was not bad enough I attempted to call Alcatel to try and resolve the issue. First I download Alcatel support app, it has a 800 number that is non-functional (strike 1). Then I tried to call a number listed in the manual, no one is there on weekends and holidays, (strike 2). And last but not least is the question who releases a phone so that it arrives on a holiday weekend and does not have support available in any fashion what so ever. (strike 3). While I did fix the keyboard issue by downloading a free keyboard app I would like to have the original equipment/software work properly. Searching on the web found others complaining about the same issue and no help on their website. Buy at your own risk. 3
Just after the return window ended my phone ceased function! The speaker and microphone no longer work nor does the headphone jack. Very displeased! 1
I got this phone for my pre-teen kid.It worked well and held a charge for a very long time.Then she sat on it and it broke.Yeah... < $20 for the phone... but it lasted a month.Not recommended. 2
problem with the battery. Doesn`t charge properlyThe charger is a generic one and doiesn't charge properly 2
I have waited my entire life for this IPhone 5 and to-date, I never received it. I contacted the Seller 5-6 times and She responded once . I still didn't received my iPhone5. I filed a claim with Amazon and is presently waiting for my money to be credited to my account! 1
Very slow running phone. And very little storage on phone 2
Works great thank you so much 5
I didn't like the idea that the watch is having a camera 2
Good phone by the price, battery drains easily, BT has major flaws when paired with BT devices and you use WiFi or 3G/4G. This unit is kind of picky when you try to charge it with other cable or chargers so have the original one handy, this is the first time that I see a problem like this with smartphones... Performance is good, Sound profile has little problems when you try to setup personalized sounds for applications like whatsapp. The Zen UI is a plus, makes the OS more enjoyable. Camera needs a major improvement when shooting photos using the normal mode, if you use the flash when using that mode there is a 60% or more chances to get a bad picture and forces you to try another setting... 3
Love the phone and got a great price for it. Good for anyone who's looking for a nice cheap and useful smartphone for everyday use. Using for the tmobile line. works great 5
Its an okay phone, not what I expected. Not worth $63.edited 7.1.15:Phone's touch screen has stopped working and I've tried everything to fix it. No wonder the price keeps dropping. 2
Doesn't connect to ATT LTE network 2
The phone is as described and appears to be genuine apple product but the headphones appear to be knockoffs and actually one side quit working just days after use. 5
product was blocked, the serial number of the box does not match with serial number of thephone, the ear-phone was not original. The product was manufactured in 2010.The product was returned and already refunded 1
Great for the price. Have no complaints. 5
Absolutely brilliant phone..... but lots of ASUS apps replacing google apps.... for that reason, I only give 4 stars 4
This phone was bought by my father for my step-mother. My dad does lots of research before buying new phones...because he wants a cheaper phone, with decent reviews. This past weekend, my step mother had to reach out to me to ask how to display her contacts as they were not automatically joined with the transfer from her old phone. It was an easy fix, but a frustrating solution none the less. There is no Swype functionality either, so I had to download the google swype keyboard to provide that functionality for her. Other than a few other minor usability things, the phone has a nice feel to it, the apps are familiar looking and as long as you have some smart phone knowledge, the phone is fairly easy to navigate. 3
The earpiece doesn't work when on a call. I have to put it on speaker phone to hear the other side of the line. The screen seems to be falling off the front of the phone and I have to squeeze it back several times a day 2
This person selling this item is a liar .. I asked specifically if this unit is for t mobile. The sell told me yes.. I put a tmobile SIM card in this phone that was sent to me but it did not read because the Carrier was sent to sprint 1
phone works just fine, just don't drop it from any, and i mean any, height without a protective cover on it first. Dropped mine from 1 foot on to tile and the case cracked apart at the front and back seam. 3
Gave me a phone that was locked and it wasn't done being paid for . Highly upset 1
The product is refurbished, i bought one I lost my money 1
I bought this phone and after a months of using it,it died on me i took it to the Apple store to have it fix and they told that my phone was faked...meaning amazon sell fake stuff for high prices. 1
Very happy with iPhone 5s, it has met all my expectations. 4
Supposed to get the phone in 5-7 days and got it in 2! Yay!! Very beautiful phone and I'm so excited!! 😊😊 5
Tha worst buy i had did its get this Blackberry phone, the first day i had used had working good, then i had log off , the next day i had use again and i was surprissed this phone dont accepted the sim card , i dont know what happen. I had really dissapointed with this phone.I dont recommend buy this phone. 2
very nice thank u so much 5
The keyboard has small letters. 4
Exactly as promised. Pristine/Brand New condition in factory sealed box.Verizon IMEI. 5
screen will eventually pop off of the cheap plastic back. do not get it 2
The phone I needed was iphone4s GSM unlock and this phone is regular android phone they couldn't use it over seas .now i have to get another phone. 1
It is ok though linking everything to iTunes is rather limiting -updates, playing games, etc. I think the more liberal android phones are much user friendly. The Bluetooth will not link with other phone type Bluetooth. Maybe I missed something 4
Well it said it was message compatable with me LG G Vista and it's not I've tried everything 2
I admit to being one of those devoted Blackberry users who dug in my heels and wanted to keep my Blackberry. So, when my phone began to show use and malfunction, I was thrilled to find this phone for sale on Amazon! It was in perfect condition and served my purposes for a long time. Thanks for making it available. 4
Product was defective, not charging properly. Battery drains immediately even while on standby. Something that shouldn't have been sold to us. People just like to sell you anything even if they are aware of it being defective. 1
The phone is awesome. I had a 4 but I lost it. So this was a replacement. I may get my daughter the same one or the 5s if it's not too expensive. 5
Love this purchase! Thank you so much, it even came with a warranty. The phone was exactly as described and worked even with international carriers. It's probably one of the most beneficial purchases I've had on Amazon. 5
fine Blackberry Curve 3G 9300 Unlocked GSM SmartPhone with 2 MP Camera, Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth - Unlocked Phone - International Version - Graphite Grey 4
Did not come with a sim card and I didn't know the iPhone had one but the Apple Store made sure it was extremely affordable. The phone came with a usb cord as advertised but the phone said the cord isn't compadable with the phone and the cord is too short but it works. I had glitches with the phone BUT it must have been due to my kids playing with it because the sprint store fixed it. The phone I have was not mentioned to have a little discoloration but it works just like new 5
It's better than what I was expecting 5
this is used and is in great condition, came with earphone and wall charger and cord. now its the test of putting the sim (micro) {didnt check it would be a problem}in and seeing that it works great. there are very minor scratches on the side but it can be covered by a case. 5
Great experience. Product way much better than advertised and expected. I ordered a very good item and received a brand new product. Excellent seller, 200% recommended. 5
My son is disatisfied with his phone. It does not consistently work. He isn't able to text or answer calls part of the time. Not sure if it just needs a new screen. 1
The charger provided in the box was not able to charge the battery. Has to buy a new charger.Not impressed with the companies choice in chargers. 3
One of the speakers is broken from water damage, i learned cause i got it with a broken screen also and when i went to get it fixed they told me why complete waste. 1
Received the item in really good condition as advertised. I'm pleased with the purchase. 5
The phone does NOT work right, and never has. Sure, you can call out on it, and you can receive calls BUT ....no one can HEAR YOUR VOICE ... unless you switch the 'speaker phone' on! That part is not working right, and it has not since the day we received it. This was a gift for someone without a phone at all, and now she has one that only works halfway! NOT RIGHT! I've written the Seller already and now have submitted a claim via Amazon too. So far, the Seller is NOT returning emails or calls. Maybe Amazon itself will have better luck -- and if not, perhaps this store does not need to be an Amazon store at all.Let's see if they answer this, the THIRD request for replacement! A full replacement or even a full return of funds in the next 24 hours would certainly be welcome since we thought we bought a WORKING CELL phone. This one does not work right, period. we demand a replacement that works or a full refund within the next ten(10) days. 1
This phone will not turn in. After use of less than 1 month, I cannot turn my phone on. I didn't start using it until April 26. The battery was fully charged I took it off the charger and when I attempted to turn it on nothing. This is poor service. 2
I have had this phone for less than 24 hours and it reboots itself over and over. Will be returning today. 1
Phone is in great condition the vibration doesn't work though. Overall was satisfied still. 3
The phone I received was in great condition except for one small scratch in the upper corner. However, the phone was locked to the original user's Apple ID so there is no way for me to access this phone.I was satisfied with the condition but very disappointed that Amazon did not wipe the phone entirely and therefore I could not use it at all. I researched buying a phone from Amazon and thought that it would be safe. Just a word of caution that this does happen sometimes! 3
No good batey the not good 2
Was not new. It has scratches. 1
The phone is wonderful, perfect condition. No regrets whatsoever 4
Phone was fine at first, but after two weeks it was constantly shutting down. The power button got stuck down. Took the phone to Apple and they said it was toast. I was able to return this phone through Amazon though for a full refund and ended up just buying a new I-Phone 6 from my wireless provider. 1
Major cons: (not negotiable)- speaker phone function is roughly 50% of how loud it needs to be. Makes listening to music or talking to people using the speaker pointless without headphones- Bluetooth function will not even display other devices to link to. Completely inoperable Bluetooth capabilityPros:-clean screen with little scratches or dings 1
I got this phone 2 days ago and its alright, i only say that because i hate blackberrys and its my first one & i downgraded from an iPhone to this. So the contrast is hard for me. This phone is running on 4.6 and i tried everything possible to bring it up to OS 5 and i cant. It tells me its up to date ughhh, is anyone else having this issue? 3
First time buying a phone online, great phone, works well, no issues, minor scratches, no biggie, arrived quickly, happy camper, hope this helped. 5
It is an excellent phono with low cost! 5
pros.. it works fine, its easy to use, not too heavy.cons .. most of the apps are for android iphone and bb 4
Excellent mid price phone. Has met all of my expectations. The screen and two front speakers are beyond great. 5
The device doesn't work , I will be returning it . 1
Perfect! Very pleased! It was listed as like new and was indeed in new condition. The phone is working great (on Net10) and no regrets on this purchase! 5
This product was not what I was intended to buy. Does not use a chip, and when I looked at the features on the phone it was not clear to me it didn't work with a chip. Wasted my time and money. 2
I love the blu dash phone. I need a dual sim card for it and I don't know how to go about getting it for my phone. 3
Had troubles with this phone from day 1. 3
This phone would not turn on and will not charge. Unfortunately I didn't open it until after 30 days and have no recourse. I am very disappointed. 1
Anti-lose is a pain. Need to manually reconnect bluetooth. Get the newer cheaper Otium One or LeFun One. 2
The battery is extremely short lived. It will show over 50% charged and then die. I have to almost constantly have this charging. I ran into issues getting my carriers cellular network. Not worth it for the price that was paid for a refurbished phone 1
Ordered a brand new apple iphone 5s factory unlocked ., item came in an OPENED box without charger and the item doesn't look like brand new having lots of dust on it. 1
I purchased this new iphone 5c and went to Sprint to activate it. I was told by Sprint that this phone is a stolen one, and can not be activated!!!!! 1
I had to return this phone as I was buying for my parents, it did not work for them as the phone is very small in size and difficult to see what's on the screen 3
Works great!!! No problems at all. 5
The iphone was in great condition and it works fine. I have no issues or concerns regarding my purchase. 4
Delivery was great, but the phone didn't make it to the new year. Completely blacked out screen with no previous damage done. Bout to head to dinner and no screen, no way to call out, text nothing. Owned the phone apx 4months... 2
Just as promised. This a great SmartPhone. Very fast interface. Just make sure you buy it "Rooted" and google Play pre-Installed. Awesome. Can't get enough of it. 5
I am waiting reduje my money because the iPhone is very destroyed 1
ordered it and it came on time, nothing wrong with the phone. it only cost $15 for a sim card to activate your phone or switch phones (same carrier). truly decent.((my carrier is t-mobile)) 5
This cell phone had a total system failure after only 9 months. The cost to have it repaired is almost equal to the purchase price. But after taking the Iphone to the local Apple store who tried to identify the problem, we learned there is not an option for Apple to repair the phone. It turns out the phone was previously damaged & repaired by a non-Apple repair center using non-Apple approved parts. So we quickly learned all Apple warranties are voided & they will not even attempt to repair the modified phone for any price. 1
I bought this phone due to it being what i wanted without paying $500 for a phone. It says it comes with a 3100mAh battery no it dont it came with 2 2800mAh batteries. The camera is not what its supposed to be which is 8mp its only a 5mp camera. The S pen that it comes with isnt an S pen and dont even work on the phone unless u press hard. Everything about the phone is not what i assumed i was paying for. I bought 2 of these phones one for me and one for my husband and were purchesed at the same time but when the phones arrived i only got one phone and when i contacted the company they said they r sorry for the inconvenience do u still want the phone well yes i want the phone i paid for it. It comes from china so it takes anywhere from 11 to 21 days. I have been in daily contact with the company about these phones due to all the issues with the phone not being what i paid for 1
Speaker did not work. I have returned it for a refund and still haven't received my refund 1
After a month of having this phone it just stopped working completely, it wont get a charge or anything ,i got sold a defective iPhone 1
I will be honest in my review, it is a pretty nice phone the reason I gave it 3 stars, but a bit heavy. Also, the location of the sim cards and SD memory card is poor, easy to push in, but very difficult to remove (except the top top sim). You will need a needle to slowly pry them out.Second, my home screen and back space buttons on the bottom of the screen stopped working just as the Amazon 30 day return policy expired. So I contacted the seller and unfortunately they do not offer a factory warranty because they are located in China and would cost too much to ship and return.Buy at your own risk, knowing if something goes wrong after 30 days (which is possible for a $80 Chinese phone) your on your own. 3
I am rating this while using a blu phone. I have the 8xl and although it gets laggy I love it. Both screens are amazing but the energy plus is just bad in other areas. The software is odd. Trying to run a basically apple software. We kept getting glitchest from past ghost of an app and front cam was distorted. Of course we could have gotten a lemon but we didn't like the experience. 2
I like iphone great condition 5
I bought Pure XL in May 2016, everything is good until last Saturday, when I was playing games or review the FB, the phone auto shut down, I tried reset, but cannot fix the problem, I have emailed to factory two days ago and they haven't any respond to me til now. I'm so upset this is good phone but very bad customer service.... 3
Brand new no scratches got it on time the best used new phone I bought in a while if I can give it more stars I would and yes there on unlocked 5
It's a shame that the only reason I am tossing this away (or returning) is because I can't read text messages. I was hoping to be able to minimally read texts ; I wasn't expecting to be able to text back from the watch. I have an iphone 5s. 2
This phone arrived in seemingly good shape and seemed to be a great Christmas gift. However, the gift was opened Dec. 25 and by Jan. 1, we had taken it to the Apple Genius Bar at our local Apple store TWICE and, by the second time, it had died completely and could not be revived, even by the geniuses. They said it was defective and the only thing to do was replace the phone. I'm thankful for Amazon's return policy and glad I bought through amazon but the whole thing is disappointing. 1
Great phone, works perfectly. The lightning cable and the charger didn't work well though. 4
Came 2weeks later after I got the 2day shipping 1
Great phone! I would recommend it. It may not be the newest version of the iPhone but they are all the same thing in my view. I replaced my blackberry torch with this one. 5
It's a good phone for emergencies and the numbers are nice and big. Easy to use. Thank You so much 5
As described & in great condition 5
excellent everything arrived on time without inconvenienceI recommend it. thanks for product safety . from venezuela thanksbye bye 5
I brought iPhone 6 pulse from amazon it's really good for me 4
Bought this for my gf because her iPhone 5 was damage. 5
Phone worked great! Only issue was that it wouldn't charge. Something was bent small repair made and it works like a charm 3
8 g was never big enough. 1
there is some crutch on the front of the phone . but its work good and i will keep it 3
My first BB. I like it 4
I absolutely love this phone. Great performance, UI, very sleek and the dual speakers on the front produce high-quality sound for their size.Most importantly for me and also the reason I recommend this phone to everyone is the outstanding price. Priced at $250 I was able to purchase a 64gb microSD card and a quality case while remaining under my budget of $300. I know some people would prefer the smaller version (4.7"), and it has an even better pricetag at $180.Some flaws would be lack of mobile service providers (Verizon, Sprint) and the inability to access the photo gallery through the camera app, which has been a standard feature of most phones for quite some time now.For me these drawbacks don't impact the overall score of this phone. I had to switch from Verizon to t-mobile, but have had better coverage and a smaller bill as a result. I could see the camera / gallery issue being a nuisance to some people but to me it's a very minor inconvenience.Overall this phone has much to offer. For music fans it has even more to offer, including a turntables feature built-in to the music player allowing you to crossfade between your songs.Strongly consider the Alcatel OneTouch idol 3 if you're searching for a high quality no-contract phone for an exceptional price. 5
excellent iPhone exactly what i need i recommend it buying from here 5
I disliked this phone because I had to charge it everyb10 mins when I'm out I had to turn it off because it died even if I was not using it , it gets very very hot, and is beginning to crack in the back,My reason for this late return is that I was waiting for some cash to purchase another one because the refund was not instant, so I purchased another type hopefully it's working well 1
I had some problems with the battery charging and also dying way before 1%. Sent it back, battery was replaced. It still acts a little strange with the battery life at times and just connecting to charger. it doesn't connect right away. have to plug and un-plug from phone jack/wall etc. until it connects. over night, I got a line going through half of my screen. Top is normal and bottom is darker. Not sure how that happened while sleeping. I have had the phone in an Otterbox since day one. Never had any issues like this with a Iphone before. Battery charge gets worse and worse. don't recommend. 1
It's for my son he said the charger is weird itbtakes two peices and the phone is thick not slim 3
Value for money this is the best iPhone you can get!! 5
Phone did have a few scuffs on the screen and on the back but phone works fine. 4
Has been great phone for my 15 year old nieces first smart phone. 4
Gave 3 stars because it did not come with a charger or box. The battery was already half way gone. When I first turned it on I thought it was broke the screen clarity was off. I think it's not worth that much and it doesn't come with the needed accessories. No sim card as well...i could've just brought a new phone all together! 2
Fake. Chinese knockoff. Not a real IPhone 1
This phone arrived in seemingly good shape and seemed to be a great Christmas gift. However, the gift was opened Dec. 25 and by Jan. 1, we had taken it to the Apple Genius Bar at our local Apple store TWICE and, by the second time, it had died completely and could not be revived, even by the geniuses.

it doesn't have too many fonts. i'm receiving messages in Arabic and the phone doesn't recognize any . 2
This phone is seriously one of the fastest phones I've ever owned and I've used the S6, S5, Note 4, and several other "flagship" phones. Apps open amazingly fast, games play smoothly, and the Zen UI is fairly nice. So why the 3 star rating then? Because the camera is horrible. It does decent low-light photos but all other photos look like crap. If you search "ZenFone 2 camera issue" you will see multiple pages of results with people complaining. There's a chance Asus might be able to fix the issues with a patch but I couldn't wait any longer and already switched to a new phone. 3
Okay been having this phone for a year, I would give this phone 5 stars but here is the catch, I'd you buy it, it comes with the phone,headphones and charger. The bad thing is the headphones aren't the real apples headphones(fake) they don't sound good and trust me I know how they sound because I own another pair of them. The charger is fake too it's like a knock off brand but it still charges your phone, the reason I know it's fake becUse some times it tells me this accessory can not be used for this phone or something like that but I just disconnect it and connect It again. I thought what if the phone is fake, so I went to look for the serial number of the phone and then went to Apple and searched it and found it, so yeah the phone is real but everything else is fake but still works. 4
It exceeds my expectations! I love it 4
Still working on learning how to do all the things it can do. So far it does what it is supposed to do. Can't ask any more of it. 4
It is good except the microphone quality. There is a newer version vivo 5R. 3
Great buy and great communication would definitely buy again 5
Works great, clean, great condition. 5
I had the phone for about two months and all of a sudden it starts shutting off on me and won't stay on contacted the seller and got no response. Horrible service and looks like it was put together like crap 1
el equipo llego en buen estado pero el mismo día que lo comencé a usar se me apago y así mismo sucede cada vez que se recalienta y es un martirio porque todos los dias se me apaga quisiera devolverlo pero lamentablemente no tiene garantía y estoy en Venezuela que decepcion 2
I'm guessing this is one of the Japanese ones because I can't just use it on wifi without a SIM card, JUST TO SEE IF IT WORKS IN EVERY WAY!!! Can't afford a SIM card right now, I will change my review when I get a SIM and check it out. I don't even know if I got the 32 gig for that matter. 1
I bought this for my daughters birthday gift. I am having to send it back the day after her birthday. The screen backlight is jacked up. The touch screen does not work. I cannot even slide to unlock the phone because the screen won't work. Totally pissed and disappointed this is total bulls*** that i paid almost $200 just to have to return it and not to mention the sadness of my child that I am returning her birthday gift, and now have to wait to send this one back..... get credit...... order another...... wait for it to come in.....Waste of time and money. 1
The description was wrong it says for sprint service but it is not for sprint after i eecived it it is verizon i am very disappointed. 1
I don't know how well the phone works because I could not use it on verizon network. 2
The phone works ..not sure if its unlocked to work with any carrier , but its unlocked i currently have metro pcs and my sim card did not work in phone..i did not get headphones with the phone but overall the phone is in mint condition 3
Scam, the phone was barred off the network after 1 week due to "Unpaid payments in the T-Mobile payment plan", returned immediately to amazon. I'm very disappointed. 1
Refurbished phone with previous broken screen. Screen replacement was a big shoddy and had to replace after a month 3
it is a real apple phone. I was a little concerned about the authenticity of it.... On the other hand. It is a brand new phone, it works perfect. but I didn't get the color I ordered. 4
EXCELLENT SELLER RECOMMENDABLE 100 % 5
Great tool for classroom teachers. But Apple needs to address ios update issues with their cameras and flashes. My first two used iPhone 5Ss looked great but had inoperable cameras! Sellers were great and quickly refunded money. Research showed thousands of 5s users have camera issues after updating their operating system. So, I'm not updating anytime soon until this is publicly addressed by Apple. Until then, I love my current 5s. 4
I've bought this item and I received it in this conditions: the phone has the AT&T logo, the box isn't a genuine BlackBerry box (just oem), and the wall charger is not for my phone!! Could you believe that? You buy some phone and the charger doesn't work with it!! I am worried about this situation and I won't buy any other BlackBerry through Amazon.com. They do need to review their MarketPlace BlackBerry sellers. 2
This was advertised as new. Took it to Apple as the battery was depleted after 2 months. They refused to work on it because the battery was third party as were many of the buttons and inner working!! This was not as advertised at all. 1
Outstanding product ! Outstanding shipping speed!!! Thank you !! 5
Hello Amazon I just received BLU Studio 5 (cool) and I power it up and the phone is locked (not good).I need the password to get into the Phone, the screen say’s to (Type password to decrypt storage)Please advise.Sam Lopez 2
This is the worst thing ever the phone came like a glitch and nothing works right the phone also cracked very easily 1
Love it!! Looks and works great!!But after a few months the paint is chipping 3
The phone was in decent condition just some scratches but nothing that couldn't be covered up with a case. Only hardware issue it seemed to have was the Touch ID it won't scan my finger print overall definitely worth the price and arrived quickly, very pleased! 3
i think this phone does not meet the standards i was looking for in a smart phone even though i did not want to spend an arm and a leg for one. my first issue is that once you drop the phone even on a bed it turns off and restarts again. the least touch onto any hard surface and the phone restarts which is very inconvenient. 3
I bought this phone for my mom who does not require much from her phone except making calls and browsing the internet. On the making calls front, it has held up so far, but we've only had the phone for 4 months and it's already been having internet connectivity issues on and off for a month. BLU does not push Android updates out very often, so the software is outdated. It came with Android Lollipop, and it runs okay, but it's definitely buggy and requires some serious work sometimes. My mom is really technologically illiterate so I have to debug everything for her, so I would strongly recommend AGAINST buying this phone for your technologically illiterate friends or family. Overall, you get what you pay for. If you want a cheap phone that will last you about a year, this phone can be considered. It's got okay software and hardware. The camera isn't great, but it takes pictures. I had good hopes for BLU, but after this I am probably never going to buy a BLU phone again. 2
The phone I received was defective. The wifi function of the phone did not work. Thankfully, I had full insurance on my broken iphone that I was attempting to replace. Verizon covered the cost of this phone and provided me with a new one. Never again will I purchase a refurbished phone through Amazon. 1
Very good phone and well maintained. Except for one issue i.e. back button was not quickly responding other things were near perfect. 4
I wouldn't buy it, I already regret it buying it. I'm not doing this to make them sound bad but my front camera is half broken around the lense and for 3 days in a role my phone goes on vibrate and on silent simultaneously. 2
Phone did freeze and went completely black for hours but was still on contaced apple support to figure out why and they told me how to fix the issue hopefully it doesnt happen again the phone itself is in very good condition besides this incident 4
Well for one thing i didn't get a new one and when i did get it, it had a very volgure e-mail left on it (rapepornog ) what the rest was i can't remeber, and there was still some chinese writing left on it, i was lucky to get it off, so i really do think ALL THE PHONES SHOOULD BE LOOKED OVER A WHOLE LOT BETTER THAN THEY ARE?????????? 4
If your in last place shouldn't you be going faster than the rest of your competitors to catch back up in the race. I wish someone would tell BB that before they implode because I love using BB handsets!!!This BB Classic has a extremely bad flaw that makes it a deal breaker. Let me explain.The proximity sensor (the sensor that disables display while on a call with phone positioned at ear/face to eliminate accidental/unwanted input while on a call) is broke. PERIOD!! When the phone "on edge" whether vertical or horizontal the display turns off like it should, fine. But when the phone is flat the display DOES NOT turn off. This is very bad when you are using your shoulder and face to hold on to the device to free up hands to multitask or anything else the device will start muting, adding calls, repeat number taps, and so on. I was on a personal call the other day and knowingly called a client now he thinks I'm crazy. I keep unknowingly putting people on hold and rambling on only to realize later it was a wasted call. This is actually very dangerous as i have been talking while phone put itself on hold only to have that person call back and have the ringtone right in my ear by surprise scaring the heck out of me.There is know logical reason for the proximity sensor to disable itself just because the phone is flat. And it is not a single phone defect as I purchased 2 Classics and they both have the same problems.I also check to see if the happens with my Nexus 6 and Moto X 2nd Gen. Nope the display stays off while on a call even when phone is flat.This is a complete shame because I love this phone but cannot afford to lose business on a so called business phone. Until BB pulls its head out of its own UKW this one goes back. 3
It's a great phone but the main problem is: as soon as I lock the screen it loses track of time. That would've been nice to know before I bought the phone! 2
Well first of all the item was not as described..it came with 2 Sim card slots which is useless in the USA plus its very laggy..I gave it a star for the accessories another for KitKat and the third for the design however it has an unnecessary bezel at the bottom when being compared yo my nexus 5 3
The Seller didn't factory unlock this phone as stated... He kept saying that he unlocked it, and I checked with APPLE, ISP, and a couple of professionals and it was locked. I would never buy from this idiot again. He defies all logic and just keeps telling me that it's unlocked. He provided no answer other than it was unlocked, and the iphone didn't work. So I professionally unlocked the phone, and it works now.Beware of people that tell you that the iphone is factory unlocked. 1
is ok if you are not going to take pictures with your phone. doesn't have good resolution I bought the blu 6.0 and it have 8.0 this phone only have I believe 5.0. pictures come out blury 3
I was really mad at first because I thought I bought a broken phone. Phone works they gave me a charger that was no good 3
Overall happy, but the battery on the phone didnt stay charged very well. 4
Good value. Wife loves it. 5
The keyboard is very good. It was a bit heavy compared to other BB. I did not like numbers shown in red. It makes it difficult to see them. In Argentina I was unable to use 3g. As per what I was able to find out, problem came from the gsm/umts system shown in the BB. I was told that not being pure gsm (gsm/umts) created problems to recognize thus being unable to use 3G. 3
My granddaughter is deliighted with the phone. 5
Got for granddaughter she loves it Verizon put it on line no problem at all 5
I purchased this phone March 2015 (it's currently September 2015) and have used it fairly consistently until about three weeks ago. I rarely post reviews right away as I find those silly. I prefer to get to know a product before I review it.Initially, I liked this phone. I still like the aesthetic of it. It is sleek, not too large and does all of the basic things you need a phone to do. Or should I say "needed" a phone to do. About a month ago ago I noticed it was not charging when plugged into my car charger. Assuming the cable was screwed up (it was charging at home, as far as I know) I purchased a replacement car cord. That did not help and it soon stopped charging at home. Using the Blu provided, and other brand, chargers it refuses to charge. The charge 'lightning' bolt flashes for a moment, then goes away and no longer charges.Additionally, I began noticing a considerable drain on battery life. I do not run a lot of programs and they get shut off when not in use. Pandora, Hoopla, and email are my primary programs utilized. Initially, the battery would last approximately 12 hours or so, running these programs on occasion and then in standby while not in use. By the time the charger quit, I could barely get a full 6 hours out of it. I cannot say whether this is phone design, a faulty battery, or some other issue.Other issues that were annoying could possibly be due to the android platform itself, and not the phone. I have not used another android phone so I cannot compare. Turning notifications for programs off, but they turn themselves on again, and no phone number blocking for texts or calls were the two that I really had issues with.I really wanted to like this phone. I love the expandable storage, and the two sim card slots. I like that it has a lot more ap options than my older Lumia 521 (which I have had to return to). There were so many things that drew me to this phone. I spent a lot of time researching a phone and decided against the 5s in favor of this. My iTouch 3 still works fine and it's seen much harsher days than this phone ever did. I shouldn't be using that as my mp3 player again instead of this phone. 2
So far, I pretty much dislike this phone ("hate" is too strong a word).All-in-all, I'm fairly unimpressed, and I don't understand the "hype" about this phone; last month when it was introduced, I even saw it featured on a local TV News segment. I suppose it's major draw is it's relative affordability compared to the Big Brand Name smartphones?CONS:I've been looking for WEEKS to find a complete User Manual because the manufacturer DOESN'T HAVE ONE. It seems that there are a lot of things/features/functions not covered in the Quick Start Guide.The battery life is unimpressive; my 3-and-a-half year old Samsung Note (the original, first generation Note) has the same battery life as this.Why the heck is the Ringtone/notification so FREAKING LOUD even at the lowest setting?!Why can you NEVER turn-off the vibrate/buzz regardless of turning it off in all the settings that give you the option of turning it off? You can either have the lowest (but pretty darn loud) volume set for ringing and notifications, or vibrate/buzz. There is no "silent". Silent = buzz.Even with the option of the LED Notification light, which is meant to preclude the use of buzz.PROS:Yes, the display/screen quality and resolution are very nice.The overall quality of the manufacturing is excellent and exactly like any of the Big Name Brand expensive phones (you cannot tell that it is a "low-priced" phone at all, it looks and feels great).I prefer big phones/phablets and find this phone is a nice size.I cannot comment on the JBL/Harmon sound; I have heard only ringtones and notification tones and buzzing, which seem the same quality as any modern, good-to-best-quality name brand smartphone.In fairness, some of the things I don't like I suspect are just my own fault for not learning Android 5/Lollipop completely yet - and maybe a lot of stuff I just really hate about Lollipop...But I'm comparing this to another family member's new phone that runs Lollipop and this Alcatel phone has some very weird and undesirable features/functions, and is missing some of the more desirable ones (for my uses).It could also very well be that this is simply not the right kind of Smartphone for me.I use my phones for Internet if needed when I'm not near a PC, messaging, the occasional actual phone call, and photos;never as a music player or for watching TV/movies/videos or as an eReader (that's what my massive LED HD TVs and tablets are for). 1
Got exactly what was asked for... so far no problems. 4
Device did not work to its potential 1
It arrived fine and looked much like it was described. However, it will not hold a charged and has to ist on the charger after only 5 hrs (with almost EVERYTHING) turned off. I did really like the extra long cord that came with it. 3
I ordered this phone expecting a 5s. Imagine my shock when I opened the box to find a 5 in there. The phone is in good condition, but WAS NOT AS LISTED! 1
Horrible! Not having this phone for even a month and multiple problems are happening. First the screen glitches a lot. Then screen fades to black and even blacks out for days at a time. I am returning it today. 1
This is exactly what our granddaughter wanted 5
Great phone! Worked without issue for quite a while, eventually the screen stopped adjusting when I turn it on its side but whatever, it's an old phone at this point. Highly recommended! 4
Send it to my girlfriend to the Philippines and spent more to have it activated I thought it was unlocked I should have just bought it over there 3
very responsible seller and excellent product 5
Unfortunately our phone started to have issues after only 2 weeks of turning the phone on so I'm not sure it was a "new" phone as advertised. The camera,video do not work. 1
The phone seemed ok but we were not able to use it because it had been blocked by the phone company. Beware! 3
This is my first Apple iphone, and I wish I had had one before the OS is so easy to use, brilliant choice of apps and I like the way in synchronizes with my computer. 5
Phone in general is good. But speakers need to be updated. Can't hear the ringtones that well. Also, can barely hear the person on the other end when the speaker is switched on during call. 3
Blackberry it's an ok brand, this 8520 works fairly good, I use this phone for traveling and for basic tasks. 3
Everything was great except the camera shutter is hard wired to never be silenced. It is a Japanese phone so it will always have a shutter noise with every photo taken, even with screenshots and in other apps. Personally this annoys me to no end. 1
Well I like features,it works well and the price is right. I would recommand it to my friends so they get it. 4
I love this phone it's my first blackberry but I have had a slew of other phones and smartphones. This is a great phone, the only drawbacks are no video capture and no 3G speeds. But I'm sure that RIM will fix that next time around. 4
Amazing value. Great phone. Great reception. Excellent display. Good speakers. Updates are a bit flaky. First one messed up texting functionality and the third threw my phone into an endless reboot cycle. I ended up booting in safe mode, and eventually got the phone to boot again without having to wipe it. Sharing videos over email is still broken, which is very annoying. Maybe the next update will fix it. Only downside of this device is that it doesn't ship with stock Android, although it's pretty close (very few software enhancements and no bloatware). 4
I ordered so i could use it during roaming as an extra phone. I had nano sim and i tried to use SIM adaptor to make it large size. But the phone does not recognize it. 2
Love the 5c for its durability and its price - cheap iPhone and great quality. The only downside to this model is that there is no motion capabilities, so it can't track/record your health data - like steps. So if you're looking for that in a phone, choose the 5s. Battery lasts me a full day with heavy use. With light use, I only have to charge it every other day. This phone is fast and durable! 4
the phone did not work, I took it to the apple store and it could not be repaired. I ended up trading it in on another 4s that did work .The phone would not pick up my wi fi or any wi fi. It still cost me another $199.00 but it made my little girl happy. It cost me $102.00 for your phone and 199.00 for the new one. No more refurbished for me. 1
I love Apple, just not this particular phone, it worked for a day and then when I would make or receive calls I would here a terrible noise. 1
This phone worked well until 4 months later when it started going off automatically (even after being fully charged). I am not surprised though. Considering the fact that it is very cheap. I do not recommend that you purchase this phone. 2
Been having a bad run....cant say if its the phone or what but battery died on me after about 1 month then I replaced it (not from this seller) and it died again in approximately 10 days....very pissed !Tried another battery and its working fine so it seems like its the battery again.....WTH!!!! 3
very bad experience the phone never works I'm still waiting from seller for my money back 1
The one I received seemed more geared to AT&T than T-Mobile. Some profiles did not work and the scratches in the interior made me wonder if it was damaged during or before refurbishing. 2
This phone has slightly weaker reception quality than my old phone but it is a lot faster processing wise. I tested the phone by calling it with Google Voice and it didn't start ringing till the second ring on Google voice. The auto-focus is okay for the price. I suggest using this phone on wi-fi when possible to help with the weaker reception. Edit: This phone started locking up and going unresponsive after a few months. I can barely use it now. I do not recommend this phone. I know it is cheap, but unresponsive is bad. 2
Product was not in as good condition as i was told. phone had about of scratches and dents around the phone. i was not empress at all !!! 2
A new phone but trouble right out of the box 2
Didn't come with sim card won't recommend it it took me forever to find a sim card for itLame 3
this is good phone, and good merchant the phone came in perfect condition ,, and the delivered was quick.. I like it a lot... I am a satisfied costumer,,,,,..good thanks 5
I was sold a failed unlock phone that was no longer compatible with sprint. Not only this but the device arrived greasy and dirty. 1
I am still trying to get my head around the BB classic but it froze one night and it is back to normal.The whole order came in perfect condition and I am quite pleased with everything 4
You can barely hear out of the speaker 1
Love my phone it's perfect in every way! 5
completely satisfied with this product orders arrived the day stipulated ... agree with the request if this provider would advise 3
Do not buy!!! It's a sturdy phone but it capabilities for connectivity is horrible I bought this because I tried to save 50 but I the end I ended up buying a Blu phone anyway u will not get any data on this phone just spend the extra 50 and get a Blu phone its amazing 1
It was supposed to be new and unlocked but received in an open box with not instructions book and this is to use only with Sprint. Why they tell lies and make us lose time buying things we have to return? 1
Love it. Great quality for refurb. A few slim slight scratches mainly just on the back Apple reflector. Other than that it was like brand new. Great value with the 32 GB. 5
It's not working properly I want to return it 1
Appeared to be as good as new - no scratches, dents, etc. Cable and power adapter also like new. 5
before the fifth I was the fourth iPhone, the husband has 4s and finally I bought 5. Very light, comfortable. Yum! I love it! 5
I was fooled by the item description. It was totally below expectations. I could not even use the phone. Seems that they were just trying to place a broken phone to innocent buyers... 1
Purchased for my daughter for t mobile prepaid service. Had to purchase a micro sim card from tmobile and phone worked perfectly. Phone did not come in the standard iphone white box I'm used to, but upon opening it phone looked new and had all the plastic coverings a new phone should have. 5
iPhone is defective does not work properly , the camera is not original , can't use the speaker while talking on the phone 1
Phone size,style and color is amazing exactly what u expect... But the lag in the screen is ridiculous and should be fixed asap...idk how the expect this phone to compete with other big market androids if the speed is not even close to be on the same level as any galaxy S3 or better android...its bout as slow as the note 1 3
The screen came lift up already 1
iPhone 5 64GB was in good condition, works fine. 5
They will get you phones are not unlocked! 1
Phone is as good as new. Works great. 5
No it did not, you can't hear when you have it on speaker phone 1
Is good phone just because too heavy, 3
Ok as a temporary replacement but I cannot recommend it for anything else. Messenger service sends horrible pictures and videos, it's useless for anything more than text. Phone crashes and randomly resets. Sometimes resets into some kind of programming screen. 2
This phone was NOT a Sprint phone. Tried to activate it with Sprint but it was denied. Waste of time. 1
Came as agreed. Much better than my iPhone 4. 4
Phone is not new as they claimed. Had to conected to itunes to restored 1
They sent me a lemon, but thank god the warranty was still active so Apple replaced it. 1
Great phone for the price 5
This item is NOT new! 1
I bought this for my mother to replace the iPhone 4 she had been toting around for years. This review is a reflection of how she feels about the phone. She does love the bigger screen and the fact that it moves faster overall- but the battery does die way quicker than the 4's did. Even after I did lots of energy-saving settings modifications, it still dies to quickly for her liking. 4
Well,...my iPhone came like new.....unlocked...on time and i am a happy customer...I would buy again from this company...thank you and good job...P.S...it was fairly priced too... 5
phone came looking good except its not unlocked so i can't use it untill i get a sim card and there is no way to fully bypass sim activation 2
this phone was sold by Diamond wireless as new but was defective. it wont connect to any wi-fi and the screen cracked while i was holding it in my hand. Furthermore when I was told to return it for a replacement ( $22.00 ) I'm being told they cant replace it because it is locked into an I cloud account witch was never done by me. I will definitely think twice about buying electronics online again. $234.88 plus $22. down the drain and I still have to go buy a phone. I've been robbed !!! 1
I won't go into too many details about the phone itself, as I'm sure many other reviewers have covered it. For reference, I purchased the 64GB version both times.As I have looked around since May, the ZenFone 2 is the best value for the price, and nothing comes close to it. The screen is IPS, and not AMOLED, so there is an obvious difference in brightness ranges coming from an AMOLED phone (Samsung/Google Galaxy Nexus).I ended up damaging the screen when I dropped it on a terminal of a large battery at work, and from that, about 1/8-1/6 of the screen stopped working. I tried to replace the screen myself, but this proved to be quite difficult and it's sitting next to me in an ESD bag as I can't get it to display. I went back to the Galaxy Nexus for a month before I lost my patience with it again and decided to buy this phone again (being very cautious with it this time around).There is a lot of bloatware, but don't remove them if you plan on rooting the phone (a boot loop is possible with an OTA update). Yes it does take a bit of time to remove the bloatware (or hide and/or disable notifications for them), but it's worth taking the time to do.One thing that's irked me a lot is an update to the "Power Saver", which added a couple of extra battery modes that was automatically switched to without me knowing of it (and missing important notifications because of it). The modes are to help further enhance battery life, but because I use my phone more like a PDA, "Balanced" is good enough to last me about a day and a half (though I charge 5V@500mA every night). If you are missing notifications, this is the setting to check! (Also check the Auto-start Manager if problems continue to persist.)The back/home/recent apps capacitive keys are not backlit, cannot be seen in the dark, but are spaced apart so that it's hard to fat finger one for another.I do like ASUS's Launcher over the "stock" Android launcher, as you can reduce the number of pages apps take up and hide ones you don't want to use/look at.Overall, I'm quite happy with it, even considering the fact that I have another in a questionable state. 4
Knowing that this phone its actualy very old in the market, i love it, its gorgeous!!! I want to start to used 5
I received this phone at the time stated but shortly discovered that it couldnt work in my country because it is not GSM capable. Had to return it. 3
It does not have a very responsive screen. Have to touch it several times to get it to register. I did get it to try a less expensive android alternative. While I was not expecting much, the phone did not deliver on the low expectation. The frame of the phone is solid built and feels comfortable. However, the insides did not deliver. Poor Wi-Fi , screen sensitivity, and overall phone performance. 2
The phone is good buy send me yellow color and correct color is pink and charger and wire is generic 1
el equpo se recibio sin accesorios y bloqueado 1
Its OK for the price you are paying. It's too slow and camera take normal pics, it's good to carry because of the size and you can download all your apps normally. Sometimes the sound is not good and you have to use the speaker mode. 3
kinda huge headache. Bought this for my best friend for Christmas since she has a job that won't allow her to have her phone at her desk but she is allowed things like smart watches, we wanted to be able to get ahold of her quickly if there was an emergancy at home. She opened it, played with it for about 20 minutes before the screen began to blink and stop responding to any touch on the screen or the button. Sent it back, at my own expense, and had a new one sent out. They did send an extra battery to sort of reimburse me for the shipping costs, which was good because the battery that was on the second watch when it got here exploded shortly after being turned on, but thankfully didn't damage the watch. The description for the item is a little unclear. This doesn't work WITH your smart phone, it IS a smart phone. It needs it's own sim card to be able to use all the functions, My friend almost had me send it back again because the touch screen isn't very sensitive at all. She says it will randomly stop responding to touch when used regularly. For the most part she doesn't really use it because of how frustrated she gets with it being glitchy all the time. 2
I had high hopes for this phone based on reviews, but unfortunately the one I got would not connect to my Consumer Cellular/AT&T network. It read the SIM card and contacts and connected on WIFI, but no calling or texts. On the plus side, shipping was right on time, and even though it said 2-4 days after receipt of item for a refund, they posted my refund within an hour of when I dropped it off at the UPS Store! Good customer service! 3
It's an amazing phoneWaterproof is a thing that I've been waited a lot forI really recommend it for all apple lovers 4
terrible company, they said the phone was new, it was reburbished, aflter a few months it did not work properly . they didnt do anything..do not buy anythinh from them!!! 1
Short battery life, forever to charge, apps constantly running in the background, phone back constantly heated, pixel poor. Good screen control 2
The battery is not good. It become low very fast. 4
Phone was brand new and worked great.. I also recieved it in 2 business days which was awesome because I paid for standard shipping..my only complaint is the price was a little ridiculous for an iPhone 4 so I'm rating the phone a 4 4
A bit more sluggish than my 5 was. Not sure why. Not as noticeable as the androids, but annoying none the less. 4
Well,I now know why it was so cheap,it came with nothing,not even a charger..not that that would have helped,the battery is nearly useless,it doesn't stay charged for even 12 hours and I have not even used it yet... pay full price,you're better off! Very disappointed for nearly 500 bucks! 2
the output ratio - price are very good . It is much more than I expected cell phone. 4
Very good underrated phone, I was surprised by it. I like it more than my nexus 5 but the bloatware is a little annoying and unremovable, you can't even disable it. But with that said I still like this phone a lot and was definitely worth the buy and the money. I like how it fits in my pocket so slimly, feels smaller than any other phone in my pocket despite its larger size. 4
Touch screen doesn't work well, 10 times click for 1 task. 3
Excellent Product.But needs to provide in a good packing with all accessories.. 4
I have owned a lot of refurbished phones and have never had problems. For the first few days the phone seemed fine and for the last week it only works sometimes it either always says no service or no sim card. very unhappy 1
Thanks so much I give you A++++ 5
I thought it was unlocked, and I wrote many times to ask the pin phone or online and never answered 1
yes but I wish it was a 2k or 4k screen and the speakers was a little louder but other than that I love the phone for the price $249can't beat that or less it was $199but is OK 4
this phone is giving alot of trouble it sticking alot it shutting off it wasnt a good buy at all not please about this item at all 4
I bought the phone, at first i loved it. That was 12 hours ago. Now its freezing. Videos are delayed. Its freezing on me and being slow. I figured it was refurbished and returned before because when i got the device it had a old screen protector on it and they come with one that you have to put on it not already on there. Im returning this device and going to just buy me something else. 2
Got to me quickly. Great phone. 4
I originally bought this unlocked phone to use with my prepaid At&T account and although I've followed youtube in how to make an AT&T go phone card be cut into one that's assembled in the iphone tray, it turned out drastically awful. Rather than changing my number completely and just doing this simple task I'm not having to buy a whole new sim card and that's just money I could have invested long ago when I Received my iphone, which i'm currrently unable to use to my disappointment. This product alone however is beautiful, runs like a new phone, and slick to the touch. I'd recommend this seller in using phones but beware---cutting a go phone sim card can be costly when doing it wrong. I advise just getting the new at&t sim card and getting a new number. It'll save much disappointment and money.BIG THING HERE: The seller sent the product on time and earlier than I expected. It arrived in a package and bubble wrap ( love bubble wrap). There were no scratches, or hints of it ever being used---I've read some reviews and said this wasn't so, but on mine it's brand new. No sim card arrives with it, but there did come a cord with it in order for me to connect it to my computer. Didn't expect this so I'm ecstatic! :D 5
Lots of scratches on the film.. said it was brandnew but you can tell its been handle...the package seems old...not convince it is brandnew...not worth the money. 3
' I Love It Freezes Some times but other then that it's great 5
It is bent, but everything works fine. Not sure how to straighten the phone. 2
i got it today,, thank you so much AMAZON..happy Holiday and God blessing you all the CREW..")) 4
The description listed was "Item model number: A1428" however, what I received was the model number A1429. The problem with this is that A1429 is not compatible with the 4G network. 1
It looked good, but the battery is shot and it won't charge very fast. Now we are stuck. That was all her Christmas money. Don't buy used! Or refurbished...it took an hour and a half in the Sprint store to get all the updates loaded. 2
Would be 5 but had an issue with first phone they sent me but other than that great once they corrected problem 4
It took 2 days to get here. I'm really happy with the phone. 5
I purchased this phone in October (2015). Since then, I have had issues with freezing, lack of responsiveness (especially from my keyboard), the home button not working, and now it won't charge. I have a few friends who also have this phone and they have had issues as well. I would consider my use average, so this is very frustrating. 2
Price was very good,nice look and feel. Many apps run just as well as other top phones but at 1/4 the cost. If you buy one order a good screen protector and put it on first thing. Now that I had it a while comparing it to a flagship model isn't fair but how many can you buy for the price of a flagship ? about 4 to 6 depending on which you chose. Add a 2 year warranty and that beat my carriers protection policy hands down. 4
I needed a simple phone for my upcoming trip to Germany, so this one seemed to be perfect for my purpose. When I first received the phone, everything was set in Spanish language, with the home town set to Mexico City. It took me a while to find out how to set it to English. I immediately tried the phone with my German SIM card, it worked fine for exactly 2 test calls (one outgoing, one incoming) and then I put it away. I was really impressed with the small price!When I arrived in Germany a few weeks later, my transport was not at the airport as usual. I tried to call them, but the phone did not work! Callers could hear me, but I could not hear them. I rebooted the phone and even reset ist with the same result. I could hear no sound, not when the phone turned on, not for the radio, or for a phone call. I did not bring a headset for phones with me on the trip because I wear hearing aids and would not be able to use the phone with a headset anyway. However I tried with a simple headset from the plane (no microphone), and I could hear the sound with that just fine.So I could not use the phone during my trip as intended and immediately sent a mail to BLU and asked customer service for help, because I thought there was a simple solution to the problem. They responded with a prefabricated mail and a link to a web form, where I could contact customer service. I filled out the web form, but of course I could not provide a working phone number overseas, and neither could I supply the requested IMEI number, because it is very tiny and I did not have a magnifier on my trip. Needless to say, they never reacted to my help request via the web form.Back home, I filled out the web form again, this time with all the required information. I received yet another prefabricated answer, with the suggestion to reset the phone to factory settings. I sent them yet another mail, telling them I had already tried that several times, with no luck. It was very frustrating because every time after a reset I had to change the language and the home town all over again.So now I even told them I was willing to exchange the phone for a more sophisticated one which costs about $100 more. Again, I received no reply from BLU customer service.A week later I sent them yet another email that I had lost trust in them because of their unresponsiveness and I just wanted a simple exchange for the same phone. This time they finally reacted, after four weeks and my fifth (!!!) question for help! Now they want me to send the phone for repair (not an exchange as I had requested!), at my own cost, which would be more then a third of the $18 I had initially paid for the phone.I read the warranty and it states that "BLU may, at BLU's sole option, use rebuilt, reconditioned, or new parts or components when repairing any Products, or may replace Products with rebuilt, reconditioned, or new Products." Well, there is no guarantee that my new phone will finally work correctly after the repair with rebuild parts, and I don't like to throw good money after bad. So I will probably just throw the phone away and look for another solution for my next upcoming trip to Germany. Maybe I'll have better luck with another company. 2
My home button broke immediately after one day of usage 2
The phone is okay but the person selling the item didn't describe it properly it was look and it didn't have a charger just not good 2
Attractive phone but did not work upon arrival. I would not recommend. 1
Fue una buena compra pero no saio como yo queria porque yo coloque mala la suite les recomiendo que lenan bien porque les puede pasar como yo ! 3
I bought a Used Sprint iPhone 4. I recieved it and it looked brand new with brand new looking accessories. The only and MAIN problem was when i tried to activate this phone, it said it can't be activated because this phone is already activated on another account. Hm? I need to activate this phone right now but i can't because for some reason it is on somebody else's accont. I need this phone, that i paid for, deactivated so i can use it.Thank you! 3
My son is disatisfied with his phone. It does not consistently work. He isn't able to text or answer calls part of the time. Not sure if it just needs a new screen. 1
MEH I PHONES ARE WERID 4
Phone works great and is in great condition 5
Phone was fine... given to my Dad for father's day 4
Phone is in good condition, but it was not in MINT condition as advertised. 3
Great price and phone in great shape. 5
Phone delivered on time and in excellent condition. I was able to activate it completely on my own and it is working fine. A fifth star would have been merited except somewhat degraded battery performance. Overall I consider it a very good purchase. 4
Works very well. No problems whatsoever. I am very happy with my purchase. 5
My husband got me this iPhone 5s for my birthday. I absolutely love it. The reason I'm only giving it 4/5 stars is because the charger port was just FILLED with lint and junk, affecting its ability to charge. My husband had to dig all the lint out with a safety pin. 4
It came faulty, scratches and with the screen a little loose. I bought in my trip to Usa, so now is impossible to ask for a refund. Avoid this "refurbished" stuff! 2
did not get earpiece with the phone i love the phone but was disappointed that i didn't receive earphones with phone 3
I really liked this phone, except its wifi, and had to return it back for weak wifi signal.My previous samsung android phone, my wife's android phone, IPod, XBox 360, Asus laptop all are getting proper signal at the same location where this phone struggles to get any. I checked using different Wifi Analyzer tools available on Google Play, and the results were confirmed that this is not able to capture the wifi signal with decent strength. Also, number of networks shown were very few (because it cannot catch weak signals) as compared to my other phones.Pros: 5" HD screen, price compared to features offered, HSPA+ capability, decent 16 GB storage with external card support, 13MP back/5MP front camera, comes with protective cover and screen guard, power adapter sizeCons: Really weak wifi antenna, battery capacity, GPS sometimes takes time to capture any satellites, power cord not long enough, Android JB not upgradable to Kitkat (Blu did not announce for this model), last but not the least - BLU CUSTOMER SERVICE - I tried to reach them on phone couple of times but was not able to get though even a single time to speak to someone.Hope Blu is listening :) 3
This was bought as new but i doubt it was new because when i tried to use the headphone it would not work and there is nothing wrong eith the headphones. Other than that the phone worked fine 3
Phone had too much signs of usage. 2
Charge doesnt last long and started to glitch when watching video after 2 months 3
phone works fine, charging cable faulty and did not come with the earphones. 4
Came as agreed. Much better than my iPhone 4. 4
Excellent! Great condition and fast shipping. I could not be happier! 5
I like the phone, I had some problems with it at first but it seems to be Ok now. 4
It is not unlocked. I want my money back 1
Picture quality is great, very responsive and fast.....but after 2 weeks of having it, the device would not charge. I was able to return it and was sent a replacement at no extra charge and the same thing happened again. Eventually i gave up and got my money back. 2
Payed a lot of money for said phone and had it activated Saturday March 19th. All seemed fine. Received first call on Monday and couldn't hear the caller. Thought maybe it was their phone. Nope it's this one. Seller won't take return! Now I have to get credit card involved for someone who sells junk! 1
It's a cheap burner phone, but I have a constant problem with sim cards not reading, probably because they are not cut perfectly, but then again with a cheap phone like this it doesn't really matter, everything else works fine, dislike the fact that i doesn't properly store characters from other languages too well 3
The phone is awesome. I had a 4 but I lost it. So this was a replacement. I may get my daughter the same one or the 5s if it's not too expensive. 5
The phone works fine. A few fine tunes are needed sometimes for it to work on ones network. I use MTN a GSM carrier and I had to pay $5 for someone to further unlock it. Then the USSD are not working. When you dial a USSD code to check for your airtime, it behaves as if you are dialing a normal call 4
I got this phone for my mom , and she loves it she still is new to the iphone .. we are showing her step by step how to use different Apps on the phone but other than that she likes it and its UNLOCKED !!!!!! 5
Phone was used for a few days (not brand new as said in the ad listing) but packing was good and was in box along with new charger and new ear phones.Overall happy with the service. 3
I am thinking about returning this phone. My connectivity to the internet is extremely glitchy along with some areas where everything black outs. Works great on wifi. Unless anyone can figure out how to get access to internet before i return.Delivery was quick. 2
i give it 2 stars because the battery lasted literally 2 weeks and then it would go dead after 30 minutes. and the phone wouldn't send texts if the phone was moving. had more problems but it is an i phone 4..... so i dont wanna bash. would definitely 2
phone is great, and awesome bang for the buck. i knew the camera wasn't great from reading reviews, but in actuality it is worse than i thought. very grainy in anything but full sunlight and even then the auto focus works about 1 out of 5 times. video shooting is a little better. if you plan on taking a lot of photos pass on the phone, otherwise it's a great phone.oh, plan on taking a lot of screen shots. volume down + power = screen shot, and when trying to turn the screen off with one hand using the power button, the volume button is placed perfectly to end up taking a screen shot!UPDATE: Alcatel really supports this phone, they have done 3 software updates so far, and the camera is now performing much better. Vary happy that they are putting in effort to support the handset 5
i am happy with the product, as it was on time, and it was good packed, and i sold it as soon as rived, will buy more. 4
Great, connection is lost at times but maybe the connection is due to ATT. Didn't come with charger like supposed to. But works great. Came charged. Almost new. 4
Tried to use this phone, but it just wasn't easy to set up, there is no storage. I never could get it to connect to the Wi-Fi or internet right. I just might not be tech savvy enough. 2
I have had my phone for at least a year and I'm very satisfied with my experience but the camera isn't the best. Everything else is good but the music situation is very complicated because when I'm looking at the music app it doesn't seem to work. The size is great it's big but it still fits into my pocket but when I try to find accessories for the phone there are not many out there like when you lose your charger it is hard to find a new one online. I've used my camera a lot but now I am not able to use my stickers and editing on the photos. 3
The phones arraived in perfect conditions and are worrking properly, the 3G works perfectly with Movistar and Movilnet, here in Venezuela, it's a very versatile phone. 3
I received everything on time.I bought tris product because i got one last year and it was great.I cant say the same now.I had lots of problems.It didnt work well.I changed the battery and this didnt work either.The phone is working but suddenly it goes off and you cant turn it on.You have to take the battery and charge it again.Im not satisfied with this product 2
Pretty good but the operating instructions are weak. 3
Very clear voice and simple to use 3
I specifically ordered an AT&T phone but received a t mobile carrier phone. Not cool at all. 1
The charger isn't working. And the battery life is also not good. 1
Arrived in time, works great! 5
Love the watch, but. Before purchasing I asked the seller if apple care could be purchased for the watch. Was told yes, it was a apple certified refurbished product. When I went to apple to purchase the apple care extended warranty was told that I could not purchase Apple care because it wasn't sold through Apple. Would not have purchased if I knew this up front. But I do love the watch, but not having the extended warranty is a little risky. 3
One of the worst phones I have ever had. Apps shut down constantly and phone turns off by itself. Apps always say they need to be force closed. YouTube is very very slow, and shuts down randomly. One of the worst buys I have ever had. 1
This phone is not able to update apps on Wi-Fi or mobile network...... And it freezes up regularly 2
I loved it and the speed it came in 5
Just what I was looking for and fixing to purchase another 5
bought this phone for my daughters birthday, and the phone looks untouched very clean and so far no problems with it. My daughter is very happy. 5
It's ok but it freezes up from time to time. 4
I received this phone on 04th of March, now the phone don't work well and the clock doesn't work anymore, in addition at the apple store told me that the phone is not new but born on 2014, the supplier, the supplier don' t help me well. 1
Was impressed first with the cost. Then the performance of the Leap was exceptional. BlackBerry has stepped up Big Time. 4
It connects well to my T-Mobile LTE account but is getting hot and draining the battery very quickly. Seems to turn on the OS flashlight feature at random in my pocket for instance so I am unable to track down the ghost in the machine. 3
according to specs this phone was supposed to work with my track phone sim card 1
Pro: It's an iPhone. Con: needs to ship with a sim tool and apple certified lighting cable. 4
I purchased the blackberry bold 9650, well it is unlocked as the seller indicated, all i had to do was pay my local service provider to activate the phone, since am from a country in the caribbean named SAINT LUCIA. It was and is a good purchase, thank you guys for the free holder.Christopher Stevens 4
I got the best deal when I purchased this iPhone 5 for my mom because the price is awesome for 32GB. 5
I didn't like the phone, would prefer to buy a new phone. 1
This took a week to ship, and for an impatient 13 year old boy, that's frustrating. However, it was totally worth the wait. It came in the original packaging, sealed. Also, it came with 1 screen protector and two of the black iPhone 5c cases that cost $30 at Apple.com! The screen protector and the cases are a $70 value. Plus, the phone was $150 less than the cost Apple! Such a great deal. I'm loving my first smartphone :D 5
Pictures on this are great! However it likes to randomly go to camera mode even when it's still on the table.Otherwise perfect phone, tolerates my crazy use. Other phones usually overheat at this point! 4
The phone was in good working condition and new. However, the entire manual was in spanish (which I do not know a word of). So I've had to ask friends who have the same phone for instructions or help in finding certain things in the phone. The phone was even in spanish, I had to select a bunch of options until I saw English...this sucks. 4
DO NOT buy this phone you can not do anything on this phone. 2
This is my first windows phone and probably will be my last windows phones.this is a glitchy and buggy phone. Horrible experience!!! 2
Good except for no GPS on Fitness Tracking and no continuous heart rate monitor 4
Not at all happy with this product, not geared for adult wrist, too clumsey to really use..cannot navigate around the design to eve really use it. would not recommend..save your money to buy the real thing. 2
Only worked for a day, then i had to take it to the Apple Store because there was a specific error on it and they couldn't fix it. 1
Great phone, has Withstood quite a bit of abuse, 4
Even though the shipping was delayed it arrived in good condition just as described. Ive only been using it for a couple of days but so far everything is working just fine 5
I thought the phone was in excellent condition when I purchased it, I didn't have any problems getting it setup. It was totally easy from start to finish. My son loves his new iphone. 4
Have had the phone a couple months. Daughter dropped it on a carpeted floor from only about 3 ft away - cracked the screen. I doubt we'll be replacing it with another i5 as we hear that is a problem with them. 3
My son loves this phone. Pricey for second hand though. Came fast and looked new. 5
It came perfectly fine with the charger and everything but I expected it to be unlocked. When I got it, and tried to take it to a phone service company, they said it wasn't unlocked so...yeah....good overall though. Works great. 3
The phone was like new but we couldn't recipe calls on it. 1
great to work with, we needed the order quickly and they made sure we got it before we left for vacation! 5
Exactly as described. Phone in perfect condition and worked immediately with my ATT service. 5
DID WORK IT KEEP TURNING OFF 2
There's a learning curve from the 3-G, but it is fast and has a good screen. Once acclimated, it is very user friendly. 4
Love my phone, delivered on time and in good condition everything intact 5
Bought for a friend. Worry about support. 3
I had to return it. It was full of scratches. 1
This is the worst buy ever. The phone doesn't work. 1
Works well except for the battery which doesn't hold a charge well. Loses power much more quickly than other 3GS units I've owned. Shuts off with ~15% left. Yes, i calibrate the battery regularly. It doesnt help. Based on its shaky battery life and power quirks, I don't think this phone will be working much longer, so I feel a bit cheated. 3
It's OK. For $200 I expected more. It's really hard to hold at times. Slippery. 3
Does not work at all. Will not turn on >:( 1
good product for the money 4
This phone will work for people who are basic smartphone users: ig, fb, WhatsApp, email, calls and text.I am a more advanced user so I was happy with this phone for about 6 months. After that I've been forced to delete and disable apps in order to get new ones in. I'm a frequent user of Netflix and Spotify but had to uninstall Spotify because although I don't have any tracks saved, it kept telling me the memory was full.The phone has NEVER told me who's calling, I have to guess, and it's sloooooow to do even the most basic thing like switching from an app to another. At some point it started rebooting itself but that went away on its own.Sometimes the keyboard stops responding and just after a year of use, the charger has completely died.The only reason why I haven't changed it yet is because I need a much better phone but I'm unable to afford it. After 1 year of terrible quality I'm definitely ready for an upgrade. 3
Considering my last phone was heaping pile of dung, this one is a little slice of heaven. I'd never pay those ridiculous Apple prices so I got this one used and I couldn't be happier. 5
I can't get the thing to sync with my phone. I even watched several Youtube videos on how to do it and still can't figure it out. Can't find the sound to turn it down or off. Can't pull up the apps section most of the time. Sending it back. Don't waste your money! 2
I love this Iphone and learn to use it less than a day. 5
I bought this that the intention that it was new and never used. When i went and brought the phone to the verizon wireless and the phone was definitely already used and registered to another person and i had a problem transferring the phone to my plan. 2
Battery dies too quickly and picture quality is poor. 3
Tiene la pantalla despegada :( 1
This may seem really ridiculous but I ordered this last week and got it Saturday. Before I got it activated the other night the screen was messing up on me. I was having a lot of fun trying to put in my WiFi information. Anyway, I got it activated last night and everything was working fine. But now it's back to the way it was before it was activated. The screen was acting like it was possessed or a chipmunk on rd caffeine. It kept going to comments or my messages or previous pages on the Facebook app and it even did it on the Safari app when I decided to just use Facebook on that. Still acted up. I was really looking forward to trying out Apple but I'm really disappointed. Even with that 9.0.2 update or whatever it is, it's still doing it. The phone itself is great but that touchscreen thing, REALLY needs to be fixed. As well as on their future models. The only other positive thing I can say is that it finally showed my music than my previous phone did (not an iPhone). It would show less than half of it even though it was all right on the micro SD card I had in it.I will try Apple again someday when it gets better hopefully. If not, it's either just not meant for me, I got a lemon, or I should just curse the fact that I have big fingers. Lol. 2
I really want to love this phone. It's cheap, it comes in a couple color choices, and other folks seem to like theirs. Sadly, I only find it acceptable. The television feature doesn't work, the manual is a joke, and worst of all, the speaker-phone function is unusable, as nobody can hear me when I try to use it. I've tried it out on different people, in places with different sound levels, and it's 100 percent a fail. The person I'm talking to can tell I'm speaking, but it's too blurry and faint to understand what I'm saying. I use (or used to use) the speakerphone a lot, so this really bothers me.All that being said, it has large buttons, so would be good for an older person who is savvy enough to figure out how to use it (given the poor manual). 2
I have had my phone for about a month now, it feels strong, durable, everything is working great. I am very pleased and happy with my purchase. The only thing is that it did not come with a datacard. I am not sure if that is normal that phones do not come with data cards?. Other than that great buy, unlocked using in the caribean working great so far. 4
For some reason sprint wouldn't allow me to use this phone with them. Got it returned though! 1
I received a phone that would not turn on at all, past the Apple symbol. After that the screen would turn blue and black, and turn off again. 1
Good phone and in good condition, but recently discovered that this is only an Iphone 5, not a 5s. Also, it didn't come with the stock earbuds, which are expensive. FALSE ADVERTISING. 2
The phone looks great but the touch screen sensor is messed up very bad .... 2
The phone arrived and the first thing that disturbed me was that I could clean the screen. The white plastic sticker paper that cover the screen in between was put on wrongly and after taking it out, I could not clean the screen. I have used alcohol but the screen is dirty. I installed viber, skpye and line and then ran out of memory to install any other program 2
I was not satisfied with this phone so I sent phone back. 1
I was hoping this wouldn't be a crApple product but after less than 2 months of use the phone shuts off randomly & as of lately refusing to boot up for hours.This is absolutely disgusting. 1
It's a good phone for who ever likes small phones however I'm a big phone lover so I didn't like that and I initially ordered this phone on the first of October just received it on the 13 of October the tracking information was outdated on amazon website and the tracking number couldn't be tracked just a mess then the USPS dropped it off at the front door step on the porch bad service but good phone 2
I had really high expectation due to all the good reviews I previously read, but it wasn't what I expected. I must also note that this was the second one I am going through as the first I got stopped powering on after a couple of days of use, thankfully I was able to get a replacement. Now on this second one the screen lock/unlock and volume buttons on the side of the phone have stopped working, they were very sensitive so I am guessing that they were probably getting constantly pushed in my pocket although it had a case on. Other than that, this phone has a lot of potential, hardware is very up to date and the Android OS is always a plus. 3
Former verizon customer, wanted to change carriers to tmobile so i used this as my trade in to get my ETF paid, worth it and i dont regret it. 3
This is a great phone although the microphone stops working after two weeks. You make a call and people can't hear you talking because the microphone is not working. Should fix that. I am returning it now. Don't buy it because you won't be able to call people. 2
- NICE AND PRACTICAL- Basic but not cheap .- very resistant to daily accidents / rain / food etc... 4
It's a good product but it doesn't last 2
Yes! the iPhone is Used but, minor scratches & no earbuds but, not as bad. Other than that I am so happy with this phone for real. 5
Good novelty item, not very good at being a phone... or a watch... 2
Bought this phone for my son, great buy! 5
Glad I bought this on the Marketplace as I returned the first one. 2nd try worked out. 4
The cell phone arrived several days before that the expected.The Mobil work excellent. It is fast, big and the screen looks very good. The only problem is the camera during the night, isn't good.But for the price, I think, is a good Mobil. 4
My sons phone was stolen, and we still had to pay for the monthly service. So we got this as a replacement phone and it was in very good condition! 5
I bought this phone for my wife. Everything works good except the mic. She can receive calls and hear the other person, but they cannot hear her. 2
Everything is ok, except the battery !!!!!!!!!!!! It drains fully for 2 hours, is it ok for 4200 mAh battery ???? 2
Doesn't work for tmobile at all. Tried to put the SIM card in and it won't read itDon't buy this phone. 1
at this time the phone works fine. The cables were not a Apple approved charging cable and they were disabled by Itunes. Had to spend more money on a cable 3
Yes this is a great phone! But soon after i bought it i got an sd card for up to 64 GB and i did get to download a lot of apps but now i have like 55 gigs and it keeps saying i have insufficient storage, so thats really pissing me off, i cant download the games and apps that i want. But i really love that this phone was only 130 dollars and is as big and as thin as the iphone 6 plus, internet works pretty good but i would rather get an lte network phone, the camera is pretty good for the rear but when you zoom the detail is so horrible! Although the front camera isn't as good as a 12 mega pixel camera it takes some pretty good shots. BUT ONE AMAZING FEATURE for this phone is the BATTERY i can go all day for low use when im at school and come home and it will be at 90% or normal-a lot of use would be at 70%. I mean this is a great phone if you dont want to spend like 2 or $300.00 but if i were in your shoes i would get a a better one for at least around 200 just for some better features. 3
Great phone, it just is not social network friendly. 4
I think I already reviewed this but am very happy!! Sure beats paying full price for brand new when this phone was basically a brand new phone!! 4
Overall okay phone, I mean it works great for like day but the few problems I have with it are quite major.. Phone will shut off randomly and take 15 minutes rebooting. Phone will sputter audio with YouTube and Spotify like an old CD Player. There is no touch calibration and with this it is quite impossible to draw on here. Seriously try drawing on here a decent picture it's not going to happenOther then that it's great, if you want a usual phone with calling and texting then this is for you, also the smart lock is awesome. 3
Working well so far and came in great condition as described. As a matter of fact I'm posting from it right now! 5
I was really excited to get my phone. From the very first charge it stopped and started charging. I did not send back, this was my 1st I-phone and I didn't know if this was something that just came with the territory. 2 months later, the phone won't take a charge. It's a brick and it's too late to get a refund.It now serves as a pretty paperweight.Don't get ripped off thinking your experience will be different, you are flipping a coin. 1
I bought this phone that clear stated that its compatible with sprint only to call sprint and for them to tell me that's not the case. Such a waste of time!! 1
Good product. Fantastic keyboard. I recommend this device for people who really need to use the mobile for e-mails.The screen gives good quality, the touch screen is also working good. 4
Although Asus makes good computers, their cell phones are the worse on the cell phone market. The first ASUS phone I received would not boot up after 1 week of use. The replacement Asus phone received would take up to 90 seconds before a connection is made when calling, in addition, the GPS is not functional as it always comes on and off all of the time. I have played with the configuration and even reset the phone, still the same. I therefore believe that all of the 5 star reviews made for this phone are fake. I am now using the low end version of the HTC phone that I purchased new for $69.00 and am very satisfied with it. Instead of throwing it in the garbage, I plan to give this $300.00 64gb Asus phone to a friend who is visiting from the Caribbean. ASUS ZEN FONE: MUST READ BEFORE BUYING: On January 5, 2016, I opted to buy an unlocked Zenfone 2 in lieu of a Samsung Galaxy note 5 because for the past 12 years, I was extremely satisfied with all of the Asus computers brand that my wife and I owned and decided to give their phone a try. During the first four month of phone use, I noticed that the GPS signal would suddenly drop and could not be turned back on unless I rebooted the phone. On the sixth month of use, the phone became completely unusable. The screen would either respond erratically or would not respond at all. I called Asus and they gave me an RMA to send the phone to their warehouse for repair. I was advised that the turnaround time would be two weeks. On August 22, I sent the phone via USPS and was given a tracking number. Because I was advised by Asus that my repaired phone would be returned within two weeks, I did not bother to do an online check on the repair status. On September 5, while I was out of town, I went on the Asus site and was very surprised to see that the repair status notation showing "phone not received". I called Asus and told them what had transpired within the previous two weeks and after waiting for about 45 minutes, I was told that they did not receive the phone and the case would be escalated and I would be called within 24 to 48 hours. The next 48 hours came and went and no call was received from Asus. Upon returning home in the next few days, I called Asus and gave them my tracking number and told them that my phone was delivered to their warehouse on August 26, 4 days after it was mailed. Once more, I remained on the phone for another 45 minutes after which I was told that the warehouse had made a mistake on processing the RMA and this is why they did not locate the phone. Once more, I was promised a call back within 24 to 48 hours for an update. Once more, the 48 hour call never came. On September 10, upon checking the repair status on the Asus web site, the notation shown was: "phone received on September 9, 2016". I thought, at least, it is acknowledged on their site that the phone is in their hands. On September 14, I received the phone via FedEx and took it to my phone service provider to have the sim card programmed on it. I was told that the phone I just received does not have the same serial number as the previous one (that was sent for repair) and could not be programmed because it is locked. Once again, I called Asus and explained the situation to them. I requested to have this phone replaced with their newest version of the Zen fone 3 because my research also indicated that screen problem is a recurring problem for many ZenFone 2 owners who had to send their phones for repair on several occasions for the same screen issue. The customer service rep calmly lied to me by telling me that the Zen Fone 3 is not out yet as I am seeing it for sale now on Amazon. This $300.00 Zen fone of mine is about to become an expensive paper weight as I cannot use it because it is locked. Once again, I am supposed to receive a call within 24 to 48 hours. ALL OF A SUDDEN, MY LOYALTY FOR THE ASUS BRAND HAS FADED. 2
It arrived and the microphone didn't work. Do NOT buy from these people. 1
Now I have only just gotten this item but I have to say this phone shows major promise. First of all it's slim and light, almost feels like a plastic toy, but I can appreciate that. Since I bought it unlocked I was excited to see if it really was cause I read some didn't get what they ordered. And it is unlocked, I put my Swedish SIM card in and it works great. The phone needs patience when starting up, as I first thought it was just slow for the first 10 minutes after the system update.I love the fact that there are almost no apps installed as you get it, cause most phones have facebook and such already part of the phone, so this phone really lets me control what apps I want and not. The layout is pretty great and easy to navigate. The phone is quite big, so either handle with ultimate care or order a case with it. Back to functions I have to give the phone some credit about the camera. That has always been my priority when buying phones so I was sceptical but I'm surprised at how good it is! You can get close (to the object), its pretty sharp and decently fast at captioning. The front camera is pretty nice too, and it smooths the skin when taking selfies (for all selfie hungry hippos out there). Like I said I just received this item and have there for a lot more to explore but for now I would definitely recommend this phone! 4
Buenas tardes no me enviaron la factura comercial me podrian mandan una foto de la factura al siguiente correo: facturas@libertyexpress.com gracias 3
Came on time but the charger did not work and did not come with headphones or any manuals. It also did not come with the little key to open the sim slot 3
Very disappointed with the Iphone 4s I get. Its battery is desperately unfuntional- it can stand by only few hours after being full charge. 1
Such a pitty, zc551kl is a great phone but neither amazon nor asus clarified my doubt about band 4 LTE support.Using phone in Argentina where LTE is band 4 only, and didn't get any kind of LTE signal at all meanwhile a Zenfone 2 ze551ml next to it gets pretty good LTE signal reception.From what I've researched throughout the web, international version doesn't support this band... Maybe Amazon's selling zc551kl as US warranty version when it isn't actually, don't really know... But LTE band 4 seems to not be supported as days of use go on..Edit: Got into bootloader checked it is US/BR version actually, but still couldn't solve the 4G issue. 2
Great buy unfortunately never receive this phone 1
I can't get the thing to sync with my phone. I even watched several Youtube videos on how to do it and still can't figure it out. Can't find the sound to turn it down or off. Can't pull up the apps section most of the time. Sending it back. Don't waste your money! 2
I haven't had this phone a week yet and I have lines going horizontal and vertical all over my screen. Also the home button doesn't work half the time. I am going to have to buy another phone to replace this one I just bought. 1
used this for a year it worked well, but would lag at times maybe due to small RAM. 4
This is a great phone. I did not want an iPhone 6, so I chose the 5S. My only complaintis (and the only reason why I did not give it 5 stars) is that the battery is short lived. To methat is annoying especially when I have not used it that much and the battery is down to75 or 80%. So I have to charge it frequently. If anyone has a hint for me to increasebattery life, I'd love to hear it. 4
This phone is a real disappointment. I can not get onto the internet unless I am at an establishment that has WIFI. So this phone is useless to me. Now I have to buy another phone that is in working condition this is the first time I have ever had a problem buying a phone on Amazon. 1
Arrived on time, Brand new, all accessories included very pleased 5
Speaker phone doesn't work, doesn't hold charge. Took it to Verizon store and they couldn't help. Returning for refund. Disappointed. 1
my experience with amazon is good, there are respect with client, i recommend buy in amazon.thanks 4
Very dissatisfied I went to sprint to have the phone activated and they said that is was locked or that the last carrier had a balance due to sprint and that I wouldn't be able to use it. I spent 300$ on a phone that can't be used and I want my money back ASAP. I shouldn't have to pay to have the phone unlocked on top of that. I was really looking forward to a new phone and now I have to wait for this problem to be fixed. I better get my money back too!!!!!!! 1
It states in product detail this phone is compatible with straight talk. Well, it isn't!! 2
It's not the top smartphone on the market, but you can't get anything better for emails than this phone. 4
Phone was locked. Verizon suggested it was a stolen phone. 1
The phone we received had problems from the beginning. Finally took it in to an Apple store and they verified that it wasn't an Apple phone. Buyer beware. 1
Phone went dead after two weeks of use. I can see why blackberry is all but done as a phone company. 2
I have owned a lot of refurbished phones and have never had problems. For the first few days the phone seemed fine and for the last week it only works sometimes it either always says no service or no sim card. very unhappy 1
Said it was new and still in box but it has had many issues already pretty disappointing, would not buy again 1
Needed a simple phone for my mom. This phone fits the bill. Great price.it's not a touch screen phone, but that's fine. 5
Overall a nice little phone though the antennae seems a little week to me. I was up in the mountains near my home and my sons cheap go phone had better reception. Both phones are AT&T... 4
It worked like a New phone no problem I have no problems with it thanks 4
The phone came in pristine condition and I'm glad it did. Other customers got their phones with scuffs and scratches. I guess i just got a good phone. I would have given it 5 stars if it came with a real apple cable because the one in the box couldn't transfer data. 4
Phone came in decent condition, however, came with a battery problem. Phone would not charge, so I replaced the battery, which was an unconvienent expense. 2
Horrible horrible phone no reception keeps downloading programs DON'T BUY 1
the phone is not unlocked, its a sprint carrier phone 1
Received pretty fast watch is good 3
A decent phone for a reasonable price. The phone is pretty big it makes people turn heads. I personally like the phone works great but it has its limitations. I will say the phone is pretty fragile but it's expected considering how thin it is. Definitely buy a case for this phone maybe even a screen protector. 3
I got a great price, and it arrived on time for Christmas. It actually arrived ahead of the promised date. My daughter, who received the phone as a gift is very happy with it. 5
The product itself is ok but I got a package that was opened and a unit that had an AT&T logo when the picture specifically had no logo.I am very particular about a logo and VERY disappointed that my unit had a logo on the phone. 2
Well it said it was message compatable with me LG G Vista and it's not I've tried everything 2
The battery only lasts about 6 hours 😠 3
Its a very good phone. The applications that comes in it are great. It help me to get organized: the clock with the convinience to set different alarms, the calendar for the appointments, the camera and the application to write notes. Those are my favorites. Another favorite is the ease to download applications like the Bible (daily devotional) and the calorie counter and GPS.My only disappointment was that it came with a crack in the back side of the phone (about an inch of long!). Its not noticeable since I use it with a cover.Otherwise I would have rated it with 5 stars.By the way I was wondering if it would work in Puerto Rico with Net 10 phone service... yes it does! 3
Good condition - fast shipping - works fine with minor defect in screen but overall pretty good deal 4
NEW REVIEW:After getting a second unit, this phone is still a pain in the ass. In hot rooms, sometimes the screen won't respond at all. That un-removable bloatware is actually malware and it's not content to be disabled--nooo, Wireless Update sends daily pop-up notifications to "update" itself. Apparently this is a common theme with cheap s*** coming out of China these days. You get what you pay for.OLD REVIEW:Great specs for the price. Fair battery life. Dual SIM capability is practically unheard of at this price point.Cons: Comes bundled with some un-removable bloatwarePretty soon after getting this phone, I noticed a spot on the screen, as if someone were pushing the glass down on the LCD. Sure enough, pressing gently on the screen made the spot bigger. This appears to be a manufacturing defect, so I'm sending the phone back for a refund and trying my luck with a second unit. -2 stars for the pain in the rear. 2
This is an edit to an earlier review I made. Another consumer (I think) pointed out that it uses a different network than Verizon and that I should have done my research. Well, maybe I should have. But I don't know, I'm a consumer, and even though I agree that consumers should indeed do their homework, the majority will read "Super Cool Quad Band Watch". And since there is no disclaimer in the specifications, most would probably buy it. I mean I'm not an expert, but how many people really know what GSM or CMDA means? If the Verizon guy couldn't figure it out......Anyway, I bought this product, took it to my cell phone carrier (Verizon) and they could not get it to work. Because I am not willing or able to search all of the cell phone carriers to find out which one can get it to work, and because of the fact that it is way more bulkier than I thought, I returned it.You know what, in all fairness, I'll upgrade my rating because I can't speak on how it works. But I got a white one and the watch band is a noticeable different shade of white compared to the watch. If you are getting it for your kid like I did, just know that it is bulky and looks like someone grabbed a nokia and trimmed off the key pad and slapped it onto a wristband. JUST MY OPINION. Again, It might work for you but the look threw me off. 2
what can I say? the phone works great and was the right price and seller shipped super fast. no issues as of yet will update if I notice any 4
does not the bluetooth in the car. 3
The home button sticks bad. You have to push a few times hard to have it respond. 3
be careful. these phones are still in contract for someone and you can unlock as you are paying the full price 1
I bought the phone as a present for a relative. I was glad until he opened the brand new box, and I show that the logo was blurred. Everything looks good, but, is it a genuine Blackberry? Apparently It is, but maybe with defects.The software is just in English and Portuguese.Just judge yourself. The rest is ok and it arrived perfectly on time. 3
If u r looking for a brand new, Don't go for this. I ordered and received in time. But its not a brand new. Its very refurb. Seller didn't mention here whether its brand new or refurb. Tats not fair.. 2 stars for the product and for the sellers, i can say buyers beware.. 2
The phone is nice but sometimes the people I call cannot hear me. 3
Love it and it same as apple ipad 5
Very good services and good item . 5
Honestly, I love this phone. I bought mine from Amazon Warehouse. Although it was used. It preforms well but my package didn't come with the jbl headphone, just apple headphones. As for most users, battery is a main concern. My idol 3 gets about four to five hours of screen one time. I would like to state I am a heavy battery user. Bluetooth enabled most of time for my moto 360 and Bluetooth devices. Data also enabled for couple hours. For my opinion, this is an average phone, battery wise. Buy a fast charger for this phone as it only comes with a standard alcatel charger. The NFC and the Gyroscope sensor work very well for VR streaming. On board speakers are greatly better than most phones due to the dual front facing features. The camera is just good. Nothing to write home about. I highly advise y'all to buy the "A better camera unlocked" app. There is also a free version if y'all are into that. The app will make the camera in par with the iPhone cameras. If y'all are wondering about the double tap to wake feature. I'd like to say it works but only with the one touch launcher. It might just be a software issue with the marshmallow upfate. Hope alcatel fixes it soon. As of now. I use nova launcher with the knock lock app and the gravity lock app. Works well in unison.Overall. Great phone for the $200 mark. I did get mine used and for cheaper the price. Nothing bad. Hope this review helped your decision to consider this phone. Thanks bye bye 5
good iPhone 4, 8GB - Factory Unlocked. works good and looks great. with complete box and adapter, headphone. no scratches.All in all. worth to buy. With original clear film. 5
The back feels good to use, but feels cheap for the price. 3
DISCLAIMER: I was attempting to use this overseas; I do not know how it would function here in the U.S. on a normal network. I tried to use this with a prepaid SIM card from e-kit while I was in Ireland/Great Britain and could still never get a data signal. It had trouble connecting to wi-fi as well. I ended up using my Verizon phone on the hostel's wi-fi most of the time instead. 2
Can't get access to what's app , now I'm gonna have to buy a better one. Anyway I still can use it to make & receive calls 2
This phone was great for the 10 days it worked. On the 11 day it wouldn't turn on. A hard reset wouldn't work either. It's boxed up ready to return to Amazon for a refund. 2
This phone works just fine and as described by the seller. There was not a scratch on it when I received it. I am very satisfied with this phone and would buy from this seller again. 4
I got a great product that came exactly as the description said. 100% satisfied 5
The product itself is good however the companion app that runs with it is not up to par. The companion app continues to crash and keeps wanting to update after running updates the companion app then continues to crash more conductivity between the device and my smart phone is non-existent. The device in and of itself is very nice and functions very well however the device is practically useless to me without the necessary companion app. 2
Alittle slow but not bad.. 2
Worked fine for 1 month, after that, got stuck in the BLU logo and that's it. Sad :/ 3
Still kicking this was bought a long time now. 4
Product came exactly as described and couldn't be happier. 5
I am still getting used to it. It is unlocked but It was not rooted. It is subject to annoying "GSM Buzz" near my radio/TV/speakers. I like the dual SIM slots. I use one plan for voice and another for data/text. Or you can use each SIM for different countries services when travelling. The manual and warranty is in Chinese, but it's easy to figure out. It's a phone: Insert battery, Insert SIM, insert micro SD, insert charger cable, charge, tap on Settings. That's pretty much what a quick-start guide will say.The ear buds are cheap. So buy your own ear buds. 3
The phone came with a bad speaker I could return but not replace took it to cell repair place cost me another fifty dollars needed the phone.. 2
Its a very nice item to have and is good for the children to use as well, thanks! 4
Very happy with the product. Was delivered on time. Packaged well and everything that was described for example"unlocked T-Mobile phone" is exactly what I received 5
I like the phone but when I call somebody and I can hear them but they can not hear me. That sucks cuz I like to talk to people more than texting. Like I can't call work when I'm going to be late. I would have to text someone who going to work that day so they can say that I going to be late. 2
After much hesitation regarding purchasing anything electronic on the Internet, I decided to take a shot. Glad I did. This product came exactly as described and worked perfectly. Had to change it from Chineese to English but that's all. 5
Iphone arrived in perfect condition, looks absolutely brand new. Battery life is great and it seems that the phone has never been used. We activated on Tracfone using their BYOP sim card and had no issues. 5
Sneaky, asked for a new device sends any user device does not workDelays in delivery time. 1
Ear phone is not work 1
Great screen, slim and light. Occasionally gets quite warm. The reason for two stars is durability, it has none. The power switch quit after 14 months on the first phone. I've owned 20 or so phones and never had a power switch quit on me. I bought a second phone for a family member and the screen auto cracked. This is likely the reason it is only $100 now versus $240 a year ago. Great phone but do not expect it to last for more than a year. 2
This phone has given me trouble since the very beginning. First the audio had a great amount of static, that problem was partially resolved after a couple of resets. Then the dropped calls started happening, I live in the heart of the city and have never had carrier-related issues with dropped calls. Then finally a few days ago, screen went completely dead. Now, I am back to using an older phone and I have no idea what to do with the phone I purchased. I have never owned an iPhone with so many issues. The earphones fell apart within a couple of days. The box that it came in seemed a bit shady, I am really not sure if the merchandise I received is actually a true out of the box Apple product. 1
Nice phone IF you can live with dismal battery life....figure 1% of drain per minute for internet use and even more for HD video 2
i like this product because it was inexpensive and for a use phone it is in excellent condition cant tell the difference from a new one I had the phone 1 week but lovvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvve it , it is slim and light weigh i had a3g for 3 years and love it, this one is spectacular .The pictures are clear this really meets my expectations. the shipping is fast, buyers you don't have to wait long to begin enjoying it, 5
My first mistake was to buy the original iPhone five. If you're considering buying an iPhone five,don't waste your money on it. It has microphone issues. You have to make sure you're speaking directly into the microphone. With this recent replacement, it's so bad I have to use the speakerphone, which works good, but everybody around you here's your conversation.I'm sure it's not the same with all refurbished , but the one I bought has a low battery life. A full charge last for about 2 1/2 to 3 hours. I would definitely reconsider buying a refurbished phone.Please used phones are not cheap. 1
Sorry for the delay to feedback you....I was traveling...I really really like the product...It`s exactly how it was described....Thank you so much.... 5
I like iPhone 4 but at the time was looking for a 4s the iPhone 4g was in great shape... 4
not very good, did not last very long 4 months 2
Good quality and good price 5
For starters, this thing does not run LTE and barely runs 4G. The feel of the phone is a little cheap. Its not very heavy and you can take the back cover off really easily. The version of android is a little old but gets the job done. On the plus side it does come with some average headphones, an okay case and a screen protector. The main camera is okay, it doesn't handle movement very well. The front facing camera is terrible. And make sure that you get the 8 GB model because the operating system itself takes up like 2 GBs. Also make sure you get a SIM card adapter for this phone because it only accepts full size SIM cards, not micro or nano cards. There are lots of flaws on this thing, here's another: This phone can barely stay attached to wifi which means you constantly have to refresh the wifi in order to stay connected. Also the battery life is terrible and it can barely make it through the day. ALL that being said, it is only $120. And for $120 it is pretty good. Basically as soon as the Motorola Moto G 2nd GEN LTE comes out I'm ditching thing this because, as a temporary phone, its fine. I couldn't imagine using it every day though. 3
Had no problem whatsoever adding it to a pre-existing straight talk account. it works perfectly. thanks. 5
Wasn't able to download updates 2
Great deal. Looks good, works great! 5
Battery was dead when received, had to replace the battery. works fine afterwards. Works fine outside of US even it is ATT branded 4
Great phone and it works amazing for the trips and for everything I have needed it everything it said on offer was true and again it works amazing!! 5
The iphone 4 shipped quick and came with all accessories in the original packaging. The phone looked almost brand new but the home button did not always register. Ive heard that this issue is not that uncommon because lint and dust get trapped under the button. This was however a $315 phone listed as "like new" so I expected it to work flawlessly. This is my first amazon return but the process has been pretty easy so far. 3
Frequent crashes! Not reliable with catching available wifi! 2
I do like this phone, especially for the price, though there is a delay and some picture quality that I think could be improved. For the most part I am satisfied. NOW here is thing I had trouble with, my apn mms setting, and I'm on a NET10 plan. So if anyone else has had this problem I'm going to give you the information you need. Saves a lot of time.Go to SETTINGS and click on CELLULAR+SIMScroll down to SIM 1 SETTINGS and click on itScroll down to MANUAL INTERNET APN and turn it onThen click on EDIT INTERNET APN(Okay now this has to be set up exactly this way)APN: tfdataUSER NAME: NET10 (note- it must be in all caps)PASSWORD:AUTHENTICATION TYPE: PAPPROXY SERVER:PROXY PORT:IP TYPE: IPv4v6Now save it and click on EDIT MMS APN.APN: tfdataUSER NAME: NET10PASSWORD:WRAP GATEWAY(URL): mms3.tracking.comWRAP GATEWAY PORT: 80MMSC(URL): http://mms-tf.net/MMSC PORT: 80MAXIMUM MMS SIZE:IP TYPE: IPv4v6Now save and reboot your phone.Then you should be able to successfully get onto the internet and send mms. Hope this helps anyone on NET10 3
all well with the phone, was not broken or scratched, it was in its original packaging and was very pleased, but in the specifications of the seller did not say that this team does not have connection through wifi. 4
Just want I wanted and a great gift for my cousin. She really enjoys it for a great price too! Very happy. 4
Great phone nice practically new 4
It appears to have a battery issue.....Have not determined whether or not its a bad battery yet, but having difficulties holding a charge. 3
Like all bb devices. Impossible to turn off without removing battery. Good quality. Great size. I Hope they will update theOS. 3
Got on time. No issues in activating for Verizon. Phone is in excellent condition and works great! 5
if u have no ther option, then u better stay with no phone. Days 1 thru 3 were good. Then everything went downhill. The phone lags, it stutters, it freezes to the point where it begins to get hot and it locks up. The phone did feel ok in the hand. oh yeah and the speakers were good. 1
Battery was utter bad. the was battery was getting dried up every 1 one hour.. Also they said that phone was new but when we went to apple store they told that this was phone was refurbished.. 1
I have used one other Blu phone in the past. The Blu Studio HD LTE 6.0, that phone my friends, was awesome. About 8 months in though, the speaker stopped working and the Blu customer service asked me to send the phone in, however I was in the middle of a semester and did not want to part with my phone. A month after the one year warranty expired the phone just wouldn't charge and had to be replaced. After much searching, and realizing the Blu Studio 6.0 HD LTE was no longer sold on Amazon (i know the 6.0 HD is still sold) i settled on the BLU LIFE XL. I got the phone in the mail 2 days ago and set everything up and then i plugged in headphones to realize there was no sound. I tried with a couple of different headphones and still no luck. Will be sending it back. However, I will re-order just incase the complaint was just with the one specific device I received and I will update my review when I receive it.One other problem I noticed with this device is the gold tone on the sides. You cant really tell if it is gold or silver, which is a bad thing because it looks like the gold faded, not something I want in a brand new phone. 2
I wanted to like this phone. I was looking to upgrade a Nexus 4 to a larger screen and I read about the Blu Studio company and thought I'd give them a try.I didn't have high expectations. I already knew that it wasn't going to be as fast or as clear as my Nexus but I didn't really use my phone for games or HD video viewing. I did however, want a bigger screen so that I could get rid of my tablet and use a single device for everything, including surfing the web, reading books, etc.Everything worked better than expected. The screen was great. The initial setup was effortless, though I needed to buy a adapter for my micro SIM to mini SIM. I was very happy with the phone until I dialed in for a work conference call.The feedback and call quality were awful. I had to drop off b/c no one could hear each other b/c my phone was providing feedback. I returned the phone to Amazon.Maybe I got a bad one, somehow the phone I got had the seal on the box broken so not sure how that happened given it was shipped from Amazon. 2
I have just unbox this phone today and my sensation of it is great, look well built, runs fast and fluid, I really like it. Excellent piece of hardware for just 85 bucks. If you were hesitating to try Windows Phone, this is the time, this is the phone!Update!The device is well built and works OK, but after several month of use (Not as my main phone) I never get the device to use the 3G network, only Edge. Although it uses the correct bands 850/1900 for my 3G carrier/network provider (Movistar Venezueela) it just stays in E 3
I have had zero problems with the phone itself. I love Apple products and so far it stands up to any other I have had. The phone arrived sooner than expected, so as for the iPhone 6 it is a great device. 4
Very nice. The phone was as described. Honest seller 5
Pretty good since it was a present and I'm perfect condition 5
I was hoping chargers are included and headphones 4
It's was a scam!!!!! Becareful... 1
I wouldn't recommend this phone for long term use but it's okay if you need a temporary phone and this is your last resort. I lost my phone earlier this year and used this for a few weeks. It's relatively cheap but, of course, "you get what you pay for". Messaging is surprisingly difficult if you're used to more modern touchscreen phones. Given how difficult the touchscreen was to use I would have preferred an older phone with a keyboard. 2
Güzel ürün ama. Satıcı olumsuz ardarda iki telofon siparişi verdim biri geldi diğeri gelmedi 3
Ok when i got this it was in great condition. and it looked like it was barely used. but then as i was using it i realized that the silence/loud switch doesnt work, and neither does the location service, which made it really hard to get directions and i really needed that. but however it was very fast, there was no problem with the usb port or headphone jack, but it dropped a lot of calls. so i'm giving it a generous 3 stars but i wouldn't recommend it to others. 3
It only lasted 4 months before it stopped working. 1
Very good conditions and it's working great 4
The phone did not turn on plain and simple. This was a birthday gift for my son who was so excited to receive his phone and to our disappointment, it doesn't work. 1

Nice cell phone from Blackberry, very useful to check email, calendar, take pictures and keep all your contacts in one place. 4
Works as expected since I bought it several months ago. As everyone knows, it is bigger (but thinner) than the iPhone 5. Took it to Verizon and got it hooked up to our network without incident. Saved about $200 doing it this way (with a refurbished phone). 4
Looks new, no scratches are all, I recommend 4
no work, i do not recomend this item and the seller. 1
The phone is very decent for its price. But as with cheap products, there is always a downfall.1. The phone has gotten visibly slower than when it came. It has been only around two months and already its speed has decreased by a certain amount.2. This issue is the more disappointing one: The back squeaks and clicks when you press against it. This probably means that the back cover has gotten loose somehow. I have never dropped the phone, nor do I use it roughly. I am very gentle with it, and only after 1 month of use (the other month was spent on a trip), the back is already loose. I am very disappointed and the return period is already over.I was very hopeful for this smartphone, but it seems that there is a reason why higher end phones are priced the way they are. 2
I love it . It was what I needed . thank you very much. 4
I have no problems with the phone until now I see it has a 1 year warranty and I want to talk to u personally about that and what my problem is with the phone please contact my email habitofficialbizzness@yahoo.com if you cannot direct message me 4
I try to activate the iphone 4s in front of the Verizon wireless, but the service told me that the iphone 4s I just bought from Werehouse Deal is a stolen one!!!! 1
I received the phone. The screen was loose. The digitizer was non- responsive. It looked like it was put together in a backyard shack, by a bunch of blind elves. Simply put. It's junk. 1
An amazing experience indeed. And I will recommend amazon.com for my friends in my area for them to be able to share the same experience that I share now.. 4
It came perfectly fine with the charger and everything but I expected it to be unlocked. When I got it, and tried to take it to a phone service company, they said it wasn't unlocked so...yeah....good overall though. Works great. 3
I purchased a phone about 6 weeks ago and had nothing but issues. It was setup for sprint service but couldn't be added to the network. The phone was listed as 'lost or stolen'. I have since returned it and hope no one has to go through a similar experience. 1
the phone will not work 3g in venezuela, the software has glitches, no flash, OS 6 and basically like the 8520 but more expensive. however I got mine from cell lounge inc and they are great, excellent customer service. 3
Charger and headphone was not original 3
I bought this I-Phone for my dtr. but I had to return it because it couldn't be unlocked for any other network. phone is beautiful blue. great phone but we just didn't want to be on phone plan 3
I'M VERY PLEASED WITH MY PHONE! IT'S TOTALLY NEW AND IT HAS ALL THE ACCESSORIES!! THE ONLY SMALL PROBLEM WAS IT HASN'T THE INVOICE WHEN IT WAS RECEIVED BY MY COURIER CAUSING DELAY IN THE CUSTOMS HOUSE FOR THE CALCULATION OF TAX, BUT IN ALL THE LINES I FEEL HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT! 4
I'm still using this iphone now after purchasing it months ago, but the fingerprint unlocking mechanism stopped working less than a month in. It's a fine phone but I wish that aspect of it hadn't quit so soon. 4
Thank you for the wonderful phone. I was giving this phone as a gift and I really appreciate the great service 4
Arrived diligently . Phone was as new. I installed micro chip and called 5
THE PROBLEM IS THAT IT IS NOT 100% COMPATIBLE WITH T-MOBILE LTE. SINCE ONLY 2 GSM CARRIERS EXIST THE PHONE SHOULD BE FULLY COMPATIBLE WITH BOTH. THAT IS A MAJOR MINUS. 3
good for the price . not to compare with the actual good phone but good so far 3
I LOVE THIS PHONE. IT'S REALLY WORTH IT. AMAZON IS VERY EFFICIENT. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORKS PLEASE DON'T CHANGE. 5
It looksbrand new, and works perfectly. I live in a very rural area and my Galaxy SII got poor reception, but this iPhone is great. People can hear me just fine, and I do not experience dropped calls. I highly recommend it. 5
Great phone. Sadly its not 4G. And doesnt work as well yet has great features. 3
Doesn't do enough. I sold it on Ebay within 30 days of purchasing it. 2
Brought for my teenage daughter..she says she loves it! 4
I'm very disappointed with this smart phone. Too many features do not work! Only one SIM card slot works, keypad is a mess, the 8 and 5 are crossed, some letters are crossed and the battery has to be recharged very often and I could be considered an average phone user. I'm very disappointed with this purchase especially that I'm in the Caribbean and to make returns is difficult and expensive. 2
Only after one month the IPhone would no longer charge properly. I have to reset the phone every time I need to charge it. And the charge cord lasted half as long before it fell apart. Over all I love the phone and it was like new when it came in. Highly satisfied. 4
I did not realize that the phone was not unlocked and made ​​the mistake to buy it for the Sprint company. I live in Argentina , and wanted to know if you know any way to unlock it or I can send some code to do it? 4
I couldn't connect to wifi ???The wifi was grayed out. I was like seriously ??? Otherwise it was fine 3
Couldn't get it to recognize a sim card, had to return it 2
The sound is not loud enough on it 3
el telefono tiene una falla en el conector de carga, no es nuevo, yo soy comprador desde venezuela, por lo tanto no recomiendo comprar porque es muy riesgosoThe telephone has a fault in the connector of load, is not new, I am buying from venezuela, therefore I do not recommend to buy because it is very risky 2
This was my second phone from this seller. Both exactly as described. Fast shipping. GREAT!!! 5
The Phone had a dead pixel! :( 2
Phone does not hold a charge and shuts off at 40% batterie. 2
Phone looks fine but i need a sim card just to access the phone. That was a waste of time 3
I bought a used iphone 5s from the seller mobile shop USA. After 11 months of use, I wanted to change a battery. When I was trying to get the old battery out, the old battery in the phone exploded!! I warned everyone who wants to buy a used iphone. The battery is not original apple battery and it had lots of safety concerns. Apple says they are not responsible for this. And the seller won't issue me a refund because I am out of the one- month warranty. 1
I bought this for my sons 9th birthday, and he really likes it! 5
I love this phone. It is very lightweight with improved resolution and camera quality. The 64GB version leaves A LOT of space for music, photos, apps, etc. I used to own an iPhone 4S, and this is definitely an improvement. If you're looking for an affordable, spacious, durable phone, this is it. 5
Badly Seller, it is supposed that it is new and it it was not. I work 2 months. This does not serve. Swindlers 1
The iphone was 10/10 I dont have any problem and it works perfect, but the charger its not the original one, I just got one week and its already broken (I really like take care abouth my stuff) just that, service and time were great too. 4
its an ok phone for the price , runs very slow 3
I bought this phone to save a few bucks. At first it was a good phone. It was terrible to text on but I figured, it's a cheap phone so it not going to be perfect. And the memory is terrible. As many apps and pics I would delete I somehow never had enough to take another picture. Then after two months with the phone, it started turning off on its own. Then 2 days later it just didn't turn on again. So I wish I has just invested in a better phone to begin with cause now I spent $100 more that I should have. 2
My kids love these phones! They have used them for over 6 months without any problems. 5
When my phone broke and I wasn't eligible for an upgrade, I thought I was out of luck. Then I searched on Amazon and found this little thing, and I am so happy!!! Buying it refurbished it a lot better than used because it's basically a brand new phone. It looks and works perfect. It doesn't come with a SIM card, but I just went to a Sprint store and asked for one and they gave it to me for free!! I'm so happy with my purchase of this phone and I would definitely recommend buying from this company if you need a new phone but don't have an upgrade. Very fast shipping too!! 5
horrible reception in rural area because of design of antenna of all 5's! Stay away my 4 im back to cause its 3 g and amazing! 1
It's Ok! I went back to my old phone because so much was not working right on this phone and I haven't had time to call to see if it was a phone problem or phone carrier problem. I could call and receive calls, and text and receive texts, but none of the data would work, it wouldn't connect to the internet so I couldn't view anything nor download anything. I got an error with everything I tried. So I put my SIM card back in my old phone for now. When I have the chance, I'll try to see what's wrong with this phone because it seems like a really nice phone, and I love the size of the screen. 3
Great price for a great phone 5
Great phone! Worth every penny!Update.....After having the phone six months, it stopped working randomly one day. I tried plugging it into a charger and the only thing it would do was power cycle itself continuously. I reached out to Alcatel via e mail to no avail.I decided to send one last e mail threatening a report to the Better Business Bureau and I magically received 4 e mails in response from4 different people. Huh.....Long story short, they paid to ship the phone back to them to get fixed and it turns out they couldn't, so they have me a new one at no cost.It took a bit but they made right in the end. 4
Phone was blocked by T-Mobile as payment was not made for the phone or it was stolen. Service was disconnected once T-Mobile tracked the serial number. We are sending back to Amazon for refund. 1
there were multiple issues with the phone that was supposed to be refurbished. this was the first product I purchased through here that I can say was a waste of money and I order a lot. 1
THe Audio is very bad! I am returning it! 1
Phone did not hold a charge. 2 stars though for easily being able to return it. 2
Just received this phone in the mail like 30 minutes ago. It was packaged nice, phone was is perfect shape. Which is good because compared to some of these review, I was nervous about that. No scratches or nothing, the phone is new. I bought this phone for my husband, we share a phone at the moment and its to the point where I'm tired of it LOL! He said he didn't want nothing fancy just a little phone to text and talk on so I hope he likes it. It's not big in size but I don't think that'll be a big problem for him but anyways I have yet to activate it with the sim card and all but so far so good. Hope my husband likes it, if not I might be returning it for another phone and I don't feel like going through all that so fingers crossed LOL!If he likes it, I will be back for a further review!!!! 4
I originally picked this up as a costume piece, but I ended up using it when I dropped my smartphone. It's a fine device. The communication features are a bit limited, but it also includes a handful of nifty features most modern smartphone users will be used to.The phone only features a very dated network connection, no data options here. Voice calls and text messaging are available on the device, but email, internet, and other data connection features are not available. Even modern baseline options like visual voicemail are not featured here (of course, holding the 1 key will get you to your messages just like the old days).Voice quality is okay, a little quiet on the normal earpiece speaker, but the handsfree speakerphone has a respectable volume. The connection is not nearly as clear as you'll get on any smartphone though, and is not even comparable to a wifi-call. Texting on a classic dialpad is a bit of a pain, especially without something like T9 predictive text. There are multiple keyboard options, so most special characters should be covered.The device charges quickly via a micro USB port, though I have yet to find any way to use that to transmit data to the phones internal storage or expandable microSD storage. Speaking of, the device does allow for 32GB of expandable storage (on top of the measley 5.5KB of internal). You can load images, songs, and video to the device (though video may be restricted to the archaic .3gp file type - I've yet to experiment). The music player is pretty bare-bones, but it does allow for background play, and the phone has a 1/8" audio jack for headphones/auxiliarry output. You can also pair with blutooth devices and play audio that way, but the quality is very bad. I haven't done any testing with a blutooth headset, but I imagine it would not have any issue using that.Some weird things with the phone I've noticed include a lack of a discreet volume setting. Instead, the phone has 4 ring profiles - General (normal), Silent (no ring/vibrate), Meeting (vibrate), and Outdoor (loud). Custom ringtones are possible with any mp3 audio file you load on the device, which is nice, but you cannot update the text message notification tone.The calendar function on the device is nothing more than a date tracker. You can view a calendar, but cannot make any appointments. There are also 5 alarms that can be set simultaneously, with custom day repeat options.The camera sucks. Not much else to say about that.I haven't used the Dual SIM feature, since I only have one SIM card, but my AT&T card works without any issues in both slots (located inside the battery compartment). Battery life is great as well, lasting well over a day - my battery indicator shows, at worst, 2/3 battery left after a full day (though that's probably because I only play music from it for about 1-2 hours during the day and maybe a few texts - still better than my iPhone used to do).It's not a bad backup phone (though BLU makes budget smartphones too, so that might be a better option), and I'll be keeping it on-hand in the future. Just in case. :) 3
When the phone states that it is UNLOCKED, that means it should work. But since this is with Sprint that can't be done. So therefore the phone is nothing but a big Ipod and useless. Let buys be ware, When Iphones are purchased through Sprint they can't be transferred to another service. This sucks as you can never get out or away from Sprint. Hook line and sunk - you are stuck 2
It worked fine for about a week. It just stopped working and I don't know what to do about it. I bought this phone for my husband, who is one Hospice, because he has trouble using a smart phone. Now he's back struggling with it. 2
Extremely disappointed that this was received the first part of September and the screen is literally falling out of the phone. I've never seen anything like it before. My son saved his hard earned money to buy this product and not even 3 months later it is junk. Hope to find someone that can help us to get it fixed. :(Just took the phone to get fixed today and found out the phone is total junk! The battery is swollen and ready to explode. The parts inside were broke and some screws were missing. I watched the man open the phone and was in total shock! I can't believe we were scammed so badly. This was NOT a new phone! 1
Works great whenever it stays connected to my Samsung Note 3. Unfortunately the BT connection is sporadic and unreliable even when it's only a few inches away from the phone. The watch must have a poor BT transceiver or it's incompatible with Android's Lollipop OS. The price is only a little more than I would pay for a cheap watch so I guess I can't be too disappointed. 2
Bought it for my niece. She loves it! 5
Really good buy... It does show a lil use on the sides n a few minor nicks, a bumper can easily cover up screen n back are in perfect condition the fone really is unlocked n for half the price it normally goes for i would highly recommend them.. And I got the phone before the estimated delivery day very pleased with my new iPhone 5
Overall has proven to be as advertised includind a true T-Mobile, unlocked phone, unlike other phones out there. Disappointment was that the keyboard was faulty from the start (not uncommon with the 9900) so I replaced it with a spare I had and it has been fine since. 4
Very undone. Speaker was blown, front facing had to replaced as well as the battery after I found out it was an aftermarketed replacement that was too thick for the facing to seat correctly. Overall spent over $200 to have it in basic standings 1
I was happy when i received my package from the mail. The box and its content came in an excellent condition. Though I was quite disappointed on how long it took to reach i'm still happy i got it. 3
This arrived before time. Was as per the description. 4
I wanted an iPhone 4s that was used on verizon network that works with Tracfone. This is the one. 5
I found it opened box and fingers on screen 2
I just received the Blu Energy X plus yesterday, so I may update later. So far, I am satisfied with the phone, it is well worth the $125 I paid for it.Pros:- nice large screen, great definition (no iPhone 6 but still HD)- Android Lollipop is much nicer than the previous KitKat 4.4- Battery life is great, though not as good as its predecessor Blu Energy.- Given the screen size, this phone is surprizingly light -- lighter than both the original Blu Energy and iPhone 6 plus.Cons:Only 1 G of RAM, sometimes it's a bit choppy but decent performance.I like Lollipop but hate the the "colorful" icons. I recommend downloading Zero Launcher, much nicer icons. Or any other launcher, lots of free launchers out there.There isn't any decent case for the BLU Energy X Plus... yet, but hopefully Amazon will market one soon.I will update this in a week or two if there are any issues.Update: the screen size is 5.5 inches, but the actual display on most apps is only 5": There is a black bar on the bottom of the screen, so in reality the screen size is not much larger that its predecessor, Blu Studio Energy -- I feel cheated! 3
the phone doesn't even starts, it doesn't work, please let me know what I have to do to solve this. 1
The only thing that stops me from giving it 4 stars is due to the lack of a lock functionality so buttons do not get pressed by accident. Otherwise, this is a good cheap basic phone for my elderly parents. 3
I love this phone easy to use,don't like the Calendar layout as much as on my IPhone 3 but found another Planner app that works fine.The only downside is that the battery needs to be charged everyday,I was told by others later that this is a problem with this phone 4
Love the iPhone but the one I bought had visible signs of water damage in the inside I had to replace the battery did myself while I was doing that the screen cracked had to buy a new one on one of the metal covers there was rust and the charger that came w it literally stopped working 2 days after I got it I told seller they sent me 2 more both quit too but then again I bought my phone used 3
RECIBI MI BLACK BERRY GEMINI 8520, COMO LO QUERIA, SOLO QUE AL ABRIRLO Y QUERER COLOCAR LA BATEIRA RESULTA QUE NO CORRESPIONDIA AL BLACK BERRY 8520, SI NO AL MODELO 8900, CREO QUE DEBERIAL REVISAR LOS EQUIPOS ANTES DE DESPACHARLOSYO COMPRE DESDE VENEZUELA, AHORA DEBO COMPRAR UNA BATERIA PARA PODER USAR. AUN ASI RECOMIENDO AL VENDEDOR. CON CUATRO ESTRELLAS 4
The screen was scratched quite a bit. I expected that of the casing but not of the screen since, it seems that everybody uses a screen protector now a days. The rest was fine. 3
Phone with many issue. For one thing, not all the letters work when texting. Randomly switches screens. I'm not a high tech person and tried to live with it...ended up being so frustrated I turned it off and filed claim. However claim was a few days past 30 day guarantee and GizmoTraders wouldn't exchange it. SHAME ON AMAZON TOO because they advertised 90 day A to Z guarantee on this product which of course led me to believe they would guarantee a good resolution for problems of defective merchandise but that was not the case! They said said claim filed after 30 days...OUT OF LUCK and see our fine print! 1
The post of my package was very delayed, and the quality of the phone is not good, about 3 months later, the screen always freezed and cannot work. But, when I contacted the seller, his response was quick and finally let me replaced a new one. Anyway, my feeling is much better now.Add two stars. 3
I had high hopes for this phone...I love a good phone camera..I was upgrading (so I thought) from a Samsung Note 3.... I had it 2 days...its on its way back....SLOW....LAGGING....SPINNING WHEELS ON NET ...BATTERY LIFE SUCKS.....other than that its great! 2
Great Buy, arrived in very good Condition with charger, set it up in Minutes 😍😍😍😍👍👍👍👍Made my 10 years old daughter Happy! 5
I got this product at the end of September and it worked for about 3 weeks until one day lines appeared on the screen and it is now defective. I would not recommend buying this product unless you want a broken iphone. 1
Some functions is not working :( 3
something was clearly wrong with the phone, it would not hold a charge. after buying a new battery and installing the next day the phone the screen went blank and has not worked since. I have since had to purchase another phone. Not Happy! 1
Very nice item,very useful,thanks a lot 2
Phone works well, no problems does exactly what a 5c apple phone should do. I have phone for months now. No scratches no marks on phone, came with a wall charger & great bargin price. 4
Awesome condition and shipping was fast. The only downside is the battery life of the phone is pretty low. 4
Great value for $$. Works in U.S. and Europe without any problems. 4
When I received it, it didn't come with SIM card and the speaker in the phone didn't work, so I couldn't hear anything. It also wouldn't make a call. The phone looked in new condition, but unfortunately didn't work. But I returned it with no questions asked and the process was very easy. 1
It's a phone, doesn't have very much internal memory. Only can install a few apps. 3
I had to return the first one because of a bad speaker. There was no directions of how to use some of the features. 2
This phone has no battery life. I check a few emails and go on the internet a few times and the battery never lasts the day. 2
Apparently has a short lifetime since everyone it gonna stop supporting 2g 3
I dropped it on the "carpet" a few weeks after getting it and it the screen cracked. Scratches on screen - not super noticeable but made it easier for the the screen to break.The actual phone size is nice. Not too big, not too small. 3
Received iphone5c an was locked needs password to open did not say this in description 1
not buying! It does not work: does not play audio from videos or ring when they call, no charge! and I am now in Colombia and I can not return it! And Amazon is not responding! 1
Bought the iPhone for my female mate, but I do not use iPhone. A few months after the purchase, the iPhone is still working properly as like new. What a great purchase here! 5
the phone does not work!! 1
It doesn't work it sucks 1
the volume of calls is very low. I not hear almost nothing. 2
Great price for a great phone 5
Not happy with the phone did meet my expectations did work very well 3
the same as advertised brand new!. all the part was in the box that came with it. i was impressed with the delivery part of it the most. 4
battery life is not impressiveno charging status light, you don't know if its charging unless you look a home screen.WiFi is very weak, takes long to detect.the rest is ok android os work alrite. for the price it works! 2
at first look all was ok but one of the phones had some troubles with tactil display, i was about to return it but i had to travel and the waranty expires! i had to take it to a bb center and they fix the problem. Also the phone was suppose to be NEW but it was refurbished! I dont recomend. 2
I gave it 4 star... it was a excellent 4
Good as a starter phone for my in laws. The features and specs are not quite up to par considering the price, but it seems to be near impossible to find a good 'smart' phone without having to buy one overseas (India/China). Not too worries about the warranty or it breaking. 3
Perfect phone for regular smart phone user. 5
Arrived as pictured in a few days via USPS. The connector jack at the bottom was a little dirty but, after cleaning it with a toothpick and alcohol, connection anomalies disappeared. Works fine now. I just popped the T-Mobile SIM card out of my old phone and into the new one and it started right up. It came loaded with iOS 8.1 and the overall condition of the case was very good. Did not come with earphones but I usually replace them every few months anyway. 4
my opinios is for seller recellulartoo, he always sold to my, but for the begining very good all is ok, but now when you bought quantity like 30 or 50 mobile always mobile the 10 or 15% come defective, for example usb, awful, if you want buy one is good, but if you want bouy 20 or 30 items.. you need to know that always 10 or 15% come damage or defective. 2
Very helpful when I had the issue and then phone started working on its own. When I originally contacted them I was not happy with the response but as soon as I wrote the review they were more than happy to help me with my issue and it was corrected quickly. 4
Phone was in good condition, but it was described as unlocked and it wasn't 3
This is my 5th Blu phone, and if you can get these phones when they are on sale, then they are a great value for your money.First things first1) This phone does not run lollipop, and you cannot update to lollipop as well (as of now).2) It comes with 4.4.2, and Blu put a lollipop wallpaper, pretending its running lollipop.3) I assume the lollipop update is coming sometime in future, but why put upgradable to lollipop everywhere and make false advertising...Other than the gripes above, this phone is worth $80, runs pretty much stock android and you have all the features you want (dual sim, FM radio, tethering, 5.5 inch 720p screen etc). Phone comes with a soft plastic case, pre-installed screen protector and an additional screen protector as well.I have T-Mobile, and get a decent reception. Internet Tethering works great and battery lasts almost 2 days. I did not like the default launcher, as the icons are too big and wont let me slide to left. I replaced it with Nova launcher, and icons and screens are crisp now. I put a 64GB Samsung Evo SD card, and the phone detected it on reboot.Great phone when on sale. 3
Great phone once flashed with Superzen to rid of the bloatware. But not so great build quality. 4
Great phone!! Very nice quality! 5
My friend brought it to me at work after i ordered it on Amazon as we work together overseas and i live in Johannesburg. When i got home and tested the phone the microphone doesnt work. So you can hear but no one can hear you. Now im stuck with it because how would i get ut back to Texas? Very unhappy with the product 1
I bought this phone to replace one of the same model that got destroyed. Popped in my SIM card and everything worked just as it should. No problems with phone, material, or sender. Very happy with purchase. 4
I was looking forward to the Vivo 5 but I was actually very disappointed and returned it.First off their "gold" is actually more of a ROSE GOLD. So it was more pink than gold. The AMOLED screen is clean and wasn't as great as reviewed, its way too oversaturated. The reds appear orange making skin tones in video look natural. Scrolling through Instagram, I could see the 720p screen pixelate pictures. The speaker was very loud and clear which I liked.As for camera, I have a Blu Life One (2015) and figured the Vivo will be just as good if not better, but it was actually a downgrade. The 3GB RAM was good, made phone overall nice and snappy, no lag. I ended up returning it and getting the Honor 5X. Its not as snappy (less RAM) but has so many more features (fingerprint scanner), 1080p screen with better / natural colors, better camera.I would say if you are looking for a 5.5" budget phone, Vivo 5 and Honor 5X are good buys, but it comes down to preference. 2
When I bought this phone but wanted something cheap, but just 15 days after the cell phone does not work at all.Why I evaluate it as ***: because Im from Mexico and in the BLU company in Mexico let me to fix it with the invoice of Amazon, that was great because is not a common practice in my CountryThanks and Regards 3
If your an Apple customer you'll love it , just like new , no scratches or appearance of usage .Be sure to have your sim card ready for it ... Comes in box with all accessories needed. 4
Wouldn't connect to wifi. I spent SO much money on this and for what? A phone that wouldn't connect to wifi. Rip off. 1
Phone came in decent condition, however, came with a battery problem. Phone would not charge, so I replaced the battery, which was an unconvienent expense. 2
After I got my SIM card (on Jan 03 2014) and inserted it into the phone, i got a message stating "SIM Card Blocked. Your Device is Network locked. Contact your service provider." The phone was NOT unlocked as stated. I had to spend TTD $400 (app USD$64.00) to get my phone unlocked. This is absolutey ridiculous. I would like to get a refund of this amount as it was no fault of mine that the phone was not Unlocked. The name of the phone/Product name that i ordered stated "Blackberry Q10 Black 16GB Factory Unlocked, International Version". 2
great product and works well for me at the moment. I am enjoying the features and learning new things with it 5
Advertised as new but was definitely used before. The phone wouldn't connect to itunes or even my computer. The phone wasn't even showing up in the device manager at all, not even as an unknown device. A day after receiving the phone, the screen got lots of white streaks on it and starts flashing uncontrollably. Basically the phone I received was unusable. 1
Exactly what I expected, the phone worked great for 5 months. Then the camera stopped working,and a short time later the screen would fade to black. I would have to restart the phone to get the screen back and then for just a short time. It was apparent that it was refurbished very poorly or not at all !! Don't buy from this seller 1
usb cable was damaged and did not come the memory card if the phone is in perfect condition thanks you very much 3
This phone is nice i just got one for my daughter but wen it came the charger didn't work I had to go buy a new one 4
Hello Amazon I just received BLU Studio 5 (cool) and I power it up and the phone is locked (not good).I need the password to get into the Phone, the screen say’s to (Type password to decrypt storage)Please advise.Sam Lopez 2
This phone doesn't play Windows WMA music files unlike all of the other Android phones that I have owned. I now have have to go and convert thousands of songs to a format that this phone will play needless to say I am not happy about that. The phone is supposed to have fast charging if you use the charger that came with the phone but mine doesn't seem to be working. Other than that I haven't had any problems with the phone. The camera is better than I expected it is actually takes better photos than the point and shoot cameras which my employer provides. The speakers are loudest that I have heard on a phone the sound quality is above average although not as good as boomsound. 3
Device did not work to its potential 1
home button messes up a lot! 3
If U don't have an iPad, U don't have an iPad ;)I recommend getting the 64GB... Once U go Apple U won't go Back 5
This is my first blackberry ever and I'm in love with it. I love how thin this phone is. It perfectly fits in a woman's hand.Shipment:The shipment was delayed, but just for a day. Maybe its because of the carrier that's shipping it. So I dont blame the seller or amazon. :)What comes in the box: (I'll just include this since I don't find it in the ad) :)*blackberry curve 9360*EM1 battery*2gb micro sd (it's already inserted inside the phone)*usb cable*2 charger adapter (this is sooo cool.. i like it)*headset*manuals :) 4
After about three weeks of use, I noticed the battery running out very quickly. Now, sometimes it goes from 68% to dead instantaneously, and sometimes it will stay on 1% for hours.I know it was refurbished, but I didn't expect the battery to fail that quickly. I'm disappointed, to say the least, and the phone is no longer eligible for return. 2
I wanted to get my young daughter a phone that was in between smart and dumb. Blackberry is right in the middle. It looks great, sleek and smooth, slips easily into a pocket. Blackberry store has a bunch of apps too including whatsapp.So far so good. Second day phone wouldn't start. Tried everything. Then it started. Thought we were good. Two days later it happened again only this time it wouldn't start at all. Bought a new battery. Worked like a charm. 2 days later same thing all over.My daughter actually liked it because it wasn't what everyone else has and the physical keyboard was great but it wasn't reliable. What good is an unreliable phone.Too bad. I really wanted it to work. Supplier did refund me though. 2
This phone is big and heavy. Totally diffefent from the BLU Vivo Air. 3
It's just not as good as my other one. 2
Only one sim port visible, have to switch the sim card, time means that it not s dual as was marketed. 2
Disappointed, my phone came in yesterday with a cracked screen. 1
It's exactly as was described! I love it! It looks brand new! Came super fast and the sender was very easy to communicate with! On top of that, it was actually a 32 GB phone. The price was more than a deal! I would by from them again. 5
Its OK just wasn't what I expected 3
I had it for 2 weeks And now its broken can i request another one out of my warranty 3
Phone was cool my current phone is with boost mobile so I couldn't switch over to use this phone because its not compatible battery is good though the phone is big but nice. I would give 5 stars if I was able to use boost mobile 2
Even though i chnrged the cellphone for an hour, i am not able to turn on the cellphone. 1
I bought this phone in 2012 nd it got stolen that same year. But I loved it. I got a iphone now 4
Phone was still owned by previous owner and his/her name wasn't clear from at&t, therefore have trouble activating the phone.Update: Resolve when speak with at&t representative, showing them the receipt that I purchase this phone. 1
Fast ship. This is my first and last iphone. Always been a android and windows phone power user. My 2003 windows phone out performs this I phone 4s. $100 is to expensive for this product. Bad wifi. This phone has to be left right next to wifi source because of disconection issues and poor preformance . Bad bad battery life. I leave this phone on airplane mode and only listen to slacker radio via wifi. With that said, the battery last close to 4 hours. Only one speaker works. This being my first iphone I don't know if it's an iPhone problem or the seller problem. This product comes with a cheap charger. If you really need to buy this product, buy yourself an extra charger. My charger lasted a week even with the fact that this phone get very little use. My review is based on the fact that I only use it to listen to slacker radio via wifi. From this experience I can only imagine how fast the battery will die if I turn the airplane mode off. On a rating scale. I give this product a Very bad out of a bad bad 1
Bad experience, the phone comes in a horrible case. It is not the original, also battered . The phone says VERIZON everywhere. I do not recommend to buy it . Just bring the cel and charger, there seems to be new ./ Mala experiencia, el telefono viene en una caja horrible. No es la original, ademas de maltratada. El telefono dice VERIZON por todas partes. No recomiendo que lo compren. Solo trae el cel y el cargador, no parece que sea nuevo. 2
I ended up getting a phone that only worked when it was plugged in. Called the company and they never call you back. 1
The calling started glitching after a week and noone can hear me on the other line, alot of bugs and problems, starting to become real slow also 1
Haven't figured out how to make it work yet. 2
Suppously it come in an original box and with handsfree and data cable, and it doesnt come with it. I will wait for your answer. 3
Great for the price but the phone does not respond when plugged in to charge. To answer calls I must first unplug it. 3
Product I returned it , it was locked because it was reported stolen. Sprint the informed me the device will not work because it's looked because it's stolen item. 1
Does not charge or turn on. 1
The phone was in excellent condition except for a few minor scratches. I had no problems having it activated. The phone also arrived on time. 5
was not as stated , could only use one carrier. liked the phone but unable to use since I use att. 2
Phone is working on, I was planning to use it for whatsapp anyway. The oh problem, I can't change the idiom 5
the product comes in perfect terms, in time and shape. The only problem that i have with the BLU was reset and the screen in grey 2
bought this as a gift for my mom's bday, she absolutely adores it, much better than her previous iphone 4, fast and sleek, standard apple product, i might get the pink for myself, shipped super quick, will do business again 4
The phone looks nearly new and very well taking care. Everything works great and I couldn't be more happier. I went to Metro PCS and put the sim in and transferred my number to it without any issues. The 4G LTE is great on here all in and around the Houston Tx area 5
Phone is almost pristine condition and works great . Exactly as it was advertised . Great price and worth it. 5
BLU Studio G LTE smart phoneFor $100 it is good deal, size ok, 2 SIM slots, 2500ma battery, unlocked, comes with screen protector, and protective cover. Loaded with Android 5.1.1, and respond fast. reasonable weight. it allows you to choose the SIM 1 or 2 to use for dialing out.The Android 5.1.1 is annoying (and I used almost every version that came out on other phones).The sound is week (in max volume and/or on speaker), sometimes is hard to hear the other person (especially when there are background noise).The phone drain the battery fast, even when location, Wi-Fi, and data are OFF. It will last full day when the above services are off, before need to be recharged.The battery is not removable, so you have to recharge it during the day, if you use Wi-Fi, data and location for GPS.The 3 starts is because of battery, week sound, and Android 5.1.1. 3
Bought the phone. Took it to Verizon to activate it and they said it was not Verizon compatible. Nice. 1
had to return the replacement too. hangouts crash, static on voip based calls, device heated up..... 2
The product worked great for the first 6 months. After that, the phone started to move slower and slower. After a year, the phone will not power on or charge. Thinking of getting a newer model, but not sure being as though this one did not hold up. Very disappointed. 2
I ordered this product for my parent, they like it a lot. Looks great, works fine! The blue color is really nice! 3
This phone was a gift for my girlfriend and from what i'm hearing, she is enjoing every moment of it. 4
I didn't read the fine print it's not USD it's all in Chinese I'm going to have to send it back 3
Stick with nokiaI like Windows phones (don't like Windows computers) and have had them in the past. I admit I'm worried because of the other reviews I have read and this is the first time I have strayed from Nokia phones (now made by Microsoft). I'm giving it 5 stars and will redo if phone doesn't work as one would expect. This is day one, Jun 25th, 2016. July 4th and still happy as a clam. Added second sim card today (AT&T) original Sim is T-Mobile. All going well, I presently do not have lte on the AT&T network but I believe that is because of the location I'm in, I'll update this if there is an issue when I get back to civilization. A few miles away from where I was and I received 4G LTE so all is great with both the SIM from AT&T and T-Mobile. Jul 9th and I am still in love with this phone. I should mention that if your big on downloading apps for your phone not all apps are made for the windows phone. Great phone, just didn't take off with people and I'm sure it is because of the app issue.Still the best phone, I dropped it into the toilet the other day, figured it was toast but pulled it out within a few seconds and it is still working.The case supplied with the phone seems to have kept it dry. Don't do this intentionally but know it survived at least once for me. 2
Cons : A lot of Bloatware and lags on the system. Camera and gallery launch very slow, andros 5.0., no buttons backlit, poor updates ..Pro: quality camera, gesture system, storage 3
Phone came with a just a USB charging cord that did not work 2
phone did not work when I got it. Sent it back to CHINA and the seller will not refund my money. Money wasted. 1
Some refurbished phones don't come with a new battery...this one obviously did cause it runs for 3 days without a charge. it has not malfunctioned since i got it 2 months ago and i did get a silicone/hard plastic combo case that saved it twice. great buyI don't need to fall for the phone of the month hype... and make iphone richer just give me one the works well.. 5
this phone worked for a week and a half and then froze in the middle of the night while charging and never came back on again. 2
The display is actually quite impressive even for a 200 dollar phone. Change it to Vivid settings and i kid you not looked amoled (which i prefer) But that was the only good thing. This phone is thick. no joke and heavy. with no apps running and eveything completely closed my RAM was running ar 2.3 gb our of 3. Do ANYTHING for more than 5 minutes and its boiling hot. Did i have a lemon maybe but between the size, heat and a horrendous camera. if its not perfect lighting it will look like a flip phone picture. I would not buy this phone. lose a gig of RAM and get the Honor 5X. its what i did. 2
Great phone nice practically new 4
Have been using the phone for a week. My observations; I'm using the phone with Metropcs, purchased a SIM card at Walmart for 10 dollars. To avoid paying the $15 charge at a Metro store, installed the card and got it connected over the phone. Text and voice were working but could not get data to work. Called Metro twice and still not working. Came across a google search that had the APN settings. (but not for this phone ) I think what made it work was turning on IPV6.The phone works and it's reasonably fast, but the battery life sucks. Last only a few hours with moderate use. Let's face it, a smart phones gets used a lot by most people. If you want a phone that the battery last, this phone is not for you.The camera is not that good, it takes high resolution pictures but they seems out of focus and colors are not life like.The display is good and video plays well on it, again can't see watching a 2 hour movie on it because of the battery life.Conclusion, if you can afford a bit more money then don't buy this phone. If you max is no more than $200 you can do worse.Update: Removed gmail app, bettery lasted the whole day. The GPS does not work. Installed GPS monitoring tool and can see that the signal is constantly being lost. Will call BLU tech support and see what they say. ( Other reviews claim the same GPS issue) 3
The phone I order was not the one I get in the mail,i order a 9900 and I got a 9930 instead so please see what can be done fix this for me. 3
Good purchase, phone was as advertised. 4
Wonderful. This was a brand new phone seals in its original box. 5
They always were kind and kept in touch about whatever I needed about this order. They helped me and everything was great. 5
So first phone I received had some problems, but they were very cooperative at getting me a new one and I got it very fast. This phone has blown me away with what you get with the price. The audio is amazing its up there with the HTC one m8 in my opinion. Only complaint I have is that the original one I recieveced had very nice jbl headphones, and the second one had much cheaper headphones. That doesn't concern the phone but that was quite the disappointment. Had the phone for several months now and I still hold it in the highest regard. Blows the HTC one I had before this, out of the water in every way. And now its 30$ cheaper then when I got it. Even more of a steal. 5
Needs more memory and the screen isn't bright enough in sun 3
I just love this peace it's so BEAST 5
I am one of the few that switched from an android device (Galaxy S3) to BB10, and I am satisfied with the experience!About me: non-techie, not into gaming, not into tweeting, twittering, facebooking, or instagraming. I need a productivity tool for managing my part-time business, full-time job, and social contacts.Despite years of trying, I will never be able to function without a physical keyboard. I tried it with tablets, and I tried it with phones. Just. Does. Not. Work. No matter how sophisticated the "swype" technology or voice input, I never got what I needed out of a virtual keyboard.Enter this older-model Blackberry Q10, with the BB OS10. I like the build, love the keyboard, and with a bit of a learning curve, excellent usability for my purposes (a tool, not a toy). I figured if I liked OS10 enough I could upgrade to the newer "Classic" or "Passport" when prices dropped a bit. So far so good.I use it with AT&T prepaid service and get very good coverage. I am able to use the Amazon store for apps which I believe are android-based, but have not tested out that functionality yet.I subtracted one star because in some respects it's a little slower than my android device that is the same age. It doesn't lag or crash, but things like booting up, transferring data, or doing a a factory reset seem to take FOREVER compared to my S3.There is no "home" button so the user will need to get used to controlling the device with hand gestures. I have found that this feature makes multi-tasking surprisingly easy, rather than hitting "back" a million times or having to force close all of my apps to clear them out. I don't miss the gigantic screen or the gigantic footprint (I have a tablet for apps like Netflix when I am traveling).The transition was made easier with an app called "Device Switch" that essentially imports data from phone to phone wirelessly.A warning to buyers: I initially bought this phone "refurbished" from BREED, fulfilled by Amazon. It was described as factory unlocked and refurbished and came as neither. It was a T-mobile branded phone with significant cosmetic damage and speaker malfunctioning. I promptly returned and bought NEW (from a different seller).Overall I am happy with my final purchase.UPDATE:After a few weeks I can safely say my initial reaction remains the same. This is a quality phone. The security is excellent. Most android apps are available and generally functional (not 100% perfect mind you) through Amazon App Store. My favorite part of this phone (besides battery life & keyboard) is the native apps that come pre-loaded on OS10: weather, flashlight, maps, alarms, and a barcode scanner. They all work smoothly unlike my prior android device, where I had to often download 3rd party apps that made my phone buggy and sluggish.One drawback is that the screen could be a bit bigger. Though I love that it's small and sturdy, sometimes the hand gestures are not recognized correctly due to the size of the screen. For example, if I want to select some text in a message draft, I inevitably hit the "attachment" or "smiley" icon. Someone with larger hands might not find this so easy to work with.Otherwise, great job Blackberry! The ridicule for "downgrading" is well worth my peace of mind and productivity. 4
I liked the phone. But, there was something wrong with it. Had to return for a refund. 2
I posted a good review and that same day my touch screen wouldn't work! It was fine for two weeks, then all of a sudden the touch screen stopped for half a day, worked fine again, stopped, worked, on and on. Took it to a store and they said the screen was bad, that it would be 120 for a new one. Now I have to wait until they receive my return to get my money back to get another phone. So this left me very sad and inconvenienced. 1
Over all, it's a decent phone, but there's some downsides to it.1. The camera is not going to beat any of the flagship cameras or really any dedicated digital camera.2. It does get hot from time to time (it seems there's similar reports for phones running the Snapdragon 615 chip, so that's the likely culprit).3. Although the screen is very bright, I've noticed it seems washed out from time to time.Aside from these downsides, I think it's still a decent phone over all. Call quality has been good for me. The phone has been plenty fast for most of my tasks which center around web surfing and checking out Facebook. And the battery life is much better than my ancient S3. Over all, it's a phone I would buy again even if Alcatel doesn't provide regular updates (so far according to Reddit it can be rooted and the boot loader seems to be unlocked, so if you feel like experimenting with Cyanogenmod, it may be worth the trouble) in respect to the price. 4
Good phone for the price. 4
Couldn't ask for a better one,my girlfriends having no problem with it whatsoever. 5
It came on time was happy about it but the charger was not the right one sad can't use it. The surface looks good no scratches but the speaker is not working well when making a call . 3
The phone is not working. 2
Its a nice,beautiul ,strong and durable cell phone and and very practical to my needs 5
I requested a factory unlocked iphone. I received a factory LOCKED iphone instead. 1
Its is not unlocked its verizon i wasted my money had to buy another one but looking for an ipod buy it 3
It couldn't send or receive mms 3
First, the imei number on the box DOES NOT match the one on the phone. Second, on the box it says it's a "16gb" iphone while it is actually a 64gb one. Third, there is a scratch on the iphone!!! See my picture attached below. Thought it's not a major one but it could mean some body damage inside this phone. Furthermore, there's bubble in the protective screen film which is really uncommon for a new phone.One more thing, the battery is out when I received the phone. I owned almost a dozen of Apple products and none of them had ZERO battery when I received it.And most importantly!!! After 20 minutes charging, I couldn't even open it! 1
I have enjoyed my Nokia C3 phone for a few years, but it was tired and needed an update. This Asha 302 phone is just that - all of the Symbian S40 simple goodness, with a much higher quality set of hardware. The screen is sharper, processor faster, phone takes nice clear pictures that are pretty much good enough, the ring and alert tones are more discreet and professional. The internet and mail stuff is actually useable on T-Mobile's 3.5G network and requires very little data to stay connected on a minumal plan. Strangely, I cannot it do wifi yet ... it receives the signal but just insists on using network data or nothing at all. Probably a setting in the menu I have not toggled to the right setting. Anyway - if you want a phone that texts very easily, has a 4-day battery, a very convenient and useable features, and yet not crack open the crack-pipe of the internet constanly, the Asha 302 does it with style and then some. I may get myself another one or two for the future, as I bet this is the end-run for this type of practical phone. 5
This Used phone was defective and returned for refund – touch screen did not work. Ordered second phone from Gazelle with success. Other than inconvenience, the whole process was completed in about 2 weeks without additional problems. My only issue was that Gazelle did not aid in finding a replacement – Sorry about that but you can order another phone if you want. 1
Great Product! Great service and fast shipping. Recommended. 5
False advertisement. Phone is not unlocked. 1
The phone works great!!! Although, a few days after I received the phone, the charger that came with it stopped working. I was sent a new charger and it charges my phone very slowly. I let them know again and they are sending me another charger. They help solve their customers problems and I highly recommend you buy their products. HAPPY BUYING (: 5
I really liked this phone. it worked well for me...until it didn't I had it for a week and was loving every minute and then I went to work one day and went to turn it on after work and it wouldnt wake up. I would hold the power button it would flash and then back again. I really wanted it to work well for me. I'm considering trying it again but I havent decided if it is worth the hassel. 2
it did come to my home on time. it is a nice cell phone. i like this cell phone. it is greet. 5
I didn't really like it. But before I get into it, I will say that the two things I did enjoy were the overall handsome, sturdy look and feel of the phone and the vivid brightness of the screen, which was easy on the eyes and battery life (even with the Night Filter app running). Other than that, the camera was OK.The thing I found myself getting very annoyed at was having to tap an icon or option more than once just to activate it. For example, I had Google Maps and several other apps open. There was no lag at all. But when I hit the recent apps key to get rid of a few apps (I had to tap that a couple of times), some of the apps I tried to swipe away would open because the screen was not as responsive to my quick touch. Another example was in the phone settings, when tapping on the categories, a firmer touch than what I'm used to was required to get to the next screen.Compared to the BLU Studio Super Camera I've been using for the past couple of months, which is pretty fast and responsive, the C5+5 seems lethargic. It definitely has some touch factor issues. The phone is not buggy; rather, it's just quite cumbersome when it comes to standard touch operations like scrolling and selecting.I guess what I thought might be a slightly better device than my fast Super Camera, turned out to have more of an entry-level feel to it. Even though it looked nice and felt sturdy in my hand, it was actually quite dull and sluggish. 3
Phone is fine but TMobile reduced band width for i5 unlocked phones resulting in no 4G data access in our area , display "E" according to my grandaughter. 5
I received the phone. The screen was loose. The digitizer was non- responsive. It looked like it was put together in a backyard shack, by a bunch of blind elves. Simply put. It's junk. 1
The phone could only be used on speaker. Not what was advertised 2
The screen came lift up already 1
The seller mentions that the iPhone is like new but it isn't. It have problem on middle button. Now the middle button doesn't work. The back side of the phone seems to me open before. I am really upset with this. I gift it to my friend and its make me a lot of horrible situation.And seller was helping me to unlock the phone that was good but why he didn't inform me the problem of this iPhone? Why he posted it Like new? Really disappointed:( 1
There is a lot to like about this phone.Pros: beautiful design, huge screen (I have no problem with the pixel count), Android Lollipop, responsive screenCons: speed is not 4G or 4G LTE so I experienced far too many bufferings with the videos. Also, the call quality is a bit low.Overall, I like it, especially at this affordable price, but since I bought a phone of this size so that I could enjoy watching videos, it's a tough deal for me. If you have no problem with the speed, then I would highly recommend the BLU 7.0 II. 3
I not recommend this phone, is lenght, it's not good...i for a beginners whit Blackberry Phones. This phone is for my wife use and not have 100 % satisfy but for the prize is not bad. I recommend other BB Model. 3
I also have a Pebble, I prefer the Pebble, its battery last longer, feels better on my wrist, and doesn't turn off all the functions of my phone, it adds to them, this watch silences the phone. 3
after couple weeks of using it , i couldnt and still noone can hear me when i give or receive a calltechnically i just use it to txt although i am paying for a service to get both but i can use it as i want 1
I bought the phone for my son and it has no issues and is in great working conditions 4
Came fast and works very well 5
GREAT PRICE! Arrived in perfect condition. 5
Its cool. I first couldn't appreciate the tools till I change my orientation from BB 9900 I was using before. Its equally okay as a transition before I will get 9900 back. 3
Came in great condition, the only down side was the wall charger that came with it fell apart after about 2 weeks of use. But the phone its self works great! 4
Performance and cameras as expected. The only thing I didn't like is the external adapter for the wall charger: it's kind of bulky if you need a US plug. 4
Although billed as new, the telephone was sold sometime in 2013. So not quite an accurate description. 4
i got the phone as a bday gift. Its bin nothing but a hassle. All i wanted was an iphone 4s for prpaid verizon. I had to buy sim card and adapter additionally and make phone calls - all to find out that it is not going to work. Is not anything i wanted. Its an at&t phone and will never work w verizon service. ThAnks for ruining the birthday gift - and causing so much of a hassle i didnt need nor hav the time for- extremly upset and disappointed. 1
A lot of storage is used up on software when purchased. Some glitches with suddenly turning on and off. Overall functional. Much better than windows phone, but I have no doubt that my next phone will be better 3
Phone had bugs, did not let me sign into my apple i.d 1
When you have someone who doesn't use their Android phone go to actually using their phone to stay in touch .. that's a good thing 5
I liked a number of things about this phone - bright screen, large display, weight. However, the sensitivity of the touch screen needed to be recalibrated. If I clicked in one spot, the device recognized it have been tapped elsewhere on the screen. This was most apparent with my Gummy Drop game - I would click on one gummy to switch and it would move one 2 rows over. It finally got to be too frustrating, so I returned the phone for a prompt refund from Amazon. 2
Phone works great, love it 5
The phone came in two business days after I ordered it! It did have some minor scratches and the corners were a little banged up, but it didn't matter to me because it's going to be in a case anyway. It functions perfectly, as described, and if it were in a case then I would assume it was brand new. If you don't want it to be in a case and want it in mint condition, I wouldn't recommend buying it. If the condition is not a major concern, then it's very worth it! You get what you pay for--amazing price! 5
I recently purchase this Blackbery phone but for some unknown reason it is not allowing ne to send SMS texts. I previously bought the same phone but I don't have this problem. I am not sure if it has to do with some special setting or not. 3
phone was locked by iCloud and seller din't have password. I had to return it. big waste of time. 1
Would go to Apple next time, product from Japanese market, certain functions not able to disarm 2
I'm very happy with it . It was same as described . 4
I've had this phone for about a month & I have nothing but good thing to say about it. Here's what I think after one month:PRO- Inexpensive, loud stereo speakers, some nifty & unique features, good (day) camera & very slim profile and not to mention very light- Good battery: the battery should last a day even with heavy use. I'm not a heavy user and mine actually lasted one & half day with single charge.- Bright large 5.5" full HD (1080P) screen.- Unlocked, no contract and no preloaded garbage apps- Able to add more memory up to 128 GB using microSD card.CONS- Handling: This is a big phone so the combination of size, thinness and low weight will be an issue for small hands.- Performance is somewhat sluggish when compared to my older phones such as LG G3, Note 3 and my Fire phone.- Low light photography - Indoor & @ night, must use flash.- Battery is not replaceable.- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -This is my second Alcatel phone. After my first one which was returned promptly I vowed not to buy another but after reading the reviews & partly because of Amazon one day special sale (got it for $199) I gave it a try. And now, I think this phone is worth every penny. This is by far the best phone Alcatel has made. They were able to put some mid to premium features into this phone and sell at a very low budget price.DESIGN & BUILTThis phone is very elegent. It got rounded edges framing a metalic like body. The screen sits slightly over the JBL speakers on top and bottom which makes the overall look very unique. The back camera takes great outdoor photos during the day but at night you'll need to use flash.SPECIAL FEATURES- Reversible interface - Phone has speakers and microphone on top and bottom and once you activate the feature, it doesn't matter which side you hold up to make or receive calls. I've never seen this feature on any other phone before.- Double-tap lock screen feature - They copied this from LG G series phones. The implementation of it though is somewhat sluggish. You have to tap it a few times before the screen turns on or off.CAMERA- IDOL3 has a 13-megapixel auto-focus rear camera, and an above average 8-megapixel front-facing for selfies. The lens is flush to the back, so there’s no raised section like the new iPhone or Galaxy S6 and others. On the software side, the layout is simple but it does come with a variety of shooting modes and interestingly there is also a manual mode with shutter speed control. The camera delivers decent looking photos in moderately lit conditions with nice details and saturated colors. However, it seems to struggle with low lit situation and with no flash, you get hazy details with some noticeable noise. But on the plus side, it does have electronic image stabilization feature which helps to keep things steady especially when you're working with the manual mode with low shutter speed. Also the latest OTA update has significantly improved the camera's performance. Colors look nicer, it focus better and snaps photos faster. If you get this phone be sure to get the latest OTA update.BATTERY PEFORMANCEThe 2910 mAH last me the full day and even after 24 hours I still had 30% left and so this is one big plus for this phone.Overall I highly recommend this phone. There are very few phones that can match the features with such a low price. Oneplus one (last year version) which is now readily available is the one of only two true competitor. That phone is faster but its 64 GB version is $75 more and with IDOL 3 you can add up to 128 GB of SD so from that standpoint its ahead. The other phone is Zenfone 2 which is $50 more but from what I read, there's a lot of shortcoming with that phone. Anyway, if you're looking for a feature rich, low price, no contract phone, you can't go wrong with IDOL 3. 5
It don't have illuminated the buttons outside the Screen to go back and see all appications... at nigth it is imposible to use them. When a call is running, if I want to end it, I must give back two times to reach the screen of the call... it is very bad. 3
Delivered on time. Phone looks practically new! 4
got the item in time and no issues. 5
Phone was in perfect condition when I got it, everything was fine, until I put the SIM in. Phone was blocked on my network and was reported as stolen. Needless to say, I am NOT happy with this outcome. 1
works great came in great shape 4
Great phone for the price! Fast shipping, and worked wonderfully out of the box. You can't beat this phone for what it costs- does everything a high end phone does and is a nice size screen. 5
Very happy! Quick delivery and everything perfect! Thanks 5
Lo-lo-lo-love it! I am In love with my new phone. Best purchase ever, cheap and unlocked- that was a surprise 5
Exactly what I ordered. Works great! 5
Purchases a used iPhone and that's what it got. Looks used with scratches on screen. I put an Otter box on it for protection but it also works to cover used look. Phone works great. Good phone for kids. 4
Fast shipping, as described. However, it stopped working after 6 months. Won't stay charged, replacing battery doesn't fix it. 3
In the modern world of smart phones, this phone does not cut it into the elite. Careful what you are looking for. Do I recommend you to buy? I'd not say no outright. But I may not buy a BLU again. Here's for you to help make your decision:Pros:1. Good picture quality: If you are watching a video, then good resolution.2. Price is good for the look/appeal factor.3. Photos are OK. Not great, not bad either.4. General operations like Call quality/Alarm/Vibrate/Sound quality etc. are very good.Cons:1. Screen sensitivity is low. More pressure needed if you are used to the Apples and the Samsungs.2. Battery is fixed, I don't think replaceable easily. Battery life is good, but expected much better for the listed ratings.3. No fast-charge.4. Top heavy design. Not only that it is a heavy phone, you'll have to hold it carefully while handling in one hand. It's rather top heavy and your index finger rather be high up in the back to stop it from toppling. Now to more important part:5. Processing power: I don't play games. But once I open resource heavy apps like Google Maps, it simply stops working. Does not even take/make calls.6. Calling: Can't say unreliable. But when Google Maps is on, everything stops working, including simple call features. It hangs and hangs for some good time. Even when I close heavy apps.7. GPS: Has never worked for me. It shows my location way off.Overall, I am not very impressed with this phone. It is good when it is running. Probably that's what you get for what you are paying for. The frustration may adds up when essential features don't work when you need them most. In the new fast life styles, you'd need more power. 3
the time is wrong on the phone do not buy 1
I was promised a good working phone but apparently when i got it, the microphone doesn't work. When i make phone calls, record voice memos or videos, the sound just doesnt come through. Really disappointed! Phone should have been properly tested! 1
The smartphone is regular, because only you download 3 app in its intern memory. 2
This Phone is OK, it is the right phone for you if it is your first smart phone, otherwise, look something with more internal memory and better camera. 3
It is a great smartphone. Honestly if you have an iphone 3 of less, it worth the upgrade. But if you have an iphone 4s then wait for iphone 6 :) 4
Dissapointed. The product is not an original product of BLU. Packed off after a week 2
Alcatel Onetouch Idol 3 5.5 has certainly done right this time. The phone can't compete with the top flagship phones today, but for its price, you can't really complain. Phone is nicely designed and it is almost as thin as a iphone 6+. Phone has a beautiful display and loud speakers that you can compete with the flagship phones today. That's where the difference ends. It has a slower snapdragon 615 cpu 2gigs of memory, no removable battery, nfc and wireless/quick charge. One design quirk that I don't like is the placement of the power and volume rocker. Most phones has power button to the right and volume rockers to the left, this is just the opposite. Not to mention that the power button is so high up in the phone. The phone looks nice but not very well protected so you should definitely get a case for it. Software is Lollipop 5.0.2 rather than 5.1.1 that other flagship offers. Although I can't complain about the almost stock android experience which works fine for me. You definitely need a micro sd card if you want to put movies and mp3's as I only have 7 gigs free without having any media files stored internally. I hope that Alcatel can offer software updates like what the other flagship phones does.Should you get this phone, yes, but I would wait for Alcatel phone goes on sale as I brought mine for less than $200.Pro's- Has a beautiful 1080p display.- Very nice stereo speakers- FM tuner- Band 12 LTE for t-mobile phones- Nice, nice and thin design while maintaining a 2915 mah battery.Cons- Placement of power and volume rockers- Slower Snapdragon 615 cpu with 2 gigs of memory.- No NFC, wireless and quick charging- Android 5.0.2 rather than 5.1.1 5
I received it and after a day of use it immediately start freezing and having "command delays" like I'll press "safari" and it'll take a min or 2 to come up and I'll get contacts instead so yeah. 1
No scratches on the glass and worked nearly as described, except the headphone jack is broken -- which is a real bummer. The apple store will only replace the phone for as much as I already paid for it or I have the option of fixing it myself, which really is not what I want to do. I'm too nervous about doing further damage inside. I guess this is what I get for buying a used phone. Other than that, it works perfectly and arrived quickly. 3
wasn't happy because it arrived without any charger cord or accessories. This added cost and inconvenience and was not disclosed. 3
I normally don't write reviews but I simply had to for this phone to inform others of what they can expect. I'll keep it short:They've promised android version 6.0 (Marshmallow) but have yet to follow through with that promise.The phone will often freeze for 3-6 seconds randomly despite formatting the device and starting fresh again.The speakers for both the earpiece and speakerphone are on the weak side so it's difficult to understand people in louder environments.If you're okay with those three things, then the phone is incredibly light and a nice value for the money. Just try not to throw the phone when it constantly freezes or randomly restarts. 2
Phone was brand new. Exactly what we wanted 5
just what you would expect from an iphone. 4
Wife had a basic phone, and wanted to upgrade to what the rest of family had (iPhones)... Wasn't due for upgrade for another year, so we went this route...I emailed the dealer regarding the condition, and if verizon was not able to activate the phone ,was I able to return (yes I could)... Phone is in excellent condition, and within 20 minutes verizon had it activated and on line ...no problems, shipped quickly, and would go this route again if needed 5
This phone arrived in seemingly good shape and seemed to be a great Christmas gift. However, the gift was opened Dec. 25 and by Jan. 1, we had taken it to the Apple Genius Bar at our local Apple store TWICE and, by the second time, it had died completely and could not be revived, even by the geniuses. They said it was defective and the only thing to do was replace the phone. I'm thankful for Amazon's return policy and glad I bought through amazon but the whole thing is disappointing. 1
We had a situation where we went to pick up the iPhone at the post office, and the package had been cut open and the phone was missing. Noble Planet was great and they sent us another one, with no cost to us. They truly stand behind their service! 5
It was jail broken and couldnot be fix 1
Phone did not work right and the seller took care of problem fast happy with result 5
It was a little dinged up and the microphone barely works. Can't really communicate with Siri because of that. 4
No surprises, just what was expected. 5
Not a bad phone. The phone seems to lose battery life a bit quick, but I plan on changing the battery myself. 3
i wish i had done this 2 yr back ,brand new phone ,stoned noke e5 ,samsung galaxy ( worse phone ) android sucks .every money tight should buy this phone .sound quality is not good as nokia and certain features are missing as comparison to new 4s siri dont works on it ,screen touch is little slow to fluid flow ,so buy a otter box case from amazon its dirt cheap too .so finally very glad i have finally what i wanted .loving it and it will go a long way with me until new iphone 5 came out . 5
Very slow and my provider said it is an old phone. I threw it in the trash 1
I purchased this phone March 4th and thought it was a big win. So wrong, had trouble with T-Mobile and sim but got it done. System okay and worked. FM useless in my area So little memory really m Ed the SD which is where it all went bad. Installing card looked simple but metal close p that holds it came off in process and that was it for my Blu. Came online to contact seller and can't get the info guess if not DOA no recourse. Total was for me. Shame really 2
I've had this phone now for over 8 months it works fine with little glitches here and there but overall its good. This product lost 2 stars for 2 reasons; the camera isn't that great and a notification keeps popping up that says not enough disc space and disc space is internal memory which means it was created with just a little bit o space and no matter the size of the sd card you place inside the phone, some apps and programs just simply cannot be transferred onto your sd card. So as simple as listening to a whatsapp voice note I can not even do that because it won't download and I cant send or receive voice notes, songs or videos. I did a factory data reset a few times even did a hard reset twice which completely erases everything and is supposed to allow the phone to work like new. Unfortunately when the phone had already had a hard reset, the notification still showed up 3
Great phone- great price. Very pleased. 5
Really nice phone... the one i received is just like a new handset.no issues so far. 4
Great Iphone 4 Great Condition Works Well, I Love it Thanks -Chinks 4
I e tryed different plans doesn't work waisted like 300 bucks on it 1
I really had to drop this watch down for connectivity issues and the all around quality. the phone drops signal alot and the wristband was so small I had to give it to my girlfriend. Who could barely wear it. 2
Camera quality could be much better. Really expected it to have a compass sensor but it did not. Its battery life is minimal. The back button on the left feels a bit counter intuitive. It states 8 GB of memory but it barely gives 5. Was really tempted to send it back but did not want to go through the hassle. Getting a choice in after-market cases is also limited. 2
Still working until now, excellent 5
Phone goes off by itself from time to time. 3
We used the phone with AT&T with out a problem, but unfortunately when we switched to another carrier we learned that the phone was not unlocked as advertised and all attempts to unlock it have futile! (First Straightalk and then Metro PCS) 2
This is a terrible place to get a product. Very poor product quality control. I received an iPhone that was visibly broken with the hassle of having to return. This is not worth you time. 1
Phone I got was in decent visual condition. However, battery does not last with more than 1 hour of use. Also, after 3 days the speaker stopped working. Buyer beware, these are junk refurbished phones. 1
Well it is unlocked but does not connect to the internet. Hope it will someday. I did my best in connecting it to the internet ... 3
reset it self every 5 minutes 2
After a year my teen is fully enjoying the Studio 5 C, & I needed a replacement phone so we ordered this thinking it would be an upgrade. Software, ease of setup & organizing music, apps etc. is great like any BLU product. Although, I'm disappointed in the camera, the photos are not as clear as the 5C and unfortunately we're most having problems with the screen (my teen thinks it's singular to our device) being either not responsive enough or too responsive (there's no 'tap' it's press firmly), jumping forward even without 'auto correct' active. After a week of texting with this phone I lost patience. Tech-friend thinks maybe it's the software lagging to keep up with our fingers? Will be returning this unfortunately and trying to match the 5C or upgrade to 7.0. We gave it a good shot, & will continue to purchase BLU for their excellent quality for an unbeatable price! 3
get what u pay for 2
Sis loves it, functional and easy to use 4
Yes, the used iPhone 3GS works the way it should. I actually received two for the price of one. Also, both iPhones works with any SIM card that I putted. 5
the back camera stopped working, the phone touch screen stops working and i have to restart the phone to get it to work. The phone is a huge disappointment. Not worth what i paid for it. 1
I really like this purchase it was a great buy...everything is perfect with this product. 5
This phone was NOT compatible with the Verizon network. I had to get a new phone and pay just as much for it. TERRIBLE marketing, don't believe it when it says it is verizon compatible. 1
I have had some erratic incidents that I had not had with my previous 5s. Eventually they went away, but it has caused me to question the product or the source a bit. 3
My pacage arrive whitout cellphone 1
Terrible! It is a Sprint phone and they couldn't turn it on. I tried to return it but never heard back from the seller. Then I tried to unlock it and have T-Mobile turn it on. They couldn't do it either. This was a waste of my money!!!! 1
I just love this peace it's so BEAST 5
I want to replace the screen but don't have money so 4
Best phone I've ever use. 4
good product so far,have no problems with the device except that instead of a colour black that i ordered i got some ugly purpleish colour i was really peeved about that. 3
First off I loved the phone! Then out of nowhere it shuts down and reboots out of nowhere!! It is seriously passing me off and going back to the windows 10 phone!!!!! 2
Was broken, did not work! 1
When I first unpackaged this I tried many features and I loved it. But then the problem. I have owned cell phones for well over 10 years going back to the basic Nokia. And I have owned many cell phones, I love a challenge and something different. So I was perplexed that my SIM card wouldn't go into the phone. It just didn't fit! I tried two different adapters. The SIM card fit the adapter, but the adapter wouldn't go into the cell. It seemed just slightly too big. It's a nice phone with great features that seem to all work, but if I can't call and text, I can't use it. I am returning the phone. 3
The product is not as high standard as I hoped. Camera is really bad, and sound quality is poor. Would not waste my time again. 2
Was actually a 4S. Nice! Perfect condition 5
Perfect! It got here sooner than expected and it has been really amazing!!!! 5
This phone is not so good. very slow, touch screen is not responds quickly. I think It`s little expensive. Normal price would be 50-60 U.S $ 3
May I use this medium to find out why the blackberry purchase did not come with a USB cable. Due to this, I could not charge my blackberry let alone verify if it works! Therefore there is nothing to review yet! 3
This cell phone had a total system failure after only 9 months. The cost to have it repaired is almost equal to the purchase price. But after taking the Iphone to the local Apple store who tried to identify the problem, we learned there is not an option for Apple to repair the phone. It turns out the phone was previously damaged & repaired by a non-Apple repair center using non-Apple approved parts. So we quickly learned all Apple warranties are voided & they will not even attempt to repair the modified phone for any price. 1
The iPhone came in amazing condition, no scratches on the screen or back of the phone. However, there is a slight screen discoloration at the bottom left. Hardly noticeable. It appears like a yellow spot. I don't mind it because I can barely see it and it's just a nice way to confirm the phone is actually mine in cause anyone tries to be funny and take it. 4
Purchased used phone advertised as "like new". Although phone arrived in original packaging and all external appearances Iwere as advertised, the phone receiver volume is so low that it is for all practical purposes unusable. Diagnostic at Apple Store resulted in conclusion that the internal receiver speaker was defective and not repairable. No warranty. Apple offered to exchange for $199, or suggested that I consult my carrier. In the end I have a killer music device but for a phone it, it is about useless. Caveat emptor. 2
This device works in Venezuela, is unlocked, has no box but is a new device, the charger and the cable is very cheap and low quality. 5
Pretty good in general. Great Phone. A Little expensive but it is because is Apple 4
8 g was never big enough. 1
I've owned several different Android phones by many different manufacturers and this was the most temperamental phone by far. Sometimes I would be doing something as simple as browsing a website in chrome and the phone would lock up and automatically reboot. Other times it would become unresponsive and then 15 seconds later it would come back to life. This phone seemed to totally lock up on me almost once a week, and it was never when I was doing anything that would be considered taxing on the system. The boot sequence also has an annoying loud sound that you can't turn off, so if the phone locked up when you needed to be quiet you have to try and cover the speaker with your finger.The touch screen also seems to ignore input randomly (but I was also using the included screen protector, so that may have contributed).I seemed to totally lose reception with this phone way more frequently than with other phones. One time I lost reception and could only get it back by rebooting the whole phone.The battery lasted me all day typically, but just barely.It came with a case from the manufacturer but it doesn't even fit properly. It is loose vertically so the phone slides about 0.5mm up and down, just enough to be irritating. How the original manufacturer can't even create a properly fitting case for their own phone is baffling. Even cheap $1 iPhone cases from the dollar store have always fit my iPhones snugly.The best thing about the phone was the large screen combined with the thin and lightweight frame.BLU phones 'on paper' seem like they should be pretty good, but the finicky nature of the radios and touchscreen are something that bothered me too much. 3
Phone works and looks brand new and it was a lot cheaper than buying from a provider 5
I was about to buy this phone same phone for about 70 bucks more for new out of the box. Saw the same phone in the warehouse section with the Amazon guarantee. So glad i got the warehouse deal. Phone came with a charger like new, no i phone box but who cares. 5
Came with all cables, appear brand new, factory packaging. The screen was a little scuffed, but was expecting more, so no complaint there. Did have issues with the USB micro to PC connection (tried using several cables, and have deduced it is the phone it's self), however I connected the sim card through the PCs SD slot and it worked. The main issue was the key pad, it worked for about a day and stopped moving (but still clicks). Had to open the phone and adjust the track-pad because it did not have enough pressure on it. Had a five star rating until I had to repair it. 3
In good condition. It works just fine. 3
I'll give em a thumbs up. As I will say,they went above & beyond to resolve the error of receiving an incorrect item by error. Impressed with the customer service response & pleased with the product once received. 4
I got my Niece this blu advance right here and she was very happy with the outcome of it plus the price isn't bad at all 4
Having so many problems it's only been 7 months! 1
Excellent phone. I love it. Fast and good for work. 4
Not possible to lock the phone. Thus, whenever your phone is in the pocket or bag you send messages, make calls, etc. 2
It's OK but it could be better 2
my brother love this phone i send this phone back in philippines and very well preformance 5
Was just some small chips in the edges of the phone but it worked fine 4
Ordered unlocked, it's locked by a French carrier and it has a water spot under the screen! Can't believe I fell for this! Don't do it! 1
I bought this phone with international warranty and in arrived on time and working perfectly, but 3 days later the keyboard letters a,q,e,r,u and o, wont work, im not living in america so i found tedious to ship back the product and waiting about 3 weeks to get a replacement using my warranty, so i went to a technician, the problem was a keyboard controller chip, so he had to changed it, i barely used it and it got damaged. it cost me 60 bucks to fixed it, but i would pay that than to wait about 3 weeks for something should be working perfectly at least 1 year. 4
I purchased 2 of these phones in early Dec 2016. Both phones could not be activated by Verizon. Wasted a lot of my time with Verizona customer support. Very angry. 1
I ordered it as a gift to someone but did not liked it because it was too small . apart from that everything was perfect. It came new in a box and on time. 2
I need a new one! This one glitches and I need a new one! I will not send the other one back either! 1
I did buy two phones, one arrived with no bone damage was irreparable served 2
I called Verizon to activate my phone....and the phone isn't actually theirs. I was unable to activate it on their network, so I can't use the phone. 1
the owner did not think it was relevant to make it clear that the iphone he/she was selling was, in fact broken and the screen would not even turn on. I even took the phone to best buy and had them examine it and was told that it was beyond repair. Therefore, I paid $250.00 for an irriparable iphone. I contacted the seller to see if I could get my money back and was told that he/she did not provide refunds but offered to sell me a screen for the broken iphone that I purchased, (this would not have fixed the iphone and the owner was just trying to scam me further.) I am obviously not happy with my purchase and would advise anyone else against purchasing from this seller; he/she is a scam artist and fooled me. 1
I lost it. could not enjoy it 3
Charger port did not work. Pink shadow on screen. Had to returned it. Glad I got my money back. 2
The phone worked perfectly, worth the money. I bought it for my father and he loved it so much . 4
headphone jack does not fit, battery is drained, audio is bad. 1
Phone Came On Time ! i was very excited and it came just How it was described , ( no charger , and unlocked , 16GB , ect ) it does Have very light scratches on the back But a good Ole case Will take care of that !!!!!!!! the screen is perfectly clear , phone works just as new , Thank Youu! 4
In great shape for the age of it, had a crack in back and SIM tray was damaged but it's all perfect! Works like it should! Worth the price! 5
I've had this phone for almost two weeks now I waited a bit to give a honest review. The shipping was super fast for this phone I did two day shipping and received it the next day. The over all look of this phone is amazing. The pictures come out great. Now the downs it seems to drop my call a lot, It cuts off on its own and the battery doesn't seem to last long 2
Camera not as good as I thought 3
Received on time and it is working well. The packaging was good.i hope it does not develop issues in the near future 4
It is a nice phone for a low price 4
my nepwe is happy with this iphone, thank you, very good condition like new. 5
When I received this phone it was already activated to another persons name so I can not put in on my account as I wanted to. I either want the phone deactivated or my money back I am very unsatisfied with this product. I have went to three sprint stores and they have all said the same thing to me in such this phone is most likely stolen, if so I want my money back as soon as possible. 1
hey this is my first time leaving a review , i brought this iphone back in september of 2015 and im pleased with my purchase. the phone came a day early and i brought it used but when it came from my perspective it looked new , it had minor scratches that were barley visable . As far as durability im happy about that as well , i can begin to say how many times ive dropped my phone and and some times face first and its never cracked or gotte any scratches. i do keep it in a case now so that my luck wont run out. The only reason why im giving it 4/5 stars is because of what i like to call the "blcak out" period my phone chooses to go through. during that persiod of time my phone is fully fuctional i just cant use the screen at all. itll go darl hence the name " Black out" and i cant use it. ill have to wait till it dies which can be a headache because when the phone is on power saveing mode it can take days. this is the third time its happened to me and since its my only phone it can interfere with my daily duties . Other then that im happy i made this purchase and would do so again . the GSM really came in handy as well i activated my phone with an sprint sim card but later down the line when i was ready to get my phone on i was able to use a cricket sim card . If you ever want to know if your phone is locked with a carrier ckeck out this website [...] 4
Hello i received the phone I love it but number 2 sim slot say forbidden it don't work nut I can get it check out here 3
The phone works great, I'm just not an iPhone person. 5
The phone could not be connected to the sprint network, so it was of no use to me and had to be returned 2
Worst experience with this phone. its not a new phone and hs serious battery problem and also the speaker is also not working 1
Bad product that lasted 35 days. I believe the warranty is 30 days, so you know how convenient that was . 1
The battery is horrible! Hardly holds an hour charge. The camera kicks rocks. Blurry photos. Other than that I have no problems with it. Except there is no swype. Oh, and the internet is slowww...WiFi connection is good though. And I do love the neon pink color..But the battery kills the deal. Returning it..Well, back to Samsung I go. I hate paying for their high a__ phones :( 2
This watch is aesthetically pleasing however the sound is just horrible. you need complete and utter silence to hear the person on the other end using speaker. it sucks! 2
Great! No issues. Good product. Received with 2 tiny scratches...everything else is perfect. 5
Works perfectly and met my expectations, expect it did not have an adapter or plug in to charge. Very good. 5
I received everything on time.I bought tris product because i got one last year and it was great.I cant say the same now.I had lots of problems.It didnt work well.I changed the battery and this didnt work either.The phone is working but suddenly it goes off and you cant turn it on.You have to take the battery and charge it again.Im not satisfied with this product 2
Totally awesome iPhone great condition works great, will buy from seller again he was very insightful 5
I bought one it works only one and have month then the mic does not work . I went to apple store they told me it out of guaranty it sold from apple since 2010 so I just loss my money 1
Happy with this purchase:-)Speedy shipping. 5
The phone is nice condition, almost looks new but it is not unlocked! I have not had any luck unlocking it yet, but remain hopeful! 3
This arrived before time. Was as per the description. 4
This phone does not last very long. The SD card slots became non response after six month I am highly disappointed in this phone and I regret buying it. It now freezes a lot and restarts on it's own. When it turn's back on some of my contacts are deleted and only the number is there. Keep in mind that this phone isn't even a year old yet. And the photos of the phone online are deceptive. The phone looks cheaper, thicker and bigger in person. I hate writing negative reviews but this is one I could not refrain from writing. 2
I received the watch and found it very easy to setup and start using right away. The problem was that from the first day, the screen would intermittently turn a shade of blue with lines through it. This continued everyday and so I emailed the seller to let them know the issue. They were very easy to work with offering me a full refund, sending me a prepaid shipping label and apologizing for sending a defective product. The bad news is that I'm still out a watch but the good news is I didn't lose any $$ in the process. 3
I was skeptical at first on buying an iPhone since I was an Android fan.I love my iPhone, it came in perfect condition, & brand NEW!Also, it came to my house in exactly 4 days, just like they said it would!I am now an iPhone lover! 5
Not Compatible with my Sim Card! 2
ok.. . ..... ... ... ... .. .... ... .. .... .. ..... .... ..... .... . ... ... ..ok 4
My phonw was chiped and cracked and I couldnt even get it activated, very disappointed!! 1
The phone was listed as "new", but more than enough evidence to convince me that is not the case. Scratches on the case and the hotspot and bluetooth features don't work. Battery life also seems a bit on the short side. These challenges probably go with buying a three year old design from an aftermarket dealer. On the plus side, the 4S has a much, much, much, better phone capability than the iPhone 5 series. On my iPhone 5 (dead from a dunking) I was lucky when I could carry on a conversation in our house or inside a building. Not so with the 4S, which is always rock solid. An Apple Tech explained that from the 5 series on, Apple switched to a smaller and less capable antenna to save space and money. Bad choice Apple, very bad. 2
Great phone. Sadly its not 4G. And doesnt work as well yet has great features. 3
It is not all that. 2
The phone was in great condition but locked to sprint and impossible to unlock the carrier which is disappointing. 4
Came on time and works GREAT! No scratches or anything cosmetically. Great product and service 5
Why if i have enough money at my credit card i cant to buy itcan someone helpme please 3
the phone has not come and say who sent him there was nobody to receive it, but because it had a hotel and there is always someone at reception 1
It's acts up time to time 3
Decent phone for the money, but if you are used to flagships, prepare to embrace the lag. The UI lags severely even with hardly any apps running.Pros: - Screen. Very bright and colorful 1080p display. - Speakers. JBL audio working great. Plenty loud - MicroSD. Great to have. Allows apps natively installed to the card. Great feature with only 16 GB on board. - LTE. Grabbed LTE on ATT no problem.Cons - LAG. SOOO BAD! sent it back within a few hours of getting it. The Zenfone 2 blows it away in this category. - No fast charging. This might be able to be overlooked, but after having a Nexus 6 and the Zenfone, you get spoiled by it.Overall if you can deal with the lag and sluggishness, it's a great phone. I don't game on my phone as I have a tablet, which is why I tried this phone thinking it can do daily tasks fine but the UI lagging just got to me. I think the culprit is it only being clocked at 1.5 ghz, even the lower end zenfone @ $199 is 1.8 ghz. for $50 more, go with the Zenfone 2 with 4gb of ram and 64gb on board. Yea, the speaker sucks on the Zen, but the display is still pretty good and it runs so much better. 3
Phone works as advertised. Has a very good battery life. But BLU has failed to deliver the promised Lollipop 5.0 update by the posted end of July 2015. 3
I loved it and the speed it came in 5
I've had the phone for a few months now and is still working pretty good.. 4
My speaker at the bottom is broken and there are some chips and dings that I wasn't notified on but over all I love my new phone. 4
Thought there would be a speed dial feature but I was wrong. Either that or I can't figure how to set speed dial. The info makes no mention so I guess that feature is not there. 2
Great phone at a great price. Purchased it for the BYOP program for Tracfone. 5
I bought it a year ago and the speaker didn't work very well, I couldn't hear people talking when they called me or I called them. Thankfully it was still covered under apple care so I got a brand new one. 4
bad phone had apple diagnose it, said it had hardware issues 1
I was nervous about buying a used iPhone online, but when I received this there wasn't a scratch on it! It looked brand new. Placed my SIM card , charged it and it works great!!! Very happy customer! 5
I love it ! And it works great!!! Everything that I wanted and hoped for only this is my charger just went out but I ordered a new one 5
okay all alone in my country used 3g and 2g phone is T-MOBILE funcioa me super slow with the data 3
The phone had pretty heavy scratches on the front and back, plus the back part was all cracked! The phone restarts itself all the time and the battery lasts 2 hous top! I bought it from Amazon Warehouse and definitely would NOT buy it again. 1
I ordered this for my dad. I kind of regret it. I like that it isn't too expensive. But the phone always ends up having the wrong time and date. And it is very slow. I don't recommend this for a 1st smartphone. 2
So far so good it worKS 5
The size was awesome, the camera is pretty bad... Its a decent phone, a bit slow, but decent. 3
It was great but after 3 months started to freeze up and ehen trying to plau audio has a static screeching sound first 3
I think it was quite slow processing informations.. 3
This phone is okay if you don't mind buying a replacement every year. I purchased in Sep 2015. It died Sep 2016. It turns on but will not move past the BLU "Bold Like Us" opening screen. After researching support sites and YouTube and performing the unique factory reset process multiple times, and then, finding and following additional instructions because of the "no command / Android error" screen that popped up during factory reset, it remains stuck on that screen. This, along with the problems happening with a new Blu Energy X as well, causes me to say "good-bye to Blu". Even so, I'm rating 2 instead of 1 because of the low price and, therefore, if a person doesn't mind buying annually, it may be an option for some. 2
There are no Aps for this phone. And it was sent to me with a line across the screen. 2
Claimed "excellent " condition but battery life is very short. Phone itself is fine 3
Phone does not say percentage by the battery, caused me problems when I was restoring it. Charger is FAKE. Not pleased because of that. The phone is also causing me problems with music. On a scale of 1-10 I'd rate the phone a 6. 3
I like the Phablet, but the volume is really really low when I put it on speaker, I still have to put it to my ear to hear. 3
excellent quality, like brand new. Only thing is one of the speakers was not working. 4
I've owned a Iphone 3gs before but it feel in a bucket of water. I wanted an iphone but I did not wanted the 4 or the 5. In my opinion the 3g and 3gs were the best built models. The product arrived before the estimated date, it was unlocked and the quality looked (and works) like new. 5
Even though the phone does not work for my particular needs, the vendor has a very good reaction, they call me promptly and really they care and try to understand my needs, I feel they are accountable and try to satisfy the customer, in my on line shopping experience I can say I was very positive surprised by this company, the best customer care experience I ever had. 1
Touch screen isn't very responsive. Cameras are not good in dark conditions 3
It was not enough memory storage and I hate to delete app lot. I want to trade to 16gb from 8gb!! 1
Phone had a number under it so i cant use it 😡😡😡😡 1
I Chose This Rating Because The Phone Was In Good Shape When I Got It. & It Works Good. It's Coo. 5
What do you expect for the price? It gets the job done. 3
Phone I received was registered on the Sprint Network, Sent Back. 1
This phone worked for 1 day after I received it. Issues with the screen remaining lit. I am completely disappointed. Repairs will require micro soldering on the motherboard. I will never purchase another refurbished electronic item from here. This is my first negative experience with purchases here. 1
Just what I was expecting. thanks 4
i like it is very good. the phone mobil is best. i true in it .100% good y beautiful.the precious good 5
Still has the same issues that the 6 does. Also the R1 HD. Take a photo and SOMETIMES it will let you view it. Others no viewer associated and the picture is Blank and gone forever. Reboot system and it comes out good maybe. but still loosing pictures. Not worth the money and headaches to go BLU Ever again. Searching for a different brand and hoping that it works the way it is supposed to the first time. Very disappointed. 2
The iphone arrived well but with the surprise that I discovered that it was repaired in the past and badly assembled.The seller did not specify that detail. it was not in mint conditions 3
Very early delivery and great quality! 5
Excellent product and good to do business with this seller 5
the product is perfect, but the packaging is poor....! 4
My charger port fell out on the 5th day. I believe that this phone was refurbished and not new as advertised. 2
Crashes and reboots frequently. In Whatsapp, it hangs when viewing an image... slow. Screen already has a break without dropping it, and it has a rubber protector. Worst, a hairline break on the screen has made the keyboard useless, can't return phone... it's dead in only 35 days...I made a mistake buying it... 1
The phone is in perfect condition, it looked pretty much brand new! No scratches, no dents, no blemishes at all.The phone operates flawlessly. I am so happy with my purchase. Thank you so so much. 5
Me llego tarde el celular pero además de eso el cargador no era para ese modelo de teléfono ni el cable USB. 4
The first rating I gave on this phone was given because I hadn't received the phone yet. Now that I have received it my rating on it is excellent. Other than the fact it didn't come with charger when it was shown in the picture next to the phone. Never the less the phone is in very good condition. Was a good buy. I would recommend buying it. 5
The phone came in excellent condition , but it turned battery damaged me 2
It's a good phone for the price but here are some weird cons that could be deal breaker for you potentially:1. The home key, back button, and tasks bar are touch buttons on the bottom of the. This poses a problem when typing because the space bar is just above the home button. So frequently, you may accidentally hit the home button rather then space bar, which consequently send you to the home screen. Can be quite frustrating and hard to get used too.2. No fault to ASUS, but there aren't very many cases or accessories for this phone and, when looking, you must be cautious to look for the exact model number. Asus made a few different versions of this phone that have differences that effect most accessories.3. The rear loud speaker's sound quality isn't very good for music.A few nuisances, but like I stated earlier, this is a good performing phone for the price. 4
Ordered this iPhone 5 after much research and finding that it's the ideal phone for traveling because it is unlocked and it has the most LTE bands covered compared to the Euro/Asia GSM and US AT&T models. It has worked perfectly although currently I'm traveling to places with limited LTE coverage, so I can't say much about how fast it loads up on data connections. A few things to consider when moving from the 4 and 4s (per my experience): the wallpapers will look wrong so you'll need to get new ones especially made for the iphone 5's screen size; on the Converter that I use, I'm glad to see more of the currencies I've selected, without having to scroll down; and, the lighter weight kinda takes getting used to. It really is lighter than the 4/4s and is wonderful in that regard. For music lovers, I recommend getting the bigger memory models as the 16GB one easily get filled up. 5
it wasnt unlocked like it said it was 1
I have had my phone for about a month now, it feels strong, durable, everything is working great. I am very pleased and happy with my purchase. The only thing is that it did not come with a datacard. I am not sure if that is normal that phones do not come with data cards?. Other than that great buy, unlocked using in the caribean working great so far. 4
the Phone works very good Ilike it 5
Because phone is locked in page it show as an unlocked phones then i can't used it at now. This was a hoax 1
It works fine, but it does not work on the 4G band for AT&T. 3
I love the new phone. It works in the Western Michigan Area. I had to take it to AT&T to get a new SIM card because it required a smaller SIM card at no cost. The BB 10 software is a great improvement over the older software version. I would have giving a % star; however, The package didn't come with a phone user manual. Other than that Great Product. 4
good phone, but the charger cable isn't compatible with the phone: it's not a apple cable!!! i must buy a new apple cable: 30$.... :(( 3
I bought this to replace one I had before I switched to a note 5. Now I'm back with an iPhone I wanted to use the Apple Watch again. It's refurbished but I had a little higher expectatitions. Looks nice. From the exterior you can't tell its refurbished. Came with new bands. The magnetic power cord was tied up in twist ties. It's functional and it works. The reason I knocked it down to 3 stars is because the haptic vibration .... Doesn't vibrate. It does a click or a cluck sound. I can sorta feel it. So I guess it will work. Would have been 5 stars if it was completely functional. Should have spent the extra 30 bucks to guarantee full functionality of the device I purchased 3
Still getting to know the phone... 4
Have not tried it yet, but looks good for a good price 4
Had to return the phone. After 10 days of the phone, phone became blocked and could not be used. The phone came out of service and couldn't not be used to call or text. 1
While I love love love the battery life on this phone, I have a major issue with the storage. Even though I have my phone set to default everything to the SD card, it doesn't and I am very limited to what I can download to my phone. I have 13GB available currently on my SD card but can't even update the apps I already have on my phone due to insufficient storage. This is a major flaw that I've found no actual solution to. The phone does have a decent camera, is very easy to use and is sturdy. It would've five star material if I didn't have to constantly fight just to get a new app. 3
I was delivered a 16GB rather than the purchased 32GB iphone. 1
The only big problem of this iphone is that i can't used because the phone is locked.SO NOW WHAT? -.- 1
Phone looks and feel great but I'm having a problem with the SIM card from att. Normally they tell me I could have taken the SIM card from my old phone, didn't work. When to ATT and got another SIM card and that didn't work. I will give it another try at a different ATT store 3
I would have given it 5 stars except the bezel has a noticable scratch and I bought the device to use on T-Mobile in which it was advertised for.It had a Verizon sticker on it but seems to work OK so far. Otherwise its a decent iPhone and arrived on time through Amazon Prime which is a terrific service 3
The particular phone I got, Well it exploded after it's first Charge! I'm glad it wasn't on my son at the time. I believe he may have gotten hurt! 1
I wanted an iPhone that was current but inexpensive. I found it on amazon. Good price, good product. I am very pleased. 5
one of the worse phones i done owned 2
Well first of all the item was not as described..it came with 2 Sim card slots which is useless in the USA plus its very laggy..I gave it a star for the accessories another for KitKat and the third for the design however it has an unnecessary bezel at the bottom when being compared yo my nexus 5 3
perfectly received . No problem 5
My son broke his original iPhone 4. He cracked the screen. I refuse to buy a new one and buy into another contract. It was much cheaper to find him a used phone from here and this one was in awesome shape. Even came in a box! 5
Very useless "smartwatch." Would consider saving a little more and buying something more like a real smart watch. I used it for about a week and decided to storage it forever. Also headset wire was broken. Think twice before getting it! 2
There are a lot of scratches on the edges, and also it is cracked across the flash. I would have returned it, but I will be leaving the country in less than three weeks and there just won't be enough time for me to send this back, and place an order for another phone. 2
I needed a phone that I could afford as a 17 year old rich kid with no job (except babysitting) that would not necessarily be perfect but would work well enough. I was not impressed. The battery started out incredibly well but got slowly worse, and I've had it for just over a month (too long to return it grrr). The camera quality is ok, but a lot of my apps don't work well. If I shut off the phone, which I have it set up to do at 11:30 every night, all my app settings will reset (notification preferences, account log-ins, etc.). The speskers are really good, there are two easily accessable SIM port things and an SD slot. The power button is right below the volume button which can get annoying, but I get used to it. The main problem it is so annoying is the call/text/internet. It just doesn't work 65% of the time. It's unpredictable and I'm never surprised when I try to call anyone (iPhone or android) when it tells me it's dialing, it's dialing, it's dialing, it's dialing, whoop! Call ended. There isn't even a ring tone. The texts are just as unpredictable and generally don't work at the same time calling doesn't work. I went into AT&T (my provider) and they couldn't help me. They said it was probably because the antenna in the phone wasn't good or something. I didn't expect a lot from a cheap phone company no ones ever heard of, but I at least expected to be able to call my mother in an emergency. Storage was also a problem. Yes, the phone only comes with 8GB (half of which is taken up by the system itself) but the SD slot comes in handy here. I purchased a 32GB SD card specific to BLU phones and it seemed to work, except apps I downloaded first downloaded to the internal memory and I had to manually move them to the SD card. AND EVEN THEN IT TOLD ME I HAD TOO LITTLE STORAGE. ATT also couldn't help me there. PS the screen is super flimsy, I leaned half my weight on it on the seat of my car and the screen cracked. Please, I am 140lbs after Thanksgiving dinner and I had just worked out for two hours before going home for dinner. All in all, pretty eh. Either look to spend more or good luck trying to make this phone work. 2
So far so good..... Ordered it Feb 6, 2015 & rcvd it Feb 10, 2015. No problem getting a sim card & having the phone activated. Really no signs of a used phone that i can see. Great seller! 4
good phone. I had bought the phone for getting 4g in USa, but even though I have T mobile connection, I am not getting 4G connection in the phone. Very bad! 2
The details need to be more explicit in big bold letters that the phones for Sprint users cannot be unlocked or compatible. 1
It just gets slower and slower 2
Excellent, Im venezuela, 3G Movistar and Ios 9.2 very nice 5
It worked for a week 1
I've read the reviews and they are pretty straight forward but this phone may be good on price but the aggravation is greater it freezes and langs to the point it shut off and the speakers are just ruined can't ever understand one word due to the static. Missing parts no charger nor any screen protectors but that not all upper top screen is non responsive . I really didn't think this phone would be a pile of junk VERY DISSAPPOINTED.!!!!? 1
It was as description said 5
Well you definitely get what you pay for. Freezes constantly. Feels well built, but with the lagging issue, I should have paid more for a better phone. 2 stars instead of 1 just because of the price. Other than that, unless you're desperate for a smart phone, look elsewhere. It takes so much will just to not throw this phone against the wall. I think it just took me twice as long to type out this review than it would have on my old Samsung. I feel like I need a cigarette and I don't even smoke! 2
We bought this Iphone because it was much cheaper than a new one. The phone is in great shape, and appears to be working great! So far, happy with it! 5
Product worked. However, camera was broken. Big huge blob in middle of all images. Very unhappy with this, after going through the trouble of activation. 1
Phone is good but;because of me i had problems first time to get familiar the new OS ( i used 9000 and 9900 before)it is little bigger than previous BOLD series.Useful; just like it because of it is blackberry. do not wait too much things with other smart phones. 3
I have this phone and the 5.5. The 5.5 is a much better phone. The camera is poor quality on this phone, the pictures are fuzzy. Pay a little more and buy the 5.5! 2
They sent me a broken phone and then they apollogize to me and sent me a good one. It works perfectly, but the screen need to be tighted. 3
The quality of the actual product was very nice and sturdy. The only problems I had with this product was that the Bluetooth kept disconnecting every few minutes. The step counter would reset every so often without me prompting it to. 2
Let me start off by saying this phone does in fact work with straight talk. I was also kind of skeptical of it too but I was reassured by the seller (iconverwireless) that it would work with straight talk. Matt, the one I contacted was so helpful. The phone arrived in 3 days and in great condition. It did not include Apple stickers or earbuds but I didn't want any, so no loss. We got the phone activated in less than 4 min. No joke. This phone was amazing, and DOES work with straight talk. Totally recommend. 😀 5
The first phone I received did not work properly and did not come in the original box as stated. This phone was returned and a new device was shipped out promptly. However, the 2nd device did not work properly either. The charger does not work and again, it was not in the original box as stated. Neither phone came with original accessories, as stated.When the charger for the replacement phone is plugged in, a pop up clearly states that it is not an original or correct charger. It does nothing for this phone.I will not be purchasing from this seller again. 1
the product has a lot of damages (risks). 3
I find it OK for my 9 year old, She loves it. it's really a great phone. 3
This advert says Apple iPhone 6 plus , but what was sent to me was not a 6 plus, there was no pin to open the sim case. Looks like it was hurriedly packed and didn't look like a new one. When I actually ordered a brand new phone. Would have returned it but my son had waited so long to have a phone so he wasnt ready to let go. Phone has been working well so far though. 3
It's way too heavy, the camera sucks big time, it says is 8mp and its actually 2mp. The led never worked and the extra battery didnt either. the menu botton is too hard to use. Earphones were broken. Didnt like this cellphone at all. Please, re.check your choices before purchasing this. 2
So not happy with this phone. Got it for my daughter, wasn't even 3 months in and she has already had lots of trouble with it. 2
This phone, or at least, the phone I was delivered only had limited compatibility with 4G LTE network and with my wireless home network. As a result, very often I have no connection to the network at all. Webpages load too slowly, GPS does not function as it should and my outgoing messages frequently do not come through. The price may be low for a phone, which is nice, but it costs you reliability. I would not buy from this manufacturer again 2
This arrived before time. Was as per the description. 4
This product came with a torn up in side and no SIM card DONT GET IT 1
Kids liked it. But its to small. Can't do much on it. Screen is dim. But for a 4-7 year old they liked it.... Then again having a phone is major. BTW I got it for my 11 year old. 2
Hi, Im writing because my item arrived in good conditions, but it seem is not unlocked. An I Need an unlock cose. Thanks! 3
I took this phone into 4 different countries across South East Asia and the internet and media all worked as expected. the phone on the other hand did not. I tried 5 different sim cards from various countries and NONE of them worked properly or worked at all. So gave up on the phone and used it as a messenger and media player. I really enjoyed the media player portion because I have many files in WMA format. It's a gd mp3/wma player. It's compact and sits well on a armband. As for the phone, I bought a cheapo and that worked! I had to carry both but it wasn't too bad.As far as for the rating of this phone I really would only 2.5 stars. One star for the phone and 3.5 stars for the medai portion. I would NOT buy this phone again but I the Win jr HD sounds a bit more promising. I may buy again before the next trip but very unlikely. 3
The product arrived promptly. There was no problem with switching data. I'm very pleased with this purchase. 5
Phone had a number under it so i cant use it 😡😡😡😡 1
I purchased this item around two months ago and at first the screen didn't work properly which is because Ithought it was a nice new screen and I couldn't get oil on it or some idiotic excuse, I put a screen protector on it and it worked fine. Fast forward two months and my screen randomly died and when I went to a repair shop they said I had two screws missing indicating someone had worked on the phone before. So essentially they are putting bad parts onto phones and reselling them. 1
Unfortunately I had a problem with the phones "UNLOCKED" version where my phone arrived actually locked by AT&T. Although it was a bad experience, the Affordable Electronics made everything easy for me to return the phone and helped me the whole time via Whatsapp (I'm living not in US but very far abroad). I wish I had a better experience with the device but my only experience was with the seller; and it was very successful. 4
recieved phone and found out that I could not use on my service because was GSM unlocked ...... in post it stated could work on any network. 1
It works completely fine, but there were more scratched than I thought 4
now working the touch id you cheating customer, you said that everything working properly 1
It's ok for a kid.....or if you want a cheap smart watch. But a Samsung or an Apple watch it's not. It works, but conductivity can be spotty sometimes with Bluetooth. My son has had to reconnect this watch to his iPhone like three times already. Although he likes it, I personally would not buy it for myself.Update:Watch stopped working after 2 weeks. 2
Sim tray is a problem to use with a nano SIM card adapter . 1
Everything about the phone was nice expect the speaker and mic quality. in call people will not be able to hear you, sometimes, which turns out to be most. I think its a software issue that consistent with most of the phones as this is my second one with the same problem...You either have to talk on speaker or with an ear piece. You just want to keep it because it looks so good but that issue you just cant bypass.[...] 3
I have had my phone for at least a year and I'm very satisfied with my experience but the camera isn't the best. Everything else is good but the music situation is very complicated because when I'm looking at the music app it doesn't seem to work. The size is great it's big but it still fits into my pocket but when I try to find accessories for the phone there are not many out there like when you lose your charger it is hard to find a new one online. I've used my camera a lot but now I am not able to use my stickers and editing on the photos. 3
This is model A1429 (even though description says A1428).I read this in the reviews/customer questions, and clearly there is some confusion. I asked the question again and someone replied saying its A1428. Either the seller has some A1428s and some A1429s OR more likely people are answering based on the item description instead of actually looking at the model number at the back of the phone.The phone will work on AT&T/TMobile, but will not be able to use 4g lte.In any case I have to return the phone. 1
It's an awesome phone . Love it very much 4
For a novice user, this phone works well. Especially for the price. Just be gentle when plugging the charger cord in the phone. It is sensitive and after a few months it is more difficult to plug it in just right to get it to charge. 4
The phone I got is not unlocked. My SIM card is not accepted, although it works in other cellphones. 1
This is our 2nd iPhone 5 from this seller. The first phone came with almost no battery life, but was pleasantly returned & replaced. The replacement phone has more limited battery life than I would like, but not nearly as bad as the original. 4
The only reason I did not give five stars is because I found out that only the right speaker works, I mostly use it with headphones though or a ihome. It holds a bunch of songs but since I plugged it into my computer itunes flipped out and said it has to be uninstalled but i put a lock so that no one can delete itunes, i cant get into it to unlock the lock so i can only have the songs i have baught on my iphone, not ones that i have on cds. I wish i had the money to use the phone part of it but for now i have my music 4
It's OK. Unfortunately it doesn't work like the one it replaced. Got it for my grandson to replace one he lost. The watch works well camera so so music plays ok. You must have a sim card for for everything else to work . His other one would cannect to his ear piece and Facebook and Internet without a sim card. Had to amend the review. 1 It only has five faces to chose not many and when playing music the battery died in less then one and a half hour. 2
The phone arrived promptly as it was a Christmas present. However, the screen began to lift two days after Christmas and the phone froze up. Returned the item on January 6, 2015 and waiting patiently for a return. 2
This new phone i ordered as a gift is now not powering on. I am very disappointed in this product and i don't think i will be ordering any cell phones from this site again because I am not going thru the trouble of shipping it back. 2
I did not get the car charger and the cell phone was not unblocked how do I contact you?Alex 1
Had this phone prior to my blu life xl. This has a very delicate screen, cracked easily 2
This is my first Alcatel OneTouch phone. These are what I've experienced during my usage.I bought this phone because my brother's iPhone 4s was too slow and too small. He already used an Android device, but he feels more comfortable on iOS.Pros1. Thin and lightweight design (not my kind of thing, but most people would like it)2. Great display (almost rivals the $389 OnePlus 2, which is my daily driver)3. Loud speakers (louder than the Galaxy S6, the LG G4, and the OnePlus 2, but not as loud as the HTC One M9, the Moto X Pure Edition, and the Nexus 6P)4. Nice battery life (better than the Galaxy S6, but not as good as the Nexus 6P)5. Clean UI (uninstallable bloatware, stock Android-like interface)Cons1. Average performance (1.5GHz octa-core S615, 2GB RAM is not as good as the Asus Zenfone 2 and the OnePlus X)2. Average rear-facing camera (colors are dull, focus is slow)3. Charging speed (2 and 1/10 hours)4. Bloatware (even though it can be uninstalled, it'd be nice if it just didn't come with it)5. Not durable enough (doesn't feel robust and dependable)6. Price (it needs to be $200)So, it's an overall okay phone for the price, but I would go with the Zenfone 2 or the OnePlus X. Also, for $199.99, the Honor 5X has very similar specs to the Idol 3 5.5". So, I wouldn't fault you if you just bought one, but you can do better. 3
I love it, the only problem is the camera its not very clear but its okay! 5
The iPhone was in bad shape with screen that had scratched and didn't hold a charge 1
good basic pone... Works very well with companies in Venezuela (Movilnet, movistar and digitel) 4
Its says unlocked....but Sprint cannot bring it to their network 1
Uses a full size sim card so if you don't have one u need to get an adaptor too other than that I don't know much about it because I don't have an adaptor yet 4
I'm not happy at all, the Item was received broken in the bottom of the screen 2
This iphone 4S 16GB is not good what i was expected. the product have several Problems, like sensor button is not working, there are scratches on front side. and also i didn't receive the ear-hones with my phone., and also when I'm calling the phone got hanged.I'm a loyal customer to Amazon, but i have ever received this kinda product before. very dis-pointed.:( 1
It is completely slow , the software is old , the power button works when it wants to I hate it an I'm replacing it 1
Great phone with a lot of great apps. Takes some getting use to, but I love it! Very long battery life and expandable memory. All around phone for business or pleasure. 4
I purchased this phone a few weeks before the Curve 9320.This phone has a ton of great features and upgrades from my Blackberry 8820.Small, great screen, Blackberry features and fast.A very good value from a vendor that shipped quickly.Unfortunately this phone was lost in transit to work and I was forced to buy a new one. I just hope that whomever found it is able to enjoy it as much as I did for the few days that I had the unit. 4
Works great thank you so much 5
The Phone is beautiful, unfortunately I got a defective unit with dark shadows at the upper end of screen that can be clearly seen when the screen is light,( it is a manufacturer's issue not Deal fisher, their service was excellent and I would buy from them any time).I will be returning the unit for a refund or exchange. 2
Touch ID stopped working after few weeks. Fortunately the phone was still under warranty. 2
Did not function properly. Kinda wish my $80 bucks wasn't wasted :( 1
It is exactly like the phone I've been using and like. This model is a 3/4G and that is the reason I bought it. It allows me to do a couple of things the older model doesn't accommodate. It actually isn't quite as smooth as the older model but this is my only complaint. Generally speaking I am happy with the purchase. 4
is suppose be unlock can't accept the chip in ARGENTINA 1
Okay so let me start by saying the phone got to me on 2 days which made me very happy considering that I was headed out of town and needed asap. Phone itself is beautiful and sounds good(Speaker could be louder). The screen is amazing and when connected to WiFi the phone is fast. Wish it had a Gorilla Glass because the lightweight feel of the phone makes me question its durability.Now to my issues.1) I have not had 4G LTE service at all! Barely hitting basic 4g speeds.For whatever reason my sim is being read as cricket 3G and HSPA+ in status section. I've called BLU customer service and Cricket Wireless and both had no idea how to fix the issue. I've performed the Hard reboot (numerous times), tried updating software and added the carrier APN manually and nothing has worked.I recently had the seller Open Group Wireless send out a new phone and that was even worse. The new phone did not even recognize my sim card. I even tried my wife's card and it did not work. So after going to Cricket and buying a brand new Sim card, which also failed to be recognized. I am at a point where I am stuck with my phone and cant afford to try a more expensive phone. I am sending back the replacement and keeping the original.2) My other complaints would be the glitch in the music player that constantly pauses my music and the how my playlist constantly erase. it does it with Pandora also. Annoying but i make due. And the fact that updates have not been issued yet for Android 5.0 and although petty this phone could definitely use a stylus.Again, let me state that the phone itself is a great phone and when I am on WiFi, I really love the speed and functionality of the phone. But the issues I am having keep me from really enjoying the phone and being satisfied with my purchase. Had to finally return because glitches could no longer be ignored and nothing seemed to fix problems 2
The phone is ok. Replaced a smashed Samsung until my contract expires. The FIDO reps have never seen this brand and had some trouble getting it open and working. Still can't get photos by text. Def need a micro sd card, since the internal memory is not great. As well, do not buy this phone and expect to take decent photos. 3
Advertised as: New, in the box, sealed w/ original shrink-wrap, never opened, iPhone 4S, factory unlocked. Received item not shrink-wrapped, w/ minor marring on edges of iPhone, locked to AT&T, dirty places on box. No way this is just a "mistake." Clearly, a mass hit or miss on order recipients as to who will or will not make a fuss about it, and odds are, many will use AT&T as their carrier upon receipt so it would not even come up. Hate being baited and switched by anyone. Have asked for return and replacement, but will change to just return and refund as do not trust seller now. 1
This product only worked for Verizon company's so it is not a unlock phone. 1
It's ok but it freezes up from time to time. 4
This phone was unlock the one I got was from verizon wireless. While the phone was unlock it was still saying "Actation Required" but simple and easy to fix that $30 should cover that fee. All the phone parts came in the blackberry box with aye leather case, (really nice case) no head phones but idk if thats how Blackberry sells them now. Overall great phone and deal on this phone. Hope this review was helpful. 4
Very disappointed in this phone. We spent around 3 hours on another phone with apple support trying to get the wifi to work. Final determination was that this phone was grossly defective. Wifi icon would not even light up let alone work. In addition to wasting my time, I also wasted a $60 straight talk activation kit. I returned to Amazon and am waiting refund. 1
I didn't like the iphone at first because it arrived locked. After much investigating how to unlock the phone, I am relieved to say that everything worked out just fine. The iPhone is unlocked & my son is enjoying it. 3
Am not using because I don't have SIM card size to match it 1
2 weeks after delivery the phone went off and won't start.i'm taking it to the apple store tomorrowi hope they have a good explanation 2
Product is good, but I realized it is not worth it... 3
Can't unlock. Useless. Will have to refund when I return to the U.S. 1
A decent phone for a reasonable price. The phone is pretty big it makes people turn heads. I personally like the phone works great but it has its limitations. I will say the phone is pretty fragile but it's expected considering how thin it is. Definitely buy a case for this phone maybe even a screen protector. 3
Do NOT buy This phone it was not unlocked as it said. It would NOT work with Verizon yet seller stated it would. I spent 1 hour 38 minutes with Verizon trying to figure it out. They called apple and Apple would not unlock it. The phone will NOT work with Verizon. 1
Love it, works like new! Thanks for being honest! 5
Good price, and been using it since then. was a replacement of my other 5c dropped in water. 4
Great phone- great price. Very pleased. 5
Good "soild" phone - very dated technology - NOT LTE compatible - at least on ATT ... 3
Phones work perfectly. Wonderful transaction. 5
did my best to get in touch with you for a change of equipment, since I received the phone is cdma tegnologia, and does not work in Venezuela, my intention was to file a change for gsm team, but I found it impossible to get any type of response, should pay attention to the requirements of its customers. 1
This phone looked like good deal until I received it. Cosmetically the phones looks ok. Feels sturdy. The main issue I had with it is that the screen looks grainy. Youtube videos were hard to watch due to the low screen resolution and had a slight delay. According to the Sales Guide from BLU, this phone has a resolution of 480x854 and 196ppi, did not see that spec before ordering the phone. 2
Great phone delivery on time 5
OK phone for the price, but if you want a phone with memory don't buy it. I have 4 apps on my phone and yet still no memory to take pictures. 2
I have trouble with receiving pictures . had to call my cell phone company and Im still having trouble. Its just wasn't what I expected. I also ordered the plastic cover and I still waiting for it. it now been 3 weeks 1
Phone works fine but battery does not hold charge for long. The phone has to be charged every day after a few months of use. 3
aside from the usual wear and tear scratches, all works just fine, its awesome!! and it got here on time soooo goooddd!!!! thanks for being trustworthy...definitely buying with you in future 5
We received the phone quickly from vendor but had problems with phone and was never able to use the phone. Upon contacting the vendor there was no problem returning the phone. The overall transaction was very professional just the out of pocket expense and wasted time which is at times unavoidable. As for the phone since we did not get a chance to use it, not really sure how to rate the phone. 3
It's a goodbye phone but I got 5 GB on it even though it say 8 GB 4
This phone is nice enough. I liked that it comes with the Kindle app already installed, as well as Google Drive, YouTube and a flashlight. However, the phone just felt flimsy in my hand. And whenever I would press any icon, the whole phone would vibrate, which doesn't seem good to me. Therefore I'm returning it. 3
I like my BLU X150Q. The only aspect to improve on my BLU is the Camera. I'm spoiled from my Nokia520 camera, the images in artificial light with my BLU do not look as nice as I'd like. I now have an issue with my BLU phone not accepting a charge and the operating system continues restarting throughout the day. Not good. 3
this phone is good it just take FOREVER to ship , other than that i love this phone yall should but it 4
I bought this used and it had few noticeable scratches that weren't mentioned. I enjoy this product, it works faster than the iPhone 4s and came with new fully functional charger, headphones and cord. I am very happy with my purchase. 4
The only reason I did not give five stars is because I found out that only the right speaker works, I mostly use it with headphones though or a ihome. It holds a bunch of songs but since I plugged it into my computer itunes flipped out and said it has to be uninstalled but i put a lock so that no one can delete itunes, i cant get into it to unlock the lock so i can only have the songs i have baught on my iphone, not ones that i have on cds. I wish i had the money to use the phone part of it but for now i have my music 4
It's really good! But sometimes, it doesn't find good signal! I don't know why... If it's the cellphone, or if it's the carrier! The product is amazing, what I had found 4
Tbe Blu phone is good because I can use it all over the world. 2
Didn't know the lock screen did not work, and the wrong CMDA/GSM was listed 2
Great phone is there any warranty service let me know ty 5
The wi-fi does not work and the everything else appears to be working fine at the moment 3
I really like my new iphone. fairly easy to use, and takes very clear pics. The reason I gave it only 4 stars is because of the price, I think paying this much money for a phone is crazy....but here I am being crazy !! 4
I'm highly upset I bought two refurbished iphone 6 in February of 2016 and both phones was broken by June same yr. 1
Phone was in excellent condition, but the SIM card reader was broken so phone would not work. Disappointed. 2
I had best buy get everything set up for me which took awhile but it was worth it. I put my old blackberry SD card and then bought a new SIMS card after everything was working that day at night time around 10pm It locked by itself without me putting a password on it and I can't get back into my phone??? I tried resetting it and it wiped everything off but it did it again last night. 3
The phone was in great shape, had no problem getting service plan 4
When i received the phone I found that the top button did not click and now i have to use the accessibility feature to turn it off. Also the battery life, even when all apps are closed and screen is shut off, is horrible. 1
Yeah just make sure you buy or have an AT&T Sim card...you can get one from Amazon for like a buck and it will activate the iPhone just fine...and then you could even do what I did and get the GoPhone Sim and have unlimited texting a 250 min voice for $25/month. Really cheap bro. 5
Awful, phone had serious issues. Had to buy a new one. 1
good product. simple to use 4
AT&T not covered in my area 1
Good product and delivered as promised. 5
My expectation where not set very high, so I must say I was pleased with phone. The only thing i did not appreciate is that the charger only worked for one day. It's buyer beware ,so I probaly will buy another device from this person in the future. 2
I received only a cell phone, I did not get a box, cables or other accessories.The cell phone is broken, in the ad is not warned. In reviewing the ad is not that warning, but on the printed invoice I received if you warn. Now tell me they do not accept returns so I lost my money. 1
Just got my IPhone 5C. Got it in 4 days. No problem. Everything worked out great. Would have been nice if the price was cheaper. But My recommendation is to spend that extra money and get a new one, I don't trust the old ones.The only con with this purchase was the headphones are crap and knock off. Didn't even work properly. The phone charger/adapter also is not apple. But I already have plenty of those so it didn't matter. That is the only reason why I didn't given 5/5 stars. Overall very satisfied 4
The phone they sent me was manufactured for sale in Japan (or another similar country) and thus I cannot shut off the camera shutter sound. It's very annoying. 2
Phone was in excellent condition, but the SIM card reader was broken so phone would not work. Disappointed. 2
This item is great, it's new and good,iphone is the best mobile,i have used it about one weeks, i feel very satisfaction. 5
Not good the phone start giving me problems after couple days 1
Thanks so much CN-world everything is fine with the product, it was check and no problems with it. the screen is extremmly big and fast. i was worry because it came from china and is a long trip to here. almost two months and finnaly is here. 5
not much to say but i good phone came on time but it was just that i change my mind after getting it nothing to do with the company came on time was brand new everything 3
Phone worked great for like two weeks. Turns out it wasn't brand new at all, screen started ghost clicking and when I took it to the apple store to use the "warranty" it comes with they said it wasn't even new and the warranty wouldn't cover it. 1
It's a bit slow for what it is, nowadays, and most software only barely gets to it. It's somewhat slow, but still fairly powerful. However, be sure that you're getting a factory unlocked phone. Several sellers are selling them as simply iphones, but if you try using a different sim card, it won't work, or it was hacked to allow this. So be sure of what you're getting! 3
The phone is okay and the battery life has not gotten much better since the 4 days. 3
Hello! I am not fully satisfied with this items. one of the phone Home button is difficult to operate. In addition to this any of these phone not complete set.I didn't get earphone(ear plug) for any of them. Do you think , it is acceptable? 3
Great device ... It's better than I expected !!!Great performance at low price ... u won't get that ultra mega performance like new flagships .. But u will get %80 of their performance at a fraction of their price !! It's a good deal :) 5
The team is too hot when used long applications , really worries me because I can damage and if so will claim , so I hope the team will not be damaged 2
Phone broken after a few days, home buttom stopped working. 1
Apple has a fantastic reputation, and rightfully so. All their products are extremely reliable and durable! I got my iPhone 4S for a great price with all the original cords, it looks unused. While buying make sure that you're buying the exact model you want (unlocked, GSM, etc). I would recommend this to anyone as long as they're sure they're getting exactly what they wanted 5
The phone itself is what i espected... but it doesn't have the earphones, but everything else it's good 4
This is a sham. I ordered a new one and the piece of junk I got was such a waste of money. It can't tell time for one, it's always the same time, 7:49. Secondly, Bluetooth doesn't work! Along with a series of errors this phone is a piece of crap. 1
The phone seemed to ma as counterfeit 1
Very weak wifi range. Cannot see Wi-Fi access points unless I'm very close to the router. Otherwise it's a good phone for the price. 3
Phone was in good condition, but it was described as unlocked and it wasn't 3
Unit arrived with only a quick-start pamphlet, no instruction manual. Purchased this for my elderly mother-in-law, an elderly person would never be able to activate this without better instructions. I am skilled with electronics but had difficulty figuring out how to open it. Finally found a small notch on top and took a chance on prying it open (that worked). SIM car needs to be inserted upside-down (chip facing up) - that also took several tries to get right. Decent no-frills phone - when you finally figure out how to put it together. 3
Phone looks good, but could not get it to go onto our AT&T service. Tech tried for 1/2 hour, no go.Was supposed to be 'unlocked', but if the AT&T tech can't figure it out.. I know I can't.. :{ 3
Got this when my Nexus 5 died and was amazed at the progress made in android phones since I got the N5 a year ago. For less than half the price of my N5 I got a phone with comparable screen, better battery (being able to charge my phone 1/day is a game changer), better speakers, better camera. Granted the Idol doesn't have the benchmarks of the N5 (or the ZenPhone2) but I haven't noticed it at all in everyday use.If you want a great unlocked phone (with all the GSM LTE bands) and don't want to pay $600, get this phone. 5
this phone is locked to another AT&T network and does not accept a USA AT&T sim card this is very frustrating 1
iPhone arrive at the time completely new , but box was open , I mean It came with an plastic cover like the new one from apple but it was obviously open previously because inside the phone there was a SIM card , I was not surprised because I read that before in the other comments , yesterday my phone was inhibited for minutes , ive read thats normal un iPhone 7 plus , so Im happy for the Fast delivery but kinda worry for the product 4
Phone worth the price works as expected well 3
perfectly received . No problem 5
Positive: Large screen is good for senior people. Cheap. Maybe ok for those people who don't use phone quite oftenNegative: doesn't cover WCDMA band in US. Only supports GSM network in US though it says WCDMA. Runs quite slow so that I have to slow down entering characters... 2
It's not sold by Apple 1
After using this phone for approximately 2 months, the screen started being distorted and wouldn't work properly. Once we were able to get to an Apple Store for repair, they informed us that the issue was the screen and that a new screen would need to be installed. It was once Apple started to replace the screen that it was found to be a phone that was NOT original as sold to us. It had a third party screen that they were not able to replace. We were frauded by this company as they did not sell us an original phone and we are out over $300 on a defective phone! 1
The lock won't work after a week and the charger messed up, plus the phone begins to get slow but great camera and can connect it to metro and iMessage is great. 4
I love my cell. Then 2 months later it has decided to stop charging. Seems the charger port is lacking big time with this model from what I read now. It was very hard to find anyone to even work on my cell given that the brand is Blu. Once I did finally find someone it was going to have to be mailed in because I live to far way from them. When its all said and done it will cost $75.00 just to fix and mail it back. :(I love the cell but with that price to fix it. It doesn't seem worth it. 3
Charger got ruined in 2 weeks 4
Can not download certain app 3
Needed a new phone since I broke the screen on my new galaxy 5 in the first 2 months I owned it. I read the reviews and ordered the Idol 3 since it was cheaper than replacing the screen and digitized on the Samsung. I just hoped for the best, and can honestly say I was very pleasantly surprised. The phone looks, feels and operates like a quality product. I like it and its features better than the Samsung. I have had it about a week and could not be more satisfied. We'll see how it goes, but as of now I highly recommend this phone. 5
Disappointed! No instructions.... Purchased it as a present for a teenager, who is very "tech" smart and they weren't sure what to do because there wasn't a brand on it to be able to go to a web sight to research. :-( 2
Bought this in may sim tray dead after a month boooooooo 1
For some reason I can't get on the Internet or get my micro sd card to sync to the watch. Need some help 2
Great exterior condition. Screen is streaked with pink lines. 2
It arrived on time .just as I expected works every well and I am pleased .I have no regrets about this purchase so far 4
I have to say, "You get what you pay for". I bought this phone as a business tool. The the only thing I can say is the camera is horrible. I need to to be able to create PDF documents anywhere. If you just want a cheap phone with a big screen, this might be ok for you, but if camera quality matters at all, it's a huge NO!! 2
I bought cell phone as a gift for my younger sister. I didn't know it was so hard to look for a decent text messaging dumb phone. Other text messaging phones I researched were utter crap having random issues with the OS, camera, or battery life. This Pantech was the best out of them. It had a decent camera that might be a bit slow but took relatively sharp pictures. The phone also felt solid and my sister hasn't complained to me about any bugs. The only downside I saw was that it didn't have a 3.5 mm audio jack so I ended up spending more money on a headphones that had a mini USB plug. But as I said its hard to find a good dumb phone and this was the best I could find at a reasonable price. 4
I got this item brand new from dealer. The phone is surprisingly faster then my HTC One M7. 4
I like the fact that it came with a charger and the ear phones but the screen was slightly lifted at the top. Also it freezes up sometimes partially probably because of that. I can say other than that it is a good phone. 3
It's as good as new. 4
Phone delivered on time and in excellent condition. I was able to activate it completely on my own and it is working fine. A fifth star would have been merited except somewhat degraded battery performance. Overall I consider it a very good purchase. 4
I am very disappointed as I ordered an Apple iPhone 3GS 16GB (Black) however received a 3g with model number A1241. All the packaging said that it was a 3gs however the phone itself is a 3g. This is made worse as I am living and working In Africa and had a friend bring it over when he visited. 2
I bought this for my wife's grandmother (88) who mcuh preferred to use a simple flip phone over a touch screen. Though, this is a disappointing experience as the ring tone is very very low even at the highest volume setting. Another aspect I dont like is the phone is nog that responsive. Im in my 30s with perfect hearing and this has very low volume for eing tone - imagine it being use for an 88 yrs old 3
i like the feature to enhance the voice which is only available in blackberries. bad thing is that trying to get your email in bb is a pain or almost impossible. Good for voice and text only 4
I have been using Iphone 4 for 4 years. Have no complaints whatsoever. 5
in ma blackberry 8520 3 buttons work so bad.the box was scratched and terrible.and its buggy with windows.i rate 2 to this item,unfortunately 2
The phone is working great, my husband likes it. Never had an apple phone before, even if it's the older model it works good. 4
this is an untruthful sellerthe first iphone he sent me, the front button won't work. said with charger but nothing.contact ...sent charger, but can't be used !sent another iphone. But battery die every 40 minutes talk !I give up. I throw $144 to the dirt.don't buy anything from this seller 1
My daughter loves her phone. Thankyiu 5
Good customer service and the product is as good as the service. 5
Even considering the low price I simply can not recommend this phone. GPS started failing after 6 months of heavy use (used daily as my GPS device). Apparently tech support does not exist. The Android GUI has been butchered, no app button, blurred wallpaper, lots of modifications that don't help at all making the phone run slow despite pretty decent specs (I really hated the PIN entry delay or the phone not even registering my touch). I was forced to root my device and remove a lot of BLU added modifications, installed NOVA launcher and was able to finally have a decent GUI with clear wallpaper that scrolls (for some odd reason this is not available with stock setup). This of course voids the warranty. It is running Android 4.2.1 that is affected by Stagefright vulnerability and you should expect no updates. Ever. No third party ROMs are available and there seems to be very little interest among developer community to do any work with this phone. This will be my first and last BLU phone (this seems to be fairly common among BLU users).For those of you still willing to try to make this phone usable this is what I did to gain root access and modify settingsGained root with framaroot (google it, very simple)Check for app updates in Google Play and install themInstalled NOVA launcher (you can use other launchers just make sure you install one BEFORE you do the next steps)Install Build Prop Tweaker Lite (free) and modify the followingro.gn.navil.lock.scrn=yes change it to noro.gn.navi.launcher.support=yes change it to noRebootPS Keep in mind this will void your warranty but considering you should expect no support from BLU it makes no difference. I have moved on and upgraded to Google Nexus 6 and could not be happier. 2
The phone seemed to ma as counterfeit 1
it is fairly to use it, and there were some scratches. 4
Nice phone IF you can live with dismal battery life....figure 1% of drain per minute for internet use and even more for HD video 2
You get what you pay for. Very light, fast but had to root it to increase the memory capacity thus to be able to download more applications onto my sd card and not the phone memory. 3
It was working and it started blinking after it shut down.the screen can't switch on now. 2
Bad battery and will not stay charged. scratches all over 1
Very happy with my new iphone! Had to reboot it, but all went well with getting it turned on with my carrier. Thank you! 5
the volume is too poor it is hard to hear when someone call me, 3
Exactly what we expected and arrived earlier than anticipated. Thanks! 5
Phone was worse than expected with dents on back and damage to all corners. So far screen is flawless and phone stays charged, works well. 4
Basically in the condition described. However, with no SIM card it could not be used out of the box. 4
I clicked because it was advertised as a Series 2 on the home page but is really Series 1. I knew the price was too good to be true and sure enough it was. It is described as being waterproof when it's only sweat resistant. Beware! 2
The phone seems new. Worked exceptional for 1 full week. In the 2nd week I was encountered with network issues as it failed to find any network. Now I'm forced to return the phone 2
The phone has some great features, pictures and video resolution are amazing, however the internet connection s**ks; I have been using the same internet network and it worked perfectly fine until I got this phone, the only way to use internet is through applications like facebook, instagram ect, but don't get too excited to Google something or go into any page using your browser because it will take forever trying to download and at the end of it, it says that the page couldn't be opened. 3
I actually buy these case for friends and I haven't gotten any complains so they must be doing a good job 3
Much better and great upgrade from an iPhone 3gs. 5
After using this phone for approximately 2 months, the screen started being distorted and wouldn't work properly. Once we were able to get to an Apple Store for repair, they informed us that the issue was the screen and that a new screen would need to be installed. It was once Apple started to replace the screen that it was found to be a phone that was NOT original as sold to us. It had a third party screen that they were not able to replace. We were frauded by this company as they did not sell us an original phone and we are out over $300 on a defective phone! 1
It had some scratches not sure it was used or refurbished pretty sure it was a used model. But still good iphone :D 4
The phone came In very good condition, very minor scratches on the side by the volume button. Phone seems to be working correctly, but I have only had it for a couple days. I'm very glad that I was able to update from 4s at such a great price. It was also factory reset and was able to quickly put my T-Mobile SIM card and have no problem.Now the only thing that is misleading is that in the item description it stated that "product includes all original accessories, and is backed by a 1 year Apple warranty". Phones do not come with year warranty because Apple allows one to verify if the product does through their website and no headphones. Secondly, when I received my package, the item was only placed in plastic bag and you could here it rattling around in the box. Other than that price was very affordable and item seems to be working properly. 4
Has decent functions but very slow phone. And there is no option to make it to where when on phone calls the screen closes or locks so your face make you push buttons constantly or you conference in other calls. That's a major disappointment always have to use speaker I you don't want that to happen. 2
Was not worth $200, color and picture quality is low, and this is 3g, so it's pretty slow! 2
When my phone arrived, the edges looked like they had been drug through the sand - at first I was disappointed. The screen looked great though and all fictions of the phone work perfectly. Once inside the case, you can see the external signs of wear typical of a phone not protected by a case. This phone (I am writing from now) is perfectly functional and is holding up great. Hundreds of dollars cheaper than a new phone. If I break it tomorrow, I will be online buying another from them. 4
Sent me a locked phone. It was suppose to be unlocked. Now i cant use it and i am out of the country and cant return it. Would love some advice on how to unlock it somehow. 1
It is perfect screen，but few clash marks on the frame。The iphone is unlocked，and warranty available over june 。It is delivered fast，only spent 10days got it since paid。 4
With a mere 512 MB of storage this phone is practically useless. I should have realized that before I ordered it, but I was rushing, and got took. I'll eat it because it was my own fault, but the phone is not worth $50.00. The RCA M1 @ $100. is a much better phone. 2
Thought this had more features so im disappointed 2
Im so dissapointed on my order in amazon, when i open my iphone 5s unfortunately my phone wont activate. I call the apple support they said that the reason why my phone wont activate due to some deffect on hardware because they try to restore the phone wont work...And they said that the phone is not anymore warranty of apple. 4
Generally speaking, the phone is wonderful. But there are some problems: 1) the lock screen key is not easy to push and I can hardly turn off the screen; 2) the back lid doesn't fit well that there is gap between the lids. 4
I like the could it's true to the picture. Takes a little getting use to, not quite as user friendly as I'd hoped but really worth the price 3
I have had this phone since February and it has gone downhill drastically. Now the phone will not charge to full capacity without being powered off. In two hours the phone has reached than half of its battery life. The phone locks up continuously. First bad experience with a BLU phone, but probably will be my last. 2
Very good seller with great follow up.The size of this pearl is great. fits in your pocket and it is rugged design. It can take it. It can be kicked around, or wind up under your clutch pedal and survive the abuse. The keyboard is a simple "regular style" that works well for standard text messaging. All the features are here: WIFI, GPS etc. Also a wide band of freqs for world travel and a very decent quality sound and speaker phone, good battery life. Someone else liked it too, as it was stolen from me and I'm here online, buying another Blackberry 9105. 4
the phone its self was ok, i was led to believe it was a new phone but when my grandson opened it, it had a verizon account on it and strange people were calling his phone, we have now taken off the verizon account, but Buyer beware of what you are purchasing. 3
I didn't have a chance to rate this product and the seller due to extra working schedule. My iPhone 4 32 gig worked PRESTINE since DAY 1!!!! The only little issue I had was to have the device recognizing the carrier (T-Mobile). I am enjoying a GREAT PHONE with an GREAT CARRIER, thanks to an AWESOME SELLER: VERY HONEST!!!! I STRONGLY recommend this SELLER!!!! Sorry for the delay on my review. I hope it can catch the eyes of a potencial buyer for Christmas!!! Tank yo so much for the product and for the FANTASTIC PRICE!!!! 5
Never heard of this brand before, but very pleased with it thus far. Does everything I need it to do. The battery life is amazing and better than most of the more expensive phones out on the market now. Its not your high tech Android, but does the job. The only flaw I have with this phone is that it is not always responsive when texting in portrait mode compared to landscape mode. 4
Works perfectly just as i pictured it ! ❤️ 5
If your an Apple customer you'll love it , just like new , no scratches or appearance of usage .Be sure to have your sim card ready for it ... Comes in box with all accessories needed. 4
Haven't gotten around to thinking about dislikes yet 4
I bought this for my wife as soon as we moved to T-Mobile from AT&T. I am usually fearful of buying expensive electronics from anyone besides the manufacturer or a cell phone provider, but this one has been working great so far.I deducted a star since I specifically chose one that said it included a charger and it ended up not being included. Small issue however when I'm already saving this much money on a phone. 4
Just inserted T-Mobile Nano-SIM Card into black Micro-SIM Adapter then inserted into metal SIM Card Tray together... 5
I bought this phone back in March, when there was no unlock available for it. So it sit in my house untouched. Granted I had already had a factory unlocked 4S. Anyway, a couple of weeks ago I remembered that I stuck in in my dresser drawer until there was a way to unlock it from AT&T.I found a website, [...] in which you pay $60 to a company in the UK and they'll unlock it via the IMEI number so when you log onto iTunes it will be recognized as a factory unlocked iPhone. Paid the $60, boom. Gave it to the wife and she loves it, and we're now on T-Mobile.So, back in March I paid $330 for it, plus $60 = $390. Which is $110.00 cheaper than what it's being sold for today. Very happy with this purchase! 5
The battery is damage to the month of use. Work with movilnet 3G. 2
Mobile phone had some quality problems, but the site gives reasonable solutions, hope can carefully check the goods. 4
It works so fast and good .its wort the money 4
The product was defective. I ended up spending an additional $76.00 to repair the lcd. I didn't send it back due to having a small child and needing a phone at the moment. I advise the company to review all products before shipping. 1
The iPhone was like other experiences with iPhone orders I have had with Amazon. Everything was perfect! The phone arrived exactly on time and was in mint condition just as the seller described. 5
Great phone, few probs. Love that it's up to date 3
I would've expected that I could use it on any network but I'm disappointed to find that I can't set it up with my network. 1
My phone volume is very low when I'm trying to talk to people I just got my phone like a 3 weeks ago. The internet move slow and the phone itself but It's ok . Strick with name band phone like Samsung, LG but off band never work right. Now I learn my lesson I won't never do it again. 2
The iPhone 4S is a great upgrade to a 3GS user, but I wouldn't suggest paying the $100-200 premium for the 4S vs. the 4.If you take a ton of high quality pictures or use voice commands as your primary source of interaction with your phone, sure, but otherwise, I'd wait for the 6th generation iPhone to come out for the price to drop on this one, or get the 6th generation.All in all, it's a great phone but if you don't use the camera frequently or use voice commands (Siri) I would get the iPhone 4. 5
Awesome referbished phone. I would definitely recommend this to someone who's phone has been broken or stolen and is wanting a replacement iPhone. If you are inelidgible for an upgrade and do not have insurance, this is definitely the cheapest route. Great way of purchasing an iPhone at a discounted price. 5
The phone was a Christmas gift for my daughter and it said it was Sprint ready, which is my cell phone carrier. So, on Christmas day, I planned to have the phone activated so she could enjoy her gift. What I discovered was that the phone did not come with a SIM card. So, I had to go to a special, Sprint manufacturer store, get the card (which was free from Sprint), have it installed and activated at the store. If the advertisement said it didn't come with a SIM card, I sure missed it! That was a pain in the butt and disappointing for my daughter on Christmas. Other than that, the phone works great and as always, Amazon did a great job getting the phone delivered. Thanks for the great service Amazon!! 4
It's working fine and I am happy for the phone condition. No problem!!! 4
They are just wonderful. I had been wanting one and now I have it....got one for my daughter....these phones are absolutely great. Very happy with it. 5
I buyed this CellPhone from thi provider because they announce it was a New Mobile......I receive the Item and which was my surprise the CellPhone it's USED....not new.....even the old cellnumber is still on the memory im very unhappy with this....and the other thing it came with no invoice, how im supposed to declare this purchase??? without my invoice.....!!! :( 3
The version of the BlackBerry 8520 phone to request international version does not bring the Spanish option, just bring the English language. I can not make calls because neither hear nor did I hear and does not bring a manual in several languages. The letter "M" sticks. That unfortunate to lose my money 3
The description was wrong it says for sprint service but it is not for sprint after i eecived it it is verizon i am very disappointed. 1
Not too happy with this item. Say you can have connected with Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile but no sim card came with it, price out rages, and can't get it hock up for a phone use. So very unhappy as it took a long time to try all the different cell phone companies and nothing unless we buy a Sims card and still nothing. This was bull. 2
Great phone! I like the fact that Apple has allowed a little more freedom to customize. 4
Ok I bought this iPhone now I can't activate it I am desipointed . I need this unlock now they say that there is no unlock code for this phone .pls if u are buying an iPhone make sure it is unlock this was s wast of my time and money. I am KENDAL HANNA a dissatisfied customer 1
DONT BUY FROM HERE.it's not worth it. The phone I got couldn't charge. I cost me 50 dollars if I wanted to fix it. 1
The phone was fine but the battery lasts only about 45 minutes. The first day I got the phone the charger that came with it was not working. I am disappointed. I bought a new phone and I ended up with a junk battery and there were already scratches on the back. I could have bought a used iPhone at a store nearby for less and would have been MUCH more satisfied. DO NOT buy this product unless you want a price of junk that only lasts 45 minutes. This product was supposed to be new but is OBVIOUSLY NOT. 2
It came in the first expected delivery day. I love it. The applecasing was a bit smeared and all but overall im happy i bought from him. 5
The only think I don't like you send me the Cheapest usb cord n no earpod other than that everything look good n perfect 4
This is an edit to an earlier review I made. Another consumer (I think) pointed out that it uses a different network than Verizon and that I should have done my research. Well, maybe I should have. But I don't know, I'm a consumer, and even though I agree that consumers should indeed do their homework, the majority will read "Super Cool Quad Band Watch". And since there is no disclaimer in the specifications, most would probably buy it. I mean I'm not an expert, but how many people really know what GSM or CMDA means? If the Verizon guy couldn't figure it out......Anyway, I bought this product, took it to my cell phone carrier (Verizon) and they could not get it to work. Because I am not willing or able to search all of the cell phone carriers to find out which one can get it to work, and because of the fact that it is way more bulkier than I thought, I returned it.You know what, in all fairness, I'll upgrade my rating because I can't speak on how it works. But I got a white one and the watch band is a noticeable different shade of white compared to the watch. If you are getting it for your kid like I did, just know that it is bulky and looks like someone grabbed a nokia and trimmed off the key pad and slapped it onto a wristband. JUST MY OPINION. Again, It might work for you but the look threw me off. 2
This phone is Described as NEW but obviously is not, phone appeared new in factory box. The first phone died after 2 hours, the screen when blank and could not be restarted. The second one worked okay except that the microphone was bad and callers could not hear you, nor could you do a voice recording. 1
This phone was refurbished but still worked perfectly! There were a few noticeable scratches and scuffs on the back of the phone, but nothing a good case couldnt take away. Nothing was wrong with the phone and was exactly what I was expecting for $150. A very good deal indeed 3
I'll recommend you to other friends and family members 5
The battery swelled to the point that it almost exploded and ruined phone. Then the seller would not replace!!!!! 1
If you rely on the speaker for navigation or hands free talking, then you will be disappointed. It is only audible in a totally silenced room and VERY difficult to hear in a moving car (windows closed). 3
Great phone look just as described in perfect condition. Order it on the 22nd recieved it on the 25th fast shipping. very happy :) 5
Not new looking. That's for sure. Not well refurbished. Prompt refund hence the two stars 2
Love this IPhone ,,, although not the most modern model from apple compared to my old motorola phone I had before this phone is like going from day to night big big difference ,,, is worth every dollar I pay , very very happy with this purchase ..I've heard some criticism here in some comments about the phone not being unlocked !! ,,, no problem ,,, at&t is doing it very easy for people who buy old models iphones to unlock any i phone for free !!! if you buy a new older models or used from business like amazon or you buy it from someone else at&t will , unlocked at no charge ,, I did unlock my purchase for free in the At&t web side if you Iphone is three year old and has no pending contract with at&t and has no history of being stolen or history prematurely canceled contracts from the original owner with at&t this in case you buy a used ) they will unlocked for free !!! ...,, 5
Phone says it's unlocked will only work on wifi the phone is a version phone and will not sync with my AT&T plan. Can only make calls without wifi. On description it did not say what company phone is from 1
Phone was glitchy, screen becomes unresponsive in the middle and you can only touch the top and bottom of it until you turn it off and turn it back on. Happens at least 20x a day if you open your phone 30x 1
I will be sending this phone back for a return and full refund. I had high hopes that this phone would work with PagePlus Celluar. Unfortunately, after a week I received this the mic started to malfunction to the point where I could only hear people if I put them on speaker phone. Wish this would of worked out because the price was great! 2
Phone was as good as described, price was reasonable, service and delivery were excellent. Good seller, good product. 4
The 8520 Blackberry mobile is somewhat a good phone but the phone u sent me is not what u advertise it looks like a toy phone. 3
Recieve phone and one speaker didn't work sent back and recieved another one and same thing occurred. Great picture and overall function just that speaker was my flaw. 2
This phone is not real. Fake phone. It still works fine (well it has so far) but it is fakeeee 2
I bought this before going overseas. The front facing camera is not working. I am really disappointed in this purchase. 1
Phone looks goodShipping was fast 4
Product was a gift for someone. Once they received the phone and attempted to use it the return window was over:( we charged the phone for first time use and determined the battery will not hold a charge and drained within a few hours with minimal use. 1
Fast delivery and product as described. Seller was good to work with. Very pleasant experience. 5
I received a good result on these phones in terms of sounds, it's clear when chatting. 4
I initially found this phone to be adequate at best but now after using it for a month I am seeing it's many flaws. Despite the reported high mp camera the pics are not very good. I am unable to save pics that others text to me... The latest problem is Google asking me what I want randomly when I try to do anything with the phone. The operating system is painfully slow, will freeze, and facebook and other apps will frequently crash. This phone is a waste of money. The microSD card basically adds no usable memory. You need actual RAM to run and store even a moderate number of modern apps. Stay away, this thing is not good. 2
If U don't have an iPad, U don't have an iPad ;)I recommend getting the 64GB... Once U go Apple U won't go Back 5
Phone is perfect just one little dent on back. The charger however did not work. 4
After using it for six months here are my observations-* Excellent 3G and 2G network - This is not know to many. My partner has iphone6 and she always has network problem while Blackberry gives very good network speed. My partner uses my Blackberry's tethering feature to browse on iphone. I found this phone to fetch mails even in remote places where even 2G network is weak.* Excellent keyboardWorst part of this or any Blackberry phone is "Very limited apps". 4
It already starting to free. 3
When I opened the BB cell phone in the back inside part it had sulphate in several places. I have used it and it seems to work ok but why did it have sulphate inside ? I think it was not new and I had ordered a new cell phone. 3
Its a nice phone my son like it... 4
I bought because It said that It was unlocked but It wasn't. Now I am in my country, Ecuador and It doesn't work so it is not open to use it worldwide.DON'T BELIEVE THIS GUY ! 1
Works well. No scratches or sign of use. Only a little flaws but they work themselves out. Love this phone more than my android! 4
Hard to use! Didn't get all the service 2
Great phone. Super screen. Only negative is that it connects to Amazon store and my account so purchases are not controlled if you give it to your kid. 4
Great phone. I didn't realize that I couldn't get 4g LTE but that was my fault for not reading the specs in depth. Otherwise phone works well so far. 3
Love it now that my work mates can text me for any shift changes or new shift been added into work schedule 5
Speaker sound from phone when making a call is not good 2
Received this product and the phone did not turn on at all. Will be contacting them to return this product. I tried to charge it overnight and the iPhone is completely dead. Complete waste. 1
not a good experience, i can not return it 1
Can't tell if it's the phone, the android system, or my AT&T provider, but I dislike the current combination. Battery like is too short. Screen looks great. It's also a tad large for the pockets in most of my pants, but that may be because I bought those pants before cell phones became larger. 3
It served the purpose till upgrade on Verizon kicked in! 3
very good phone and i fix gevey sim and it work perfictno any problem for tranferingthe saller very good company and contact with customer for any help 5
Would not charge at all. Returned to amazon for a refund. 1
On March 29 the phone did not charge. In the morning it flashed the apple symbol and will not turn on. Visited the Genius Bar and was informed the phone was actually 4 years old and there was nothing to be done. We also discovered the phone was from a batch that was recalled for faulty batteries. Purchased from Amazon because we trusted buying from a reputable company we'd be safe. It's now passed the return date so we spent over $200 for almost 2 months worth of use. 1
The phone constantly disconnects from the WiFi - it shows an active connection, but no data is being transmitted. WiFi has to be disabled and reenabled to resume connectivity. This is a BIG deal for me, is there a fix and/or workaround? Will return if not....OK phone otherwise - expected battery life, fairly updated OS, good response time, decent pics, etc... 2
Not a bad phone, though very limited on accessories available for it. 2
should've read the entire description - inevitably switched to AT&T but now can't use BBMworks fine otherwisewould recommend seller 3
only has 512MB of memory; not enough to load any other apps or save music or save photos 3
I just didn't like it 5
Phone is okay at best. Physically the phone is nice and small and looks great. But the functionality of the phone is poor. Options are very minimal. It would be unfair to say phone absolutely sucks, but considering price of phone, can't expect too much out of it. I probably would never purchase another BLU phone. This model is fine, but I have not had the greatest experience with other BLU phones. You truly get what you pay for. 3
Love this phone, works great and is easy to use 4
The phone is a very nice phone. My issue with it was that I could not get it to send text messages. I had problems getting it to be compatible with consumer cellular network. Went through troubleshooting with a tech from the carrier, to no avail. I loved the designed and the hardware, beautiful display, very fast phone. Just couldn't get it to work with my network. 3
Screen is fake the SIM card slot doesn't come out 1
I purchased this phone for my daughter and after 6 months of use, the phone was blocked by T-Mobile. My carrier uses the T-Mobile towers and assisted me in getting in touch with T-Mobile. T-Mobile stated that this I-Phone was financed with them but the service was terminated as well as the payment for the phones that would have eliminated the balance. T-Mobile further stated that I was not the first person to ever call them with this problem and was sympathetic to me having a useless phone but could not help me any further even when I offered to pay the phone off. I strongly suggest that if you purchase from this seller, get the IMEI number and call T-Mobile to ensure that the phone is not tied to a financed contract. I now have a useless I-Phone and a very hurt little girl who was awarded the phone from me for making the A/B honor roll..... 1
quick shipment, product was as described and worked well. 4
I did not see anty blue tooth that come with it but the phnoe aWas not loading my international credit easily . 4
I am a tech junkie, and this is one of the best cell phones I've ever used. The screen is beautiful, the look and feel is very premium, the speakers are the best I've heard on any mobile device, and the software is the perfect blend of stock Android and some very useful customizations (the feature that flips the screen orientation is really cool). Seriously, the speaker is outstanding - music sounds incredible and I now love to use the speakerphone. The ONLY complaints I have about it are that it is sometimes a TAD bit slower than the flagship phones in opening a program or doing a task, and the camera sometimes has grainy images in low light or when you zoom in. But even then, I compared it with other phones, and I'd say the pictures are only 5%-10% more noisy than the best ones, so it's not a big deal. Plus the shutter speed is really fast. And I like that the LED flash is a more yellow color which leads to more natural toned pictures taken with the flash.The button placement, as people have mentioned, is a little weird, but it is not a big deal and you get used to it quickly. 5
Came to this phone from an iPhone 4s. I wanted something with a little less functionality, but it ended up inhibiting my life too much. Crappy camera. Trackpad is useless. Minimal amount of apps available. Apps that you can download take forever to use. Once I spent 10 minutes trying to log food on MyFitnessPal. This should not be a 10 minute activity. Maps get you lost. The keyboard is glitchy. One of the worst things is that if you're running and listening to music, the songs skip as if you were playing an actual CD. Absolutely horrible device. I liked the idea of having a physical keyboard, but there were too many things wrong with this phone. Sold it to get an iPhone 6 plus. No regrets. 2
I did not got luck on this phone due to the simtray card stuck while transfer the address from old one to the new one. I enadup send the unit back and got my money back. Good seller with reputation to do business with. 4
Great price and works great. Meets all my expectations! 5
I'm going to get two more before I go home. They were great in Jamaica 4
Just I Expected on use phones 3
I would have given it a higher rating, but I had to get a SIM card Holder installed on the Phone. Other than that the phone seems to be working fine. Phone is in very good condition and was well packaged. 4
I bought this phone for a friend in Jamaica and from the feedback i for from them,it's seems like a nice phone 3
Short battery life and chrome doesn't work as well as the browser already loaded on the phone. Had to purchase a larger sim to get everything to work. I use family mobile BTW. Good phone for the price, but definitely disappointed in the battery. 3
Let me repeat myself, do NOT update your iPhone 4S. It will cause it to become so incredibly slow with the latest version of iOS 9 that the phone is almost impossible to use without wanting to throw it at a wall or in the trash. It is possible to downgrade to iOS 7 or something, but you need some techie experience. Anyways, this is a good phone to use when you want something cheap. Mine came in like new condition with it being unlocked which I'm happy. Now it's time to get the iPhone 7 now that I got a job. :D 3
Loved it even with the few chips in the screen 4
Very few scratches on the back. Overall I'm happy with product and would recommend it to anyone on the fence about buying one 4
Mobile in perfect condition, 2 stars due to lack of some accessories like charger and headset. 2
The Idol 3 smartphone is so thin and light that, despite its large 4.7" diagonal screen, it doesn't feel any bulkier in my bluejeans pocket than my 5-year-old prior smartphone did, Great job. 5
So, the phone itself is 5 stars. I needed a Verizon compatible phone and that's what I got. I removed my SIM card from the old one and set this one up no problem. I gave it three stars because of everything else.It comes with headphones, a wall charger and cable, but they were all different brands. The wall charger was some off brand, the cable was belkin but what was weird is that the headphones were really nice, dreys beats, the kind that go IN your ear, but they were used (gross). 3
i ordered a white iPhone and got a blue one... so I think that's a little unprofessional but other then that i like it. 4
Muy mal, el telefono muy estropeado, con golpes, sin audifonos ni cargador. Very bad 1
I was really excited about this phone that is why i was willing to pay extra for it. The only down side is when it is charging it malfunctions if you try to use it while charging. The sender put way too much tape on the case, but all & all pretty happy with my phone. 4
The phone hangs up after I speak for five minutes. I've only had it less than 6 months. I would not recommend. 1
The phone was not new as stated it was defected when it arrive also car alarm pruchase did not work cause more than the item too send back 1
Phone works good but the power cord was broke when I received it. I had to go out and buy one. 3
I'm a patient, tech savvy guy. So after my 3rd factory reset and a continued glitchy system, I have given up. I'm giving it 3 stars still, because I see the potential. And it seems other users have had a great experience. I don't wanna scare you off from giving this a go. Maybe I just got an unlucky pick off the line. Definitely potential. But definitely a pain in my butt. Gonna try out the Oneplus One instead. 3
Totally Bummed....Was a Christmas present for my son and the letter 'E' doesn't work. It now sits in the drawer..Useless! 1
Several scratches in the phone but works almost as if it was new. 2
it works for now but BB RIM need to offer better direct apps. thank you. 3
its over heating to much 3
Arrived quickly, works absolutely fine. 5
It's OK. Unfortunately it doesn't work like the one it replaced. Got it for my grandson to replace one he lost. The watch works well camera so so music plays ok. You must have a sim card for for everything else to work . His other one would cannect to his ear piece and Facebook and Internet without a sim card. Had to amend the review. 1 It only has five faces to chose not many and when playing music the battery died in less then one and a half hour. 2
Shipping was fine, the phone works but I think something maybe wrong with product as a whole. Not an issue with seller but Apple. This phone appears very cheaply made in my opinion, the App are shown in very low quality, my itouch 4th gen has better quality images. Still doing my research though. 3
the phone arrived as described in great condition. it was ready to go to a sprint store and get signed up for a sprint account, etc. I'm using it and loving it! no issues with getting a sim card, etc. 5
Its good just don't have much space in it .Other then that it works fine 4
If you don't need to use bluetooth, the phone is pretty good. If you need bluetooth, avoid it. The Kit Kat update did NOT fix the bluetooth issue. It will connect to a device, but it cuts in and out and eventually disconnects. When I emailed Blu customer support, they implied that the issue was my bluetooth device. It will not connect reliably to any of my bluetooth devices (even though every other family members' phones work with those devices and they have various brands/models). Since Blu does not appear to be committed to fixing the issue or even acknowledging that it exists, I will be returning my phone. I live in a city that requires use of hands-free devices while driving. My $50 interim phone had working bluetooth. A $200 phone should have functioning bluetooth as well. 2
Phone came as promised, ordered used but still looks brand new, very fast, updated version of IOS and I am very satisfiesmd with my purchased 5
Phone looks new and has clean imei. Not black listed nor has a balance due. No problems with it so far (only been a couple days)Would of givin a 5 star review but it says it's brand new and when I went to put my SIM card in the phone there was already an att sim installed. Found that weird. Overall though it seems like a great phone. 4
the phone works great!! and for the price you can't beat it. ideal when travel outside of the country and want to stay connected !! 3
I didn't like it because I went to go switch my service over and I couldn't because it was still in someone else name 1
The phone is fine, but it was advertised as new. It wasn't. There was a phone number in it and I had to go to verizon to delete the number, get another sim to put my number in. 3
Unit arrived with only a quick-start pamphlet, no instruction manual. Purchased this for my elderly mother-in-law, an elderly person would never be able to activate this without better instructions. I am skilled with electronics but had difficulty figuring out how to open it. Finally found a small notch on top and took a chance on prying it open (that worked). SIM car needs to be inserted upside-down (chip facing up) - that also took several tries to get right. Decent no-frills phone - when you finally figure out how to put it together. 3
The phone was in great condition. I can only find one little mark on the case. The phone has been working fine with AT&T. I'm very happy with this purchase. 5
Very happy with the phone, it takes a while to learn how to use all the options and functions but there is good on-line documentation available. 4
The phone works perfect. Looks like new. Shipping was faster thanks 5
Was not like they said it was not unlocked 1
This is a great phone. I did not want an iPhone 6, so I chose the 5S. My only complaintis (and the only reason why I did not give it 5 stars) is that the battery is short lived. To methat is annoying especially when I have not used it that much and the battery is down to75 or 80%. So I have to charge it frequently. If anyone has a hint for me to increasebattery life, I'd love to hear it. 4
*** I GOT DUPLICATE IPHONE, AS SOON AS YOU GET THE PHONE PLEASE CHECK WHETHER IT IS ORIGINANL BY CALLING APPLE SUPPORT TO SAVE YOURSELF **** SELLER: WIRELESS MARKET"I bought the phone and it display gone bad within two months, and when I went to apple service center they checked the phone and said it is a duplicate product. And I said them that I got it from amazon. They said, they are facing many duplicate phone complaint from amazon purchases.I was further shocked!!!!I felt lonely and cheated by a big giant! I felt helpless. Depressed!!! It was a gift to my wife, and felt shame! felt insulted! Please be aware and save yourself.. 1
The watch is internally set for GMT in which N.Y. is GMT-5:00 however nothing you can do to get it from AM to PM or vice versa so if you use the Stock digital face clock will be 24hrs off if you can set it at all. I hope the seller contacts me with a way to fix this problem or I may have return it and I really don't want to do that but rules are rules. can't set the time don't pay a dime.6/20/2015 Okay I got the date fixed as I had to sync it with my phone, still the user manual is kind of useless, but you can google smart watch setup [...]. And get some great tips, but I have not had any success loading any faces yet I will keep everyone interested posted, as we know the seller isn't going to help you.After about 5 days I must admit my disappointment I can not add additional faces and I have tried so many times it isn't funny. A watch face app creator replied to me after I complained his app had failed miserably , he took the time to try to help me but I have come to the decision or reality that the watch wont do much of anything other than what's on your phone and that can be a pain in the butt, it works but it takes getting used to and to be really honest you have to ask your self do you want an extension of your phone on your wrist. My answer is no. but who's ever reading this can make up their own mind about that because it is kind of annoying and insignificant. 2
the phone works great, but i did have to get the power cord replaced shortly after receiving it. but the apple store gave it to me for free because it was still under warrenty 4
This phone gets so hot that my daughter has to hold it with a towel. 1
Phone not fully. Unlocked. Took 5 hrs over 4 half-days together up email and gain access to internet Phone functionality difficult to find in online manual. Should conduct usage tests. Phone quality. Seems high. 4
Great cell. I buy with 99.99 offer, great deal. 4
I bought the iPhone 6 Gold 64GB from Wireless Warehouse. It was said to be in excellent condition I picked it up for about $400. I get the phone, overall it was in good condition. It had one little ding on the bottom right nothing too noticeable. After using it for about 2 days I noticed the battery life was absolutely dreadful. Luckily, the firmware was on 9.3.3 so it could be jailbroken. I jailbroke the iPhone I downloaded a tweak to give me information about my battery life it's at ~40-60% capacity it likes to jump around, it had over 800 charges. The iPhone was used a lot I could tell. So I am going to order an external battery and take apart the phone. Now if anyone else has a bad battery and they need to switch it out I recommend you go with extreme caution. If you're not comfortable with doing it then I highly recommend you don't do it. If you can pay apple their fee (which I think is roughly $100) then I would do that. However, I don't really feel apple should get $100 for a battery you can pick up for $20. But again I am fairly comfortable with taking apart my phone. Overall I am happy about the phone I will update later once I order the battery and get it put in. 4
It's an ok phone, the screen is poor in resolution, the cpu is kinda slow on times and the phone get's stuck on a black screen from time to time, i need to remove the battery because pressing power buttons or combinations of volume up and down dont work. My true rating is 2.5 stars not 2 and especially not 3. Another thing to consider, if you are going to use it for 2 sims it will get ever slower and slower until it reboots itself, so i dont recommend the 2 sim solution even if you are on a budget this a a semi-waste for a 2 sim long term solution, if it's for a short term AKA 3 to 6 month's then yeah take it for a spin, no harm done. This phone is for budget minded people only not a long term solution phone because it will give you trouble from time to time. 2
everything it said it was. works great. delivery was faster than expected. 5
I specifically ordered an AT&T phone but received a t mobile carrier phone. Not cool at all. 1
8GB iPhone is USELESS. iOS takes up nearly /2 the storage -- the device is maxed out after few pictures, songs and chats. DON'T BUY AN 8GB IPHONE!!! Expensive lesson learned. 1
It wasn't unlock and it was broken 1
The phone was exactly as describe only thing was the screen was a bit loose 4
I love this phone so much thank youYou really deserved that money and thanks for not setting me up. 4
Phone was sold under Verizon as the carrier. when I called Verizon to activate the device they said the IME # was not a Verizon phone and would not activate the phone. 1
I wanted a smartphone for Nextel iDen network and this fits the bill. It is an obsolete phone and wasn't going to pay full retail price to Nextel so a refurbished is a good compromise for an obsolete network as I am forced to use it. 4
Cannot use sim card (overseas)Called ATT and they claimed they cannot unlock it because it isn't activatedAwaiting jailbreak info for IOS 7.1Had to order a different phone 2
I found it opened box and fingers on screen 2
When I bought this a while ago, I was buying a 32GB phone. Then when I got the phone, the phone was reported stolen. The seller immediately responded to my claim and he sent me a new phone. Except the new one was only a 16 GB phone and it was hard to hear people when I was on a call. I also paid the amount for a 32 GB phone and ended up with a 16 GB phone that came with a bonus "box." Then the hearing part went completely out, so I just bought a new phone from Verizon. 1
Served its purpose but the camera is terrible! 2
Came without key to open it and right away has issues: when you pull up one screen the previous one can be seen behind it. I live overseas so returning it is a real hassle. I should've just paid extra for a new one 😆😞 1
Love this phone as easy as my I Pad, slim sleek designs would and will , only buy Apple Products... 5
Great deal for an iPhone! We use it for our tween (and as backup for Waze and other apps) as an AT&T GoPhone. Since the case is less robust than the other iPhones, we got an Otterbox case and so far it's been working great! 5
I need a refund of some money as I paid almost the same amount to clear the goods and the camera takes absolutely no pictures which makes me angry. 2
Looks good. Works good. Accessories are really bad. I'm using my old original USB to charge the phone. It shows a label with Verizon locked on the back of the phone. But it works fine for T-mobile. So far it's working fine. Let's see what happen 4
You can barely hear when you are talking to someone 2
It is less expensive than the iphone 5s and I bought it with no contract to replace the iphone 4s that she had. She loves it and I think the phone looks nice and sleek. 5
The watch is a joke don't buy it at all please save your money and buy something else 2
Camera quality isn't what I exoected, but overall Love it! 3
Received garbage its defeated phones 1
I am so pleased that I purchased this phone! I was using a Google Nexus 4 and it just didn't feel "right." After going back to the iPhone, I am so happy!!This was a great buying experience too! The seller was super speedy on shipping and the price was AMAZING for a MINT-condition iPhone 4S! Thanks for such a great buying experience!! 5
the battery does not last for a long time. 2
IT was a nice phone. it worked for a little while but the bluetooth wasent strong enough to keep a single to a head set and in the end we had to do an upgrade with horrible att 2
This phone is not unlocked!!! Sold by BuySPRY 1
The front camera stopped working today 2
The phone works great but when I tried to activate the SIM card the phone went into an endless loop. Now I have to wait for Straight Talk to send me a new sim so I can actually use the phone as a phone instead of a very expensive iPod touch. Not happy. 1
LO LAMENTABLE ES QUE TARDO 10 DIAZ DESPUES DE LA FECHA PREVISTA, VINO CON LA MARCA VERIZON, Y LA VISTA EN LA PAGINA NO LA TIENE. NO LEVANTA 3G VENEZUELA, MOVISTR EDGE Y MOVILNE EDGE EN ALGUNAS ZONAS OTRA NO FUNCIONA, DE RESTO, DENTRO DE LO ESPERADO. 3
It came in perfect conditions and has been working good, not so sure about if it's new or refurbished because of some details in the keyboard and data, but it's really good! 4
I want my money back!! What a disappoint :( never expected this to happen to me ;( 1
On time - brand new, in box "just as advertised"! 5
First let me say, I'm a Windows Insider person. I'm on the Fast Ring of Beta testing. My real phone is a Lumia 950 XL. The ones before it were also Windows. And the ones way before that were Android, all Motorola. So this is my first Apple phone. Because 3/4 of my family are Apple people...we won't go into why but I blame it on the schools...they use FaceTime a lot. So, hence, if I want to be part of the social circle I have to use Apple. As for the phone, it's an okay phone. I like Live Tiles better than static apps. I like the power of Windows 10 Mobile. Siri has nothing on Cortana. Microsoft phones are durable and work as well as any with Apple's reputation. So I usually only use the iPhone on WiFi. But this certified refurbished phone works and works consistently. My one big complaint is it uses a Micro SIM instead of a Nano SIM. I can't swap SIMs to use cellular service on my main number. I bought this one for the extraordinary price. But I see another, Nano SIM model, certified refurbished iPhone in my future. Unless, of course, Apple decides to share FaceTime and iTunes with other platforms like Microsoft shares Office, Skype, Wunderlist, and many other apps with it's competitors. BTW I'm what would be considered an elderly woman and not some IT professional. 4
iPhone looks and works very good.Sorry that no headphones. The seller is comunicatible. 5
there is a big problem in this phone every time I send it to the manufacturer I get another problemPROBLEM. whenever I call I was unable to disconnect I had to reboot to go to another call nowit jumps to other apps by itself I sent it again same problem Now the warranty is expired . 2
I recently purchase this cell phone, however i was unable to activated its services after inserting a Sim card. the phone was supposed to be unlocked however i was still unable to have use of the phone.I tried purchasing the unlocking system via the computer,but that didn't work out...I want to know if the phone legit.Can i please get another phone if the unlocking system does not work?..I like the phone but i want to be able to use it need help please. 4
clock not working all the time... 4
Looks like brand new. Arrived within 2 days. 5
I bought three of those iPhone as a gift. I know in the ads they said it is used.But they are in good quality, no cracks or any bad signs on any of them. The price was a bargain. I liked them so much that I placed another order for two more.Good communication with the seller too.ThanksOmaima 5
was fascinated, but when I saw I could not get him to Ecuador was terrible, so I had to make the return, and I do not like 3
Exactly as described. Packaged well 5
I love my phone but I am giving 4 stars, only 1 complaint. The volume when making calls is very very low, so I have to either use my head phones or use speaker. Sometimes inconvenient but I'm used to it now.Thanks 4
Very fast shipping and everything works smooth. 4
I am very pleased with this purchase. Everything was in excellent condition and a case for the phone was also included.Would definitely recommend this to others. 4
Everything working great still, the home button is a little ehh but other than that great price and in good condition. 4
It was s good phone. Can couldn't hear with the speakers. Had to always use the ear piece 3
One day, it had a failure, it turns off and after a short time it turns on, the cellphone was not as i expected. 2
I received the phone quickly but am disappointed to say that the headphone /auxiliary cord plug in does not work. One reeson for wanting the iPhone was for music. Paid a decent price for a manufacturer refurbished phone and it does not completely work 3
Phone accessories doesn't work and the doest last over 3 weeks 1
It's an iPhone- there's not too much more to say. It works great with all our other Apple products and the price was excellent for the large memory. I've been happy with it so far. 4
Great phone and good customer service 4
It is a very good device, but after 5 months it is not working properly. 3
The one star is because the seller accepted my return request immediately. The screen and case were scratched, but most importantly: The camera didn't work! No focus! Back it went. Bought new. Fifty dollars more. My advice is: don't waste your time with setup & troubleshooting an iffy device. 1
I recieved it broken and it doesn't charge not what I expected 1
the charger that brings the phone comes with problems and not burden and also has problems microphone output, not recommended because pay for something new and seems used 2
Phone arrived quickly as described and worked great for a week. After a day bouncing between Apple and my carrier Apple replaced the phone for a new one. The new phone lasted a week and I had to make another appointment with Apple and they replaced that phone. Quality control could be better. Has all the bells and whistle to keep my daughter happy. 4
Had difficulty connecting to wf 4
Iphone that I bought is broken ( the round button in the middle) and locked. - I read in my order - Factory unlocked - and I don't understand. 1
Great phone at a great price! from Estock 5
This phone is nice i just got one for my daughter but wen it came the charger didn't work I had to go buy a new one 4
I have some trouble with a independent seller and the order was canceled but after the reorder through amazon direct handling everything was ok.... 3
Wonderful phone, came as described. 5
I'm just giving 3 stars for now as I still don't know if the phone works good or not.The phone arrived on time but when I put in my Metro PCS SIM card it won't recognize it.I checked on the website and it clearly states that phone is compatible with AT&T,T-Mobile,Metro PCS and most GSM carriers.I will go to the Metro PCS store tomorrow to see if there's a way get it to work.UPDATED REVIEW!!!!!,,,I went to Metro PCS to get a newer SIM card and this time it worked,had to pay an extra $15 but the phone is running and is working properly.I think the price is ok for a phone like this.The phone is thin and it looks like is well constructed,the only weird thing is that the power button is on the upper left side but I can live with that.The screen isn't too bright but I can also live with that and for a phone with a 5.5 screen is not bulky or too big,I just love the size and I'm happy with my phone.WELL I'M GIVING THE PHONE 4 STARS!!!!!! 3
I don't know what they called certified refurbished, but all i received was a severly dented and scratched phone with a new screen. Also, it won't even turn on! DON'T BUY AND WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS. 1
In the end....Great! I recieved a defective phone from this company that somebody had sold to them, and i sent it back and I sent it back and they sent me a replacement phone RIGHT AWAY and I recieved it within the next 2 days and it worked Perfectly. :)...Not exactly how i wanted it to go but they did their job! 4
Phone was delivered early but is being sent back because the phone consistantly showed no service. I checked with the carrier and went through apple support and it was a problem with the the phone. It wasn't worth it to spend $100 plus to get it fixed through Apple. 1
All the other IPhones are overrated. The 2g works just as well. Basic. Sleek. Cool. Holds just the right amount of information that one needs. 5
Works like a brand new phone. Works great. 5
During the first week of having the phone, the screen would shut off and won't turn back on even though I would still hear notifications coming in. It did it several times. Recently it started making an ear piercing static noise every time notifications would come in that would require a sound. 2
Siri doesn't work but I guess it's fine😒 2
This phone was locked when I got it even though it says un-locked. 1
Awesome condition and shipping was fast. The only downside is the battery life of the phone is pretty low. 4
On time and not other relevant comment. 5
The good news is that it was an unlocked phone. And I was able to go to any carrier to start it up.The bad news is that it does not have a good battery life. The phone loses its charge very quickly! 2
It came in excellent condition, runs very good, only sidenote would be a slight scuff on the Sim card tray but other than that very good phone 10/10 would recommend 4
Came exactly as advertised with hardly any sign of wear. 4
This person selling this item is a liar .. I asked specifically if this unit is for t mobile. The sell told me yes.. I put a tmobile SIM card in this phone that was sent to me but it did not read because the Carrier was sent to sprint 1
i purchased this item March 28, 2016. It is now Oct. 13, 2016 and my phone is flickering and has what the internet says "touch disease". I spent so much money on a product that hasnt even lasted a year. Rip off. 2
Was good first day then started cutting off ... Phone sucked 2
Phone was from Japan - could not use in the states even though the claim was that it was a brand new, unlocked phone and could be used anywhere. It was actually registered to a Japanese phone number and an account that was open. Very disappointed. 1
This is a gift .......👍🏽 3
Not a bad phone, though very limited on accessories available for it. 2
At the moment I have to say its ok,because I have not used it yet. I will activate it in Germany, and hope all goes well, if it is usable and works well,I will re post my review.M.St. 3
 The phone is an unlocked phone and the support network of the phone is 3G (WCDMA 850/2100) and 2G Quad Band(GSM 850/900/1800/1900) network ,If you have to buy a sim card buy the GSM/WCDMA SIM card. Do not buy the CDMA SIM card from them.The support language of the phone is English, Bahasa Indonesia, Bahasa Malaya, Burmese, Cestina, Deutsch, Espanola, French, Italiano, Nederland's, Portuguese, Vietnamese, Turkish, Greek, Russian, Hebrew, Arabic, Persian, Thai, Simplified/Traditional Chinese.If your service support those network, and those language, you can use this phone.It supports two different sims cards and a memory card I put a 64 gig memory card in it and it supported it.The internet on this phone is just as fast as 4g I was very impressed with the speed of the phone and clarity.The phone is very well made and durable you will not be disappointed with this phone.I received this phone at no cost/free to test it and try it out in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion/review of the Juning cell phone. 5
I really like the phone it is very easy to use and can be cusstomized to anyone with tons of aps avilable. 5
It is a good phone but the cam is just not good well what can we expect for the price but is pretty good 3
Bought this as a travel phone and served its purpose. Good for taking voice calls and listening to fm radio. Not ideal for texting. No instructions with the phone. I wasn't able to find the mechanism to lock the keys from accidental dialing. 3
I'm sending it back only having it a few days. Reason why is that the battery sucks on this phone. If it was not for the battery it would have been a good phone. The battery runs down so gas and I have to charge it a few times a day and it takes forever to charge as well. So that's why I'm sending it back. 2
I gave this transaction a 2 because their is a dis colored section of screen which was not stated and although comes in original box no headphones were included. Besides that phone works fine. 2
I love this nifty phone because i can unlock it and then use another carrier of GSM like T-mobile. This is something i will have until ios 7 comes out since iphone 3gs wont support it. To make this even more special amazon sells these phones and apple doesnt or other companies since semtember 2012 these iphones are for sale in store. In the package came the Iphone itself, a sim card removal tool, New Earphones, and a New USB connector. Overall I am happy with this iphone until IOS 7 comes out then i will upgrade. 5
Great smart phone. Gets a bit sluggish from time to time, but I still like it. It's big, thin and the battery last all day. A bang for the buck! 4
Hello! Acquire thisApple iPhone 4S 16GB Unlocked - White (Certified Refurbished) product and the same presentaa problem with the handset (not olle ) what is the procedure to enforce the guarantee 3
I have this phone and the 5.5. The 5.5 is a much better phone. The camera is poor quality on this phone, the pictures are fuzzy. Pay a little more and buy the 5.5! 2
It died in less than hour each time I charged it other wise it's ok 1
Phone won't hold a charge and the volume down button doesn't work. Definitely not a quality phone. 1
Really good phone other than battery...THE BATTERY LIFE IS A JOKE I had to charge 3x a day thats ridiculous 3
This phone is nice i just got one for my daughter but wen it came the charger didn't work I had to go buy a new one 4
The phone is great and exaclty as the description said. Would recommend this seller. I bought 2 for my parents they are happy and the phones are really new. Thanks again I am so happy. 5
Good! I just didn't like about the recharger, cause is not original but the rest is ok! 4
only worked for a few months! battery died and needs a replacement its been in a drawer ever since! waste of money! 1
I bought this phone back in October 2015 and added a Protection Plan. Now only 7 mos. later the Home button is not working properly. I called the protection plan service provider to submit a repair/replacement claim and they referred me to Apple. Apple said the Limited Warranty expired and referred me back to the service provider. Well, it seems no one is willing to make good on this purchase. I totally understand this is an older phone model, but that's why I purchased a protection plan, now I'm out $274.95 for a bad phone. 1
In great condition. It came with charger. I have had no problems with the phone. 5
it is fairly to use it, and there were some scratches. 4
This product was very difficult to set up. Even now most of the time it refuses to connect and give an error message telling us that our devices is not recognized. The one time I made a phone call it dropped the call so that I had to use more minutes to reconnect. I am new to satellite communications so maybe I was expecting too much but the set up issues are inexcusable. 2
I used it for about 2 weeks, it was working fine and I was even surprised to see all the things that I could do with it...honestly I would take this over an apple iwatch. I forgot to remove one morning and took shower with it, I don't if that's the problem but now it won't charge so now I don't have a watch 2
I still use it, works great 5
Product was in good condition but was kind of dirty and the speaker seems to be going out other then that I love it. 4
Terrible Phone. Lagged. Bad Camera. Bad sounds. Just...cheap. I mean you should know what you're getting for the price you're paying so it comes as no surprise. I'd rather pay a bit more for a lot more. 2
I adore this phone but for some reason it won't take my sim card!! I'm so sad!! I was wondering if I could be told how to install my sim card!! I've tried EVERYTHING!! 2
Terrible - won't hold a charge. Refurbished nightmare - if we hadn't been in such a bind I never would have bought this 1
Purchased this phone for my son. Initially very pleased with how the phone looked. When we received the phone, we were initially impressed with the way the display looked. The phone is slim and looks quite similar to a Samsung phone. There are a bunch of accessories provided with the product like a transparent sleeve, earbud, protective screen, which is a bonus. It runs on Android 4.4.2 and we use Family Mobile as carrierOne of the soft earbuds on the supplied earphone had come off within a few days of usage which is not a big deal as there were other buds in the package to replace it.Microphone problem: This is a major phoblem that we encountered with this phone. In less than a month, the microphone on the phone has stopped working. Owing to the microphone problem in less than a month on a new phone, I have to give this product just 2 stars out of 5. I have filled in service form on the Blu website with all the requested details for the microphone problem. It is unfortunate that a new phone should have its microphone fail in less than a month. I will update this review when and if there is a response to my request on their website 2
I have a strange problem with this phone. When it's plugged into the wall, some on screen buttons stop working. 3
Love the phone and got a great price for it. Good for anyone who's looking for a nice cheap and useful smartphone for everyday use. Using for the tmobile line. works great 5
Looks nice nw I'm using its works good too 4
The phone works great and arrived quickly. This is a used product and I'm very happy with it. No problems. 5
Arrived in 5 days - (green case on phone included) came with box, charger adapter and charger, and screen protector. Love, love, love it!!! 4
The description of the cosmetics of the phone was very accurate. However the phone didn't work the way it should have so that was a disappointment, we returned it. 2
It did not because when I was searching for the iPhone 5s, I searched by iPhone 5s GSM unlocked and I was presented by a CDMA iPhone and there was no specification whether it was CDMA or something else. I had to reach out to the seller whether that phone was GSM or not and that is when I learnt that it was a CDMA. Poor searching categoriAtion of your items. 1
Good product. Exactly what I was looking for. Good price for a good product. 4
Great product met all my expectationsWould buy again 5 stars 5
Phone glass is littlebit scratch n than back site too it looks like old phone 2
I believe I was purchasing a new - not refurbhished item. However, the phone has been problematic since it was activated. After a few months of use, it began to power itself down automatically after 5 to 20 minutes of use. It also didn't hold a charge for very long. I took it to a recommended repair shop and the technician suggested that the battery could be bad. Upon opening the phone to change the battery, he discovered a somewhat bloated battery - indicating that it had probably been wet at one time. (I can attest that the phone has never been dunked!) He also said that "stickers" inside the case indicate that the phone was a refurbished one. I had never had it serviced before and as said, I thought I was buying a new phone. When I ordered, there was no indication to say it was not anything but new. Upon notifying the seller that I received a used/refurbished rather than a new phone, I received a canned reply that basically said I had 30 days from purchase to return the phone - a totally unsatisfactory answer. However, for $65 (plus tax) spent on a new battery, the phone now works well. I certainly would not buy from this dishonest provider again. 1
I am having problem with the battery. Within the first 4 days after receiving the item, I have to be charging the battery twice per day. 3
Have problems with the Stock KitKat. Not satisfy at all. 3
I'm very very happy with this phone, there is only one thing I'm not very happy about, and I have to be honest, maybe it isn't the phone's fault, but I can't take good pictures at night (with low or no light), if I turn on the flash the pictures look like they have a white film, its worse than taking them with no flash 4
I thought I loved my iPad! This does everything my iPad does AND I can call and text people on it and it fits in my pocket. 5
I am mostly happy with this phone. I've had it for almost a year and it's OK. I've been fairly careful with it, but finally dropped it on my driveway, with the case that comes with it on it, and the "gorilla glass" screen broke. Then a few days ago I had to do a factory reset on it because it kept freezing up. 3
You gave me the wrong goods.You give me an iphone4 no the iphone4s that i need .And all mobile phone accessories not genuine.I also found that Mobile Charger is bad. 1
I chose the iPhone 4s and I got this iPhone for it is hardly compatible with any service due to its non-Sim card placement reader 3
Hard to figure out with very little instructions 2
janky... not worth it buy the real thing 2
Siri doesn't work but I guess it's fine😒 2
this model software sucks, any other blu phone will let you add games, ive notice they sat the phone are new tere bot rgis phone has mafuntioned alot look for scatches on glass or near battery thats how yoy know its not real and if it acts up to, i know alot about cell ohnes 2
I had the phone about 2 months and the touch screen stopped working. If the screen is unresponsive the phone is useless. Was hoping for a better product. 2
Nice cell phone from Blackberry, very useful to check email, calendar, take pictures and keep all your contacts in one place. 4
The only thing is that: the size of ram and rom memory are too small. 3
So far this phone is working better since o change slots for my sim card. The sound & volume is great! The camera takes alright pictures. 3
The phone works fine when it's not on the charger. Once the charger is plugged in, it starts glitching and closes the app/text I am currently on. 2
Phone looks great does as expected. Sadly the battery is useless. After fully charging it still dies within two hours. Now that should have been stated in the sale listing too. Now off to buy a battery!!! I don't like dishonesty or failure to disclose. especially when it comes to this sort of item. 2
I was a little skeptical at first when buying this phone. It worked well for the first week but then after a while i couldn't make calls or send text messages. I had to keep restarting my phone in order to do so. Eventually I had to start taking out my sim card and battery just to get it to work. I ended up having to buy a new phone since this one only worked half the time. Trying to get service and keep it on this phone is a major headache. Before you decide to go the cheap way out think before you buy this phone or any other phone from BLU. 2
I'm in Guangzhou, China received Iphone4 32GB, overall is very good. Is the screen and border wear more often, it was a very good deal. Using Chinese telecommunications services. 4
This is a great little phone. I understood it to be 'unlocked' - but - when I got it in the mail - it turned out to be an AT&T phone (complete with logo and bloat software).Kudos to Blackberry! I love this phone! 3
How do I give it zero stars. Phone was still under someone else Apple id had to send it back. 1
I like the phone but with in 3 months of use it fail to send out me signal and i had to replace it 3
My apologies - I didn't know that my phone is synced with my hearing aids - and, therefore, "blue tooth" is on all the time. So, that is causing the battery to run down faster than I'm used to. The phone is just fine and the vendor was most cooperative. 4
Works well. No scratches or sign of use. Only a little flaws but they work themselves out. Love this phone more than my android! 4
This BlackBerry works perfectly. I offered it to my nephew as a reward for his outstanding school records. He has been using it for almost a year now and I heard no complaint from him. 4
The description said never been out of the box when I got it there was NO box NO booklet NO charger. besides that I love the phone no scratches no nothing. 3
AWESOME phone! Absolutely love it. Came to me brand new in mint condition. Too expensive, but I had to indulge. 5
A quality phone at an OK price. 4
Not quite what I expected I thought it was a smartwatch it's more like a basic phone which doesn't have any smart capabilities. fun to play with or wouldn't use it as my regular phone call quality is very quiet the headphones that came with it is low quality and very quiet had to search a long time to find the right program to pair with my phone sorry to say I forgot what that program is while writing the review 2
After one month, a chip on the logic board failed which controlled recharging the battery. Not Repairable. Had to purchase a new phone. I could have exchanged the phone with Apple for Ver5, but chose to upgrade to 6S and get a new phone. 1
when I'm making a call I can hear them but they can't hear me 2
It exceeds my expectations! I love it 4
Phone was overall great, no noticeable scratches or anything. Amazing for just being a refurbished phone and an amazing price 4
I took the phone to Verizon store to transfer the info from my old phone to this new one. They couldn't because they said the phone wouldn't respond. Needless to say I had to return the phone and wait 4 weeks for my refund. 1
It's one of the best phone I ever bought 4
sometimes the sound on videos , music & keyboard clicks are just loud static & it won't turn down , not worth more than $100 IF THAT ... 2
This one was not for me but I know it was a good phone and it worked good, so everything is ok with it :) 3
Amazing condition and exactly how it was described. 5
I fine this phone to be very well made, and it's loaded. I had a android phone before my iPhone, if I had to rate the difference I would pick this phone first. This phone is much more sophisticated, but people friendly. 4
Phone died and won't turn on after 92 days (90 day warranty). Very dissapointed! I contacted the seller and hoping they will still honor the warranty although I am 2 days over...I will post and update... 1
I have had a Android for the past 6 years. I can't remember the last Blackberry model I had, but I remember I loved it. If you're looking something for productivity, this is the device for you. I don't play games and I don't care about apps. All I care about are phone calls, text messages, my calendar, and email. This device is better than anything out there for those applications. Call quality is far superior to any android I have owned. It is nice to have buttons to call and hangup. The keyboard is great, I forgot how much I had missed it. Not having to charge the phone during the day is even better. This thing lasts all day with out any problems. I can not say this for any Android device I've owned. Now, for the con's. It has limited app support presently. If you're into apps, this may not be the device for you. If you don't care about apps, this probably is the device for you. So far I love it. The build quality is better than any other phone out there. 4
One of the worst phones I've ever had. I was excited at first to have a new phone that wasn't gonna cost me over 200 dollars. It came in a nice package with new headphones, new charger, screen protectors, and a screen protector on the phone. However as soon as I started to download apps, with my SD card installed, it said there wasn't enough space for everything. I contacted Blu and they helped me with nothing. They solved no issues and gave me an email in which I found passive aggressive. Now this phone is an okay phone if you want to put up with slow functions, constant restarting, storage issues, no way to clear cache, no way to set SD card as primary storage, and no warranty. My daughter has had the phone for about two months now. This is not a one time issue, every Blu phone my family has own has failed to function properly. My family will no longer use Blu products. 2
Fast shipping, and accurate description 5
I love this phone so much thank youYou really deserved that money and thanks for not setting me up. 4
It did not get here when it was supposed to, it was a week late. When it did get here it did not work properly and had to send it back. 1
not too crazy with the Phone and windows....so not as I expected. 2
Had to send it back for another one due to a problem with the LCD.. Hopefully the new one is in better condition. 2
Phone is alright, though it did not come with an SD card which you need if you're going to install a few apps 5
I ordered two phones and one of the phones did not have an external sim port. Now i cannot return the phone which makes me feel sad. 1
Excellent Condition Better Than Expected! 5
I broke my samsung and needed a quick replacement. The phone does more than I expected. The only problem I have is the WiFi /data seems to drop and at any given time and the camera is not great 5/10. While these are the few setbacks I'm still using the phone for the last 3months. Performance of system is excellent. No error or bugs or sudden crashes.If you like taking selfies this is not the phone for you. If you just need to do the perform basic task like talking surfing internet, txtn etc. This is the phone for you. Its a good back up phone. Also has 2sim ports. You will however need a regular size simcard. 3

Only way to unlock is if I swipe up from bottom of lock screen to open up Google. 2.) If I change the wallpaper to anything but the one that was preset out-of-the-box AND swipe-to-unlock is the lock screen setting then the lock screen issue somehow reverts the wallpaper change back to the preset out-of-the-box wallpaper (obviously wallpaper glitches aren't a deal breaker but the lock screen issue itself is) (May be software issue?)-Camera autofocus issue - Camera will be in focus but when I press the button to take the photo the camera re-focuses and blurs. (May be software issue?)-Screen is way too bright even on lowest setting with auto turned off or on.-Screen produces what looks like to me to be a washed out appearance. I'm comparing it to the iPhone 6+, Nexus 5, LG G4, iPhone 5S.-Screen seems sub-par for color reproduction-Wide lip at the bottom of the phone makes holding it awkward (I have small hands, maybe that's why)-Preinstalled screen protector is a fingerprint MAGNET. I'd rather just peel it off.-System sound issue - When typing the keyboard sounds come out sporadically and at different volumes no matter what volume the sound is set to in the settings menu or the keyboard menu. Software issue?-No Lollipop and no definitive answer as to when the upgrade will be available.-Will not read any microSD card I have installed (8-16-32GB, SanDisk-Lexar-Sony-Samsung-LG-et cetera). Tells me "damaged SD card" or doesn't acknowledge it's in there at all. Computers (Apple + Windows) read all the microSD cards I have tried to install into this phone perfectly.-No response from BLU customer service regarding any of these issues/questions. 3
My only issues: battery is not full. Not good starting like this. Plus the one issue I had with my last one exists on this one too. I prefer the larger font. Using the larger font makes the light stay on and it will wear the battery down really fast. Bummer. I don't want to use the small font either. That's why I got the phone to begin with. Glitch. Otherwise phone was brand new, in the package, and I received it timely. 4
My wife now has a telephone that she enjoys using. Thank you 4
Everything works BUT in the first minutes the brightness and display went ultra dim and can only be seen with a flashlight or daylight, beware 4
I usually don't complain if something isn't too bad messed up, but this phone came with a really bad crack in the screen and a slight crack in the bottom. The back is also badly scrapped up! It didn't even come with a charger! 1
Phone worked perfectly with minimal scratches. Very Satisfied. 4
Sometimes the phone will randomly turn off when I am trying to do something, such as video. Other than that, I have had no problems :) 4
Phone did not come with SIM card or Manual for phone 2
No good batey the not good 2
Everything good. However they didn't bring me the tool to open the chip conteiner 4
Tried to activate this so called "Unlocked" phone with Verizon.The phone is still locked by AT&T.My opinion of this seller should be easy guess. 1
Was supposed to be gsm unlocked phone, turns out it was for sprint. So it doesn't work for what i need, eventhough it stated it was for those networks in the description!!!! 1
pristine condition, arrived on time, perfect! Love my new old Iphone 5
I have used the phone for some days.I love it. Two dins as discribed. No other problems. Thanks a lot! 5
Awesome phone. For what you are paying for it is worth it. It exceeded my expectations. 4
Its doesn't have the Samsung or the Apple brand name but don't let that stop you. The screen is fantastic, the speakers are loud and i easily get one and a half days off of a single charge with heavy use. for $250.00 you get a phone that can do almost everything that any other flagship phone can do and in some cases more. (it has SD card slot and NFC). Please note though that it does not use gorilla glass. i got a couple scratches on my screen pretty early on. It could just be from me being careless but i would strongly recommend buying a case. its a pretty thin phone so it shouldn't be a problem 5
I purchased it for a friend of mine in Jamaica. I called him frantically all day trying to reach him . I couldn't until 2 days later he called me to say the was dead and would not turn on. It eventually did. But still has a tendency to freeze. Would not recommend. For $50. Maybe. 2
My husband's Motorola Droid broke so I tried to go cheap and replace it with the iPhone 4. Big Mistake!I love iPhones and have always had one. My husband has always used a Droid so this was my attempt to convert him. I had forgotten how limited the iPhone 4 is since it had been a long time since I had that model.I had to go back online and buy him a refurbished Motorola Droid so that he could use the new technology again. 2
The Phone is beautiful, unfortunately I got a defective unit with dark shadows at the upper end of screen that can be clearly seen when the screen is light,( it is a manufacturer's issue not Deal fisher, their service was excellent and I would buy from them any time).I will be returning the unit for a refund or exchange. 2
Box came a little beaten up but other than that watch was clean worked right out of the box looks brand new 4
very nice thank u so much 5
This was the worse purchase I ever made. I will NEVER EVER buy/use a XOOMTEX iPhone again. My 12 year old daughter saved up her Christmas money to purchase this phone & it worked great for 5 months and then all of a sudden she was unable to receive/make calls or text messages. I called T Mobile to discover it was EPN blocked!! I found out I purchased a phone that was originally purchased under an installment plan (rent to own) & the original owner quit making payments on phone 90 days after I purchased it & the account was in collections. I contacted the seller to return or exchange the now unusable phone and they wouldn't do anything because it was past 90 day warranty. I thought I was getting a new iPhone and basically ended up with an iPod that only works to play games, music and apps on WIFI. Do NOT make the same mistake I did... You will regret it. 1
Ordered this phone when my son broke his other one. Very pleased with the condition of the phone. 5
The phone had scratches as stated, but when I talk to Siri or on the phone it can't hear me , same with videos if someone says anything you can't hear it. And the battery came defected I go from 90 percent to 70 percent in 10 minutes. 2
I ordered a used IPhone 4 from this place and I am very satisfied with it. It barely has any scratches or tears just like the pictures. It came within a week, and when I went to activate it with metro pcs it worked perfctly. I am gad I got my phone from here, if I upgrade Im definitely using this place again. 5
Item had some dents and very visible wear, was not "New" as described in the listing, that is incredible for the price that I pay! i go to return this item! 1
4 months after the Stagefright exploit, and still no update to fix it. That is what stands between making this a 2 and 3 star review.Customer service is really fantastic, however, wouldn't cross-ship a new phone upon RMA issuance, which is what stands between this being a 3 and 4 star review.The Android that ships with it is a bid sharp on the edges, but usable.GPS is a bit slow to lock, and camera in low light absolutely is unusable -- don't even waste your time.Phone is fast, screen is sharp, and 4G LTE is fast.But given the cons, I would probably try another up-and-comier instead of another BLU again. GPS sucking, no night camera, and worst of all, security vulnerabilities not being addressed make this a low-end deal. 2
Great but home button sticks and doesn't work unless pressed forms certain position 4
Phone came in decent condition, however, came with a battery problem. Phone would not charge, so I replaced the battery, which was an unconvienent expense. 2
Using for a digital music device in my car. Great idea and no complaints about the product itself. It works fine. However, the way the seller packaged it (with no wrapping between device and inside of envelope), I had to clean a lot of sticky adhesive from the envelope out of the headphone jack before I could use it. 4
Love my new phone. Great deal and quick delivery. 5
Charger got ruined in 2 weeks 4
I got this phone in May as a backup phone and it runs as you'd expect for $30 price. You need a micro SD, which is nice it has one, but if you take it out and forget, you're screwed. The Play Store is too slow to actually work, I downloaded about 5-10 apps and it stopped working. It will attempt to download apps for 15 minutes and then say it had an error. I'm on a very powerful WiFi network, so this should not be happening. The web browser works, it's very slow, but my main phone is an s7 so it probably would run fast for the targeted audience. The screen is washed out, but I say as long as you can see the screen (which you can) it shouldn't make you buy a different phone. I'm not saying you should get the phone, considering it tried to die on day two from memory errors. It took about 10 minutes until it'd stop giving me warnings and actually let me delete apps.The cameras are okay, but they're better than what I expected for $30. The pictures are way too sharpened and the colors are a bit off. Every pic of the sky has made it a light purple.The texting app is total garbage. Every message comes in individually, just like a flip phone. Pretty sad for an android device.Don't get the phone if you're able to save up a little extra money, for only $80 the Galaxy Core Prime is a much better deal.My video review is here> [...]Overall the phone is slow and confusing, not really a good mixture. 3
I was not impressed. There is no talk-to-text feature, which would be fine except that the keyboard had a hard time recognizing what I was typing. I honestly would recommend buying a different phone. 2
bit more expensive as I bought 64 GB one on a cheaper price but the over all quality of the product is good ... 5
I bought this to replace my galaxy s3 when it started to break, and I am very pleased.It has some qualities of a flagship phone at flip phone price, 4
Love my phone .works with sprint 5
the iphone came with the power/ sleep button bad so i had to paid 6$ to fix it and also the charger came wrong is ther charger of iphone 5s 1
It Worked fine for like two weeks and then it stopped working I had to go to the Apple Store to get a replacement because lucky it had warranty 1
Shipping was supper fast and I love it 5
It's iPhone! So not much to say since it's always the same thing over and over. However, design like it's very attractive. If I could get rid of it I will and return to my 5s.Update 27.9.2016: So I finally got rid of this phone, the size wasn't working for me. It is just too big and feels un-natural for an iPhone​, I'll pass. I went with the 6s instead 3
So far...so good! I was really impressed that it looked brand new! 4
Buen Dia,se recibio en el casillero correspondiente destino de mi actual direccion el paquete de la compra realizada, sin embargo NO SE RECIBIO LA FACTURA COMERCIAL.FAVOR ENVIAR LA FACTURA COMERCIAL A LA DIRECCION DE ENVIO INDICADA EN MI CUENTA 2
the home key is not work!!the home key is not work!!the home key is not work!!how can i do? 3
Touch ID stopped working after few weeks. Fortunately the phone was still under warranty. 2
Lower Speaker stop working two days after I got it 2
I ordered one of this, the iPhone is very good and as it says on description.But the accessories are not original.Also, I paid for the 1day delivered and it came within 3 days. 3
The phone works great and came before the delivery date but.... It didn't come in its original box, it didn't come with a manual which makes me think it was used when I ordered a new phone and the card part to the charger was broke overall I will never buy electronics on amazon again but the phone is okay it works. 3
Its tha one and only truely unlocked phone! Verizon or AT&T you get to choose! Not like all tha other knock off phones. May need Verizon to get internet & apps working but comes in the box ready for either or!!! Great gift for a girlfriend that wants a smart phone but can't afford one. 4
It's in great condition. My daughter loves it! 4
Phone is a great deal for the price. Unfortunately, it does not work with Tmobile. I took it to the store to activate and when they put in the Sim card, the phone does not pick up their network. Also ordered the same phone in black and that didn't work either. Had to return both and got the BLU Dash D171a, which works fine w/ the Tmobile Sim cards. 3
Phone is as good as new. Works great. 5
Its an iPhone 4. Nothing too special about it. I got mine fairly fast for where I live (the middle of a cornfield). Ordered a Verizon phone and got a Verizon phone. There were a few small scratches on the back of the phone but I put a case on right away. The only thing wrong is there is a small spot on the screen that is more whited out than the rest of the screen. Not big and not a big issue. Ive been using it for a few months now. I have finally activated the phone and had no issues. Only reason for 4 stars is the whiter spot on the screen. Great seller. 4
Phone works mostly, description explain 100% working order, not the case volume up button does not work, i had to clean ear piece at which was gunked up, (gross) and it also mentioned minor scratches, again not the truth.. there are gouges around the whole phone and back.. also the charger mount that connects to cord is already loose, so i will eventually jave to get that placed soon... overal for paying over 200.00 dollars for a phone I wished it was in better condition.... 2
The studs on the case come off easily , I don't like the way it snags my clothing 2
camera cracked not stated before hand! 1
It works with almost all SIM cards allowing me to have the same phone and contact information in all countries I visit. 4
The iPhone is simple to use and works great. Plus this model doesn't have the lightning adapter which seems to be more trouble than it's worth (cables cost twice as much, video and audio out are limited compared to the 30 pin, and aftermarket products can be difficult to come by). 5
I bought it like "New" but it is not. It is refurbished and it suddenly stopped working 1
this product gets three stars because it said factory unlocked but it is not. outside of that I had no other problems. 3
I bought this "New" iPhone 5s 4 months ago. It was working great and was delivered on time in its new packaging. I was very satisfied until the touch ID stopped working after a few months, and now the home button rarely works. The phone has been well cared for and has never even been dropped, and when I contacted apple customer service they stated that it needs to be repaired for $270 and that its warranty expired 3 months before I purchased it. The one star is for selling a faulty used product as a new product. 1
Was delivered quickly and works great! 5
The phone works wonderfully. Can't really tell it was used. I used it in the US with a T mobile sim and now in France-- no issues. The price was great, too. Just can't imagine spending more on a phone that could get lost or stolen, and this does everything. 5
Didn't come with an SD card. 1
I love my phone! It is like new and I received It in such a timely manner. 5
I gave it one star because i didnt get the color I wanted I got white and I didnt give it back or return it because I have been waiting for a phone for along time I wasn't about to give my phone back jus because of the color of it but I was made at first but then I got over it 1
Only one disappointment, It did not allow users of the Internet to read articles offline. 3
I love the size and Everything about this phone except the volume. Impossible and poor quality speakers. 3
the buyer is no good. this iPhone camera didn't work and the Touch ID didn't work, I will never buy another phone here. 1
The Cellphone is good in appeareance, but in functionality, there is something that I don't like and it's something when the cellphone locked automatically and shutting down its screnn, then you try to unlocked again its last a lot of minutes to get the screen on again. I think its something of Android for Blu, its strange. 2
The phone itself is great. I am just having a lot of difficulty figuring out what all it can do since the provider book is very tiny and does not have a lot of information in it. 2
APPLE WAS SAID TO BE UNLOCKED BUT WAS NOT. 1
Efficient shipping and product delivered as described in fact I am enjoying it right now :) 5
Its been more then 6 months i am using this mobile . i liked it. Perfect size , for watching video on go and reading books. Awesome sound quality by the way i love JBL sound mixer app Camera quality is really good Battery Life is good and charge pretty fast with its own charger. All in all i like this mobile 5
I loved my first Blu phone, this one cost more and had less features 3
The phone broke after use. The seller has offered to refund, but will not give us an RMA 1
The phones IMEI number was invalid and the phone was completely unable to be used. 1
Great phone. Super screen. Only negative is that it connects to Amazon store and my account so purchases are not controlled if you give it to your kid. 4
The phone came as promised in the original packaging. The AT&T store was able to transfer the information from the old phone easily. Great purchase! 5
Battery life is extremely poor. I may return the phone. Hopefully, the Marshmallow update comes quickly so the Doze feature can be used. 3
Phone works good have a problem with the 'U' but its working good that's probably the only thing that my phone has but if i pressed it hard it works! 4
The only phone from BLU I ever bought that didn't give me any major problems. But it is kind of slow and has poor battery life plus slow to charge. 3
The phone was nice, but the used model sent came with a broken proximity sensor and the home button was a little funky. We returned it and went through Verizon for a brand new phone instead. 3
I bought this phone as pre-owned and gently used about a month ago, and so far have enjoyed using it! Before this I was using the 5s, and in comparison with speed & processing power, this phone is like lightning. I've noticed that photo quality is a bit better-probably because of a higher res screen-as well, but not too different. Also, I accidentally dropped this phone in water (it was fully submerged for a few seconds) and it made a FULL recovery! I dried it out for a day, and at first there were a few hiccups with the screen, but after a few charges, everything's performing just as well as it had before the incident. So apple did deliver with their promise to up their water resistance! My mom had done the same thing I did a few months before with a 5s model and that phone was 100% ruined by water damage.However, this new iOS 10 software (that i had unfortunately no choice but to install) is a complete disappointment! I really enjoyed the iOS 9, and there were a few minor tweaks to that that apple could have done instead to make a more superior iOS version, but I feel the ignored all that and just took it in a completely different direction. They're mostly just small irritations (like how swiping to unlock is no longer a thing), however. 4
It is not straight talk compatible and it will be at 27% and shut off and say you need to charge it 1
Got my phone on the day it said that it would arrive. Came in refurbished phone box, with a charger. Looks brand new, and so far works perfectly. Only critique I would make is that it came without Any bubble wrap or outer protection. For something made out of glass I expected it to be more safety wrapped.-also, for the comments saying you need. SIM card, you need that for any iPhone. 4
Phone had alot of wear and tear 3
The phone is new. Everything is included in the package. However, the ICCID of the SIM was identified by AT&T as permanently disabled. So instead of being able to activate it online, I'm going to have to the nearest AT&T store an hour away.5 stars for the phone itself. 3 starts for the BS SIM card. 3
How should we unlock this phone?? 4
it wasnt unlocked like it said it was 1
This phone died fast everyday 2
The thing that saved it was the company at least sent instructions on how to fix the screen. Stinks because it was a gift :( 2
Phone did not work: home button did not work at all and phone turned off randomly even when fully charged. Since it was "Certified Refurbished," I find that unacceptable. Buy at your own risk. Also beware, the positive reviews seem fake. I would normally rebuy a defective product but given my experience I'm going to go another route when buying a new phone. 1
Its a great phone, for calling, texting, pictures and use a few apps. Now, the screen size is a plus, very clear but some times get unresponsive, the speakers for talking are great but to listen music not that great. And the reason I give a 3 stars is the battery, very poor performance, the meter tells you: you have one day of power and in reality last around 3+ hours. for me its a great phone but the battery bad performance over lap the other great features of the phone. If you are into internet, videos, games and music I wont recommend it for the lack of power in battery, if only use for calling, texting, taking pictures in other words, just the basic. then its ok for you. 3
Positive:- Good condition, no scratches! Is like a new in outside.- No software and speed problems, like a new too.- Working great on Brazilian network, I believe is really worldwide.Negative:- The battery is not 100%, I believe that battery is long 20-30% less than original.Neutral:- Don't came with the earphone and the original box, but is fine to a refurbished one. 4
Will not sync with my Samsung phone like the advertisement said it would 2
The phone I got is not unlocked. My SIM card is not accepted, although it works in other cellphones. 1
It's a fair phone... not so good. I haven't could to update to kit kat 3
NICE PHONE. BRAND NEW. NOT W/VERIZON. THEY WOULD NOT UNLOCK THE PHONE FOR T-MOBILE. SENT BACK. 4
This phone turned out to be too large for my liking, you need two hands to operate every time. Also had some issues with it loosing network connection frequently and randomly rebooting, I'd still give it 3 stars for the value and features you get for your money. 3
This phone was purchase to go to Jamaica to use with another network, I must say that it works perfect.it never give a problem all I have to do is put in your sim card and you are ready to go. 3
This does NOT work on Verizon!!!! Very disappointed and sent back immediately after taking to the Verizon store and being told it couldn't be activated. 1
The description said never been out of the box when I got it there was NO box NO booklet NO charger. besides that I love the phone no scratches no nothing. 3
Bought this phone mainly just to take with me to college and not be afraid that someone would steal it. Because who would want to steal a 4s😂 but anyway, my seller said top button was "glitchy" ...I expected it to work but with a little difficulty. The only way to use the top button is to press it on a hard surface like a wall. For now I'm using the accessibility mode to turn the screen off. Also the phone was really grimy when I received it. Dust in the speaker and microphone and the charger port. It could have easily been cleaned before shipped. I attempted to update to iOS 8.2 and I thought I broke it the phone, it was stuck on "connect to iTunes screen" but I reinstalled iTunes on my computer and set the phone to recovery mode, tried to download 8.2 again and it worked☺️👍 overall satisfied with my purchase. 4
Its an Iphone 4 and it was in very good condition, well packaged and delivered on time but I ordered an unlocked phone and the one I got was not unlocked. It cost me $100.00 more before I could actually use the phone. 3
Great, inexpensive, alternative to the more expensive smartphones. I paid around $40 for this and I think it was a fantastic deal. For the price, this smartphone is great. For me, there are 2 downsides: 1) video quality & 2) the back cover. The video quality (and even zooming in on pictures) is definately less than par. Video is dark, slightly distorted and pic quality (zoomed in) becomes blurry. The other, the back cover, comes off the phone so easy. If you drop the phone, chances are the cover will come off. I actually dropped my phone, the back cover came off, and upon impact my battery fell out and broke. Otherwise, a great phone. And, for the price, you can't beat it. 4
Phone died and won't turn on after 92 days (90 day warranty). Very dissapointed! I contacted the seller and hoping they will still honor the warranty although I am 2 days over...I will post and update... 1
It is not unlocked, i love my virgin mobile iphone and it took a dive the last week so i got this as a replacement because in the details it said it was both gms and cdmc compatible. It is locked into verizon and i now have to spend more money on a prepaid contract that doesnt even work for me which is a big strain on my budget. Cant afford to return and can't wait for a new phone, very dissapointed. 1
The battery seem to be generic and doesn't fit well in the slot and the phone turns off often 3
happy with the phone though i had to put a new battery in it.. 4
Good afternoon amazon, the iphone was received in good physical conditions but with some marks, however the phone is desactivated and the screen indicates to conect it to a pc by using itunes, I tried to activate it through iTunes without success. The iphone is inoperative. Plase i hope you can help me so i can use the article i bought. 1
This Blackberry was not exactly what I expected. It is what seems like a "cheaper" blackberry. It had a few things that were VERY inconvenient and hard to change. 4
Phone works fine, just the time and date keeps resetting on it's own when I go to recharge or turn it off and on. 2
Due to a number of factors I decided to downgrade from an iPhone 5 to an iPhone 4 - wish I wouldn't have done that. The service, delivery and price was good but the phone was certainly a step down. 3
Phone had alot of wear and tear 3
Not easy to use - do wish it came with more instructions 3
we like the price like the product,,,,, it doesn't had any scratch,,,,,like the gigabites,,,the color and special because it was in good condition 5
Bought this to use with my Iphone 6 Plus and am sad to say nothing works except playing bluetooth music and making/receiving alls ... was expecting the text messaging function to work so I could atleast read it on my hand instead of grabbing my phone ... nope it says install BT notifier when you goto messaging ! This one is going back to be returned. If it was for an android phone ,I think this would be better fit, but for iOS phones ... just know nothing works except calls and playing bluetooth music through a mono speaker which sounds horrible 2
Phone looks goodShipping was fast 4
Just having a bit of battery issues 4
A decent phone, no problems with it. The only thing was that I had a micro sim card and needed to buy an adapter for it to fit correctly. I used the "Rinogear sim card adapter" easily found here on amazon (and for cheap) it worked perfectly. 4
I bought this phone as being unlocked. It wasn't. I called at&t and they registered my simms card and went to turn it on. Nothing! Why? It needs a simms card with unlocked pin? At&T didn't know what I was talking about? Nice phone to look at. So I'm going to try to take it to the corporate At&t store and then probably to Apple Store. I will give a better review after I drive a hour to these stores. Check out my new review. Didn't have to drive. grreat Phone! clear reception and voice. No problems. Yes I woould recommend this seller 100% 5
 I am so happy that I got this phone because it carries a lot of cool phone features that i really like. It has 5.5 inches display size which i think is a perfect phone size...It is a half inch bigger than my other phone but yet the weight is just the same and i find it quit good because i still can carry it where ever i go and with the bigger screen size i can totally see every thing clear...I like that it is unlocked and has dual sim card and a memory card slots you can use a regular sim size and a micro sim card i find it very nice because if you go to other country you can just bring this phone and use it right away you just need to get a GSM sim card if your here in the US GSM sim card includes t-mobile, AT&T, cricket, straight talk and sprint how cool is that...This phone's support network's 2G and 3G it does not support 4G which is alright with me...This phone has four available color to choose from there is black, gold, pink and white for you to have. It is up to you what color do you like to get. Plus this phone has a built in wifi, blue tooth, tethering and portable hot spots so no need for us to worry on how to connect to the internet if we are on the go..I was amazed with this phone it does exceeds my expectation especially when i tried using the camera it really amazes me how clear and how nice the pictures are plus the volume of this phone is very good I cannot ask for more I am very happy and so glad that i ordered and got this phone for myself...For under a hundred dollar price this phone is a very good bargain for you guys..So far so good, for now i do not have any complains about this product I will totally recommend this product to my friends and family because this phone is real nice...I received this product for free in exchange of my honest and unbiased review. I am not affiliated with this company and having this phone for free did not change or affect my thoughts about this product. 5
I waited a month before writing a review.I love this phone! I have my data/minutes thru Net10 and I had no problems switching from my LG phone to this. I use this for everything! As my kindle, social media, shopping, Netflix, camera, everything but as a phone.I hate talking on the phone but when I do this is fine. The only thing that keeps me from giving this 5 stars is sometimes when I'm texting or commenting on FB it posts before I finish. Honesty it's s terrific phone with tons of coolness for less than $100.****August 8, 2016*****Well, I loved this phone up until a week ago. I had problems turning/keeping it on and now its dead. I think $100+ is a lot for a phone to only last a year. It refused to charge, not the battery, it was the charging port. It broke my heart cause I really loved this phone. Im using the $50 phone I bought with a Net10 package several years ago. No problems with that little LG phone.Im doubtful I'll buy Blu again. 2
My husband's Motorola Droid broke so I tried to go cheap and replace it with the iPhone 4. Big Mistake!I love iPhones and have always had one. My husband has always used a Droid so this was my attempt to convert him. I had forgotten how limited the iPhone 4 is since it had been a long time since I had that model.I had to go back online and buy him a refurbished Motorola Droid so that he could use the new technology again. 2
hello ! only 1 phone works well! the other was a gift for my son, who wait almost two years for it. The phone is damaged ! restarts , fails, and I sent it to fix 2 times !did not meet my expectations, thank you very much , I hope others do successful purchases ! and hopefully I can fix it so my son can enjoy 2
quick shipment, product was as described and worked well. 4
I purchased this phone in May. By August, the battery was shot and could not hold a charge. The seller would not help me because it has been over 60 days. So now I'm stuck with this phone that constantly has to be plugged in. I might as well have a landline. 1
The phone works great I have sprint service and I got my old SIM card out my iPhone 4s cuz it broke and put it in to this and it works i am really impressed 4
The phone was in the condition as advertised which was "fair". I felt that the scratches on the case made the condition fair. but the phone was very dirty. but once cleaned up it was good to go. there were no scratches on the screen 3
To the cellphone i can give 5 stars. It is great and works really good. The problem was the battery the send me a battery that wasnt working good. And they send me another one and it also was damaged. Im still waiting for another one and they took more than 3 weeks to solve a problem of a battery!!..the cellphone is good but the service of the company completely bad 3
I Love My Phone Works Perfectly Not One Problem. 5
My son is happy with his gift for college 5
First and foremost the phone was a beauty. it was new and in excellent condition. unfortunately it was an unlocked verizon phone. For future please inform people exactly which carrier the phone is for because unfortunately i did not see that it was for verizon and not att or tmobile... it doesnt work in this country. 2
Though the product is good but the battery worked pathetic. I had to charge the phone three times a day. If a phone is factory refurbished, then don't they check the battery quality? Anyway, I returned the product in a week. 1
The screen is coming out of the phone & it had water damage when I got it.. it did not say this when I purchased it!! Not very pleased! 1
i ordered a BLUE iphone 5c and got a green one like wow but its ok still a phone yeah 4
Love it great phone and it was shipped on time and the phone is in great condition as promised. Never liked iPhones but now I love them. Very happy with purchase! 5
Speaker sound from phone when making a call is not good 2
Phone is a bit more quirky than I'd hoped, touchscreen seems to lose letters and motions here and there, but I think that's just iOS8 being weird, hopefully it'll get better with the next update. 4
The phone has been great 5
Thank goodness the phone worked. However the earphones were not the original apple earphones; they looked very cheap and you can tell they aren't from apple. 2
Perfect condition. looks brand new and works great. 5
Very good phone but when I got the case I had the phone in my pocket while riding my bike it came out fell to the ground and broke the screen 4
I love my new iphone, i arrived on time, nw i got all my apps onit. I can reach family and friend near or far 5
Junk!!!Worked perfectly for just over a month. Went to a customers place where they usually call me. I was informed that I she had called me many times and got my voice mail. Phone turned off and I had to do a hard reset several times and it started and seemed to work perfectly but as I stood in the customers living room I had her call me. Phone never rang and went straight to voice mail but I never got a voice mail. Called T-Mobile and they said check my blocked list -not there. Somehow some the numbers got changed in directory including this person. Corrected number called her then she could call me. After that phone died again. Did hard reset and got it going again.Enough of that nonsense. Put SIM card back in old Iphone 4 and lo and behold up came all the voice messages from the person in question - seven of them. I didn't lose a customer but came very close. Now this phone works (after another hard reset) for everything a SIM card isn't needed for like computer, Siri. Everything except what you use a regular phone for. This is another example of "The sweetness of a cheap deal is long forgotten in the bitterness of a bad deal". 1
Good novelty item, not very good at being a phone... or a watch... 2
The cell works well, however for some reason the charging is a problem. I have to charge while cell is off and it doesn't always work. I have to turn cell off and on several times before it will actually charge. I don't recommend this cell, their are so many more better cells than this one. Keep shopping. 2
What can I say about the iPhone 5? My wife attempted upgrade from 4 with this Amazon seller and we received a defective phone. Be VERY careful with "refurbished", or "loose" (not in box and sealed) phones.Beware THIS seller in particular: "Quag's Buy, Sell, Trade." 5
The battery is very uncertain times, is very unreliable 2
First one failed after two weeks (external speaker). Replacement seems okay. Like it.. .use it for just about everything I used my nexus 7 for but has two sim slots for calling in the states and the carribean. Not the fastest out there but meets my needs. 3
My phone was damaged upon arrival! I turned it on and it lagged out and just stays on the apple logo on start up! I am beyond furious saved up for this phone and bit me in the a**, 600 down the drain, Apple trying to charge me 300 for replacement. Ridiculous, would of gotten a free one from Apple but this one lost warranty since last year, and to top it off it wasn't even unlocked it was with Verizon! 1
The phone is exactly as described although the battery life of the phone is not great. I suggest the company replace the battery before selling it or get a better battery carrier (if they already replace the battery before selling) all in all I'm very pleased with my purchase. 4
I am a first time iphone user. The phone is great, I see why they are so popular. I am concerned about battery life though. It seems to get low with moderate use in just a half day. I don't know if this is normal or my "new" battery is weak.. 3
Bought two of these one in November and the other in December. Both of them are acting up ie the screen freezes or blanks out periodically. The slot for the headphones is not working. Would not buy a BLU again. Going back to Samsung! 2
Phone was in excellent physical condition 4
First Apple product and I love it! 4
____I have owned every iPhone since the 3G model. Every year for 7 years I have upgraded. In my household is a slew of Apple products from iPad’s, MacBook’s to iPhones. My household now has 3 new iPhone 7 models. But I am also a bigtime Android owner with several high end Android phones and tablets from various manufactures. The thing is, my family loves high end tech and appreciates quality regardless of brand, make or model.I follow the mobile tech world religiously and stay abreast of all new technologies and products from all companies, big and small. I watched the Keynote on September 7th live and listened to Apple pitch the iPhone 7. I pre-ordered the 7 at 3am EST on the 9th so I could have it in my hands on the 16th.But then I came to a realization about the 7 and 7 Plus that struck a chord with me. All the new tech on the 7 is not new at all, in fact has been on several phones in some cases since 2011. I also realized that the tech inside the 7 only matches mid-range android versions. If you take the Apple logo off the back and re-brand this under Android, it would not be a $770-$970 device but a $350-$550 device given the hardware and features it has. In fact, Apples net cost on the 256GB 7 Plus is only $226 yet retails for $970. This is disturbing to me, not just the 403% profit margin, but the whole effort into making an average iPhone for today’s standards. Apple use to be a leading-edge company with innovations that took the industry by storm. Today, in 2016, Apple no longer excites me. Sure the integration between software and hardware is not matched by any tech company today but the gap is rapidly bridging. At such a premium price, I think after this version, considering there is nothing innovative about it and retails for double what other companies offer, has me moving away from Apple in 2017. I don’t know about you, but the old saying goes the bigger you are the harder you fall. Bye bye Apple, time for a divorce.___Update 9/22/2016: In response to criticism about my review:Apple certainly raised the bar on smartphones and has kept that bar up. My expectations are high for the iPhone and as such when they are not met, as with the iPhone 7/7 Plus, my letdown is all that much harder. The IPhone 7/7 Plus are great phones do doubt, but do I think they are $970 great? Certainly not. Apple (could have) done so much better with the iPhone 7 and didn't. That is my letdown.When it comes to raw processing power Apple wins in controlled and application tests. But in 2016/17 nearly all phones are fast enough, heck even the iPhone 5s of 4 years ago is fast enough, but today, shaving milliseconds off app switching times or load times goes beyond the human brains capacity to keep up. It's not about pure brawns, ecosystems, cultures, or social image, it's about value and making life's tasks easier.Apples multi-million dollar 12 step polishing process to get the Jet black phone to shine is not nearly as important as making it available at affordable prices and offering cutting edge features that make my whole reason for existing plausible.If I walked into my Honda dealer and saw the new 2017 Accord had a price tag of $110,000 I would walk out immediately, it's about value. Even if the Accord blew the doors off its competition I still walk because its value is lost.Truth of the matter is even India's $4 phone gets the job done, and that's a fact.Lets examine the iPhone 7/7 Plus components.CPU:The A10 Fusion chip in the Apple 7’s is manufactured by TSMC, (Samsung made the A9 chips in the 6s). It is a quad-core 16nm big.LITTLE soC running at 2.34GHz tops, 1.3GHz nominal with 3GB of LPDDR4 RAM, (2GB on the 4.7- inch version). Similar chips and even more powerful quad-core, hexi-core and even octa-core chips run in various far less expensive phones using 4GB to 6GB of LPDDR4 RAM running in dual channel mode. The one thing Apple does do extremely well is manage its RAM which is all software based. The Linux driven Android software has not got there yet. Yes, this is an advantage Apple currently holds over the competition but one that is vastly slipping away.LCD:The LCD panel is also on level with submarket phones. The LPIPS 1080 panel is rated at 401P, 1300:1 contrast, (1400:1 on the 4.7 inch), 625nits and P3 Cinematic color gamut at 125%. Let’s examine this. With the exception of the P3 color gamut, every $200 and above phone has this or better. I can list a slew of phones all under $300 that have LPIPS, (or even better OLED), 1080 FHD, 1500:1 to infinite contrast ratio, 500-700nits and sRGB color gamut at 100%. The Neo-LPIPS panel supplied on Huawei products is nearly as excellent as the S-AMOLEDS produced by Samsung and supplied on phones starting at $150. Apple has been in talks with Samsung about supplying s-AMOLED panels for the iPhone for 3 years, I believe the iPhone 8 will receive this panel next year. The cinematic P3 rating and higher brightness output (nit) was given to the iPhone 7’s to help make the photos pop on-screen better.CAMERA:The Bokeh effects of the dual camera system on the 7 Plus can easily be duplicated in Post with software. I won’t argue and say the camera implementation on the iPhone 7’s is not excellent, sure it is. But the Leica dual camera system on the P9 and Honor 8 are just as good and offered on devices that match or surpass other technical features and cost half as much. The camera system on the S7 is excellent too. LG has excellent implementations on the older G4, G5 and new V20. The LG G4 that can be had for $150, has a 2.1GHz hexi-core CPU, 3GB RAM, 5.5-ich QHD screen, 32GB on board memory, 128GB SD slot, and a 16MP camera that shoots in RAW and even by today’s standards is excellent shooter.SOFTWARE:With iOS 10 we can now delete stock Apple apps. This is Apples way of saying they understand their app versions suck and no one uses them or want them. We can replace them with much better 3rd party versions that also happen to have equally good Android versions. In the 30 days iOS 10 has been on the iPhone 7, (9/16 to 10/12), it has had two major updates, v10.0.1 and v10.0.2. Let’s not forget the epic failure of the lightening headphones, Gallery App and extensions crashing. This is a bug fix every two weeks. Also in the 30 days I have owned my iPhone 7 I have had to perform two hard resets for Apple Apps locking and seizing up, one was Safari the other iMessages. At one point I had to get Apple support on the phone. In 2016/2017 Android v7.01 (and 6.0.1) are just as stable and efficient and maybe even more so, but my point is there is no advantage one over the other, at this stage it is simply a matter of personal preferences. We can’t argue that iOS is superior to Android because surely is not. With almost all apps being cross-platform functional communications between iOS and Android is now transparent and we can fully immerse in both worlds without any effects.SAMSUNG:I have given the same review about Samsung products. Samsung is by no means the Messiah of Android. Their products are matched or outdone with less expensive variants as well. Samsung will have a very difficult time recovering from their $1B fiasco this year. When a company starts selling of its stock interest and shares on partner companies and liquidating core assets you know they are in trouble.STORAGE:The reason Apple does not offer external SD storage is twofold. One, the SD license is held by Microsoft and Apple would have to pay royalties to Microsoft in order to use it. Apple will never pay royalties to any company – royalties are paid to Apple not the other way around. Two, Apple would lose control over file sharing.APPLE TRIVIA - DID YOU KNOW:Did you know the iPhone has many Samsung components? Samsung has made the CPU/GPU for several generations of iPhones. This year with the 7 Samsung supplies the RAM chips and ROM chips. Samsung is rumored to supply its s-AMOLED screens next year for the iPhone 8.Did you know Google pays Apple $100 million/year to have Google set as the default search for Safari? Google also pays Apple a percentage for every click too.Did you know Google invests more money and R&D for its iOS apps over its own Android counterparts? Apps like Hangouts, Google Maps, Chrome, Google Now etc., get updates and new releases before its own native Android versions.Did you know that Amazon hosts the iCloud storage for Apple? Amazon is the largest cloud host in the world providing several companies with its AWS servers. Apple pays Amazon hundreds of millions of dollars every year for its cloud servers.Did you know Apple refused to pay Corning its royalties to use the Gorilla Glass name so calls its glass ‘Ionized strengthened’ even though it is Corning Gorilla glass version 4.Did you know the iPhone 6/6s also has water resistant features? Apple never published or made public this feature for liability reasons but the 6/6s has resins and glues inside to protect vital components from water damage. If you have ever dropped your 6/6s in water usually within a couple hours its up and running at 100%.___Thank you for reading___ 2
So far so good, it only arrived today as a replacement for my (very) dead Galaxy S4 mini. It took a bit longer than I'd normally expect from Amazon - the very last day of the 'delivered between' note, but still in the time they had advertised.It's a very basic smartphone with all that you need, response time can be a little slow but for what it costs; it's much better than I thought it would be. The camera's are both quite pixelated and don't expect to take any art worthy shots, but they do the job!Still working out the bits and pieces that go with a new phone, but I'm very happy with what it is for the price.Just do note - it takes a regular sized SIM card so if you currently have a micro SIM or anything you'll have to get an adapter (or construct one like I did)Pretty solid seeming little phone and should do the job :) 4
This product only worked for Verizon company's so it is not a unlock phone. 1
Well I do not live in the US so some feature will not be available for me but this item works perfectly the only thing is the activation required is on the screen which my service provider name suppose to be, all features that are available by my service provider I can access but this phone is a good item no problems and no confusions. 4
I bought this phone from Amazon twice. The first ones screen cracked when I put a case on it and I was able to return that one. The one that I replaced it with worked for 3 months and then just stopped working completely. I set it on my counter and when I came back an hour later it had turned off and wasn't working or charging. Now it is outside of the return policy and I am stuck with a phone that doesn't work. Complete waste of money and time. 1
The bluetooth doesn't work since I bought it, bad, bad, bad 1
The phone works very well, especially for the price. 5
Volume down button broken.. Not happy. 1
Just what we needed for our daughter 5
Interestingly, the phone actually came with a Verizon simcard though it claims it will not work with Verizon. My from the big apple is model A1532 which is prossibly an verizon unlocked version. I tested it with my H2O prepaid card and it works well though. Hope this help. 4
the one i bought has problem after i updated IOS. lucky it is under warranty, so apple gave me a new one. 3
Sim card holder broke within one month of having. Returned for another phone. But it was a great return process 2
Phone was what I expected. It came with ios 6.1.3 and battery life was kind of short. After updating to 7.1.2 battery life has improved by at least 50%. 5
Works great very good phone. Thank ypu 5
The phone was okay. But the charger was broken and it didn't work so I had to buy a new original one 3
does what I need it to do - learning more each day 5
I'm sure Mango is a great organization but this phone was a complete waste of my time & funds. Nothing works as it should, so not useable. Very frustrating not having a phone that works for this price! 1
TLF overheats and turns off instantly 2
i did not receive a battery with my phone was disappointed because i had to purchase one to use the blackberry 3
This was under the unlocked phone category and when I received it the phone was locked and virtually worthless for my trip to Europe. Very unhappy. 1
I was very nervous about ordering this phone USED and ONLINE. Unseen. But I received it, and it is in great condition. Came with an old case, but I had already ordered an otterbox, so I replaced it quickly. I also downloaded the new IOS. So happy with this phone. Happy with the delivery. I've had an iphone before, so it feels good to be back. 5
Phone was OK more impressed by the customer service 2
Extremely disappointed that this was received the first part of September and the screen is literally falling out of the phone. I've never seen anything like it before. My son saved his hard earned money to buy this product and not even 3 months later it is junk. Hope to find someone that can help us to get it fixed. :(Just took the phone to get fixed today and found out the phone is total junk! The battery is swollen and ready to explode. The parts inside were broke and some screws were missing. I watched the man open the phone and was in total shock! I can't believe we were scammed so badly. This was NOT a new phone! 1
The 3 gs has slightly less resolution than the I4 but It is so clear I don't think you would notice the difference. The only other difference between the 2 is that the I4 has 2 camera,front and rear for video chatting. The I4 gs is the same as the I4 except Siri was added. IF you don't need your phone to talk to you and you don't need video chatting then the 3gs does everything else. It came with the latest upgrade of the IOS operating system and the screen was scratch free. While I don't understand it completely apparently there is a big difference between factory Unlocked and Jailbroken. It is my understanding that when jailbroken any upgrade re-locks the phone. Can't say enough good about the seller. As advertised and delivered on time at a very low price for what I got = a great value. When its time to upgrade I will return here to purchase. 5
is ok , es very cheap 3
My husband hates it. You can't change the ring tone, and the volume is too low for him to hear if he's not in a quiet room. It works fine, it's just not very good for someone with hearing issues. 3
my daughter likes it works well she says and it has the storage space she needs 4
I e tryed different plans doesn't work waisted like 300 bucks on it 1
My company standard for wireless communications is Blacberry, so, after I lost my old 8310, I decided to get the Gemini: good looking, newer OS, trackpad instead of the trackball.To this date, I'm very happy with the phone, I realize that there are very few functions this blackberry hasn't that are being offered on the most expensive and advanced models. Nevertheless, my use of the phone is very demanding (as well as our corporate standards) and it is usual to have to wait for the phone to stop showing th clock to start using it, which is the main reason to not rate it as a 5 star product. 4
Thanks J&R. Good service, phone works, my son has no problem with it. 4
The only think I don't like you send me the Cheapest usb cord n no earpod other than that everything look good n perfect 4
The information for this item said it was BSM unlocked and would work with Tmobile.It did NOT! So I asked for and was able to get a full refund. 2
I have another two (2) models of BLU, BLU 6.0 HD and Studio 5.0C HD, they are excellent, thinking of the same build from BLU I tried this one, only ended up with surprise. With new 5.0 Lollipop and bigger storage, seems a plus, the touchscreen is slow responding or NOT responding, the battery life is lasting about only 6-7 hours with fair uses. Sent it back once, got a replacement (thanks to Amazon, honestly) but came to the same result. I do not against BLU at all since we are still using other BLU phones, but pass this one if you can spend extra $50 for another BLU model.Edits: the camera is definitely the worst from all my BLUs, slow or blurry focus at times, and failed a lot. I say it because I have another 2 BLUs to compare and I take photos all the time - 5+5 will disappoint you. Also this phone is missing a magnetic sensor for any Compass app, it won't run and gives you "can not access magnetic field data" error. Not sure? Install one it will tell you. 2
The phone is fine if you only use it as a phone. It does have bluetooth, but it's under the notes menu (I think).If you plan to text, you have a maximum of about 25 messages before the memory is full. Getting more text messages just get dropped. In any case it was useless for us since we needed a phone with texting capabilities beyond a few messages. 2
It had some scratches not sure it was used or refurbished pretty sure it was a used model. But still good iphone :D 4
8 gb not enough. Should have gone with a 16gb. 4
Have it return the phone because Verizon' Fraud Department says the SIM card is no good. Not a Verizon phone. 1
this cellphone scren is locked ,needed to enter pin , I don‘t know why ,anyonecan gime a advice? 1
Iv'e had the phone for around a week now and just love it. From the form factor to the amazing front firing speakers to the intuitive stock android lollipop interface. I am using it on cricket wireless and everything just worked right away once i popped my sim card in. Wifi and LTE reception are on par or possibly superior to the LG G2 i replaced. Battery life on standby isnt quite as good as my G2, but while actually using the phone (watching videos especially) it mops the floor of the G2 in terms on on screen time. This is due to the lower res (but still very nice) screen and lower power snapdragon 410 CPU. Dont let the lower power fool you, ive yet to run into any scenario the phone hasnt performed just as well as my G2, which on paper is twice as fast. Just a heads up to buyers of the 5.5" model (too big for my tastes, but seems to be the preferred size nowadays) is that it is coming to cricket wireless nov 6th for 149.00 bucks, 100 bucks off retail. Mind you it wont be unlocked, this would just be for people using cricket, and as a cricket customer i have only good things to say about them (they use ATT towers, they are the best MNVO by miles).The only con i can come up with on the phone is that it does not beep at you when fully charged, but the LED light goes off after its been at 100% for a couple minutes. I remedied this with an app called Gsam for the app store, now my phone beeps when it hits 100% :)In my opinion this blows away the competition (looking at you moto g) for the money, 16gb storage and 1.5gb memory really put it head and shoulders above other phones in this price range. Not to mention the better screen, absurdly loud speakers and overall dainty form factor (for a phone in 2015).Trust me, you will not regret this purchase, especially if you are looking for a phone under the "norm" 5"+ form factor. 5
It is an excellent phono with low cost! 5
Very good phone! I used to have an older version of the Curve, then went to an Iphone 4, and am now back to a BB. The Iphone was not for me because it was on AT&T and the AT&T service at my house is terrible. The BB is great because if you don't have a data plan (which I chose not to have) you can still have WIFI. Iphone will not work without a data plan. I did try to have my Iphone unlocked so I could use it with T-Mobile but was unsuccessful. The features on the BB are very good though, so I'm not missing having an Iphone. The one thing about ordering this BB is that all the directions are in Spanish - no English. But it's easy to download directions for the phone from BB's website. Overall, if you want an easy to use, reliable phone, I highly recommend this one. 4
Love the phone but wasn't expecting all the pop ups so soon 3
I was in desperate need of a new phone and this iPhone/seller was one of the best and highly rated ones I could find. I got my order right on time and the phone was perfect. Brand new just like the description said! I couldn't be happier right now. I will definitely be recommending this seller and product if anyone is looking for a new phone:) 5
I ordered an unlocked phone for my son for christmas but unfortunately he cannot use it as it is blocked. We are both very disappointed and unsatisfied. I ordered several times from Amazon and never had any problems. And suddenly my two last orders were a disaster. 1
I went from a Samsung Galaxy Note (the first one, and it was almost 3 years old) to this phone. This phone felt heavier and the photos were very disappointing. Besides that, it did the job okay. After about 6 months, I gave in and bought another Samsung (Grand Prime) and am much happier. 3
i am sorry but i think i was dupe by the information posted on this phone. if i had known i would have second thoughrs, mind you the iphone is a extremely good phone needless to say i have an iphone 4 and a 3 and i never had any problems. this phone is constantly freezing, have to shut down and restart, constantly have to do factory restore to little avail. 2
I was so hesitiant to buy an iphon after reading all the reviews but i made the leap and did it anyway. and i am beyond satisfied. this phone is perfect. best buy i have made 5
Terrible! It is a Sprint phone and they couldn't turn it on. I tried to return it but never heard back from the seller. Then I tried to unlock it and have T-Mobile turn it on. They couldn't do it either. This was a waste of my money!!!! 1
It's nice looks brand new 5
Great product I love this phone works with straight talk;) 5
This phone did not hold a charge and when I did charge it, it was very hot to the touch and I could not hold it to my ear. I have returned it and waiting for a refund. 1
It is not like new , lier !!! There is a big huge scrach on the button !Lier lier lier! 1
Excellent exactly as described thanks 5
This was a gift for my granddaughter. The phone continued overheating. she took it to a sprint dealer who was kind enough to replace it since she had insurance on it. It is now working very well. 3
Bought this in may sim tray dead after a month boooooooo 1
Phone came quickly and was basically new. There was small scratch on the back but I quickly bought a case to prevent future damages. I just popped in my SIM card and the phone was ready to go! I did have to change the default language from Spanish to English but other than that it was a breeze! 5
DearI have problems with the purchased equipmentwith 100% charged battery does not last or 3 hours of useand sometimes indicates a full battery charge being dischargedas we do to fix it?regards 2
 This phone is pretty neat. For the price, it’s impressive – especially because it is unlocked and can be used with any carrier that has a large SIM card. This phone does not support 4G LTE internet, but does support 3G. This only means that the internet is a tad slower than some other phones that support 4G. It operates much like other android/google phones that I have come into contact with. It features a quad core processor, 1GB RAM, a 2.0 megapixel front camera and 5.0 megapixel back camera. It also includes dual flash, one on the front and one on the back which is pretty impressive. Wifi is enabled and it can be run off the wifi at home if there is no SIM card currently available. The back of the phone is very flexible but thin so be careful taking the back off – there is a small piece of tape over the battery connector to make sure the battery is charged before use. There are currently no cases available for the phone so be careful when handling it, overall, I’m very happy with the phone. It does everything that I need it to do and is an affordable alternative to shopping at the store (where its more expensive). It supports many apps, its a mobile hotspot, Youtube, Facebook, emails, messaging, Bluetooth, music, and more!Pros:• Affordability• Functionality (Wifi + Data)• Can be used on most carriers• Huge screen• Front and back flash• Quad core processor• Comes with a screen protector and clear case• Large font optionsCons:• Lack of cases and accessories for the phone• Camera quality could be improved• Support for 4G would be nice• Very slight sound distortion when using speakers all the way up for musicI would definitely repurchase this, it is perfect for my mother who uses her phone at work and to message on Facebook.I received this item for free in exchange for an honest, unbiased, and authentic review. I have thoroughly tested any product I review - I take pride in informing potential customers about the perks and flaws of products. I have no affiliation with the seller and am not obligated to leave a positive review. 4
Good for my elderly mother, other than the fact that you can't control the volume or really change the ringtone for something more pleasant than a few obnoxious options. Okay for the price, but I have a feeling I'll be replacing this for her in a couple of months and just showing her how to use a smartphone. 3
Everything was fine until after 3 months when it started to glitch then froze 3
I tried to activate it on ATT. They no longer support 2G phones on their network. It's going back. 3
This is My first BlackBerry, so I dont have a lot of references about this phone.Untill now has worked perfectly, is smaller than previous BB so is pretty easy handle it.For this price is an excellent investment. 4
Didn't even come on. It doesn't work. 2
It Is not unlock n bettery is not good at all!! 3
I bought mine from SUNSET PHONES, & I'm 110% satisfied! Super happy with it! I paid for it to get here faster & it got here 1 day earlier which is plus, but also the phone is BRAND NEW, comes in the original box with charger and headphones. It come in very well packaged & the phone works great! I got it for verizon but mine also works for AT&T . You can use a SIM card. Thank you so much SUNSET PHONES! I've bought phones on Amazon before and this has been my best experience by far! & the other ones weren't bad! 5
Worked great for a long time but then it wouldn't update and I reset it and it wouldn't download my apps or send pictures or screenshot. Pay the extra $40 for a Note II. It's worth it. 3
don't like this phone and company! if you are blind by apple toys then it is best out there. however, If you are not afraid of trying new phones, look for windows phone 8.1 and later. they are way better in compare to iphone so far and price are half of what apple is asking for it. choices are yours to make. i'll recommend this phone if you are apple fan. if you are not, try windows phone 8.1 or later. 2
This phones works fine the first 2 months, after that the white cover turns yellow with the sun or any kind of dirt and dust, I would not recommend it 2
Charger got ruined in 2 weeks 4
If it had t9 text input the review would be better 3
Showed up on time, exactly as described. Sealed packaging, charger included, earbuds as well. Looks brand new, activated within seconds thru Verizon. 4
Great NEW phone received exactly as advertised. Have to order SIM card separately. Buyer BEWARE though, there is only a 30 day warranty on this phone. Seller says there is an option to buy extended warranty. Apple does NOT honor its warranty when the phone is purchased from a third party seller. We found this out the hard way after only 90 days of ownership. 4
Package came fast and works fine it exactly as described. I honestly thought for the price I get ripped off but I did not. 4
The phone worked fine for a few weeks, then started glitching. I asked to send it back and get a refund the seller pretty much said no that it was the software for Apple. 1
The vast majority of apps that I have installed or tried to install default to the internal storage rather than the microSDXC card I installed. This means that very few apps can be installed at the same time. I reached out to BLU through their BLU help app and have received no response. Thankfully it's an android device and using the developer tools I can force all apps to install to the SD card. Not all users will have the ability or skills to do so. That said this was purchased as a temporary phone until I can afford to replace a broken iPhone on the next release cycle. 2
The phone its self is okay, main application, but it’s not compatible in Africa, The only thing that this phone is able to do is just used it as an ordinary phone. It cannot be connected to internet as it cannot be activated by the local phone providers. The only time that you can use internet is when you have WIFI which is not possible in Africa-Zambia. When you want to recharge you pre paid card with airtime, you have to remove the sim card put it in another phone. I am not sure its worth the money if you are to use it in Africa as this is a Verizon Phone. 2
Phone had a number under it so i cant use it 😡😡😡😡 1
I would not buy a BLU phone again. This phone lasted a little over a year before the battery stopped working properly. I would have paid for a replacement battery but BLU customer service said that the company does not offer replacement batteries and the third-party vendors and Web sites that they referred me to did not have batteries in stock for this model and did not foresee getting them in stock in the future. A few Web sites claim to have compatible batteries but we do not know yet if they will work in this phone. I wanted a basic phone, and this phone filled that purpose for a year (though the camera on the phone was definitely sub-standard). But I do not buy many electronics and I do not want the few that I do buy to turn into garbage in just a little over a year's time. 2
It don't have illuminated the buttons outside the Screen to go back and see all appications... at nigth it is imposible to use them. When a call is running, if I want to end it, I must give back two times to reach the screen of the call... it is very bad. 3
This is the price for father's day ?😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 4
This crap DOES NOT WORK! They also do not tell you upfront the limitations of data that can be retrieved from phones or what types of phones are compatible. 1
I just want to tell this seller that his product is simply awesome. Excellent packaging. Actually I'm buying this Phone to send to Cameroon and it works perfectly with all the Service providers in cameroon. This phone is truly unlocked. I'll recommend this phone for any one who wants to use it in Africa especially Cameroon. It works very well. No scratches, looks like a brand new phone. the packaging makes me wanna get a another one even though I don't have money. Seriously, I have no draw backs for this product and its seller. I'll recommend this seller to any one... 5
The only thing is that: the size of ram and rom memory are too small. 3
the phone no charger 100% 2
Works fine easy to get hooked up with a month to month service provider. Verizon wouldn't hook me up unless it was their phone so, their loss. 5
I am not an apple fan, but this was a gift and she loves it. It has been used hard and very abused by my kids for almost 5 months and it looks and works as good as it did the day we got it. The hardware is awesome, very sturdy. Now, if you could just run Android on it, it would be the perfect phone, or if Motorola could just build a phone that was sturdy as these... 5
that is a new phone ,but sometime restart itself. 4
Good afternoon is to inform the team 5.5-Inch Lenovo A850 Unlocked 3G has the following fails, the computer does not recognize any SIM card into its two slots, I wonder if the team is still in warranty and see what we can do no more than say thank you very much. 5
I bought this phone NEW, when I opened the box it did not look new at all. I bought this phone and a straight talk sim card, so a few days of Me having this phone I was having an issue sending and receiving picture messages. So I called straight talk and they told Me it was an apple issue. I called Apple and they told Me this phone was not used and belonged to someone in Italy and they had unlocked it and also they noticed the jailbreak which I didn't know about. So they said they couldn't help Me with the issue...So now I am stuck with a phone that can't send out picture messages unless it is another iphone. 1
Only problem is the home button and a few minor scratches but other than that the phone works perfectly fine! 4
The iPhone I purchased for my son is awful. My son had an iPhone 5 that he loved but on the way home from school one day his phone was stolen and he lender up with a broken nose. I wanted to send back the phone we purchased on Amazon as soon as we got it. He was just so excited to have another phone. It never charged properly, now it doesn't change at all. The speakers don't work and the voice is unclear when someone called. 1
Es una muy buena adquisición con muy buena velocidad y la batería aguanta todas las exigencias.Recomendado 4
Great Phone!!! Fast with plenty of memory. The touch screen should be a little more sensitive but maybe I can adjust it. 4
Very upset with this purchase. Phone cane with a simcard already active on another account. Took 3 weeks for my carrier to get me a fresh one. Bad experience 1
My daughter likes the phone. 3
It does what it's supposed to do, however, trying to get the curved edges to lay flat and outing on a bumper after are very difficult. 4
This isnt the fones problem; this is a Blackberry problem. Blackberrys cant be used on Chitchat Mobile. So I am out the money, with a useless fone. 2
I was a little hesitant at 1st but than I remembered that within 30 days of purchase you can take it to the apple store and get apple care or you can get you carriers insurance but with t-mobile it cost about 120 a month or more vs apple care witch costed me 200 for 2 yearsAnd because of the cost of the phone I got a waterproof otterbox now I don't plan on throwing it in to a pool but just incase something happens and it gets wet I don't half to worry about water damage and if it dose get water damage apple care will cover it. So I say get this phone because it is a cheaper price and I have had know problems with it. 5
The phone is great, easy to work with and comfortable in my hand. 4
Claimed "excellent " condition but battery life is very short. Phone itself is fine 3
Had to return because I needed the iPhone 4s to run certain apps for business. 3
First came with Verizon logo, it's ok but then when SIM card was inserted asked mne for the Verizon unlocking code ???? So I have to go and pay extra to unlock it because was not. Flash form camera is not working at all. No advisable to buy to this provider, not Amazon standards that we like 2
Bought this used however it didn't have a scratch on it wonderful deal! Daughter loves it! 5
THIS PHONE IS BROKEN YOU F UCK FACE 1
Phone is great, seller was great when I had questions also. 5
Had water damage inside phone 2
This product seems almost brand new...so glad I have found this! 5
The only think I don't like you send me the Cheapest usb cord n no earpod other than that everything look good n perfect 4
It was nice, going on the web and downloading apps was smooth and fast. Nice phone. 4
I am through with this phone since day one ive been putting up with its bulls***. Ot has a number of issues, it would just reset on me for no reason mutlple time within like 5 minutes. Then sometime it would just completly turn off for no reason and when i try to turn it on it doesnt. So i have to hold the power button and home button at the same time just so it can turn back on. And sometime that doesnt work and i have to wait for hours until it come back on. Sometime i fear that it going to stop working completly.I dont know if the seller was aware with this issue but i am very upset with using it. I regret buying this phone from this seller and i regret not returning it because i thought all the problem would go away in a month and since you could only return product with in a month. I just wish that the seller will read this and offer me a new iphone but sadly i gotta put up with this phone until i have enough money to buy new iphone😪 What a waste if money. 1
Looks nice good features but drops calls 50% of the time battery burns out fast. Not one aftermarket item works for case that fits or charging units. Only thing that works halfway is my kindle cord. But the camera is great and good picture in screen. 2
Great phone. Still learning to use all the features. Works well with the Consumer Cellular phone plan. 5
The phone was fine but the battery lasts only about 45 minutes. The first day I got the phone the charger that came with it was not working. I am disappointed. I bought a new phone and I ended up with a junk battery and there were already scratches on the back. I could have bought a used iPhone at a store nearby for less and would have been MUCH more satisfied. DO NOT buy this product unless you want a price of junk that only lasts 45 minutes. This product was supposed to be new but is OBVIOUSLY NOT. 2
So, the phone itself is 5 stars. I needed a Verizon compatible phone and that's what I got. I removed my SIM card from the old one and set this one up no problem. I gave it three stars because of everything else.It comes with headphones, a wall charger and cable, but they were all different brands. The wall charger was some off brand, the cable was belkin but what was weird is that the headphones were really nice, dreys beats, the kind that go IN your ear, but they were used (gross). 3
This product is disappointing. It is locked and has a big crack at the back. The OS is also ancient. 2
I like it, shipping early and nice phone. Thanks 4
I was pretty skeptical once I read some of these reviews. My phone got here with only one or two small scratches & the only complaint I have is that when charging, my screen doesn't act right when I try to use my phone so I have to unplug it, do the task, then plug it back in. I love my phone though, I'd still recommend buying it. 4
I initially found this phone to be adequate at best but now after using it for a month I am seeing it's many flaws. Despite the reported high mp camera the pics are not very good. I am unable to save pics that others text to me... The latest problem is Google asking me what I want randomly when I try to do anything with the phone. The operating system is painfully slow, will freeze, and facebook and other apps will frequently crash. This phone is a waste of money. The microSD card basically adds no usable memory. You need actual RAM to run and store even a moderate number of modern apps. Stay away, this thing is not good. 2
got shipped to me right away and worked well but it had a lot of scratches on front glass screen part and a lot of chips around the edge of the phone. wish he would've been more straight up with me about the shape of the phone. 3
Not a good phone. Chokes when you need to run more than one program on it. GPS is unreliable and constantly loses signal. Included case is sub par. Only bright spot is that battery life is good. 2
Sold Me A Blacklisted Phone 1
I ordered a blue 5c with 8 gigs, I got a beat up white 5c with 4 gigs. I'm thinking about returning it, but I can't go without a phone for long and I'm not sure how long it'll take for them to get me the right one. I'm bummed out. 1
I offers more than any other phone alone or together. Speed, look, one can answer in any side. Has an excellent look. Light and thin. A 5.5 display, wide front camera - has a great back camera. On top the Audio Mix - has an excellent crystal sound on 5.1 stereo and great great headphones.On top, it offers more than iPhone 6 on $250. After a day paying with it - a friend of mine - just garbed it from me. Now I have to boy another one :). Currently I have an Idol 2 - but Idol 3 is much more advanced. I recommend it to all. 5
The phone I bought is an iphone 5 unlocke. they listed as "good as new". It worked fine for about a week then the battery started dying at 10% then 15% then 19% now its 30%. The text screen is sideways and not upwards. I can barely use this phone! Only stays charged for 2 hours at best. It drops calls constantly (NO it's not my cell company, i know that for a fact) But I am LOSING client calls and it's affecting my business. Be cautious about buying from this place...maybe i'm one unlucky customer who just got a bunk phone but I highly doubt I'm the only one. I'm so dissapointed. Major inconvenience!!!!!!!! 1
My son got it fast and it worked fine 4
to used in the usa is horrible... 2
This phone is fantastic. I bought used via Amazon Warehouse "like new" condition - wow the condition was perfect - no scratches, no dust and it works beautifully. Battery life - OMG what can I say - it is so great not to have to charge the phone a couple of times a day.I didn't think I would like the iphone being and android user all these years. I glad I made the switch. The screen size is smaller than my old phone, but not by much. I had looked at the iphone6 - found that too big, the size of the 5s is just perfect 4
It served the purpose till upgrade on Verizon kicked in! 3
You cannot get this phone networking card for this phone with straight talk will not work 1
I PURCHASE THIS PHONE FOR A FRIEND IN THE END SHE LIKE IT AND WISH IT CAME WITH A MANUAL 3
Phone speaker does not want. Tried all online suggestions with no luck. 3
bigger than I expected but everything is satisfied except the size. 4
The phone is good value for the price. Though BLU hasn't provided an update to Lollipop as they said they would after 3 months. 3
I paid over $200 for a 16 gb phone and ended up getting an 8 gb. 2
The home button fell off I'm disappointed because I wouldn't have expected that to happen for the price u paid for it 3
phone brought from july...only takes 5 months then the phone wont charge anymore.. kinda disappointed 2
This phone is okay. My son purchased it, he didn't realize how little storage there is. He is constantly deleting nearly all apps and photos to make the phone operable. 3
Its a good phone for me just that it always has low signal and my provider is simple mobile. For some apperant reason my headphones can't seem to work at the same time and I know it's the phone since I bought some other headphones and I'm still having the same problem. I would better my review if blu would fix it. 2
So far the phone is working great. I usually use the wifi setting vs cellular. Browsing the web, phone calls nice and clear. The reason my rating is a 4 stars i was disappointed that there was no brief documentation manual also no pen as pictured. 4
The earpiece is so quiet it's almost impossible to hear except in the most quiet of rooms and with the loudest of loud-talkers on the other end. The speakerphone is slightly louder but still isn't much louder than the earpiece on most other phones. One thing that was not immediately clear is that there is no support for data functions -- no web browser, no multimedia/picture messaging. While you can take pictures and store them on a micro SD card, you cannot send them with this phone. Also, the charging port is in an inconvenient location, on the top side of the phone, which is really weird. 2
For the price it's a good buy. 2
Same thing here I had to first download several manuals from web site none them were right one but from reading all of them I was able to make some progress. I figure it out 2
I have tried to return this phone but I can not get any information on how or where to return it, it does not work for me and Verizon Wireless will not make it ready for me to use. I have put in a claim as instructed by Amazon but still have not gotten a reply. The apple phone is too old orjust not usable....I desparately need help with this I need to return it so that my credit card can be credited and I will buy a new one that my carrier Verizon Wireless will accept....MY FRIENDS ARE LAUGHING AT ME FOR GETTING SUCH A BAD DEAL ON MY FIRST ATTEMPT AT SHOPPING ON AMAZON... 5
The sound did not work properly which makes it hard if you can't hear text messages or people when you answer the phone. First and foremost it must work as a phone. Customer service was great at facilitating returns but it would have been nice to double check everything before shipping things out. 1
The phone was in great condition it's an excellent product I hope to use it for a long time. However I noticed one if the bottom speakers doesn't play but other than that phone works great. No glitches no cracks or scratches just fluid use. 4
If I could give zero stars I would. This phone was advertised to me as new but sold to me clearly refurbished with scratches on the back. A week after activating it the lock button became defective and it keeps going to the "slide to power off screen" every 10 seconds which practically makes the phone unusable. I called apple support and they informed me the phone was not new and was 200 days past warranty so now I'm forced to return the phone and go buy a phone from somewhere else for much less since I'm not on a contract and I refuse to pay full price for another defective phone. 1
Received my blue life 8xl yesterday in the mail (Sunday( had ri wait and activate today with phone carrier metro pCS. Phone was working fine now all of a sudden no internet unless I turn WiFi on only.Google Playstore never came on from jump. Not sure if problems with phone company or defective phone. Will take back tomorrow to metro and check out... I've owned 3 other blu phones between myself and kids and this is the first to ever have issues...not sure if its the lollipop upgrade that's giving issues but that shouldn't have anything to do with Google not working and my emails... I like the phone but without all apps working and internet I can't keep the phone. Will check with phone carrier first...keep u posted 2
I needed a simple phone for my upcoming trip to Germany, so this one seemed to be perfect for my purpose. When I first received the phone, everything was set in Spanish language, with the home town set to Mexico City. It took me a while to find out how to set it to English. I immediately tried the phone with my German SIM card, it worked fine for exactly 2 test calls (one outgoing, one incoming) and then I put it away. I was really impressed with the small price!When I arrived in Germany a few weeks later, my transport was not at the airport as usual. I tried to call them, but the phone did not work! Callers could hear me, but I could not hear them. I rebooted the phone and even reset ist with the same result. I could hear no sound, not when the phone turned on, not for the radio, or for a phone call. I did not bring a headset for phones with me on the trip because I wear hearing aids and would not be able to use the phone with a headset anyway. However I tried with a simple headset from the plane (no microphone), and I could hear the sound with that just fine.So I could not use the phone during my trip as intended and immediately sent a mail to BLU and asked customer service for help, because I thought there was a simple solution to the problem. They responded with a prefabricated mail and a link to a web form, where I could contact customer service. I filled out the web form, but of course I could not provide a working phone number overseas, and neither could I supply the requested IMEI number, because it is very tiny and I did not have a magnifier on my trip. Needless to say, they never reacted to my help request via the web form.Back home, I filled out the web form again, this time with all the required information. I received yet another prefabricated answer, with the suggestion to reset the phone to factory settings. I sent them yet another mail, telling them I had already tried that several times, with no luck. It was very frustrating because every time after a reset I had to change the language and the home town all over again.So now I even told them I was willing to exchange the phone for a more sophisticated one which costs about $100 more. Again, I received no reply from BLU customer service.A week later I sent them yet another email that I had lost trust in them because of their unresponsiveness and I just wanted a simple exchange for the same phone. This time they finally reacted, after four weeks and my fifth (!!!) question for help! Now they want me to send the phone for repair (not an exchange as I had requested!), at my own cost, which would be more then a third of the $18 I had initially paid for the phone.I read the warranty and it states that "BLU may, at BLU's sole option, use rebuilt, reconditioned, or new parts or components when repairing any Products, or may replace Products with rebuilt, reconditioned, or new Products." Well, there is no guarantee that my new phone will finally work correctly after the repair with rebuild parts, and I don't like to throw good money after bad. So I will probably just throw the phone away and look for another solution for my next upcoming trip to Germany. Maybe I'll have better luck with another company. 2
There wasn't a SIMS card with it. Which my have been my fault for not double checking out reading through everything. I'm not sure they advertised no SIM card though. But it was in great shape and exactly what I was looking for. No scratches or problems either. Also the charger they sent me didn't work. 3
Greetings I am writing to tell you that I am very comfortable with the phone, filled all my expectations. thank you 5
Everything was as promised and expected. 5
The phone I got is the iphone 7 MN8K2ll/A which is not an unlocked phone but one that is listed as Verizon and locked. The product description said Apple Iphone 7 Unlocked US Version. This is very misleading advertising,UPDATE:Though I have not activated the phone this model recognized the DIgicel SIM and network easily. I upgraded the review to 4 stars 4
Fast and prompt. Phone works and looks great. Recommended any time. 5
Even the instruction book is better than any I have ever had, but as a senior we need BIG print with the phone, not for your website as page 1 clearly tells us because seniors take instructions with them as we go places, especially traveling and there is not a computer readily at hand, remember we are not the laptop generation, just getting into tablets and they are often to small. Otherwise, so far so GREAT. Love the name, I ask my brother, do you have Jethro, when he is leaving. 5
Nice looking phone as usual buy Apple just screwed me up yet again with the phone memory it said it was 8gb and turned out to be 5.4 to be precise. Why do they keep shoving us up all their stupid apps that No one ever uses 1
Got the item out by the time it was suppose to be deliver, the saying you pay what you get for applies here. I was looking so hard for a white iphone and couldn't find one at a reasonable price so I went ahead and order the black one new and I got a white one same gbs and all just the color was different and I was very satisfied with the product no bad experience so far. 5
Charger port did not work. Pink shadow on screen. Had to returned it. Glad I got my money back. 2
The phone has been to the AT&T store twice and help from Apple Support . It may have serious problems. Not sure iif I should send it back or give it more time. 2
Its a nice,beautiul ,strong and durable cell phone and and very practical to my needs 5
Scam! When I was buying it, it was a sim card, not iPhone! It costed 1 cent and didn't worked. They did it to get reviewes and now are changing description. What a shame! 1
I thought this phone was new, but it was refurbished. It has a few bugs still. 2
I love it works great 5
It was great. Has worked well. but I would like to kindly request for the name that was attached to the sprint account. It is equested for the unlocking of the device. Please contact on my email ubong21@gmail.com 4
dont buy it its a trick phone was bad & no headphone no charger no box 1
The phone works well, but the glass on the front breaks very easily. After using an older smartphone for the past 4 years with no issues, it was quite surprising (and disappointing) to pull this one out of my pocket just a few days after I started using it and find that the front of the screen had a crack all the way through it. The phone still works, but the large crack across the screen makes me sad every time I see it. 3
The Blackberry Curve is good, but not as good as the Blackberry Bold 9000. I still recommend the Blackberry much better than Iphone as a professional use. Iphone is more for younger generations. 3
Apple iPhone 5 16GB - Unlocked - White (Certified Refurbished)It is an Apple iPhone 5 16GB - Unlocked - White (Certified Refurbished) This phone has battery problems, problems with the touch screen and the camera.This is not the product I expected and I need a seller's response to these problems and a solution to it. 1
Wouldn't hold a charge for longer than 3 hours. 1
only has 512MB of memory; not enough to load any other apps or save music or save photos 3
When I looked it said there was nothing wrong. Everything was clean. After I got it. I checked the esn and it was bad. Was so mad 1
Received an iPhone in like new condition cosmetically, but I don't believe it was legitimately refurbished.The battery only lasts about 1/2 to 3/4 of the day on a full charge and the phone randomly shuts off with like 30% battery life remaining, saying the battery is dead.The packaging and the charger are not from Apple. No earphones or instructions were included. (The charger is the only one of those items I cared about, but, if it makes a difference to anyone else, that is what to expect.)Very disappointed. 1
not pleased. was told sprint phone and it was not. 1
Bought this for my Grandson's birthday to upgrade him from his 4S. Works like new for a fraction of the cost. 4
I am not satisfied with phone,As it's not working properly and displaying screen was not good.Poor co lour display.Less quality. 1
upgrade from my 3 year old iPhone 4. Works great and I got to keep my unlimited data with Verizon. 5
Apple and Gmail don't play well together. I had to download the Gmail app in order to get email notification sounds, since the iPhone's mail app won't do it. Facebook notification sounds are inconsistent. There are some really nice thing about this phone though. I love the vibrancy of the display. I like text dictation. I do like the extra large format, though there is wasted space. The screen should really go to the edges. 4
PROSAmazingly fast and powerful for the price. Good camera. Dual SIMs. Lots of memory.CONSBig and heavy. Dim screen. Heavy Android skin. Too much bloatware.BOTTOM LINEThe Asus ZenFone 2 is the most powerful smartphone you can get for $299, but it isn't the most aesthetically appealing one. 4
It was in a extremely wonderful working condition, and exceed my expectation. Awesome! 5
The order came in a timely manner- initially the phone worked great. Later I had issues accessing data from my SIM card.The battery has a very short life. Although it may simply need replacing, but if the phone is listed as "new" then this shouldn't be the case. 2
Cheap price, cheap product. Buy a model that is a year old, but a brand name, and you will do better than with this. Cracked screen inside of a month, way too little storage, and the camera does not work well.Does make phone calls and texts, therefore no 1 star rating. 2
This is my second Blu, I upgrade form a Blu Life Play X...good product for half of the price of another brand....amazing performance.........buy it but do not count with customer service...my phone needed an update, but at the time of the install had a problem. this happen two months ago. I sent a mail with the screen shot of the problem and I am still wating for the answer and the solution. I will down grade to 3 stars 3
i could not insert a nano sim chip then i do not know if works. I noticed that if you buy the 64 GB from the apple store for Tmobile is cheaper than this one, also is unlocked. I didn't know about that. 3
Phone came with wrong charger. 3
I phone 5 is the worst phone I ever had 1
It was great. Sucks that it didn't come with a charger though. 5
How should we unlock this phone?? 4
Well I don't know if the phone battery is defective or not but the battery lasts the same as a regular phone not happy with the phone 2
I love it thank u 5
It came locked so it was not advertised properly. 1
No call blocking. Way too big. Auto correct is not only atrocious, it does not turn off even when you take the proper steps to turn it off. Avoid this phone. It's a cheap knockoff. 2
The phone lasted a long time, my problem was more so with the inability to set alarms and when you set to-do items on your calendar and set an alarm to go off no sound went off to warn you. 4
The phone itself is beautiful but it has a defect. After 5 months it will not charge . Defective ! 2
Ordered this phone as new and when it got here, it turned out to be refurbished and not new. It didn't have the original seal and there were no user manuals in the box. You could clearly see that the phone had been used before. There were some light scratches on the back! 2
It looks nice as other phones, but the camera and the speaker have problems. When I talk on the ohone, I can hear the other side, but they can't hear anyhting from me. And the camera gets frozen all the time and then automatically shut down. I have no idea how to fix them. Sucks. 2
 I've been using both iPhone and Samsung Galaxy for quite some time, I was recently using a Samsung Galaxy s4 when I thought of buying an iPhone and I was going to buy an iPhone 5 when by chance I found out about the Blackberry classic. I admit that since I saw it I fell in love and especially when I saw the physical keyboard, I knew I had to have it.I must clarify that before the iPhone and the Samsung Galaxy I was a Blackberry user, I was always a fan of its elegant design and its software, but after people changed the Blackberry Messenger by WhatsApp, and the fact that there barely existed some apps that didn't even ran so well in the Blackberry, that forced me to change to the aforementioned brands.The idea of ​​buying the Blackberry Classic was merely because it promises to be a cell phone that will optimize and make easier working with email and text messaging, FALSE!Recently, I had closed all my social networks and just wanted a cell phone to focus on email and text messages, but definitely this phone does not do the best work in those functions.First of all I can not believe how slow it is between applications (take note that i uninstalled LinkedIn, Facebook, Foursquare and Twitter, which are already installed when you buy it. I wonder how slow it would be if I had to use all these social networks!), it's ridiculous, sometimes BBM itself takes a few seconds to open a single message, and when using WhatsApp, there have been occasions where I have pressed the button to open the message and ends opening the user profile, all because of its slowness.Second, the design of the software generally feels somewhat out of date and responds slowly compared to any other phone on the market today (including some older as the q10 and Blackberry z10). What is unforgivable is the instability that this phone has, a total chaos to navigate between same Blackberry OS 10 options, I can't believe how this came out to the market.What's most surprising is the price, I paid a total of $ 485 (with taxes), and it's amazing that for half the price I could have bought a z30 which is much faster and stable than this!What most struck me was the physical keyboard, once I already had it in my hands felt cheap! I saw many reviews saying that the keyboard was comfortable and that it wasn't that noisy when you pressed a key, but the real thing is that every time I press a button at night, my neighbor ends up yelling at me to please stop texting in the phone.I would say the product is a complete disappointment and I dare to say that it's a scam for the price it has.My advice would be: by no means buy this phone, it is nothing that you expect it will be. For those who want to have a "retro experience" of those golden times of Blackberry and those long sessions with BBM chat I recommend to borrow it for a week and then return to something more modern (if only is to send and receive email).Do not be fooled with the idea that this phone is ideal for work, simply in no way is good. You will end up suffocated with its really pathetic and unjustified slowness.Another thing is that it can be use as a weapon thanks to its weight.I hope they make an update soon that optimize its OS. 2
I love this phone. Granted I'm always near a computer or tablet the iphone is great when out and about. It's a user friendly interface and there are a ton of apps. The bluetooth is great too. I use a bluetooth stereo headset at the gym which allows me to play music while keeping my phone safely in the gym bag. Yes apple products a bit expensive but they are darn fun and good. No preinstalled junk apps. 5
this product is great so far bought it for Christmas so don't know how long it will last but the price you cant beat and always amazon is great so well pleased 5
The add said very good condition not even close the back has obvious signs it has taken at least 2 drops and the screen looks like someone cleaned it with steel wool 1
excellent product 100 % responsible 5
Phone is good but picture quality poor 3
I have bought this phone from Amazon Warehouse Deals. To my surprise, the phone was locked in the first place and then the charger is not an authentic one. The charger is gone within a month. Post to then, I have started using the headset that Amazon gave, it was of poor quality, and the ear pods worn out too quickly. Both the charger and ear pods seems to be not good ones. Phone is Ok, however, please don't keep lot of hopes on the accessories. 1
Phone is pretty good headphones are loud but the case doesn't protect it. Haven't activated it yet but its up to date and really nice size👍. The down side of it is that when u first turn it on it has a virus and porn but download a cleaning or security app to take it off🙌. 4
I got this phone because I broke my other phone and needed an inexpensive replacement. This is the first windows phone I've ever had and I miss Android. Shipping took forever and tracking was useless but I'm warming up to it slowly no huge issues just learning how to use it. My only complaint would be the apps that I can no longer enjoy like vudu but overall good phoneFeb 10 16I couldn't deal with it anymore replaced it with nexus 6P. I'm too dependant on Google , I love my Google 2
Works as expected since I bought it several months ago. As everyone knows, it is bigger (but thinner) than the iPhone 5. Took it to Verizon and got it hooked up to our network without incident. Saved about $200 doing it this way (with a refurbished phone). 4
It was alright just didn't meet my expectations 2
Just got this and is O, however I find that the battery runs down very quickly. 3
The product is marked as like new, but the mobilephone i received screen scratches.And the top of the screen will be dented with a little strength,use my hand. 3
I had to have it unlocked which cost money! I had to have the speaker fixed bc I couldn't hear anyone on it! Over all I should have not bought this phone... 1
Not unlocked. Description clearly states that it is an unlocked phone, however it is very much locked. Need to register with AT&T before using....Thankfully Amazon is great with returns. 1
i have had this phone for 2 months and i didnt really like it. it does not really compare to a big phone like the company claims. i had a galaxy s4 before and it was a lot better. this phone lags too much and does not have near as much features as a s4. also this phone wont even charge anymore after 2 months of use. 2
You can here it ring but you can't talk on it to low and I don't. Use mind now 4
Not pleased with it , tried to get it connected with sprint. But sprint came back saying the serial number was bad and that it was clearly not a sprint phone . Like the seller clearly states in the title 1
Phone works good! Charger that came with it broke like 4 days after I got it & the earphones that also came with it, didn't work. 4
I'm going to be honest I'm not going to give you this long 20 page review. I'm just going to say, it's not the best to get your phone here cause you have no plan or anything like that. My phone came in like brand new, except for the small problem. My phone would start turning off randomly after 2 months of getting it. It wasn't that bad until a month later it got so bad I couldn't be on my phone for 3 minutes without it turning it off. A little after that it would turn on but stay on the apple then turn off. I couldn't be on my phone at all. I had to get it fixed for $60 not a lot , but this is when they raised the price and I had to pay $310 for my phone. I found out a piece inside my phone would heat up so bad it would turn my phone off. When they fixed it I had to restart my phone. I hope my review helped you guys out :) 1
goodgoodbut little bit disappointedbecause boxcase edge be crushed..... 4
I really wanted this phone to work out for my mother. I really bought into the meaning of the name- BOLD LIKE US and wanted to get off the high priced phone/contract extension roller coaster.. She still has the Iphone 3 and I thought for sure this would be and upgrade. Unfortunately, It was a hard switch for her, as far as being able to convert to the new operation system (my mom is a fast learner under 50years young and a professional). The Screen is way too large to be called a mini. So big that you pretty much need to use both hands to everything except hold it to talk. We have decided to return the phone because the sound quality was not very good. Yes, you can hear well when using the phone but when my mom called me, her voice sounded muffled and that was one issue too many... One more thing- the picture quality was not that great. I'd give it a C grade. Still, I do recommend this phone for anyone that needs a cheap phone (teens) likes to surf on the web. 3
I'm loving this phone. I'm very satisfied 5
My granddaughter loved her replacement! 5
I was not comfortable buying this off line, but it seems to be working great so far. Only time will tell.... 4
excelent, and I recived so fast, I want anohter one. 5
If you want to use the mobile phone in China, you need to also spend a fee to unlock the mobile phone. Fortunately, this cost is not too high. 4
The phone came with dirt in the ports and buttons from use they didnt even bother cleaning it before selling it. Additionally the charger and cable they provided were cheap genetics. The charger is so cheap it takes for ever to charge the phone on it 1
it was not fully functional. I wish if I can return it and get my money back. 1
Phone was in great condition and works terrific! 5
Brand new my ass! A.K.A returned A.S.A.P! Scratched up! Chipped up! Never again! Certain of that! Run away people! Trust me! 1
Received the phone after waiting 2 weeks when it was released was and SUPER excited after it was on sale for 85 bucks! I had to buy it! There is a lot to talk about lol The phone has 2 SIM cards, Slot 1 is for 4G and 3G signal while Slot 2 is 2G next to the battery which you must removed to access. Dont forget the SD card slot. Battery life is great it lasts me to the end of the day just from texts, videos and web. The screen is awesome 5.5 inches, 720p goodness! I have big hands and it is still hard for my thumb to reach to the corner of the screen, capacitive buttons to squeeze out more size I would assume. Volume buttons and the power button are located on the right side of the device, headphone jack on top and charger port on the bottom. Weight on the phone is okay though it is not balanced very well, there have been times where ive had the phone go over my index finger. (Big hands) The camera is okay 8MP with a LED light to accompany it. Front camera is 2MP which I dont really care for unless youre a selfie person or for skype for pictures youll be using those filters to help the image quality lol. The back speaker is a bit too loud in my opinion. Great phone for the price! Bloat-free, I have rooted the device with Kingo Root. Now the bad stuff oh boy..BAD!1. The smartphone did not attempt to read my 32G SD card, Ive tried MANY cards on the device and nothing. I asked for a replacement for the dead SD slot which came in to days woo! Grabbed the new replacement aaaaaand IT DID NOT WORK! Really frustrating since I have tons of music on those cards.2. On both devices Ive had the same problem. The battery seems to be picky about what phone charger can and CANT charge it! What the...3. While charging, the top half of the huge screen becomes unresponsive! Bringing down the notification bar at the home screen is almost impossible while charging. (Maybe its the voltage coming into the device??)4.So MANY bugs on the UI, such as the swipe lock screen. I touch the bubble swipe to the right and the it unlocks and locks immediately! to access my home screen I must go through my notifications bar and menus menus menus. Another example, the dial pad, dialing numbers lags really bad.5. Im not sure if it is specific apps (YouTube etc.) or the wifi hardware, but while watching 720p videos they seem to buffer too often. Making HD videos almost unwatchable. It could be the 4.4.2 KitKat OS that is contributing to 95% of these problems and hopefully they will be fixed with the 5.0 Lollipop upgrade which the ETA on that is unknown. Otherwise its a GOOD starting phone with decent specs but if problems continue to arise I might will return this phone and spend 75 bucks more for a better upgrade. I could bump to 4 stars if 5.0 Lollipop comes in. 3
I recently bought this, and it doesn't charge. It's not new. It's refurbished. do not buy this is not new and it won't work. I don't know how Amazon allows this. Pretty bad choice. 1
Needs more memoru, cant move all the apps to sd. Stall out at times. Have to reboot to get wifi working sometimes. Ok for the money. 3
On the amazon site, it listed it as a new phone rather than refurbished. Although I wouldn't expect a new phone that is so dated, it should have been listed as refurbished. The phone itself is fine and works well. 4
Very impressed I didn't expect it to be this good cosmetically!! 5
Have not tried it yet, but looks good for a good price 4
Very pleased ! Looks like new ..and worked very well this was a great deal! 5
Considering my last phone was heaping pile of dung, this one is a little slice of heaven. I'd never pay those ridiculous Apple prices so I got this one used and I couldn't be happier. 5
The phone is everything I expected! I have been an IPhone user since 2011 and I am not going anywhere! 5
This little phone is great compact and easy to use love it .Michelleheraud 5
it wasn't unlocked it was Verizon 1
Phone was purchased as a gift in Mexico. Phone works great especially for the price. Good reception and doesn't drop calls. Recommend. 5
I love the color but it's hard to navigate and I don't like the contents vibration. 3
Never mention anywhere that it was a prepaid sprint phone 1
I owned a Amazon Fire Phone up until this iPhone. After my Fire phone quit working, Amazon refunded me my full amount since it was still warrantied and they no longer make their phone. So I decided to go ahead and purchase an iPhone instead on Amazon since they have such great customer service. I can't say enough about my phone. The picture and video quality is great, it takes a lot more clearer videos and pictures than I thought it would take. I was a little worried about only have 8GB of storage on my phone because I like to download tons of different apps and games, but so far so good. I haven't had any storage problems and haven't had to delete any programs. It was able to upgrade to the new iOS which is awesome. I am really happy with this iPhone it's my first iPhone since the iPhone3 (sad, right?). I am so glad that I went with iPhone instead of Android. They are way better phones! 5
I bought this item for my dad in Africa and he loves it. He says I made a difference in his life because no one has an Iphone deep in the village. he called and told me one day robbers were about to cut off his hand when they saw him with it. to cut the story short, Go Amazon. you are the best. 5
its a great economy phone but i paid a little more being $20 and got a lg g2 gsm phone. the blu 5.0 lte hd i paid $120 for a like new from amazon warehouse as described. it came complete in box after start up noticed overheating and about a week late the power input was wiggling to a breaking point also feels like cheap plastic and maybe one drop could end it(not sure didn't drop it I'm exaggerating) returned and refunded. 3
Good phone was unlocked and worked with other country sims.ConNo head phones jack 4
nice price for phone but the motherboard of the phone sticks and i cant text or do anything with the phone. i thought i wait it out to see what else can be done for the phone nothing 1
Good material, great design doesn't however fit the blu studio selfie phone correctly 2
I used this phone exclusively for over a week but could not tolerate its shortcomings. I like the large, bright screen and how it feels in my hand. I also like that they don't use software buttons. You get to use all of your screen, unlike some phones like the new Moto-X Pure. However, these positives were more than cancelled out by the following issues;1) Wi-Fi connectivity - barely connects to access points that my other phones access with ease. I've had to turn Wi-Fi off several times on the Pure XL just to get online.2) Battery life no where near what I expected. The first 2 cycles wouldn't last all day. After a week it did get much better but still sub-par.3) Voice recognition barely works (on occasion) and "Okay Google" not working at all even with Google Now launcher. Plus, Android won't accept voice commands while the screen is off, like Cortana can. I could have dealt with that by itself.4) Although I like that they used capacitive buttons as opposed to software buttons, they are small and are not backlit. Most times it took at least 2 tries to hit the outside buttons especially in limited lighting conditions.Recently used phones: Nokia Lumia 1520 since it launched until about 6 weeks ago when I started using a Samsung Galaxy Note 4 until I got the BLU Pure XL. I am back to the Nokia Lumia 1520 wit its incredible battery life, Cortana and no junk ware. 3
Horrible phone kicked the bucket in one month. Would not replace it 1
the phone is unable to maintain signal after 2 weeks of usage on the TMobile network. I hope it is a defected product 2
I didnt like the fact that it has no option to lock. I did pocket dial many times because it doesn't have lock. 3
Screen size, brightness and color are good. But the phone itself has too much lag even with only 1 app running. Camera quality is really bad. Can only get the focus right 4 out of 10. Had to return it. 2
Charger provided did not work. Home button a little unstable. 3
Very pleased, performs as expected. 4
Beautiful, works great just advertised. Only problem was getting it set up by consumer cellular. It took four agents to finally get it right. Two agents and a supervisor told me it wouldn't work with their system. I'm so glad I persisted until I got a customer service rep that knew what to do. Great battery life. Since it is new I'll have to wait and seehow it works long term. 5
The phone came in a great condition for a used phone, no problems at all and everything works perfectly, other than that it has a couple scratches on the sides. 4
not what to expect from Blu product , clearly a budget phone 2
Phone would not hold a charge so I had to purchase a solid battery from a reputable seller. 1
This phone is fantastic. I bought used via Amazon Warehouse "like new" condition - wow the condition was perfect - no scratches, no dust and it works beautifully. Battery life - OMG what can I say - it is so great not to have to charge the phone a couple of times a day.I didn't think I would like the iphone being and android user all these years. I glad I made the switch. The screen size is smaller than my old phone, but not by much. I had looked at the iphone6 - found that too big, the size of the 5s is just perfect 4
easy to use..love the scroll button..small easy to carry 4
Scam! When I was buying it, it was a sim card, not iPhone! It costed 1 cent and didn't worked. They did it to get reviewes and now are changing description. What a shame! 1
Phone came with 0% battery. Took hours to charge and when 100% charged, it took 10 mins to drain the battery to 50%. Phone shutdown occasionally. I also noticed LCD defect while pressing the screen. Screen also flickered a lot. Phone was returned in less than 24 HR . Very bad job by the vendor 1
the phone works good but it was not the color I chose pedi white as in the photo that you offer me to get blue sky from white to blue sky is much difference really was not what I expected or better is not what pedi 4
This phone is just what I was looking for. Familiar layout, works faster tha the iPhone 4. Good camera. Very light and sleek. I love it! The one negative is that it uses a different power cord so I know have to keep two sets of cords/adapters around to accommodate my phone and my iPad. 5
My phone is great, no scratches on the screen looks nice with my clear cover on it. It's the best phone ever. 5
Awesome condition and shipping was fast. The only downside is the battery life of the phone is pretty low. 4
We were promised Android 5.0 Lollipop on this device in July which is a short time after the device released. But it turns out that now at the time of the review it's October and the lollipop update sti hasn't been released to us Life 8 XL users and many other users that were promsied the update. BLU continues to make and release phones with lollipop preinstalled and has no reply to many begging users that would like lollipop on their current device. 2
Expected for the price.details to consider: battery and soundbattery 6-8 hours of activitydid not bring headphones/freehands1.5 gb Ram16 Gb internal memory / available 11.3gbcamera regular 2 and 5 megapixel camera with led both 5
static on-line makes the conversations annoying. 2
Purchased several as gifts. They arrived on time and were in good condition as the Seller had described. Please note that none of these gift iphones were put on the carrier named. They went on the month to month plans offered at a major chain store that sold a package deal of buy the chip and get a month air time free. Many months later they are all working fine. And the low budget carrier service is even better than my personal 2-year contract carrier.I plan to purchase more of these as gifts soon. 5
The battery was very bad; it lost power very fast! I had to get a new battery. And now a few weeks later there are lines on my screen. 2
So the truth is that it is working I bought a used one.But it's fully with dents and scratches the screen is ok but everything around is bad bad.And it takes very long to charge and the battery goes out fast.If I wold have extra time I wold send it back but I don't have the time for it.I can't stay without a phone any more so I'm not sending it back but really I need a refund.Or at least for the half price refund.So if I will get back a refund or something I will update my review and will let you know my experience, 1
PHONE MEETS ITS FUNCTIONS AS IT SHOULD BE, BUT IS AN OLD MODEL WORKS ME. WHEN CAN BUY A MORE MODERN. 4
The phone is a good phone but yeah right but. Its only a 2G and very slow without using WiFi. 1
Didn't tell me about no charger or anything 2
I received the product in Venezuela in excellent condition, thanks for everything, I recommend 100% to the seller. The Blackberry has been in operation for several months without any problems, is an excellent phone and everything works fine, one of them had a little detail on the screen is a little loose, but 100% functionalThought of returning but got more expensive the shipping to the U.S. from Venezuela to send it for repair here. 4
Better than I expected upswapit is better company than chelseewood 5
This is a great phone. It was very easy to set up out of the box. The screen has wonderful resolution. Decent camera. Decent sound quality. Call quality is great as well. I actually switched from my Nexus 5 to this phone. I think Blackberry 10 is an underrated OS. With the addition of the Amazon App Store (as well as an easy way to side load the Google Play store that I found out about) Blackberry has the apps to compete with the iClones of the world. 4
If I could give this zero stars I would. The phone's screen came off of the phone! 1
This is the first phone I have ever had such challenges with. The back of the phone consistently is popping out, the battery has to be removed and replaced at least 3 times a day to "reset" the phone, and loses charge within a couple of hours.The charging works inconsistently, even when the same micro charger is used on a daily basis.A complete waste of money, and causes frustration every single day.... 2
It's used and there is some privete information in it. I can't recover the PIN 2
Product was a gift for someone. Once they received the phone and attempted to use it the return window was over:( we charged the phone for first time use and determined the battery will not hold a charge and drained within a few hours with minimal use. 1
Q I have to show I am not satisfied with the quality of the charger and headphones ARE APPLE original porq not shoddy . The phone whether it is good and looks completely new . 2
Im havimg issues with the hone cause the button sont work and its slow 1
I really don't know about this phone, really wanted to go back to BBM... The phone turns on and off sometimes, charges weird, overall I didn't have a good experience with this phone 2
i love this phon, my children can not brake it :) 5
This is fine but they should put in the description that there's no sim card .-. 3
I am going to start with the bad things of this phone then ill talk about the good.When i purchased this phone i was looking for a phone that would last me years until am ready to buy another one with the same brand but unfortunately this is not going to happen.I have my phone for about 2 months now and it fell a month after i got it.the microphone was going crazy but then after it went to normal. after about 2 weeks the microphone stopped working now i can make calls but no one can hear me with the phone in my ear its only on handsfree the other party(person on the other line)can hear me.this phone makes no sense to me.After one fall with a heavy duty case from half a meter from the ground the microphone stopped working.I am very disappointed so i refuse to upload any picture but just so you know it is as seen in the photo.The good things about it i liked is that the speaker is very loud and the camera is much better than a samsung.its 5.5 when i first lay my eyes on it i thought it was the 601 they sent me by mistake until i measured it just to make sure.All the other features are great the storage is fantastic. 32GB wander what am going to do with all that. lol. But please dont hesitate to try this product, maybe you have to be extra carefull with it.Its like a baby.Maybe because of my review they will send me a next phone because i was honest.Thanks for reading hope you make a right choice. 3
I hate the ads that come with this product. REMOVE THE BLOATWARE 3
Disappointed. Phone is blocked due to owner's failure to pay. Cannot be activated. Wish I could give 0 stars 1
Why spern so much on a new phone when mine has been serving me for almost a year now, will upgrade with another used phone when the price goes down 5
I own one that I bought through dealextreme and it has been working really well, So many drops it has had that I don't remember, and that is the main reason why I am buying it again since I am quite clumsy with holding cells. Secondly, I think this cel is quite fast for the price, even though picture quality is not as great to pair it with my high def cameras, but just to point and click is ok. Hope it would come with more memory, but I could not complain since I the price seems to be right. 5
Impressed! Stuck with Blackberry for the keyboard and didn't expect to love the Q10-but I do! Flows smoothly from one task to another, clear, easy, beautiful. Still trying to figure out the docs to go, but will need to take some time for that. Wish it could print straight from phone! 4
Works and arrived as advertised. I feel the the motherboard was scrapped from a 4s because it shows up on AT&T and iTunes as a 4s. I crossed-checked the serial number through Apple and it says it is a 5s so the controlling component must have been from a 4s. Other than that I'm happy with the purchase. 4
Thanks soo much its perfect ! 5
I like the iPhone 4s n I like da color too.. I use to have a 3GS and this one I got now is way better.. 5
Bought from Kraymerica LLC.I figured this was an unbranded BlackBerry. Nope. The firmware has Fido branding and Fido-specific stuff all over it.The device itself isn't branded, but the software sure as heck is. The listing made no mention of this. Sure, I can probably modify the device to get rid of the branding, but I hadn't planned on having to do that to a brand-new device. 2
I had lost mine and needed one ASAP and that is just what I received!! Great phone! Works Great! I would recommend it! 5
Bought 2 of these and had to return one because it kept 'rebooting' and took forever to restart, optimizing my apps every time. 3
8 gb not enough. Should have gone with a 16gb. 4
The slower wifi was the first strike. No one talks about its slower 2.4ghz wifi connection. The deal breaker was that t mobile could not get 4g LTE on the phone. T mobile ran out of ideas trying to help me get LTE on the phone even the Though the instructions and box says is it does. 3
Bought this from Best Price Phones or kugs8989, in February - listed as NEW. Today, June 6, the battery is dead and will not hold a charge. Seller has disappeared. I've had the same model of phone since it was first issued in 2013, and it is still going strong. 1
Phone had a number under it so i cant use it 😡😡😡😡 1
This phone was just as described. 5
The phone was fine except that it does not work with AT&T as advertised, at least not with 4G. 2
I was so dissapointed the unit is locked to verizon, I would appreciate if they will help me unlock the unit... 2
This is a nice phone, but for 350.00, it doesn't do anything new or different than the average android phone. I love the size and it does what it says but I'm still a bit disappointed. My old Galaxy s3 had more tricks than this blu pure xl does.... I have had it to freeze up on me several times in the 3 weeks I've had it. A few times I couldn't reboot or power it off and since the battery isn't removable, I just had to wait until it decided to 'unfreeze', several minutes later. I have somewhat adjusted to the back and home buttons not being backlit but it took a while. Nevertheless, I'm still learning this phone and hopefully will come across some interesting things it'll do in the near future. The downloadable manual isn't a lot of help, everything is fairly cut and dry. I'm on my phone a lot and I use it for my entertainment and it falls short of keeping me entertained very long, its just plain boring so far after the initial excitement of getting it. 3
Awful, screen doesnt work at all, can't click or slide anything. Cannot open it at all. NOT AT&T or unlocked. 1
It was in good condition and worked excellent when I traveled overseas 4
Great price, shipping and service! Thank you will buy again 5
Awesome phone. For what you are paying for it is worth it. It exceeded my expectations. 4
I bought this phone from Amazon twice. The first ones screen cracked when I put a case on it and I was able to return that one. The one that I replaced it with worked for 3 months and then just stopped working completely. I set it on my counter and when I came back an hour later it had turned off and wasn't working or charging. Now it is outside of the return policy and I am stuck with a phone that doesn't work. Complete waste of money and time. 1
it was like new came in a box no scratches tht were visible to me me and my hubby both love our phones they work great 5
The phone freezes a lot and has a lot of glitches very disappointed 2
I bought the phone for my 17 years old son, had minor scratches in the back barely noticeable, but the functionality has been perfect, is the most important, my son is happy!! 4
Had to return device as it would produce garbled sounds while running apps (in our case bubble witch saga). These are not the kind of apps that should make the phone stutter much less make the sound of the game become distorted.Pros: Lovely aesthetics, device has an awesome build quality for the price.Cons: Garbled sounds while running apps. Not sure if a limitation from the CPU or phone defect. Device was returned. 2
Had to return after one day of use. Screen was going crazy and full charge only lasted about a hour 1
The phone arrived on time and was working, however, the item is posted as used very good bu the phone came with many scratches/ small dings on the back of the phone on the colored part. I have t admit the screen was perfect without a scratch so that was great. I gave it a lower rating because it made me believe it would be good as new with maybe one scratch. Also, there is no sim card in the phone so you can't activate it until you go to the store and sometimes it may take some pushing to get the employees at the store to give you the card because they don't get commission on the small card. 2
Phone works and was in really good condition the only reason I didnt give 5 stars is because I ordered a silver iphone and recieved the space grey iphone. 4
The phone powered on once, shut off and did not turn back on. The time it did come on, I got a "white screen of death" and had to manually restart it. This was incredibly frustrating and irritating. 1
i got this phone as a gift for my nephew i have had iPhone 3gs before so i know how they work , the phone is in mint condition but did not come with a charger, the phone is factory unlocked as promised and did not ship in the amount of time that it should this is also understandable and acceptable once you use the phone for the first time. 5
- NICE AND PRACTICAL- Basic but not cheap .- very resistant to daily accidents / rain / food etc... 4
I purchased 2 of these phones in early Dec 2016. Both phones could not be activated by Verizon. Wasted a lot of my time with Verizona customer support. Very angry. 1
Great condition, reasonable price and will be buying from them again for my audiobook listening for my classroom! Very impressed! 5
Don't like it much. Its not really up to date loses time often. Doesn't do what some of the other phones do. Good speaker 3
Bought this 6 months ago to replace my iPhone after 4 yrs of having an Apple phone. I love the 5.5" screen. This phone has a lot of bloatware and took a lot of time figuring out how to hide icons that could not be deleted. Consider another brand with less superfluous icons and maybe for less money. 3
not very good, did not last very long 4 months 2
My first time to buy blackberry phone and feel In love with it. The best phone I ever had. I like the square shape screen which help me a lot in reading and composing easily. 4
I would have given it less than one star, but that isn't an option. I ordered this unlocked iphone and was so excited. Then a week goes by and I still don't have my phone. I check my Amazon account and it tells me the phone has already been delivered. IT WASN'T. I had to contact Amazon (they were great by the way) for a refund, which was issued before we even finished up on the online chat.DON'T USE THESE PEOPLE. 1
This was definitely a great purchaee. I received the phone as desscribed, on time and it works! Went through a nightmare of a transaction before this one trying to purchase a phone So, was very skeptical. Glad this was an excellent purchase and provider. 5
hard to fit certain cables and chargers into the bottom of the case. had to buy new ones, which were crap and didn't work, so then ended up machine shopping the super-tough plastic at the bottom of the case all the way off so the old cables would fit. not waterproof now, but i can charge the phone and listen to music, and it is protected very well otherwise, so that's something 4
I purchased 2 of these phones for my kids and after just a few weeks, they are already complaining that the phone freezes. They have to remove the battery and sometimes reset the phone to factory settings to get it to be responsive again. Not sure if it needs some updates or if the hardware is just not good. If anyone else has encountered these issues and has any fixes or work-arounds please let me know. Otherwise I will continue to troubleshoot and see if I am able to come up with a fix. 3
Ordered this IPhone 5c as a gift. Out of the box it was locked with a Indiana phone number. I brought it to an Apple Store, where they found the phone defective. Luckily they gave me a brand new phone without a hassle. 2
was a fast delivery, was pleased with the appearance of the phone. Quality of phone is not to Casio standard as was like the boulder. But overall pleased with purchase. 3
I just got the iPhone and it won't cut on 1
Excellent for a used phone! 5
It is not working. I bought this is for my mom n it is not even couple months n stop working. Not good at all.... Please don't buy it 1
Like the product and the seller delivered on time. 4
Phone worked great for the first couple of weeks....now it drops calls,freezesup,and now will not connect to the network! This was a Christmas gift for my teenager...she is not happy! 2
I bought the 3 pack and am still on the first one. Seems to be working well and hasn't broke. Holds my phone without all of the bulk of a leather flip case. 5
The Blackberry has been working good, obviously at first I had to unlock it because when I put my chip on the phone, it did not recognized it. The only complaint that I have is about the charger. It was damaged and I did not know that I was going to receive a "travel charger", I expected the regular one, but what can I do now?That's it. 3
The Good:This was brand new in a sealed box from the vendor I bought it from.Yes this is an unlocked GSM phone.It actually had a T-mobile SIM in it which I popped out and replaced with my AT&T SIM card from my iPhone 5. No problems there.The bad:8GB is straight up not enough memory for an iPhone these days. Photos take up a lot of space as do text messages and emails (you won't really be able to use it as an iPod). By the time the iOS is installed you're down to 5-6GB then things start getting cramped. Seriously, if you have an iPhone go to Settings-General-Usage-Manage Storage and see how large these apps are. Pandora alone is like 150kb. So after deleting a bunch of unused stuff I have 800kb left. That's really not even enough to update the iOS when they release a new one, so I will have to hook this thing to my laptop when that day comes (yes I'm writing this review in it, so it obviously works).In short: but it if you can live with the limitations. If you buy the right case no one will ever even know that it's the cheapest phone Apple makes, but I guarantee you that in very short order you will say to yourself "I should have got the 16BG one". 4
The phone came with NOTHING ..... It was fully charged though which gave me enough time too get a charger and headphones 3
I do like this phone, was expecting it to process faster....seems a bit faster than my iPhone 5, but not a huge difference 4
we love it. The sim card holder is a bit loose and it takes some adjustment for the SIM card to be locked in. 3
this is a scam, the phone I received looks like it has been stolen and in very bad shape (scratches everywhere). DO NOT BUY 1
Product was exactly as expected & quick delivery! 5
a fraud. battery lasts an hour having loaded completely and has operational failures. I do not recommend 1
These things are extremely brittle. If you were to purchase one I would highly suggest investing in a heavy duty case. I literally have gone through 4 in the last year and I treat it very carefully.Otherwise a nice piece of technology. 3
It is not opened, because it is a gift, so I have not used it.I need to wait for my friend told me that you like it and feel used. 4
Im a little disappointed with this phone, it looks great, it feels great but right out of the box the WI-FI antenna does not work. So this phone is overseas right now, I cant return it or exchange so I guess I have to pay to have look at it. 3
There are not many phone in this price range when buying unlocked and this is one of the best. The performance is fine for every day tasks and the call quality is decent. For this price you can not expect much from the phone, and it performs mostly how you would expect... decent for almost all uses. My biggest complaint about this product is the storage space, after the software, you only have room for a couple of apps and pictures. Overall this phone is the best for the price, but do not expect it to perform like a brand new flagship phone. 4
Received this iPhone in great time and in excellent condition and at a wonderful price. I am very happy with my purchase. 5
My kids love these phones! They have used them for over 6 months without any problems. 5
Amazing came exactly on my birthday thank you. 5
I received a good result on these phones in terms of sounds, it's clear when chatting. 4
It's over a year and I still can't unlock this phone new provider said it is reported as an stolen cellphone it was a waist of money 1
I have spent an entire day and will spend much of tomorrow trying to solve this problem. Seller says this is a Verizon phone, but both Verizon and Apple say it is in fact T-Mobile. Verizon shows no record of this handset and referred me directly to Apple. Apple had a hard time figuring out how the seller got a hold of this particular model (some unusual features) and advised they are unsure if adding an Verizon SIM card will work. Anyone who has ever had to go to the Verizon store knows that takes as long as buying a new car. Not happy. 2
Very satisfied with my purchase! I ordered the refurbished version from a seller New York it arrived in less than a week and all I had to do was call straight talk and pay 8$ to get my number transferred with my minutes and in less than 5 minutes I was using my IPhone... I love this phone 5
I bought this iPhone as a Christmas gift, so I purchased it early. Upon opening it on Christmas only the speakerphone was working. You could not hear it up-to-the-ear. Apple told us, after we described the problem over the telephone, that it was probably only the speaker module and it would cost about $50. I recently took it to Apple to have the module replaced and was told by them that several parts inside the phone was missing and some parts did not even belong to Apple. Because of the modifications, Apple said that it was no longer a iPhone and would not even work on it. I understand that because of the length of time the phone cannot be returned, but in the future, please sell items EXACTLY AS ADVERTISED AND NOT MODIFIED. 1
This is a easy to use phone with tons of functions. The only issue is the wall charger does not work. It looks like some cheap replica made in china. The charger is not like any of the chargers I have always got with my pantech phones that I bought at the store. 4
IPhone was in great condition! Better than described and over 100.00 less than most sellers. Couldn't have asked for a better deal! 5
I had a expectations very low for this, but for 30 dollars, its surprisingly good! I'll start with the pros:Pros:1. Reasonably fast! There is some lag sometimes but its reasonably fast! For 30 dollars. You get your moneys worth! Don't expect super fast speeds, but its not super laggy.2. It runs casual games! I was able to get minecraft running with only 512mb's of RAM!3. LED is quite useful! I wish it had more uses but its pretty good!4. Very stock android. Which is a must have5. Dual Sims!6. An SD card slot! Which makes me very happy.7. Great battery!! Its insane! Its better then my iPhone 5 battery!8. Its rootable! I tested it with KingRoot and it works just fine! Which is a great advantage!And here are the cons:Cons:1. The touchscreen is crap. I was able to run games, but the touchscreen is so bad that the latency makes the games unplayable almost. Strangely, you don't see this on the OS.2. The camera. Its garbage. I could care less since I don't take pictures, but for those who do, its crap.3. Not enough ram! The processor is fine, but with 512mb's of ram, backgrounding apps is nearly impossible.4. It doesn't support lolipop. I don't understand why, because if it did it would be so much faster, and it would have more value.So there you have it. Its not perfect. You certainly get your moneys worth, but I wish they would've crammed in more RAM and a better touchscreen to make this a much more useful phone. Its too difficult sometimes. 4
i am not completely satisfied, because the item came withouth headphones, free hand, cover, instructions etc. 3
2nd try at buying a phone and having it activated on my sprint account. Don't know if its the phones or sprint just sucks. Probably the latter, but I'm done with the trying to save money by buying a used phone. 1
It came on time just wouldnt work whit my sims 2
I bought two phones, first I received one of them incomplete... didn`t have the cover. Thought.. ok.. not big deal! But then, I realized nobody heard me when calling... and that I couldn't record voices... so the mic doesn't work!!! I wrote to the seller and was told to reteurn the item to an adress in Florida... another huge inconvenience, I live in Argentina... Overall a bad experience!!!! 2
The cell in very good physical condition and performance.The cable and hub to charge the battery soon not served, sent a message that is not original, so I had to buy these accessories in Ecuador are very expensive and found them worth $ 70. A part of this cell it works perfectly. 3
Overall the phone came very quickly.. Very user friendly. A couple of disappointments ring volume and speakerphone are not loud at all.. Pre installed apps are boring.. Definitely not a galaxy... 3
It's fine but haven't used it much 4
I am here to buy second-hand mobile phones, obviously open, repair, cell phone charge can only use continuously for an hour, most efficiency is 35, the inner problem still don't know how many goods, praise is so much, at the time said looks very new, bought, the screen is definitely not original factory and the screen has a small hole in the middle 1
Doesnt work like its suppose to 2
There is a lot to like about this phone.Pros: beautiful design, huge screen (I have no problem with the pixel count), Android Lollipop, responsive screenCons: speed is not 4G or 4G LTE so I experienced far too many bufferings with the videos. Also, the call quality is a bit low.Overall, I like it, especially at this affordable price, but since I bought a phone of this size so that I could enjoy watching videos, it's a tough deal for me. If you have no problem with the speed, then I would highly recommend the BLU 7.0 II. 3
Ordered 2. Excellent phone but needed to return one because grandaughter decided to keep old phone and they would not let me return because past return date. Will never order from these people again! 1
got iphone after waiting forever for it an couldnt even activate it becasue seller still had it under his or her acount, waste of $$490.00 1
yes my costumer was so very satisfy to yhis unit 5
Need to go to the Apple Store. Technical problems like voice volume of the other person is not audible else it's good 3
Had phone for a kittke over month and went black now won't work 1
Battery power is horrible. Even with all settings set to save power, it rarely makes it through the day. 1
The phone works fine but it came with a charger & a block piece that doesn't work at all 2
This iPad is great!! My son earned this over the summer from working. It arrived earlier than expected in great safe packaging. This product looked great and worked well. We have had absolutely no issues with it since receiving it. We went with the refurbished one of course for the price...but we were not disappointed by the quality in this product one bit. We would recommend this product to anyone looking for an iPad!! 5
Not to good. I had the Blue 6.0 HD. It broke so I went with a cheaper phone plus I love selfies. It is not as good functional wise as the Blu 6.0 but it does take better pictures and have more memory 3
I love this product, I received mine with a bit of scratches on the back of the phone but it works perfectly. 4
My phone came locked. and since i slightly cracked the screen i can't send it back. could someone please unlock this so i can set it up with a carrier. I just spent 100 dollars on a jip. I will not spend anymore money here 1
accurate description, unlocked, sealed box, all was fine.Worldwide distributors were i purchase it, ship it fast and with logic cost. 5
Simply the BEST budget smartphone out there now even better then the Motorola Moto G! This phone is packed with features like tap to wake, Android 5.0.2 a reversible hand set the can be used even upside down and has 4G LTE for all Gsm carries such as T-Mobile and AT&T.. So what are you waiting for a must buy smartphone for 2015! 5
Update December 30th, 2015:* I had to downgrade my rating to a 3 star because after 6 months of usage the phone is noticeably showing wear and tear of being a cheap phone. I had no illusion that the phone would be masterfully constructed at the price point. At this point I can feel that the phone creaks if bent a little bit, and I can see that my screen cover's glue has come off at one edge. To top this off the camera has failed me recently, and I'm in the process of submitting a warranty claim. If that goes well and this are better, then I'll consider bumping the star rating back up to 4 stars....Original Review follows, and all of these things are still true for me. I do really love what this phone got right, its just too bad its not constructed better...Here are a few thing that should make you want this phone:* The Camera app - Alcatel seems to have made their own camera app, and do not use the Android stock app (which if you want you could install from the app store). But this app I feel like is superior to the android one. It does virtually no hunting for focus, and takes photos immediately when you press the shutter button. I feel like this gives the camera a distinctly Apple Iphone feel to it, and have been pleasantly surprised. The Google Camera app does not function as smoothly, and am glad to have an alternative with the Alcatel. Others have commented on the actual camera photo quality itself, which I have not tested, but honestly for my use I'm glad that the app just functions fast.* The phone is pretty much stock android. I put the Google Now Launcher on my phone and the experience is almost exactly the same as my old Nexus 4. There are a few pre-loaded apps, but you can easily remove them. The ones that you can't remove are system apps like the android gallery, and the Mix application which is a music player. Both can be ignored for your applications of choice.With that said, other reviews have done a good job of describing the phone and its pros and cons. I just wanted to add the only reason I can't give it a 5, is that while it is awesome for the price, it still has its drawbacks. It does so many things great, and they got many features totally right. But after using it for 4 or 5 days, I begin to notice the areas where they had to cut corners to get it to the price it is at. These things have been mentioned in other reviews already. With that said. Its amazing how much they do for the price, but they haven't quite hidden the reasons you might want a more expensive phone, in my opinion. If you're already in the market for spending this much, instead of buying something much more expensive, then I can say you should definitely just buy it and try it out. 3
Pretty descent phone. Everything holds up to the specs and it runs good.Only things that I'm not satisfied is the phone sometimes lag just a tiny bit when running a few apps together and I'm pretty sure it's this(mine) phone itself is.. When I play music from it. I only hear one side when a song uses the left and right speakers effects. But when I play it thru a external speaker (IE Bluetooth speaker) I can hear both right and left of songs.. So maybe my speaker on the back of the phone defected. 3
DO NOT buy this phone. Within two weeks of owning it the headphone jack already had a problem and the phone will not charge. When I discovered the headphone jack problem, my left earbud was not working. I tried several pairs of headphones to find that the jack was the problem. I looked up possible ways to solve the problem only to find that I would have to replace the whole lower part of the phone. Secondly, the phone began acting funky yesterday. The phone had been charging for a while and when I checked it, it only said it had been charged up to 8%. I had to turn off my phone and turn it back on to find it was at 40%. And right now it will not charge. It told me that my charger was not a supported accessory. The phone has been plugged in all night and still hasn't charged. I have not tried a different charger yet, but I shouldn't have to. This was a waste of money. I do not blame Apple, because I've bought from them directly before and it was wonderful, but I would not recommend buying from this seller. If you want and IPhone just save up your money and buy directly from Apple. It's worth it. 1
I thought this phone was wonderful initially. However, after only 3 months the screen failed to turn on. Just 30 minutes later, the phone stopped turning on as well. I had never dropped the phone and it had no water damage. During the 3 months when the phone was operating, it also froze very often when I played music from my internal music playlist. 2
The product delivery was fast. I received it 4 days after ordering. Don't be disappointed if the product is slow. For the money its worth and the brand, its not gonna be like a real galaxy or iPhone. The gps is having locating where you are and directions doesnt work. The apps takes a while to load. If you just want basic phone to call in and out and take pictures this phone is good for that. 2
The phone is OK but I seem to be having some problems like the charge doesn't last like it suppose to and it overheats pretty fast other than that if those problems didn't exist it would be a great phone 3
It's used and there is some privete information in it. I can't recover the PIN 2
Phone would not work came on once then cut off wouldn't come bk on after that. My husband phone same different color worked fine. So I sent mine bk for refund and gave it another chance. My new phone works great with no problems. I did put both phones on straight talk bring your own phone plan. I'm using at&t Sims card. So not great service were I live. I plan on changing it over to Verizon soon as I can. So the 3stars is because I had to send one back but the other two phones I have had no problem with. 3
We were told by carrier that phone was locked. It was not. Just had worthless employee at AT&T. Phone is fine and works well. 3
I purchased 2 of these phones in early Dec 2016. Both phones could not be activated by Verizon. Wasted a lot of my time with Verizona customer support. Very angry. 1
Great phone,,but my speakers don't work, I can't hear anything from it without a headset. 3
The phone was delivered on time but the phone did not work at all. Tried multiple chargers and it just wouldn't work. 1
Good phone but tends to drop call too often. You have to either clear all notification or turn phone off and back on avoid call drop. 3
The dealer was fraudulent, claiming that the phone was new in the box. In fact, it was 3 years old, needed a new battery, and had a defective microphone. It cost $150.00 to replace it with a new iPhone 4 from Apple. Apple can tell you the history of the phone by it's serial number. Never buy from this dealer. 1
This phone didn't last 2 months. When I checked to view the return policy, it was only for 30 days. That's not fair. The speaker isn't working and the phone shuts down unexpectedly. I believe this phone was never a new phone!. Buyers beware! 1
love the phone but not the battery. the battery was so damaged and abused that i had to go get it replaced. also, they sent me a nasty otterbox that was beyond the point of no return with how dirty it was. 3
This phone stopped reading the sim card and wouldn't allow me to turn on the WiFi. Also my voice would echo when I placed calls. I took it to my carrier to replace the sim card & it still didn't work, perhaps its just this particular phone from this seller. Because I've ordered the exact phone from other sellers and I didn't have this problem. 2
It works with my T-Mobile SIM card and functions properly I love it 5
I received the iPhone quickly and in GREAT shape. I could not even tell it was used. I would recommend buying a phone here to anyone and would do it again if I need/want too. 5
Thank you , I have received it today in good condition. 4
Mine came fine however my husbands had already been activated on T-Mobile by someone and sent back. Since it doesn't work in my area I have to pay to send their crap back to them. Don't buy. 3
Doesn't have the feel and response of a higher end phone like Samsung or LG 3
I bought it for business, only with the intention of reselling and sold very well, at least in my country do not understand how people would pay so much for a cell how it, well, we must seize! 3
Don't waste your money on this phone. I bought this phone a month ago and I kept getting this blue screen, then it reboots itself over and over again. Doesn't work well with T-Mobile like it said, I tried sending it back but they won't take it back. One month into my iPhone and I'm now looking to buy another phone. 1
I bought this phone because i didnt want to pay the price of an iphone.Now, after a few months of use, the phone is goung crazy...it keeps shutting down when i whatching any video or trying to take a picture or even playing a game like candy crush or smth... It doenst matter how full the battery is...sometimes i have over 90% and it still shuts down. For two times now it also happened that it restarts NON STOP. And nothing i can do to stops it from restarting. It keeps restarting untill the battery dies. 3
Bluetooth kept disconnecting. I was not happy with the number of button clicks needed to do simple things, like review texts. Returned and got a quick refund. 2
Phone acts a little funny here and there. 4
I'm not happy with the iPhone 5. It don't work very well. It also don't let me download certain apps. 1
Decent price for a decent piece of equipment. The camera is not bad, the processor is decent. What absolutely ruins this phone is the ADWARE GARBAGE attached to it.The Adware does NOTHING (because the ads themselves aren't even sized properly you don't even know what's being promoted) but slows up the phone. It pops up every so often in settings, launching aps etc. Additionally having used close to a dozen MTK phones Lenovo did a poor job of altering the android OS. It's hard to use, not configurable and clunky.And finally I cannot figure out how to change the MMS settings to consolidate group texts - a known problem with earlier generation android phones.I think those that have the time (I don't) to root this phone will have a much better experience. In stock software form it's not better than the other Android phones on the market - despite the slightly lower price. 2
It has been working great I would recommend this 5
Bad !!! I had to sent it back 1
Recieved the product in good shape,Thank you. 5
this IPhone4 is very good,just like brand new.with a proper price,and I believe the quality of warehouse deals.hope next coorperation. 5
A good product, I love it. 5
Sucks. Has lots of problems. Acts like its having a seizure all the time. 2
Very nice phone for the price. Its better than my expectations. The only complaint is that doesn't came with a headphone, and i think they can include a screen protector too. 4
Interestingly, the phone actually came with a Verizon simcard though it claims it will not work with Verizon. My from the big apple is model A1532 which is prossibly an verizon unlocked version. I tested it with my H2O prepaid card and it works well though. Hope this help. 4
It's a good phone, especially for being used. My only problem with it is that sometimes the touch screen doesn't respond when it's plugged in/charging, and I did have to replace the charger cable that came with it because it stopped working. 5
I love the phone especially cause its blue but why is Qualcomm Processor device not working if I could figure that out I would keep otherwise I might just return it and go back to being without a phone sadly 3
this is my third phone by Blu they appear to have a charging problem 2
Looks nice, decent sound quality, cant sync with other phones, does not support all characters. 2
Extremely dissatisfied, we received the phone and have had constant issues, we received the blue screen of death multiple times, the phone refuses to charge, randomly shuts off, the screen will become unresponsive. DO NOT BUY YOUR PHONE FROM THESE PEOPLE! 1
The phone I received was not described as in the post. The screen was clearly replaced but not replaced properly making the multi-touch defective in some spots. Also the speaker does not work. Not something I would buy again. 2
The cell phone is a good one but battery is a big problem for me it does not take more than 4 hours after it is fully charged. The battery is a problem and I am thinking of buying another battery but I am not sure whether it will be the same to one I already have. 3
I like my phone especially because of the keypad. The down side is that the phone is not compatible with many apps. The color is a beautiful fire engine red. 4
Speaker phone doesn't work, doesn't hold charge. Took it to Verizon store and they couldn't help. Returning for refund. Disappointed. 1
Complete scam. The only upside was that the phone came very quickly. Other than that, it's charger does not even charge the phone at all. The phone is COMPLETELY useless considering you can not hear anyone on a call or even having them on speakerphone...I don't even mean it's just muffled, I mean their voices are BARELY audible and are morphed and almost sound demonic through our end of the phone. I bought this for my little brother so he can hangout with his friends but still check in with me wherever he goes, but this is completely useless now. Waste of time and money. Do NOT order from this person. Please read the reviews and you'll see how off ALL his/her products are! 1
after a month the phone went blank and is not turning on or holding any charge 2
big keys , easy to text, good speaker phone, lightweight, battery life is good, charges quickly,compact and easy to use 4
Phone works great but I feel like it was a refurbished phone instead of new. Phone case was dirty and inside was full of dust.Overall the phone is working properly and in very good condition. 3
It's big, it's bold and this one is blue. Not much to complain about because everything I dislike about this phone was clearly mentioned in the description so can't say I was unaware.CONS:screen resolutionsystem memoryspeakers (worst of any phone I've ever had) even with earphones/budssize...too bigPROS:battery life (best of any phone I've ever owned)service, despite being only a 3G HSPA phone driving around downtown and going into tunnels I've yet to lose GPS signal which in my book is awesome, service signal is also top notch, I get 2-3 bars in places where people I've been with lose their signal completely.size...I know I know, I also listed this under the cons, but its a double edge sword, on the one hand the immense size can at times be some what inconvenient doesn't fit properly in pants pockets, hard to find cases (that's true with all BLU phones though), but when watching videos on youtube or movies or using the google maps its always good to have a bigger screen so take it for what its worth. I like the phone it does everything other high end phones do at a fraction of the price but don't expect it to perform just as good, for it's price range and size you can't go wrong. 3
This phone works perfectly. I actually bought it for my grandson to watch pbs kids without using our phones. 5
Good! Works great! the box is very simple... And the charger is not a cube like apple 5
Good basic smartphone but doesn't work good with Google search. 3
compared to my htc sensation (yes I know that phone is wayy advanced and the comparison would be unfair) which I destroyed by getting it wet, of course it*s hard for me to give the Iphone 3s a fair review.However, here my review:The Iphone 3 is pretty and has most things you would need in a smart phone.I like the texting, even though sometimes texts especially pictures won*t send and I have to send it over and over- despite having service in the area!service..... yes, sometimes there is no service in an area for no reason. kind of annoying. I always had service with my htc so it is not my service provider. My friend who has the Iphone3 says the same thing.. very annoying.I was spoiled by having a gps tell me when to turn - the iphone 3 comes with a navigation system which is a lifesaver so and so often - but you still have to flip thru the steps manually as you go which can get you a ticket or killed at times.Some of the apps I could get for free for Android I have to pay for now.. bummer.The camera is terrible sadly, no flash, and no front screen camera..However, the phone works, it*s pretty, and if you use your phone mainly for calling and texting and only need the internet at times it works very well. I love the way the voicemails are set up!!!I don*t understand btw why apple makes the front screen from glass! I could drop my htc on concrete ten times a day and not a scratch would be on the screen but now when my Iphone slips my grip I nearly have a heart attack! 3
No headphones or screen protector. 3
i will say it openly, i hated this device. i had my droid, and after many problems, i decided to try my luck and get this. if you hav ever used android devices, coming to this is awful. syncing previous items thru itunes was a pain, and the os simply feels too simple. the device itself felt like it had to be handled carefully otherwise it would break. i will recommend it for someone new to smartphones, or who has never had android before. its a good beginner device, just did not fit my complex needs. 1
Battery won't hold charge otherwise good phone 4
by now it works well except for some abnormal resprings and i will keep using and watching it. By the way, this iphone is sold on 2012/11/28 :( 4
Good phone but battery is dieing really quick 2
works great and no problems with it and I have used it for last several months no problems. 5
this is a great phone! its comes new! I only have one reason to give this 4 stars instead of five bc I had a tiny problem that im sure the seller will fix! buy this phone its great!:) 4
i live in ecuador it works really good works in others cuontries but i need it in spanish so have to download like 3 programs to change it to spanish but i like it 4
The First 😃but the second it was a lie it was used 4
Hello this message is for reporting touting an Iphone like new , and received iphone with detached screen, the screen has a line of liquid in the center and on top of that the device turns off after 30 minutes of use and you have to have it connected to the charger it will not fade._________________________Buenos días, el presente mensaje es para informar que promocionaban un Iphone como nuevo y me llegó un iphone con la pantalla despegada, la pantalla tiene una raya de líquido en el centro y aparte de eso el dispositivo se apaga luego de 30 minutos de uso y hay que tenerlo conectado al cargador para que no se apague. 1
My daughter saved her money all year long to by her own iphone, and when we got it it wouldn't even power on. The battery wouldn't charge. We sent the phone back and they replaced the battery and we thought we were in good shape. Now the ringer switch is causing the phone to vibrate constantly, the speaker doesn't work anymore, and the headphones keep cutting out. We contacted them just over 30 days and now we're stuck with this POS!!! 1
Was just some small chips in the edges of the phone but it worked fine 4
The phone was great but not unlocked and still under contract according to the carrier. Had to send it back 3
Phone was in good condition, but it was described as unlocked and it wasn't 3
Overall this phone is not for me. It has a few great features though. Way to expensive for what you get.It is too small for me and I don't like not being able to delete the apps I do not use.I suggest watching the videos on youtube before you buy one. 2
It's okay. I pay $75 for it and it's about how good I expected to be after reading the reviews. It's doing what I need, which is a phone to call and use apps on temporarily during the short period before I get a better phone. 3
It was cheap, it broke within two weeks. 1
Pretty nice phone. Tried 3 times to switch my number over because I'm with Straight Talk & it kept saying the phone wasn't compatible with Straight talk as it said in the description before I bought the phone. Highly disappointed! 2
My wife and I have been wanting IPhones for a long time. Our Samsung phones bit the dust (pure junk) and we didn't qualify for an upgrade. So I started shopping here and found two new IPhones and cases for less than our service carrier wanted for a single phone. I love Amazon.com, and their sellers!!! 5
It works but it came with missing internal components like screws and metal plates that secure wires. 3
This is a very nice phone, but be aware that the screen is rather fragile. 3 days after getting this for my daughter she dropped it, and the screen completely shattered. She was really happy with the phone up to that point. It's fast, the battery life is great, and she preferred the size of it over her previous Motorola G. It's also very light for having such a sizeable battery in it. These Energy phones from BLU are really nice if you've got app hungry users that aren't always close to an outlet. I would definitely buy this phone again.As an FYI for DIY electronics geeks, there is a site for ordering parts for BLU phones, called bluphoneparts.com. From what I can tell they are not directly affiliated with BLU, and I caution against ordering from them as they are simply not responsive. The screen I bought from them lasted less than 30 days before just failing. I've tried contacting them several times and no one returns phone or email messages, so if you want to repair your own BLU phone, be careful working with these guys. BLU could do a better job of making their phones repairable, too. For the most part it was an easy replacement, but there were a few points where they used glues that were hard to work around. 3
It's not working properly I want to return it 1
I did buy two phones, one arrived with no bone damage was irreparable served 2
For the price you can't beat. Processor slow at times. Battery drains fast. Otherwise excellent phone. 3
Every function on the phone works well however Bluetooth and wireless are broken. Tried several reboots with the software so it must be a hardware issue. Very disappointing. Not worth the $300+ I paid for it. 2
Didnt offer clear and concise instructions on how to put in a sim card. I got bad eyesight so i put in a microsim in the sim slot. Tried to remove it with tweezers now the phone wont power on 1
I just love my iPhone 4S that I use with Tracfone! iPhone came in excellent condition and looked brand new. There was extra time involved with Tracfone but well worth the time to be able to use an iPhone. One suggestion with dealing with Tracfone, if the first Tracfone person you talk to isn't able to help you definitely call back again to get another Tracfone person. First time I called Tracfone the guy, who sounded intelligent but wasn't, told me I couldn't use the phone with Tracfone something to do with Verizon. I called Verizon (Verizon also checked out the phone serial number and said it wasn't stolen) and to call Tracfone back. I was glad I called Tracfone back. Tracfone person I got knew her job, was intelligent, very nice, and very helpful! She spent time on the phone putting in information, getting any problems straightened out, and was nice the whole time. I was willing to put time in with the call and was never at any time impatient. I was told that I'd lose my minutes from my old Tracfone. She was able to get around that. She put in just a few minutes and told me to call back in a few days to get the rest of the minutes if the minutes didn't automatically show up on the iPhone. I called back and yes it did take time but I got all my minutes from my old Tracfone! I live where there is hills and trees and get good reception with the iPhone 4S. Was all the time spent on the phone with Tracfone worth it? YES!! I now have an iPhone and service that doesn't cost and arm and a leg!! Just remember when calling Tracfone if you get someone that doesn't help you or is rude, definitely call back. Tracfone does have excellent personal that actually do know their job and are very nice. So far the phone is working perfectly. 5
For T Mobile customers thinking about purchasing this phone, dont. It is not compatible with T Mobile after the refarm they just completed on their 1900 MHZ spectrum. From what little use the phone got, since it's unusable on the T Mobile network, it seems like a quick phone with fast start up times and shut down. 2
the phone is in great shape and works fine.but having problems getting it switched to straight talk 3
Very good iPhone no problems with it. It was what they said, new in box great delivery time. Very happy with this purchase. 5
I was hesitant buying a refurbished phone. To my surprise, it looked new, for all intents and purposes. There were no noticeable scratches or cuff marks, the home button worked well, as the the mute, volume and power buttons. The touch screen is responsive and I must say that I have been very pleasantly surprised by the quality of this refurbished phone! 5
Great phone. It is hard to use with one hand unless you have very large hands. But using this makes me use my ipad mini less. 4
BlackBerry makes a solid product this product was another in their lineup. It makes a for a good second phone. 4
At first it was great. Then some issues came about kinda quickly. The microphone no longer worked and now the usb port no longer charges. so now i have a wonderful paperweight. Hoorah. 2
I bought three of these phones before,I got case and ear piece this time I did not get a case or an ear piece>The phone looks ok haven't used it Im giving my sister it as a gift 3
Workes as expected. Cosmetically clean, functionally correct. 4
The battery was dead on arrival. No pun intended.Would have appreciated a link indicating the specs for the batteries so that I could have gotten a spare as a backup. 3
I went to sprint service for TWO HOURS so I can activate it and they can't do it because this phone is not for sprint, if I were you I wouldn't buy this phone just save up your money 1
8 g was never big enough. 1
Loved this phone until I tried to use headphones. The head phone Jack won't even register that there are headphones plugged in. 2
This is a great "budget" smartphone, because it's more of Asus's flagship, and it's got a lot of power and storage for the price. In terms of pros, you get a 1080p screen, 4 GB of RAM, 64 GB of storage for only $300, and the performance of the processor (x86 as opposed to the standard ARM in most Android phones) holds up well to some flagships. However, the phone does have a few shortcomings such as a weirdly blue saturated screen calibration (there's a built in app to adjust color levels), mediocre battery life (stems from the Android 5.0 memory leak bug, which Asus will probably fix in the future with an update, and is partially fixed if you use Xposed), and a lot of bloatware (which you can freeze/remove). It does take work to make this a better phone, but the dev community seems to be growing, and Asus also says that they are working on a 5.1 update plus bootloader unlocks which could mean custom ROMs and recoveries in the future (source: Asus forums). 4
The phone is perfect but I did not receive headphones 4
Had to return because it didn't work with my provider. Very quick refund.. 5
After 3 days the screen on this phone stopped working and I'm very pissed off !!!!! There is no way to contact the seller to try another one and send this one back. Now I don't have a phone !! I wasted my money !!! 1
The product arrived incomplete but i did'nt care, it was good quality and works perfectly, I'm really satisfied with the pursache. 3
The phone is REALLY slow. It doesn't have enough internal memory. It frequently freezes up because it just doesn't have enough memory to handle the apps. It's okay, but if I'd known I'd have so many problems with it, I would have bought a different phone. 3
The iPhone 5S is a great device! 4
this phone is perfect! is fast! is strong!with tha ios7 update the iphone is totally new again!the camera is very fast!the sound speakers is great! 5
This is a great battery, I wish they put a little more phone on it though. For the most part it is a very nice device however everything happens in slow motion, and lots of apps have bugs, youtube randomly will not play videos, messaging apps freeze up ect. the data also cuts in and out in a very odd fashion, seems to get good reception however sometimes the phone just refuses to send or receive any data for 20-30 seconds, this probably happens 3-4 times a day at the worst possible times. I have not decided yet however I will probably return it. 3
I had recently lost my old iPhone 5c and was in desperate need for a new phone. I just recieved a used iphone 5c 32gb from Dutchmoney10. Although it did come in ahead of time i am not happy with the condition and further problems that came with this iPhone. The seller neglected to notify that the phone did not come with an "active" sim card which was told to me while i was attempting to set up the new phone through at&t at my house. Now i will have to pay an extra 36 dollars to purchase and activate the new sim card. I don't understand why they would deactivate the previous sim card so that it is completely useless and basically trash and then proceed to not notify me and to make it my problem to dispose of. The product description listed that the phone had a few minor blemishes and scratches on the back but come to find out all four corners are chipped and the back side is is torn up like it was thrown across pavement. also the on/off button is loose and is difficult to press. I am not happy with this seller and the only reason that i will keep this phone is because i am in such dear need for a phone. I will never buy a used phone again and especially not from Dutchmoney10 and i suggest you don't either its deffinitely worth it to splurge a little for something with better quality. 1
Arrived on time - looks just like what the promo stated. 4
Box came a little beaten up but other than that watch was clean worked right out of the box looks brand new 4
Would be 5 Stars except its a T Mobile phone, seller needs to clarify this, other than that the phone is a very good deal for the price. Pictures quality for the price is good, easy to set up and operate. Has a lot of apps that are useful , call quality is good.Overall you cant be the price , If you looking for an inexpensive this one will work well for you, I use Straight Talk and had no problems setting this phone up and its worked beyond expectations based on some of the reviews. You will need to cut down your Standard SIM card for this phone 4
Llego antes de lo esperado el celular, muchas gracias.Recomiendo a este vendedor. . . . . . . . 5
Bought it for my wife, no complaints from her. She says way better than old Acer phone 4
The used Apple iPhone 3GS I ordered from Amazon Warehouse is incredible -- just like new! And it is so far superior to the Motorola Atrix I had. Touch works perfectly -- no accidental strokes, no opening something by mistake. Synced with all my info on computer quickly, so now have ALL contact info including ALL phone #s (not just mobile), addresses, & emails. Also calendar info and notes. I have ATT contract, so just inserted SIM and it was up and running. Shipping was fast. Very pleased with purchase. 5
I had this phone for close to a year. One night of using it , the screen just blanked out on me. No falls or anything it just blanked out on me. The phone however when it worked wasn't a bad phone. Nothing over the top, but it does what it was suppose to considering the cheap price you are paying for it. 2
The phone works. But we are wondering where is the earphone of it? 3
Completely satisfied !!!!!! Great phone. Got the delivery on time. I recommend this seller. 5
Just as described and got it sooner than expected, couldn't be more happy 5
Phone is just as expected. No problems. 5
id like to purchase another one but blackberry doesnt support a lot of app..but it ok it works very fast 4
Sold as new, but I don't think it was. The key to open the sim card slot was missing and there was already a sim card in the phone. Otherwise, all is working well. 2
me llego en el momento esperado, tiene buena señal, caracteristicas, lo unico es que tengo problemas cuando se realizan llamadas se escucha cortado, sin embargo, es bueno y sirve en Venezuela para las lineas Movistar y Movilnet perfectamente con 3G para digitel solo funciona EDGE. 4
I just received the Blu Energy X plus yesterday, so I may update later. So far, I am satisfied with the phone, it is well worth the $125 I paid for it.Pros:- nice large screen, great definition (no iPhone 6 but still HD)- Android Lollipop is much nicer than the previous KitKat 4.4- Battery life is great, though not as good as its predecessor Blu Energy.- Given the screen size, this phone is surprizingly light -- lighter than both the original Blu Energy and iPhone 6 plus.Cons:Only 1 G of RAM, sometimes it's a bit choppy but decent performance.I like Lollipop but hate the the "colorful" icons. I recommend downloading Zero Launcher, much nicer icons. Or any other launcher, lots of free launchers out there.There isn't any decent case for the BLU Energy X Plus... yet, but hopefully Amazon will market one soon.I will update this in a week or two if there are any issues.Update: the screen size is 5.5 inches, but the actual display on most apps is only 5": There is a black bar on the bottom of the screen, so in reality the screen size is not much larger that its predecessor, Blu Studio Energy -- I feel cheated! 3
Works great! Good price and came on time. My teen is happy 5
Came on time but the charger did not work and did not come with headphones or any manuals. It also did not come with the little key to open the sim slot 3
Well, I will first say that when I bought this phone I was very excited bit the more I use it the more I dislike it. I like the fact it has a big screen but it freezes time to time. It doesn't hold a charge like it was suppose to but over all I like the phone. 2
It is a good phone 5
The phone is good, but somehow it was not what I wanted. Cosmos Wireless worked with me without getting angry, obnoxious or demanding. I did end up buying another phone from them. It's not the product, it's me. I guess I am so much into my old phone, no other one can compare! 4
I bought this phone for my wife bc it looks really cool bc it's not your every day generic color like all the others , and it's big, but if u wanna have apps or anything for that matter don't buy bc it only has about 2 gigs to work with that's just awful and worthless , and processor speed isn't great either, but if u just text n call lol this is great, shipping was fast tho and came with a case and screen protector 3
The microphone has stop working after 2 months of owning the phone. Contacted blu 3 times and no reply. Don't buy the phone you will be disappointed. 2
Ended up not being able to use it on my plan, but very fast shipping and very nice phone. 5
The phone meets everything I need it to do for a great price. 5
I really love the phone but I wish it wouldn't crash constantly 4
The iPhone itself appeared to be near new. However, the sim tool and ear buds were missing, even though the copy clear states that all original accessories were included. Vendor will not provide. 2
Everything came as ordered and worked great 5
First of all, I hate when there are a bunch of great reviews from people who received the phone for free to give a review. I wish Amazon would NOT allow this.As for the phone - I want to start by saying that I don't need a super charged ultra special high functionality smartphone. I HAD a Samsung Galaxy S4 and didn't think it was worth the money since I don't really stream things and I just use it for calls, texting, pictures, and emails.I'm not a techie, but I'm also not naïve about technology. I knew I was getting a subpar phone for $100.The Good:1) The camera is really amazing. It put the camera on my Samsung Galaxy S4 to shame. Especially the front facing camera. I LOVED the quality of these pictures. FANTASTIC! Beautiful, clear, detailed, high quality pictures for a $100 phone. I spent $500 on my Galaxy S4 and it paled in comparison.2) The size and weight of the phone was perfect. Very light, very thin, and fir very well in my hand. I have shorter fingers and have a hard time with phones that are too wide. This phone was PERFECT for my hands.3) Love the color options. I ordered Pink and it was super cute.4) Speed was fine, not issues at all for what I was doing. Lots of the features that the S4 had.5) Dual Sim card slots is a great option.The Bad:1) States that you can use up to a 32 GB micro SD card, and I put mine in. However the phone couldn't read ANY of my files from the card. I couldn't listen to my music, pull up my ring tones, or see my photos. I searched and searched the BLU website/support, online, and the manual on the phone that links to their website and there was no troubleshooting help listed. I tried downloading different apps that might allow me to see the files and nothing. I don't know if it was a defective phone, or if the phone just doesn't read certain types of files, but if that is the case, this needs to be laid our VERY specifically for people when they are purchasing. This was a deal breaker for me.2) When I would talk on the phone via the handset, attach the wired headset that comes with the phone, AND use the Bluetooth headset that I have used for a while, my calls all appeared to be clear and sound great, but the people I was talking to said that I continued to intermittently fade out and sound "blurry". This is without moving around and in the same service area as I have been in before with no issues and have not had issues since I stopped using the phone. So must be the phone.3) when talking on the handset, the screen goes crazy. It doesn't black out. You have to physically turn it off otherwise your call might be placed on hold, hung up on, or random apps might open. This hasn't happened to me with other phones, so it's not like I'm a phone idiot.I really had high hopes for this phone as my low cost, low expectation phone. And the Good ALMOST outweighed the bad. Almost. I am returning the phone because of the issues with quality of calls and the SD card issues. Too bad, because it otherwise seemed like the perfect phone for me. 3
The phone looks good for it's price point, but it is kind of tiny.The bad thing about this phone is it has very choppy communication. It drops the voice every few seconds. The line isn't disconnected, but the voice between the conversation just disappears and comes back. Forcing the need to constantly repeat oneself. 2
I received my phone on time, but, the phone has noticeable pixels that are moving on the bottom constantly. As if the phone had been broken at some point. Also, there was a circle of dim light cutting off the corners on my screen fully around the screen. Also, I had it brought to tmobile and found out that it was unlocked so that was a plus. THE WORST PART OF ALL WAS... I wasn't allowed to call people, my phone eventually after four months it stopped letting me call people. Another unfortunate error was that I couldn't send pictures to someone who didn't have an iPhone. So overall, you are better off saving your money and looking for a better seller, or goto an actual phone store. You really can't trust people online. 2
Why if i have enough money at my credit card i cant to buy itcan someone helpme please 3
It came like brand new from the store! My daughter was sooo excited. I would of never expected it to be in perfect condition and so easy to set up :) 5
it's locked to sprint, which is not clearly described. 2
bluetooth doesnt workits a tad glitchy now and thencharging is a tad spotty and slow at timesit can get really laggybut i can live with all these things; it was a great price! 4
The phone works pretty well and has a wealth of features, however.It has some quirks that were for me too cumbersome to overcome.In the case of answering the phone on incoming calls, it popped up a menu, of answer later, leave a message and so on with no way to answer the call.If that menu did not rear it's ugly head and you swiped to answer any direction except for the one very limited swipe it would hang up.If this were solved this would be a great phone. 3
it sucks and i will never buy a phone on amazon again it freeze a lot it doesn't s work you can hear it was ringing. I do not recommend it this person. 1
Glad I bought this on the Marketplace as I returned the first one. 2nd try worked out. 4
So far...so good! I was really impressed that it looked brand new! 4
It works great and I love it.... 5
excellent product in perfect condition 5
Unfortunately I had to return it because it was defective. Very disappointed!This is the first time I receive an item in poor condition. 1
Extremely disappointed that this was received the first part of September and the screen is literally falling out of the phone. I've never seen anything like it before. My son saved his hard earned money to buy this product and not even 3 months later it is junk. Hope to find someone that can help us to get it fixed. :(Just took the phone to get fixed today and found out the phone is total junk! The battery is swollen and ready to explode. The parts inside were broke and some screws were missing. I watched the man open the phone and was in total shock! I can't believe we were scammed so badly. This was NOT a new phone! 1
At times, I do not get complaints from the other end of the line. BUT often, the other person says that they cannot understand me. Happening more and more often with the age of the phone. THE ROCK, was not the right way to go. I previously owned a GzOne Boulder and loved it, with no problems. My other family members still have Boulders after years of use, still going strong with no complaints. 2
The biggest problem I had with the phone is that I couldn't tether it to my computer. My computer insisted the thing did not have a driver, but I wasted what seemed like the entire weekend trying to find a solution. I tried downloading drivers, but to no avail. The second problem is Blu's technical support. I called the company Monday morning twice. It seemed that all they could recite were general "fix-its" that didn't work, instead of addressing the specific issue. I had to return it. Beautiful screen but it had a serious glitch. 2
I'm really happy with my purchase. The phone is working great. I've had it for about a month now and no problems with it. I'm really happy. 5
WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THE IPHONE IS UNLOCKED ? I AM FROM VENEZUELA AND ME KNOW IF I WANT MY COUNTRY IS IN GOOD BUY IT NOW SO I HOPE YOUR ANSWER THANK YOU! 5
Just received the phone, and there is no converter included for non-U.S. outlets, though it is pictured in the product information. Nor is there a packing list, either online or with the product. And (ironically) there seems to be no way to make a phone call to inquire, so let the buyer beware. If you are buying this for use abroad, get yourself a converter. 4
Good for the price. Phone constantly restart and random shut off. when use headphone jack can some time freeze phone. It claim to have 4gb but it is actually 2gb internal and 2gb external, which mean if you use SD card, you lost 2gb. There is no way to combine to 4gb. Hardly have any memory for app. Even with SD card is no help because app still use internal space. If you take 2gb minus Android, you have less than 1gb. Phone wouldn't let you install anything when you have less than 400mb.Edit: Forgot to mention. Screen doesn't respond touch when there is any water on top. I had iPhone before which still take touch with water on screen. People told me they had a hard time listening my voice. I had had to speak very loud, so they can hear me. 2
Very poor phone waste of time! 2
This was my second phone from this seller. Both exactly as described. Fast shipping. GREAT!!! 5
Ok I bought this iPhone now I can't activate it I am desipointed . I need this unlock now they say that there is no unlock code for this phone .pls if u are buying an iPhone make sure it is unlock this was s wast of my time and money. I am KENDAL HANNA a dissatisfied customer 1
All I can say is that this is a great product and works propertly. It arrived on time! I am so happy with this purchase. 4
It was cheap, it broke within two weeks. 1
I bought 2 iphones..one was ok..the other was not unlocked, i sended it to my country and it doesn't work..so now what?i lost my 💰?..because i can't see any option to return the phone 1
This is a nice enough phone. The screen is big and clear. It is easy to use. The only problem I have with it is that it turns it self off all the time for no reason, even in the middle of a call. Very frustrating. This phone also has a tendancy to freeze up..... other than that...not a bad phone 3
I have had my certified refurbished Unlocked iPhone 6s Plus 128GB for about two weeks now and am very pleased. The phone arrived quickly and came in a plain white box with a charger (no headphones, but I didn't expect any). I almost returned it because it was labeled a "Verizon" iPhone, but I popped in my AT&T sim card and it worked like a charm (LTE worked too). The back of the phone was flawless, but I noticed some minor scratches on the screen. They are not noticeable when the screen is on, so it doesn't bother me. Plus I knew I was getting a refurbished phone and not a brand new one, so the scratches didn't surprise me too much. The battery life on the phone so far is fantastic. I am able to go two days without charging my phone. I was worried about the battery being in poor shape, but it is working great. If you're on the fence about buying one of these certified refurbished phones, I say go for it. The price is great. Just don't expect a spotless phone. Anyone who looks at my iPhone does not notice the scratches and thinks it is brand new. It is only when you get up really close and examine the screen that you notice minor scratches. 4
It was in a extremely wonderful working condition, and exceed my expectation. Awesome! 5
It was bad thing,the screen was brokenI don't know if I am going to shop online anymore 😭😭😭😭 1
nice phone. The only problem is the memory space 4
Came just as promised, like new, although the charger it came with did not function 5
I loved it , til I lost it a week after getting it ! 😖 5
It's an old model, next iOS 8 won't work on it. But it works properly. Iphone doesn't come with radio. 3
Absoutley wonderful quick service no problems!!! 5
Did not work in my area so be sure to check before purchasing. It said it would work but did not. Could not even activate. 3
The iphone cycled upon purchase, so I upgraded to the latest iOS. After that, the Wifi was grayed out so we couldn't actually turn it on or off. Turns out, tons of people have this problem. Returned it. 1
Came in as hoped for, timely all working conditions met Thanks folks 5
Not in "very good" condition like I thought I was buying. There were dents and scratches all over the phone. 2
It was listed as unlocked. I live out of the country most of the year and need to have ability to change chips. It came locked and would not function. I did not know that until I had left the US. My local international carrier wants to charge me an additiona $120 to unlock it. It was a gift for my husband and he is irritated with me!!! 1
I bought this phone for my mother in hopes that it would be better than her previous one. The phone is very slow with responding and sometimes it makes calls on its own. I'm not sure if that's the phone or the carrier's fault. The color is nice and all but I don't think i'll be buying again 3
My phone came with the screen was nasty with hand prints on it & the charger was broke. Not to mention 2 of my letters won't work when I'm typing & the screen sometimes move up & down by iyself 2
the phone was mostly good, it came little early which was awesome, however after a few days of using the phone i noticed a glitch. The front speaker, that is used to talk on the phone to hear the other person speaking, is very iffy. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't, when it doesn't work the only way i can talk to people is by putting it in speaker mode otherwise I can't hear them. I am debating on whether to contact the seller or just ask for a refund. As for the phone itself, it tends to lag from time to time, not sure if its the 2gb ram at fault or the cpu being used or something but out of the box it lags. Other than that i would recommend this phone to people on a budget. If I get a replacement i will update this review. 2
I bought this for the 5.5 screen and the 4000 battery, I was looking forward to having a affordable phone with good specs and long battery life. The device looks very good with golden metal finish it has a high end look, but I have to say while battery performance has matched my expectations the screen has not. Yes it HD so it looks sharp and clear but the image rendering is somewhat flat and lacks luster, with no options to adjust anything but brightness u can not adjust contrast level or saturation, since I am a photographer and like to show my work on my phone occasionally this is a problem, the pics look flat the shadows are not deep, colors don't pop and skin tones are not so pleasing color rendering and white balance seem off. And this is in comparison to similar price point devices I have such as Posh Titan E600A or idroid Royal V7 (which is actually lower res screen). Also running benchmark on it I found 3D and RAM performance low, again my posh device preformed better and got higher total scores.UPDATE: bluetooth connectivity is choppy with some devices, it skips compated to my other devices/phones. Also touch screen responsiveness is either under sensitive or slow at times and other times flikery... Blu please upgrade screen quality, increase and improve RAM size and internal storage size and u will have amazing phone that will preform in a way that matches the high end look of the device... I would pay an extra 50 for such upgrades! 3
Cheap phone, you get what you paid for... 3
The iphone came in on time and was in good working condition , still going good after 2 months. I will upgrade to 5 stars after 1 year.Jay 4
I am an old Blackberry fan. Bought it mainly for the keyboard and former user-friendly software of the Curve and Bold series. Very good hardware quality including battery but camera is just ok. I wonder why have the programmers made it so complicated? They should improve on the former software, not change it so much. Main criticisms: the name you search for a call or sms stays in that window until you delete it. Irritating. It takes 3 steps to create a new contact from a phone number. It used to be one. You can't make the photos smaller in kbytes to share them via mail, wapp or twitter. I do hope software updates improve some complicated steps and make this otherwise good and unique phone more user-friendly. Wish the best to the Blackberry team. Keep going! 4
The best audio, the most vivid colors, fast enough, altough average camera (i didn't expect much about this last point because of the comments i read before i bought it). 5
Wow I bought this almost two years ago, it works like a gem but the housing was damage easily but that's a small issue 3
Phone is great condition and working order as described. No issues at all with purchase, very pleased overall with phone. 5
I was told that this iPhone would work with the Verizon network, but it is for AT&T instead. Otherwise I would love it because the seller was really accommodating and the price was great. 4
Great seller. Very good item description including photos of actual phone being purchased. Kudos! Keep up the great work. 5
Dose not get very good service 2
good pruduct , but he brought a defect in the Q key 3
The phone was in good condition as described by the seller. The only problem I experienced was that I had difficulty with it the Wi-Fi and the screws to open the phone were stripped. 4
Very useless "smartwatch." Would consider saving a little more and buying something more like a real smart watch. I used it for about a week and decided to storage it forever. Also headset wire was broken. Think twice before getting it! 2
Great! No issues. Good product. Received with 2 tiny scratches...everything else is perfect. 5
It's an awesome phone . Love it very much 4
unloucked cell phone work in Libya networks. 4
so i ordered this phone and i love everything about it i did have to send my first one back due to te internal storeage wasnt what was stated so they shipped me another one and the box arrived empty i did however i did end up etting another one and i now have one ordered for my aunt the photo quality is amazing its a nice big screen i cant do screen shots thou but other then that i love this phone 3
I bought this phone originally for myself and the phone itself it great but it didn't come with a new SIM card so I had to buy a kit. That was my only qualm with this phone. The color is cute and the size is perfect; I love the new chargers, I got this phone after having an iPhone 4 and the charger was always breaking on me so this was a nice change. As paranoid as I am about dropping iPhones ( since I had a iPhone 4) I did drop this a few times before I could get a case and was pleasantly surprised that the screen held up! One thing I dislike about Apple products is the headphones, they are way too big for my ears and don't have good connectivity so I never use them and I feel as if they're going to waste! I did pass this phone onto my mother for an upgrade but I was also surprised when my mother ( a 50 year old non- tech savvy woman) came to me and told me she loved it as well! She found some of the apps to be too much but after she got the hang of how everything worked she really enjoyed it. She very much loves to use the FaceTime option. 4
It's nice to look at but too difficult to use , I only use it for the time by using an old sim card 2
If I could've gave it 0 stars I would have!!!! Awful phone!!! Never by from this seller again!! Phone is not up to USA standards. Maybe good across seas. But not what we're use to. 1
I had read many good reviews about the BLU products, that I should be able to put my sim card in and go.... so I bought this phone for my daughter, her first cell phone. It would have been perfect for her, the size and feel of it was pretty good for an inexpensive smartphone. However, right from the outset, we had problems. It had two sim slots but when we put in the sim, the phone would not recognize it in either of the slots. After trying numerous times, and taking it to our carrier, it eventually worked. The next problem was that although we have a data plan and there were signal bars showing, we were not able to get onto the internet unless we were using wifi. I went back to my carrier who made sure we had the correct ndo codes, still no joy. They called customer service to check on the signal, they said all was fine their end. I even called BLU, who couldn't figure out what was wrong. Eventually we got it working, but later that day it stopped working unless we were in a wifi zone again. I read online that because this phone is only is 3G capable I may continue to have this problem. By this time, I was over it, so I sent it back. I am ordering another BLU phone, a little more expensive and with better specs (LTE/4G) and hopefully this will work OK. If not, it's bye bye BLU!! I'm trying to be optimistic because I do like their phones (and the prices!!) 2
each used iPhone on Amazon will be different. Hard to tell which one you will get , in terms of batter life and wear and tear. Good luck! 4
I bought the iPhone 6 Gold 64GB from Wireless Warehouse. It was said to be in excellent condition I picked it up for about $400. I get the phone, overall it was in good condition. It had one little ding on the bottom right nothing too noticeable. After using it for about 2 days I noticed the battery life was absolutely dreadful. Luckily, the firmware was on 9.3.3 so it could be jailbroken. I jailbroke the iPhone I downloaded a tweak to give me information about my battery life it's at ~40-60% capacity it likes to jump around, it had over 800 charges. The iPhone was used a lot I could tell. So I am going to order an external battery and take apart the phone. Now if anyone else has a bad battery and they need to switch it out I recommend you go with extreme caution. If you're not comfortable with doing it then I highly recommend you don't do it. If you can pay apple their fee (which I think is roughly $100) then I would do that. However, I don't really feel apple should get $100 for a battery you can pick up for $20. But again I am fairly comfortable with taking apart my phone. Overall I am happy about the phone I will update later once I order the battery and get it put in. 4
phone in good shape but battery very weak. 3
If they put a quad-core in that phone, it would be a good deal; but, as is, it's too slow. Rather than seconds to connect to a website, we're talking minutes and it was not uncommon to have the connection time-out before it was secured. Other than that, itwas just too big and cumbersome to truly be mobile. Using it at home would be fine, but for me, carrying it around was too inconvenient. 3
The mobile does not work. Inicially, we were able to configure and download prior backup. Mobile were not connecting with Apple server. After all day trying and updating the IOS, we did it. Now, the touch screen is not working. I have checked in one mobile repair store close from hotel and they have mentioned that this mobile is refurbished. I have bougth as NEW mobile. I bougth other mobiles from AMAZON and this was my first frustating experience with this!! I WOULD NEVER BUY FROM THIS SELLER..I HAVE CHECKEDNIN ANOTHER APPLE MOBILE REPAIR STORE AND IT IA CONFIRMED: MOBILE DOES NOT HAVE FIX. Even if we pay usd99 to change the screen, it Will solve. It is a tecnológic problem in hardware. 1
Phone works great but was a hassle due to not being factory unlocked as it was stated online. It was still locked with T-Mobile and AT&T charged me 100.00 to unlock it and switch it to at&t network. 3
While phone has plenty of good features I was not happy with sound which is what any phone is about.Inner speaker has high level of distortions at any level of volume in both FM and phone mode.I checked it with another person who expressed similar opinion.Sound is OK only if headset could be used but it is not about phone mode.I'm in the process of returning this item to Amazon 2
If the phone goes dead when I turn it back on, my organized screens are messed up so I have to move the apps back to their spots. I also ran out of room so I added a memory card. my husband was not able to add my pictures to the memory card, so he backed everything up, and did a factory reset to see if everything he backed up would be on the sd card, but nope my pictures are gone while my apps were still on there, what gives????? Not happy, even though i only had the phone for a week it had pictures of my family who were visiting from Germany. I tried putting them on my computer but it wouldn't let me, and i couldn't put them on any social media, as my brothers does not allow pictures of his girls on there, so now they are gone!!!! The phone also will rarely charge, when it does it takes over 7 hours OFF and when turned on is still only at 70%, it will also not hold a charge, it goes from charged to dead within minutes!!! 2
Did not meet its hype. Had to be reloaded. And still has issue. Not pleased at all 3
I just get it to used out of the country 5
The description does not state the screen size for this version is 5.2 inches and will not fit in any of the 5.5 inch cases sold in the USA. DO not buy this. No way to find a 5.2 case in US. Dimension information is missing for most cases even if it states it fits your model phone. No way to call a vendor to get info before purchase of a case. Not good if you think you might drop your phone. Ever. 2
Battery is faulty. Dealfinder was great at communicating, and did offer me the 30 day return option, but I had waited so long to get the phone that I've decided to purchase a replacement battery and replace it on my own. Phone works great besides the bad battery. 4
I ordered the phone as a bday gift for my son. It got here on time but the battery in the phone was defective. The phone would die completely if the phone's battery reached half-life. I contact the company to get a battery. Living overseas it is not easy replacing a battery for this model and when I purchased it I thought I was purchasing a "working" iphone. That was four months ago with no response from the company. Last week the phone did one better, it stopped charging completely and the touch screen literally exploded from the inside out. Although this phone has been in a draw in a protective case for a month when my son was no longer grounded we gave it back to him the touch screen as completely disconnected itself from the phone while the body of the phone was still in the protective case. My son tried to press the screen back into the body of the phone and then the screen cracked. This was a waste of money and time he never got a full months use out of the thing, we were better off just buying him a cheap prepaid phone at least it would have worked. 1
It says this phone is none CDMA compatible so why did it come with a Verizon sim card ?? 1
Did not come in the original box, it was in a plastic box. Came with a 3rd party charger and cable. iPhone had a sticker on the back. However it did boot up and is operational. Should state that it was not going to be in the original box and not have the original 3
Phone works fine, just the time and date keeps resetting on it's own when I go to recharge or turn it off and on. 2
Came on time and has worked fine so far. 4
Arrived on time in excellent condition! Thank you so much! I would definitely purchase again! 5
Works great! Love it! Can't get enough of it! Make me wanna slap my mamma with it! It's so good! 5
This phone was not working when we received. Keypad wouldn't work on and off. 1
Nice phone in excellant condition. It looked brand new. It just wasnt a Verizon phone like the description on amazon said. 3
Excellent Pricing. But the whole process is very slow. Ordered on 10th , got it on 19th. I did not use it , by the looks of , its very good. I tested using an AT&T sim , its working fine. I bought this as a gift (international) . When i gift it, then will update how good or bad its working. For Price and meeting the description , the seller deserves 4 stars. I cut one star so that they improve the time to deliver. 4
not liked, because the language is in mandarin or HK also I cannot downland any apps from android stores. 2
battery was no good, plus it would do weird things while using it, would freeze up, and the screen, which must have been replaced was not attached properly, must have got the lemon!! 1
The phone seriously lagged and it was hard to touch the screen without another application popping on the screen. 3
Very good iPhone no problems with it. It was what they said, new in box great delivery time. Very happy with this purchase. 5
They say is new but is use ítem 1
Not worth the extra money, the regular 6.0 is just as good 3
Pluses:Price: about $100 (can't believe this much phone for the money)Display: 1080P while it's not AMOLED, really pretty for the $Sound: stereo speakers rock. Easily the best sound I've ever heard from a phone. While it's not loud enough for a large party, it is great for at home listening.Camera: 13MP camera takes good pictures. Low light is not excellent but, again, for the price, very nice.Expandable memory: Has a double slot for Sim and micro SD card. Even my Moto X didn't do that.Battery: Makes it through the whole day with moderately heavy use. You can kill it if you try hard enough but I usually have half a charge left after a long day.Minuses: There appears to be no way to stop "full battery" notifications. If you have it by your bed at night, it is annoying to be notified of a full battery at 3AM.Speed: While adequate, there is some lag with multiple applications open. To me, just mildly irritating but this might be a deal breaker for power users. 5
Excellent Condition Better Than Expected! 5
Seemed just like new. Works fine and a great value! Check here first if you need a new phone! 5
el tlf esta muy bien y funciona aca en vzla bien lo unico es un detalle en la pantalla 2 manchas muy pequeñas..contenido tlf, cargador de pared, cargado del carro,y bateria..l tlf lo pedi refurbished 4
Have it return the phone because Verizon' Fraud Department says the SIM card is no good. Not a Verizon phone. 1
No headphones or screen protector. 3
Got a side scratched product with a replaced back-case. It is a Verizon unlocked device and has so far functioned quite well. Not exactly new-looking and new-functioning. I guess refurbished comes with it's own descriptions.UPDATE: 1 month using the phone and just 2 days done with my return window. The phone has started dying out on battery. I would recommend you run diagnostics through some app immediately after you get this or this is a piece of junk packed in a new clothes. 1
can't set phone to buss and let you know there is a call and then speak on phone you have to talk on watch other parts work fine 2
Working very well. Came with a few scratches,but no biggie, only thing is that the description said the glass was perfect, but it was lifted on the side a bit near the power button, but I can deal, and like I said works great! 4
The phone does work properly for the most part. The bluetooth does not function which does not allow me to connect to hands free devices, but all other functions work properly. There were more scratches and dings than I expected, but the previous owner did say there were signs of usage. Thankfully, there were no scratches on the touch screen. 3
brand new,but the apple logo stickers wasn't in the box. 4
The phone died after just over 30 days, retuned to distributor at a cost to me, awaiting a fix or refund 1
The phone was a good phone, but now it doesn't start. Only appear the message BLU products. And nothing happens. Sometimes start, and sometimes doesn't start. At all is a good phone, but now has this problem. 2
It's an amazing phoneWaterproof is a thing that I've been waited a lot forI really recommend it for all apple lovers 4
Ordered this IPhone 5c as a gift. Out of the box it was locked with a Indiana phone number. I brought it to an Apple Store, where they found the phone defective. Luckily they gave me a brand new phone without a hassle. 2
Workes as expected. Cosmetically clean, functionally correct. 4
I purchased this phone for use overseas, only to learn AFTER I received it that there wasn't a GSM Chip Slot. I currently use an iPhone 4 and it does have the GSM Slot, I had no idea the newer ones or from Verizon did not.I will now have to try and sell this item and get one GSM ready.Gary 3
well I've been using this iphone for 10days now no issues occured on my phone, I did managed to get it factory ulnocked ^_^ 5
The device is really impressive for the price. The only thing I would point out is the charging takes too long (around 3 hours to be fully charged). 4
The phone worked. However, it would not connect to the Microsoft Band 3
The watch is a joke don't buy it at all please save your money and buy something else 2
not a good experience, i can not return it 1
I really liked it ..it's said it had some scratches but when I got it.it had 0 scratches and in perfect condition. 5
Loved the phone, but after 3months or less it just shut off for no reason and I can't get it back on 3
Awfull iphone came with broken battery i have to replace it. Such a scame! Unfortunaly i waste the money And i cant return because im Out of usa.I always shop in amazon but this was so dessapoitend 1
This phone is ok, however has many issues. I actually believe this phone was sent to me used as keyboard is horrible, camera is even worse. For a 13mp camera it operates as a 2mp camera. Takes forever to type as the keyboard isn't up to par either. Lots of issues and probably returning. My old Samsung S3 was tons better and also LTE works with it. LTE does not work with this phone after hours on the phone with straight talk and BLU. Blu reps are horrible and straight talk told me LTE does not work with this phone. 2
Just received it. Completely awesome! 5
Love it!!! Better than iphone 5 😉 5
Items as described.. fast shipping ..very happy thanks... 5
I hate my money I need you deceived me and sent me a mobile does not work 1
Had a few more scratches than anticipated but still a great buy. 4
Shipped fast, packaged with ear buds, and power cord plus wall adapter. Looks beautiful, no nicks or scrape and functions great. 5
Didn't know that had to get a whole new number for the watch instead of using the number already have 2
It is remarkable how bad this phone is after only 4 months of use. The pros are it does all the basic stuff your standard smart phone should. Nothing flashy or great, just average to good.But here is where this phone goes from "ok" to "worthless":- Randomly shuts down or restarts for no reason. Sometimes in the middle if using an app or or phone call- shuts down and won't restart without removing and replacing battery pack- camera is so bad it cannot take a picture that isn't blurry- call quality is only slightly better than a pay phone in rural Uganda- key pad is laggy and frequently unresponsive while texting or typing- the body and structure of the phone is 80% plastic making it flimsy and brittleIf you need a phone to get you by for a few months till your upgrade is available, this phone is ok. If you are looking for a long term upgrade, this phone is worthless. 2
horrible service phone does not work is locked 1
Got the package and was surprised that the iphone had no scratches. It really looked new! The phone plan set up was virtually effortless; it was very easy, and all of the functions were exceptional. I am satisfied with this purchase. 5
No es confiable este proveedor de celulares, debido a que me fue enviado un celular Iphone como nuevo y fue vendido en el ano 2010 a otra persona, o sea era basura. Fui directamente a una tienda apple en Florida porque nunca sirvio y resulto ser que estaba fuera de garantia. Gracias a apple tengo un iphone 1
Perfect phone! Only down fall was that I wasn't aware you had to go to sprint to get a SIM card, so that was awkward Christmas morning! But overall great experience. 4
Phone works awesome but to bad ir does not have that much internal memory 3
this phone says that it is new but it is not.......... 1
Very good phone! Works well! 5
Came on time loved it looks even bigger than expected...having turned it on as yet but I'm blown over thought it would have looked bad....only thing I wish it came with the headphone and manual that wud a have been a plus buuuuttttt love love love my new iPhone thanks amazon love yah....... 5
So far so good.It was purchased for my daughter she uses metro pcs and the phone has been fine. 4
at first it work really well, but after a few days it started to cut off during calls, txting and down loading...so far in the last 5 days it has not cut off 3
Good phone, but it is locked to TMobile network and I had couple problems with them, their service is not the greatest. 4
The speakers isn't workingI wanna fixI don't know if I should send it back 1
I ordered this since it is mentioned Unlocked. I ordered this to use outside US. Unfortunately 3G is not supported there so I'm stuck with this phone only having EDGE. My recommendation is, if anyone intention to use this outside US please check that country 3G bands and make sure it is matching with the one mentioned in this phone. (4G HSPA+ up to 21Mbps 850/1700/1900) So I've no use this phone now and can't be returned also. 2
Purchased this for my mom. She loves it.. came when promised. Arrived in immaculate condition. Flawless.. unlocked as promised, everything works no issues, for $150 best iphone 5 u will get. . Charger included. No complaints 5
Great phone, works perfectly. It has a fast operating system, and I have had it for about a month and never had an issue with it. 5
The phone itself is great, but it was missing a couple of items that supposedly came in the box. 3
Very loud when listening to music which was fine. Without a case the sides of phone starts to chip away very easily. Poor quality when taking pictures. It has a nice appearance if you're on a budget & need a phone more up to date phone..versus a track phone that is. 3
The phone is good but is having glitches 3
Phone will not stay charged and when you to plug in to recharge it takes forever, what is up with a phone with a battery that runs out every 3 hours? 2
Had water damage, got screwed! 1
Bought this phone a couple months ago. Yesterday went to the apple (I bought the apple protection plan) because the screen wasnt working amnd they told me that it was not apple screws in the phone so it couldnt have been new when you bought it...im so pissed that I was lied to and noww have a phone that is broken. Please contact me about this issue. 1
I'm really enjoying my iPhone 5 5
A great value for a wonderful phone. 5
I had to send it back bc it didn't work what they say it does 2
Excellent product if it meets the description of the product. 5
So I was on iTunes the ither day and I connected my phone to download music and I found out that they sold me a 16GB!!! And I paid $213. 2
I never had any experience with Blackberry, I usually try to find most bang for buck products, so was attracted to this phone as a entry into something other than Android based phones, as I have been less than happy about the constant upgrading and obsoleting of the google dominated platform. I am old school, (and older age as well), and get frustrated having upgrades constantly forced on me, and having things that work fine for me no longer being supported; my gripes are the same about Microsoft; monopolies are just no good. Back on track---The phone was OK in build quality, basic, not cheap, but definitely, entry level, somewhat plastic-e feeling and lighter weight.The OS being new to me was a bit overwhelming, but seems loaded with functionality, perhaps too much just for casual use?Anyway everything all tolled, I decided to return the phone, it just did not seem to fit me.Now a twist, and a recommendation- If you are considering this phone, stop and seriously consider spending the extra and get a Q10 instead.Under normal circumstances I would consider the Q10 out of my price range while it is in reality still reasonably priced, I'm just a cheapskate whenever I can be, but I think here is a classic case of you get what you pay for.I stumbled into a great deal on a Q10 so figured "what the hey"!The Q10 is a completely higher lever, (coach to fist class upgrade style), It feels solid, hefty, and is rather elegant, the rounded bottom, (as opposed to squarish bottom on the Q5, makes a big difference to me in holdability, and the keypad seems more comfortable, (especially when hitting ALT along with 7 or 8, something I found almost impossible on the Q5).Now I have not used it a lot yet, but it seems to have a nicer display, really nice camera, and the call quality seems great both with and without speaker phone.The removable battery is a big plus, (Q5 is non removable), and give away deals are available on genuine BB batteries bundled with compact little USB chargers.Anyway do yourself a very big favor, and if considering the Q5, wait and get the Q10, you will be very, very glad you did, the difference is like like night and day 3
DearI have problems with the purchased equipmentwith 100% charged battery does not last or 3 hours of useand sometimes indicates a full battery charge being dischargedas we do to fix it?regards 2
Well, I will first say that when I bought this phone I was very excited bit the more I use it the more I dislike it. I like the fact it has a big screen but it freezes time to time. It doesn't hold a charge like it was suppose to but over all I like the phone. 2
Came as advertised and in time, not much to say about this known product.My first review was positive but I am modifying my review. I needed an Unlocked Cell phone to be able to use it abroad.a few days ago it fell and got the screen messed up.I took it to repair and waited in the workshop while it was being fixed.Much to my surprise the person fixing it told me and showed me that the phone had been open and the parts being replaced where not original, it had a screw missing and parts of the screen circuits where not glued like the originals are.It never affected the performance of the phone but I suppose it shouldn't have been sold as new when it was probably refurbished. 3
I found it difficult to get it working in Dominican Rep. I had to go to many different places before the " Unlocked fro any GSM carrier worldwide" would work worldwide! 3
only rated this 2 stars because we are Apple iPhone people & tried this phone. Android is too confusing for us. The phone itself is a GREAT phone with good features. It just wasn't for us. If you're an Android person, check out this phone 2
I really love it and it works well. 5
This phone is marred by unacceptable Bluetooth performance. It literally drops my Bluetooth headset when I put it in my pants pocket! On the plus side, the sound and speaker phone functionality is quite good, as other reviewers have mentioned. It also is not an exceptionally rugged phone as the screen broke after a fall from less than 3 feet. 3
screen will eventually pop off of the cheap plastic back. do not get it 2
does work as specified.Has battery issues 2
it doesn't stay charge long I don't know why 1
Came in the mail fast and it was new like they said. Happy with it 5
The phone is In like new condition, better than expected. Very nice case ear phones charger and data cable included. 5
a good phone but I think I paid too much 4
Ordered one, it stopped working in a week. Ordered another, it stopped in a month. Do not buy this 1
Phone shipped quickly and has worked perfectly 5
Great iPhone work with no problem so far thanks 5
There's 3 rows of pixels near the top which are all black, and it doesn't seem to have good mic quality when paired with my bluetooth headset, but otherwise it works great. It makes calls just fine and works with the built-in mic. The interface for which SIM to use is easy to use, and the Android OS interface is what you'd expect from any Android product. 3
Great iPad, but did not come with headphones and charger did not work out of the box. Plus there were a few scratches on the screen. 3
I owned a Amazon Fire Phone up until this iPhone. After my Fire phone quit working, Amazon refunded me my full amount since it was still warrantied and they no longer make their phone. So I decided to go ahead and purchase an iPhone instead on Amazon since they have such great customer service. I can't say enough about my phone. The picture and video quality is great, it takes a lot more clearer videos and pictures than I thought it would take. I was a little worried about only have 8GB of storage on my phone because I like to download tons of different apps and games, but so far so good. I haven't had any storage problems and haven't had to delete any programs. It was able to upgrade to the new iOS which is awesome. I am really happy with this iPhone it's my first iPhone since the iPhone3 (sad, right?). I am so glad that I went with iPhone instead of Android. They are way better phones! 5
Wasn't new thought it was new. 1
The item appeared to be slightly used, re-packaged and not brand new in box as advertised. Box was not sealed but had been opened and SIM card had been installed but nevertheless acceptable. 4
Love blackberry. This is a great phone. However because it is old technology I am not able to access all of the features of this phone.Battery life is great, reception is great. I'm unable to access my e-mails not sure if that is tech or cell phone provider.If I could get the e-mail to work. I would certainly keep it for a very long time 3
Good but not great. Build quality is very nice.The interface is a bit clunky. Awesome camera 3
It's a generation 1 iPhone 6, with the weaker back metal, I got a case for it, works very well for the person I got it for, zero issues. 3
mobile microphone does not work 2
lo bueno: fue mi primera experiencia con un blakberryLo malo: es que la version que compre fue el de perla y se tranca mucho no es muy practico al final 3
Finally switched to a smart phone and I am VERY happy with this Iphone. Still learning how to use it, but so far all is great 5
Phone was good for a few weeks now it cut of by itself and won't fully charge ... Really want to replace this phone 2
After a couple updates with Windows 10, a number of apps just stopped working. The battery also likes to act funny, displaying a low percentage after a while, and shutting itself down, only for my to tun it back on, and see that it's 80%. 3
Delivery took a little longer than expected (since I paid extra to expedite), and I also hadn't realized that phone didn't come with charger or any other accessory, but otherwise phone works great. 4
I am very happy , a phone in his capacity AS NEW AND RUNS GREAT , GOOD SELLER THAT GOD BLESS 5
I ordered this phone when my Blackberry Curve broke. I was mainly attracted to it because of the touch screen, but when I got it, I was in for a shock. It is indeed touchscreen, but it's not like normal touch screens. For this one, if you want to actually get into an app, you have to press down on the screen - not just touch it, but actually press the screen down. It's pretty weird at first, but you'll get used to it. As for the actual phone usage, it's a decently usable phone. It's fairly easy to use and all of the essential functions such as calling and messaging are fully functional. There are a few problems with this phone:1. The battery life deteriorates pretty quickly over time if you're not careful2. If you're using it with any carrier other than Verizon, the data is pretty slow3. There aren't many apps that you can use with itHowever, it's a pretty durable phone. During the time I used it, it fell at least 50 times from my back pocket onto the floor before it started getting wack. If you need a replacement or temporary phone, this is a pretty good option. Otherwise, you should look for a better device. 3
It was just as described in excellent condition . 4
awesome product thx for lettin me buy the iphone its perfectly no scratches everything. better than i was even expecting 5
The iPhone 6 Plus is a nice product for a nice price. Happy so far, it is still working as if new with no problems what so ever. 4
Wifi couldnt be enabled. Apparently had a hardware glitch after updating it and could not be fixed. 1
worked fine then one day the it powered off an never turned back on so now it collects dust on my night stand 3
I bought it like "New" but it is not. It is refurbished and it suddenly stopped working 1
This is an amazing phone. This phone, however, is not for everyone. Here is a summary of pros and cons that could help you with making a decision to buy this phone. Remember the current version of this phone is not compatible with Verizon wirelessPros:1. Build quality and security2. Physical comfortable QWERTY keyboard with many useful shortcuts3. Dedicated hard keys for the phone to make calls or hang up4. Track pad that makes selections and scrolling very easy5. LED with different light colors for different notifications6. BlackBerry hub to see and reply to emails, messages, etc. in one place7. Remote access to your files from your phone8. BlackBerry blend that can be run on your PC, Mac, or tablet9. Excellent call quality and descent battery life10. Very good voice recognition11. Very good and fast browser12. Expanded memory by using a SD card up to 128 GB13. Ability to record pictures and videos directly on the SD card14. Direct access to DropBox and Box15. Ability to "create" and "edit" MS-Word and MS-Excel files16. Unique BlackBerry apps and access to Amazon store for Android apps17. NFC18. Basic video editing19. Ability to play a wide range of media files20. FM radio21. File managerCons:1. Not all Android apps can be loaded and run.2. Keyboard layout for the other languages is not shown on the screen so it is not easy to type in another language.3. Though CPU speed and RAM size seem to be enough for this phone, a faster CPU and higher RAM will run some Android apps faster and smoother. Booting is relatively slow.4. Battery is not removable.5. Quality control does not seem to be so good as Apple products.6. Picture and video quality is average.7. Sharing more than a few seconds video by email is difficult.8. Wireless screen mirroring is not possible. It means that you have to purchase slim port separately and have it with you if you want to connect your phone to a video projector.9. GPS functions are very basic. 4
Screen in good shape, phone in good shape with slight scratches. HOWEVER, this is a used phone therefore the battery life is complete crap. it got to the point to were i couldnt even use the phone because the battery life was so bad, it would die WHILE CHARGING. I have never seen this happen in an iphone and am very dissapointed. It made the phone basically a useless brick. 2
I need a refund its not competable wit my Simms card how do I get a refund 1

I ordered 2 iPhone 5's (T-Mobile) from Wireless Warehouse on December 31, 2014. Since the next day was a holiday, I believed the shipping estimate, which said my order would ship on January 2nd. That was when my order ARRIVED! Wireless Warehouse processed and shipped my order faster than anyone I have ever dealt with. The phones themselves were exactly as advertised and worked great! I will use them again and recommend them highly! 5
Mine came defective but otherwise the product is decent. Only set back is no flash n front camera. Otherwise it can work with. 3
On/Off button doesn't work all ready so not very good 1
Mines was white i like everthing but kinda lags sum times but still gud 5
The package came and the plastic case was cracked that the phone was in. Luckily the phone was no harmed. I bought this phone new since I saw the used ones having trouble activating. When I went to activate the phone, I had way too many problems with it. Turns out the phone I received was a Sprinit prepaid phone and could not be added to my account. I ended up buying a phone from Sprinit. 2
Horribe customer service. Phone just "exploded" after one month, vendor asked if I dropped in or had in water (I dropped once, but having had bought this model several times before, this type of phone tends to last a year before breaking even if dropped). Furthermore, there are other vendors selling this "new" phone (which actually T-Mobile discontinued, so it is bordering on false advertising not to mention this fact) for half the price that this vendor sold it to me for-quite the rip off! 1
