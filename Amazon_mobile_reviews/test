The item work only three months and then began an intermittent fault on the screen. We had to replace it and spend enough money on repairs. I do not think back to buy phones in this wayEl equipo durÃ³ sÃ³lo 3 meses y luego empezÃ³ una falla intermitente en la pantalla.Hubo que reemplazar la misma y gastar bastante dinero en su reparaciÃ³n.

The phone I received was not a Verizon phone.UPDATE: I went to return the phone, this process was no problem, the only time it took out of my day was to drop off the phone at the Fed-Ex place. Which isn't a big deal. Once I informed Greengrape/Amazon of my issue I was responded to promptly, the overnighted me a replacement phone which worked properly. This company did a good job in correcting it's mistake. The first phone has a slight scratch on the screen, but was barely noticeable, the second phone is like new. 5
Phone is refurbished and doesn't work 1
get what u pay for 2
Good looking phone but thats all. After few month of using start with random reboots and cant turn it on anymore. I will try to use my worenty. 2
As usual, Apple make an extraordinary gadget with great presentation, nice design, awesome speed and very nice user interface.Excellent productI love it 5
I'll give em a thumbs up. As I will say,they went above & beyond to resolve the error of receiving an incorrect item by error. Impressed with the customer service response & pleased with the product once received. 4
Q I have to show I am not satisfied with the quality of the charger and headphones ARE APPLE original porq not shoddy . The phone whether it is good and looks completely new . 2
First off I have never returned or complained about a purchase I made on Amazon, even though at times I should have. I was skeptical of purchasing a refurbished I-phone, but the price was fair, initially I was impressed, the phone looked as it was never used, arrived when it was supposed to, the phone was unlocked and activating it my service provider was easy. However the speaker does not work, meaning other than with headphones, there's no music, no alarm, and no speaker phone. Disappointed, I need this phone in a hurry so returning it and waiting for a repair or replacement defeats the entire purpose 2
Be very careful with these "refurbished" phones. The one I received had camera issues and an occasional unresponsive screen. I got lucky because the phone had 2 weeks left on the Apple warranty so Apple replaced it for free otherwise this definitely would have been sent back. If you have the time to mess with warranties and returns then go for it. 2
Phone was in pristine condition. I am extremely pleased. 5
I Need a better case phone is ok I guess 3
This is My first BlackBerry, so I dont have a lot of references about this phone.Untill now has worked perfectly, is smaller than previous BB so is pretty easy handle it.For this price is an excellent investment. 4
Works mostly, but SUPER SLOW DATA. NO REAL 4G LTE. And BLU ***PROMISED*** - but never worked out - how to upgrade it to Lollipop, so it has not been "upgradeable" and never will be. Why Amazon continues to advertise it as upgradeable does not reflect well on the direction in which Amazon is going either. Likewise, BLU went from being a darn good idea to being successful to delivering JUNK which they do NOT support. 2
Buyer beware. These refurbished phones are stolen and being resold as refurbished. I bought my iPhone 5s refurbished in April 2015. Works okay out of the box. Yesterday, it stopped charging so I had the battery replaced by a phone repair store. It worked fine again, until the next morning where it was frozen (blank screen and wouldn't reboot). I brought it to the Apple Store and they told me it's a stolen iPhone. Apparently, the original serial no. of the phone gets reported to Apple when someone repairs it and Apple can freeze the iPhone if its stolen. 1
I saw a lot of great reviews about this phone, and I thought I would be one of those lucky ones who wrote these great reviews. I was so excited to find out that the battery works fine yesterday. Unfortunately, this phone couldn't be activated in the store today. It doesn't recognize sim card; maybe it's a locked phone. It's been a waste of my time. I just want to break this phone right now, but I guess I should get my money back. It's not worth it. I bought it from ROSS CELLULAR, btw. 1
These phones are all non apple/genuine parts usually of cheaper quality. You are not getting a genuine iphone. Even the glass is a cheaper glass. 1
This was supposed to be a new phone. There was something wrong with the charging cable, as the phone did not recognize it as an Apple product. The contacts looked dirty, and half the time it wouldn't charge at all. The phone also drops the wifi connection frequently. I'm not all that happy with it, but to be fair, I'm still getting to know it. Expected better. 3
Product is sturdy built. Screen looks great. Operating system works flawlessly. Although it showed full bars of 4g coverage, I could not receive or send texts for hours and incoming calls went to voicemail. Outgoing calls took about 40 seconds to hear that it was dialing. I wonder if it has to do with it being a HSPA +21 phone instead of a HSPA +42 phone. I returned it. Got a different model. 2
Physycally a great device. Well constructed, removable batteries, good keyboard. Keep in mind that BB didn't really take into account the loss of screen real estate that comes along with the physical keyboard when they were designing the BB10 operating system skin on top of Android. Things feel a little cramped on screen as a result. You'll also have to go through a lot of trouble if you want access to the Google play store. It's doable, but not simple.Make sure your mission critical apps have a BB10 implementation BEFORE you buy a Blackberry, or you'll be doing some fiddling around to get them downloaded and installed. 4
This phone is amazing when it comes to the amount of processing speed and battery life. It has a satisfying weight to it and it relatively slim with the size of the battery. However, do not over charge this battery because it's effiency will drain drastically and you will not have the same life span as you would expect. It also overheats very quickly if held on your person for too long and often restarts unexpectedly when the processor is overloaded but it is rare but it is something to look out for when using the phone. It is also only six compatible with 90 degree angled jacks which was weird but it's still a great phone with optimal size but I wish I had chosen another product from BLU that performs better than before. 3
Great phone it's the phone no one could dislike. 5
Great price, shipping and service! Thank you will buy again 5
It would in the area where I live. 2
Great phone. Great price. Even has a good camera. 5
the name of the product just misrepresented it self http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003BNYD24/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2 it says PURPLE when i recieved the phone it is red i was totally disappointed smhh 2
It would not take a 64 GB sd card. Plus it was slow and sluggish and poor battery life with a slow charging rate. Personally I have had nothing but problems with factory unlocked phones. Most of them are soft bricked meaning there's something on them that doesn't work. Blu isn't the only one. I'm not going to mention the brand because I didn't get it from Amazon. I'm going to go back to carrier phones. At least your carrier is a layer of quality control. Blu phones are just plain crappy. Maybe that's why they throw in cases(flimsy and ugly) and screen protectors hoping you won't notice. Good luck installing the screen protector without a ton of bubbles making the phone as ugly as the case. 2
I think I brought this refurbished for my mom, she loved it and it had no faults. No sign of wear and tear and no faults with the programs or phone overall. She has had it since 2012 up to last Christmas when I begged her to upgrade lol. This was a good buy and came unlocked as it says so she could use it with our local phone provider here in Jamaica 4
Good so far! I bought it 3 months ago!! 4
Perfect condition and unlocked.. nyc one 4
It's OK not waterproof and what's up does not work in it. It also does not have stopwatch option 2
did work after three month 4
Great phone at first but then stopped powering on, although 5 stars to Amazon for their great customer service! 2
The iphone 3GS met all my expectations and went beyond. I was concerned about performance after upgrading it to the latest version of IOS, but I went ahead to do it anyway. It has performed well ever since. 5
The phone works great I have sprint service and I got my old SIM card out my iPhone 4s cuz it broke and put it in to this and it works i am really impressed 4
The package was not original, the protective plastic over glass was missing, the charger cable was not assembled as original new products, the plastic box was sealed with a low quality tape that leaved glue rests. The phone was configured in an oriental language, a general reset was needed to use it. After that I cannot recommend buying from this dealer. 1
Yep, that's a blackberry q10 alright 4
I barely had the phone for 6 months the power button fell off, then it started going down hill from there. the phone would occasionally freeze up completely and the come back on like nothing. now I believe the screen just went black and won't come back on. I can't remove the battery because its built in so now im stuck. 2
Three immediate problems with this phone: it was advertised to have upgradable storage and it doesn't. In today's world, 16 gb on a smartphone is almost useless. Second false advertisement, that it has a dual sim, which it does not. I also don't notice that the camera functions as advertised. It was those three reasons in particular that I chose this phone, and it's a big disappointment that wasted my time. Other than that, the design is sleek and light, and I probably would've liked it had it been what it was supposed to be. I like the exterior, now if it were just dual sim, had upgradable memory storage, and the camera that was advertised, it would be perfect, but it doesn't. I'm returning it 2
Came exactly like it said it was 5
Blackberry Bold 9000 Unlocked Phone with 2 Mp Camera, 3g, Wi-fi and GPS --International Version (Black) 30 Day Warranty Gsm Pda Smartphone ( Esa es la descripcion del producto como podras ver aparece unlocked "desbloqueado" y no lo esta por esta razon te doy esa puntuacion la verdad me molesta mucho la gente que hace mal las cosas, si el telefono no estaba liberado no lo coloques y ya!... si me solucionas el problema tal vez elimine la puntuacion) 2
Good phone, minor scratches and dents but works perfect. 4
The wifi is not work. 2
I'm not happy with the iPhone 5. It don't work very well. It also don't let me download certain apps. 1
I had no problem with the product, was surprise that I received it so fast. The style of the phone was also amazing, really thin and small, fits perfectly in my purses. Good buy. 4
Nice phone, Dual sim slot, yeah its niceGood job guys 3

I love the product that was purchased thru amazon. I love the prices the fast delivery and the quality of the phone that I have now. Thank you amazon!! A+ 5
Pretty good physical condition, works well 4
I recently ordered a Blackberry Gemini 8520 unlocked gsm phone for use internationally. When I recieved said order, it in fact was not a Gemini 8520, but a Blackberry Curve; of which I think may have been re-furbished. I didn't want the hassle of returning the Curve because I need to use a phone immediately. So I did not complain until I was asked to write a review of this item.Thanks! 2
I bought this phone thinking it was 100% fully functional as stated but the first week I got it I noticed the camera was broken. Within a few weeks the phone started doing things on it's own and acting out. Apps wouldn't work. More problems started occurring. I contacted the seller kindly and didn't even get a response. Very unprofessional. Will not buy from here again. 1
This phone immediately had issues.- Data was slow everywhere-Phone froze, was stuck in a white screen. Even after restarting and trying other recommended remedies.-Luckily I got a full refund, ordered from the same seller. New Iphone 5 looked and worked great. 1
BEWARE!!!Dont buy this fone. It might look to you as a new fone but has been tampered with. I took it to Apple and they verified that its still locked to Verizon which is CDMA. Also they confirmed that this fone is showing a purchase date of 1978 which is completely wrong. So this fone has definitely been tampered with. No Warranty.I would suggest not buying this fone. Apple gave all the details to me in writing and said that this fone doesnt come under any warranty. 1
The volume button is not working. Dissapointed 1
The phone cant charge past 53%. 2
I was hoping chargers are included and headphones 4
Before being an Iphone Junkie, this phone was perfect for me. It's durable and good in all aspects. The only thing is the same thing that all bb has: software is very unstable. But when you buy one, you know it. 3
I found this phone to be a good purchase. It arrived on time and as it was described. I have yet to find any fault with it. 4
Tha worst buy i had did its get this Blackberry phone, the first day i had used had working good, then i had log off , the next day i had use again and i was surprissed this phone dont accepted the sim card , i dont know what happen. I had really dissapointed with this phone.I dont recommend buy this phone. 2
My husband and I both purchased the Pantech Ease to replace our aging cell phones - without having to 'upgrade' with the carrier. We like having the keyboard and the rest of the phone programs are simple enough for us older folks to use! Sometimes the touch screen can be unresponsive - therefore the 4 rating. 4
This phone, or at least, the phone I was delivered only had limited compatibility with 4G LTE network and with my wireless home network. As a result, very often I have no connection to the network at all. Webpages load too slowly, GPS does not function as it should and my outgoing messages frequently do not come through. The price may be low for a phone, which is nice, but it costs you reliability. I would not buy from this manufacturer again 2
12/14/15 Update on lollipop upgrade, I have tried to get answers on why no upgrade, but all requests have fallen on deaf ears. Can't believe 5 months have past with no upgrade as promised, definitely false advertising. If they chose to respond I will post it.Lets start by saying that $79 for this phone is worth it.I like the screen, nice and bright and as sharp as it needs to be.I love the look, Mine is a solid build no light seepage like in one review.For basic cell phone uses, it works. I've played manysimple games, some with lag issues. But phone calls, texts, wifi allwork as they should. There are a few issues with the OS, that I hopedLollipop would fix, but there is no update(as of today) to the phoneas advertised in their sales ads. Many Tech site reviews claimed Blusaid the update was due by the end of July. But no where have Iseen Blu say that, so now it's a waiting game.I use my phones on Cricket, there is 4g lte in the area,This phone has 4g speed capabilities, and says it is connectedto 4g, but I have mostly been getting 3g 1-1.6 mbps. I'll keep testing.The notification light is almost impossible to see unless your in a poorly lit area.Touchscreen is touchy and came with screen protector on, which I removedand bought a glass one, it's ok not great.The camera is ok, not top of the line by any means, but noteven close to the worst I've used.I have watched Amazon video, Netflix, Crackle and Youtube on this phoneand all worked as expected, no issues.When buying a smartphone you also "buy" customer support. I wouldsay that this is by far the weakest link. When trying to contact Blu I gotthe run around after multiple tries to get a question answered.This is my 3rd blu phone. The phone is not bad at all for less than $80and at that price I would buy it again, but at $130 I would pass. 3
Everything that I expected...Thanks Fast Shipping as well... 5
Next time I will get a better one 3
The bottom center button often will not engage. When the button is pressed the phone often does not respond. I think that the button is dying. It is not working full.It is not the end of the world but a bit disappointing. 3
Wondering why the iPhone that I bought without mic cable 3
I have been using a Blu Studio Energy since 2015, and thought that I might upgrade to an Energy X LTE, primarily for the 16GB of internal memory vs. the 8GB on my current phone.I give the Energy X LTE credit for having 16 GB internally, as it addresses a headache related to Android Lollipop. Though you can move apps to an SD card to save internal storage space on 8GB phones running Lollipop, you must move them again and again to the SD card every time the app updates. Apps will not update directly to the SD card, often leaving the user without enough internal memory and "insufficient memory" warnings. It is cumbersome and time-consuming manually moving each app every time the app updates. Lollipop eats away about 5 GB. If you use more than a few apps, 8 GB is simply insufficient. Good on Blu for offering more than 8 GB.I ordered two Energy X LTE phones from Warehouse deals, and both were problematic - though whether this was the result of the phone or the people inspecting them for Warehouse Deals, I'm not certain.The first phone suffered from "ghost touches." When tapping the touchscreen, the top right of the screen would blink as though somebody were poking it, making almost all functionality impossible. I could not even enter my WiFi password because after a few taps on the keyboard, the phantom touches would erase what I had typed, disable the keyboard, or call up other screens. So, back it went.I was completely locked out of the second phone. The previous owner had not disabled factory reset protection, and without their username and password, there was absolutely no way to get past the "verify your phone by entering a username or password previously associated with this account" screen - a real downer when you're excited about playing with a new phone. This phone was returned, too.I hesitate to buy a third, brand new, given reviews of sluggishness and poor camera performance. Perhaps I'll investigate other models, but I like the huge battery - the 5000 milliamp battery on my Studio Energy was fantastic for hours of GPS use in Southeast Asia, and generally I like Blu Phones and their place in the Smartphone Market. 2
I purchased this item for its specifications, but also for the description of the condition, since it was used. The description said it was in excellent condition. The 'up' volume works great, but the 'down' volume does not work at all. I considered returning it for a refund. But I rarely use the volume switch, and otherwise it's good. In the end, it just wasn't worth it. But I do believe that the seller knew this, and hid the fact. In short, the description was not truthful.Gary Kirsheman 1
This is an edit to an earlier review I made. Another consumer (I think) pointed out that it uses a different network than Verizon and that I should have done my research. Well, maybe I should have. But I don't know, I'm a consumer, and even though I agree that consumers should indeed do their homework, the majority will read "Super Cool Quad Band Watch". And since there is no disclaimer in the specifications, most would probably buy it. I mean I'm not an expert, but how many people really know what GSM or CMDA means? If the Verizon guy couldn't figure it out......Anyway, I bought this product, took it to my cell phone carrier (Verizon) and they could not get it to work. Because I am not willing or able to search all of the cell phone carriers to find out which one can get it to work, and because of the fact that it is way more bulkier than I thought, I returned it.You know what, in all fairness, I'll upgrade my rating because I can't speak on how it works. But I got a white one and the watch band is a noticeable different shade of white compared to the watch. If you are getting it for your kid like I did, just know that it is bulky and looks like someone grabbed a nokia and trimmed off the key pad and slapped it onto a wristband. JUST MY OPINION. Again, It might work for you but the look threw me off. 2
The biggest issues I had with the phone is the very slow processing. It seems it has to take its time to think about what you just told it what to do. Another issue is the memory is horrible. It really only took a few of my downloaded apps before it says out of memory. I bought a sd card that it could not read. I got rid of it and got the ZTE ZMAX, super great phone for the price. I love it. 2
This item was purchased for someone else. its used really battered! but for this price! what would one expect. this item came a day early! and with no damage 2
Battery won't hold charge otherwise good phone 4
Though fully packaged, it is not totally new.Checking on the Apple support (the Apple web), it says this phone's Telephone Technical Support has already EXPIRED, and only 1 months to Repairs and Service Coverage Expiration Date. Which means it registered about 1 years ago. 2
I received the device on time that's the only positive. The phone was completely defective, the speaker was in horrible condition it sounded like I was talking under water, really muffled. And I'd place a call and the only way I can be heard is if I'm on speaker. The charger didn't work and the battery drained way to quick and believe me I adjusted all my settings. I have to charge it 3 times a day not kidding. 1
Get the 16-32GB instead! I should have paid attention to the GB when I bought this! 4
The phone came with a bad speaker I could return but not replace took it to cell repair place cost me another fifty dollars needed the phone.. 2
One of the speakers on the phone doesnt work ,the sound is low 3
Phone was listed as like new but when we tried to activate it the camera didn't work and you could make a call but the person you were calling couldn't hear you 1
Very difficult to sync with your wireless device. Once you have it syncs it comes disconnected very easily. Wouldn't recommend. 2
I'm having problem with the charging system of this my iPhone 6s Plus. When I plug it to the charger, it rather discharges instead of charging. It discharges to zero before recharging & it's usually following difficult to start recharging. I noticed the battery is also discharging faster. All these started two days ago.I'm currently in Tel Aviv, Israel.What should I do? 4
There is no damages and scratches to this item it is good as new I loved it...... 5
It was BAD my product that I bought when if was shipped to me the phone did NOT work 1
Muy buen equipo sin ningun problema, responsable en la entrega y funciono con todas las operadoras de Venezuela.Estoy muy contenta con mi compra lo recomiendo 4
Phone didn't work at all. Took it to Apple and was told it was defective 1
I love the Apple phone.This is a outstanding deal and phone. I don't like writing a book to tell you about this. Deal 5
Great phone love it it's just like the owner said new phone works good I love this kind of phone 5
Just like the advertisement said, but the "free" case was pink... Seriously? Battery also seems shorter than typical even for an iPhone. 4
I love my phone, the camera takes wonderfull photos. the battery whent dead after three months but I guess it's a BB's problem and not from the seller 4
You sold a phone that the battery won't stay charged for longer then an hour 1
iPhone's battery does not work properly! This was not included in the description. The battery died every 20 minutes unless it was connected to a charger. Once the phone would turn back on, it would say that the battery life was at 30%! 1
This phone is the best I got it on the mail today 5
The phone died couple months later. The screen is all black. Not very happy with this purchase. 2
iPhone arrive at the time completely new , but box was open , I mean It came with an plastic cover like the new one from apple but it was obviously open previously because inside the phone there was a SIM card , I was not surprised because I read that before in the other comments , yesterday my phone was inhibited for minutes , ive read thats normal un iPhone 7 plus , so Im happy for the Fast delivery but kinda worry for the product 4
Well, there is not much to say about an iphone when you have been using them since the first generation came out. There are not a lot of differences between this model and the iphone 4, just Siri a little bit of speed and more weight. I bought this one for a cousin and she loved it. I have the iPhone 5 and find its screen, besides being taller (not wider) shows richer colors. 5
Excelente producto, a pesar de ser usado, esta en muy buenas condiciones tanto estéticamente como funcionalmente. El teléfono es desbloqueado para todo el mundo.!! 5
best purchase I have ever made. the phone came in great condition, maybe a couple of little scratches but that was mentioned in the details box. I love my iphone and have never had a problem with it 5
The battery hasn't got much life 4
I owned a smartphone prior to the iPhone. It was way more user friendly. The apps were more user friendly and all my music downloads and ring tones were free. The only thing I like better on my iPhone is the camera however I think the process to upload my photos is more difficult on the iPhone. I had thought face time would be nice but found out I could use an app with my smart phone that is free for face time. 3
I buy one good friend of Venezuela would like to know is the telephone operator . I requested me to unlock my country 1
My iPhone had some problems at first the headphones jack stopped working for 3 days and I'm having some problem with the internet connection sometimes I have all the bars full and the internet just stops working but other then that is perfect that been the only problem I hade with this iPhone 6s 3
I have had some problems with this phone but, in general, it is in good conditions. I recommend every body to contact the seller first before buying to ensure the full functionality of your future device. The devices, they are selling, are used but they have to be able to do all their operations. With the money I expended to repair my device, I could have bought a new one. 3
For a low price flip phone it works good, it's very light weight and fits the pourpose of a second cel phone 3
The phone came with some scratches in the back that weren't mentioned in the description. Also came with some photos and one of a naked man. Totally inappropiate. The delivery in perfect time. 4
What I like is the battery endurance.What I don't like is that when it's in my pocket, subjected to stress, bending, the device glitches. ALOT. and it's very susceptible to physical bending.Takes really decent pics, and the Android 5.1 is easy to learn.It's an attractive package.2 days max normal use, not 3. Charger is fast.Turn the BLU on first, plug usb cable from BLU to PC Win 10, tap BLU screen to decide transfer mode or USB debugging, and then selecting file transfer mode, you can browse the folders on the BLU with Windows. Makes archiving your data much easier with OTG. Before I had to use ES File Explorer and WiFi , making my PC folder a server, in order to transfer files for archiving. OTG should be incorporated in all Android devices. It should have been from the beginning.As far as phone being 100 dollars, and for what it is, I would say at this point in time, that since the RAM and ROM are only 1G and 8G the deal is NOT too good. As of 08/19/2016 this phone should have been 80, or the RAM and ROM should have been 2G and 16G. So far adding a 32 GB uSD card solves the issue.A big deal maker for me, is this phone is 4G capable on my ATT GoPhone SIM. At least the 4G in the display is lighting up...but I'll say this, for what it's worth, the 4G is NOT very fast, but an improvement over 3G. So although it's not LTE my connection to data on the cell net is decent, I still get anxiety because I'm used to internet speeds in excess of 50 M, since I use a PC a lot. Using the cell internet is frustrating.The speaker is loud and clear, the ear piece is loud and clear, and the microphone delivers clear, to the other end. Audio section is no problem. I have not used with Bluetooth.I will end with this, it's an entry level phone and has decent performance, but the price tag hangs on that Super Battery, which, in the end is a benefit to the seller and manufacturer, so the same phone with a 2000 mah battery, I'd pay 60. 3
Has been great phone for my 15 year old nieces first smart phone. 4
Was good first day then started cutting off ... Phone sucked 2
This phone seemed ok at first.Out of nowhere the power button started shorting out, if pressed the phone would turn back on like it was stuck...electrical problem not physical though.Few weeks later SD slot failed.I've been on hold with Alcatel trying to do a return for the last 45 minutes, this company and their products seems pretty bad.-Followup, phone volume button automatically starts increasing volume, shorting similar to the power button. This turns the display on and causes the battery to drain quickly.When the battery fully drains the phone doesn't turn on even at full charge, it has to be overcharged for another hour before it turns on. Had to charge mine 10 hours last time battery complete drained before it would turn back on.The person who said this review is not helpful was probably a shill working for this crap company. 1
Purchased for a 10 yr old grandson who is very happy with his phone. 5
wasn't happy because it arrived without any charger cord or accessories. This added cost and inconvenience and was not disclosed. 3
LOVE the 4s compared to the 5. Phone was practically brand new without a blemish on it. Long time Android user and am happy having made the switch. 5
I bought it a year ago and the speaker didn't work very well, I couldn't hear people talking when they called me or I called them. Thankfully it was still covered under apple care so I got a brand new one. 4
JOHN , I HAD BOUGHT THE PHONE AND HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM WITH THE FIRMWARE ,HOW DID U FLASH IT WITH THE INTERNATIONAL VERSION . PLS DO ASSIST .THANK U . 3
Used this unlocked GSM Nokia Asha 302 in the Philippines just recently (Jan-Feb 2015). Excellent, no problem with functionality. Bought a P40 SIM card at the airport & presto! It worked. I passed it on to my brother the instant I came back to the US. He will be visiting the Philippines soon. It was very easy to use. Having been used to smart phones w/ touch screen, I surprised myself when I worked w/ it easily not having read the instructions to operate it. I'll buy another one like this & definitely an upgraded version of this Nokia unlocked GSM phone. 5
nice color good size but too basic doesnt hold memory what so ever and its not loud enough .. phone pretty much is good for nothing 2
Nice deal once you get used to the Windows system, dual sims good for traveling. 3
No problem with the cell. It works amazingly well 4
Small crack on body of device, not internal problems, software is fine,activated with no problems overall am very happy with my buy thank you so much. 4
The phone I ordered was refurbished and I thought it was supposed to function like a somewhat new iphone 4 and it doesn't. My iphone 5 was stolen so I needed a quick fix and I thought this phone would be perfect, however it has very many flaws. The phone always freezes, it always says memory full (when it isn't), the charger it came with doesn't work, and the list goes on and on. The only reason why I didn't return it was because I really needed a phone in the meantime before I bought something better than the 4. The only positive was the price, and I mean it was pretty cheap so I guess I got what I paid for. 1
It works well with apps but Google maps doesn't function well at all. And it is slow with processing becomes very annoying . But for the price it pretty much gets the job done most of the time. You get what you pay for. 3
I got this phone after many years of using the IPhone, so I am not used to Android. Needless to say, I have to give myself time, but I am wishing I had my iphone. The feel and coloring is perfect. Just a little slow and dificult for me to work it properly. Going to give my self time though. 3
iPhone arrive at the time completely new , but box was open , I mean It came with an plastic cover like the new one from apple but it was obviously open previously because inside the phone there was a SIM card , I was not surprised because I read that before in the other comments , yesterday my phone was inhibited for minutes , ive read thats normal un iPhone 7 plus , so Im happy for the Fast delivery but kinda worry for the product 4
Don't get it, don't get it, don't get it! 1
I clicked because it was advertised as a Series 2 on the home page but is really Series 1. I knew the price was too good to be true and sure enough it was. It is described as being waterproof when it's only sweat resistant. Beware! 2
I got my phone really fast and it was everything I had expected and more 5
Very good phone, came right on the expected delivery date, very speedy! Very impressed! Came with other accessories as well! 5
My brother had asked me to get him a BB within a affordable range of prices. I got him this one and he is simply thrilled!Not only it has more features than the previous versions, but it also has the option of being used both touch screen and key pad...I have not used it, but seing the way he's in love with it, I can only say that it met his expectation. Great product. 4
the power button went out five mins after haveing it was a nice phone if it had worked , just got a bad one i guess but they got my refund to me write away 2
Broke with a week cracked screen didn't drop it simply put it in my pocket one day sat down got up and and was cracked screen still turns on but won't work 2
Do not buy this phone. It is USELESS I REPEAT IT IS USELESS. The screen does not work. These people sell BASURAR on amazon. I don't know y amazon grants them the permission to sell cheap, useless and garbage product on their site. 1
It's sucks battery dies in an hour it won't connect to wifi or blue tooth its junk 1
Bought unlocked, works in Asia too with GSM carrier. 5
Let's be clear, this phone is great if we still lived in 2006, you know the year before the iPhone. Let's face it, the year is 2015, and a phone with specs from 4 years ago does not cut it. Granted, this phone is designed for the "mobile professional", however they are not all boring, they might want to play a game or two - outside of the legendary Brick Breaker. The phone is one of the best built phones you can buy right now, no seriously you drop this, the phone will be fine. It's just not an impressive feature list. Ok, it runs Android apps - great! Not so great, they are slow, crash often and you need to run this in a special size mode that cuts that 3.5 inch display in half. The keyboard is phenomenal, you can't match a true dedicated keyboard to on-screen tapping. John Chen, BlackBerry's CEO said that he wants "younger" buyers to check out the Classic... Sorry John, anything with the name classic, should remain in the past. 2
I have had this phone since February and it has gone downhill drastically. Now the phone will not charge to full capacity without being powered off. In two hours the phone has reached than half of its battery life. The phone locks up continuously. First bad experience with a BLU phone, but probably will be my last. 2
Very disappointed the iphone 5c eye received already been activatied and has an outstanding bill So Not Happy it was 4 my daughters 16th b-day she is so sad 1
I would like to thank u, for the blackberry at first I thought it was going to be scuffed, but I doubted u... I hope it goes well in a few years, thanks a million big one 4
I have a positive feedback, I`ve got what I expected, the Iphone is in a good condition and I`m using it with pleasure :) 5
Of course I love my factory refurbished iPhone 5 32GB! I bought it to replace an Iphone 5 16GB that was never quite the same since I dropped it on a cobbled surface, shattered its screen, killed one speaker and ruined the autobrightness. I'm still holding onto the older iPhone because it cost me a fortune and I cant bring myself to let it go. iPhone 5 is the size and shape that I like and I was not interested in another model. Pity it was discontinued.In terms of any concerns about getting a refurbished phone, my phone has no problems. I have travelled with it to two countries and it is perfect. In fact I may never buy a brand new iPhone again. 5
I've only just received this phone a day ago, so I am still fiddling with it. Some small issues so far, such as - I have been unable find an N7100 case that actually will fit properly, the mic and headphone jack openings do not match the device. The included stylus does not work properly with the screen and there is no way to re-calibrate it, screen seems to work better with my finger. And, while it is great to include the extra battery, there is no included external charger, so it is useless to swap them. Unless, of course, you manage to find a compatible charger sold separately. Last issue, even though my carrier offers 4g service, I have yet to get 3g reception (this phone is suppose to be capable of 3g) even in the heart of town near the carrier's tower.On the good side, the phone was not $500 - $800 as you would expect to pay for Samsung's Galaxy Note II. I love the quality and functionality of Samsung's Galaxy line, but simply cannot afford the prices. As such, I will learn to live with this knock-off's flaws. 3
This phone was locked when I got it even though it says un-locked. 1
As all Apple products, it's my number one choice. It's very convenient, easy to use, and works great. It has everything I need in a phone, a personal planner device, entertainment, and anything else you can think of, it's got it all. 5
I ordered two of these based on the reviews..however I am very disappointed as they don't work as advertised, especially the camera and video functionality. I do not recommend and will be returning them. 2
Does all the basics. Microphone when talking to Siri or voice to text does not work. Otherwise it is adequate. 4
It works good as new 5
The seller I got it from sold me a super glitchy phone. It was cheap, so I can't complain too much. But you'll have to tolerate the screen freezing, apps opening without you even touching the screen, and a few dropped calls. 1
Not bad. A great deal for a not bad phone. GPS is terrible 3
It is an apple iPhone 4 what to say more. 5
All good pretty fast shipping. Signature is required be aware! I didn't know this! I was able to intercept talking to the postmaster. But that's a case by case deal, you may not be able to do that.As the phone goes perfect no complaints at all. Memory was wiped, old non functioning sim in, but was a plus as I used it to cut my normal sim to size. Normal full case wear. No major scratches. If any small I didn't pay any attention as this phone is for work but I don't notice any day to day so I would so none or minimal. Came with aftermarket charger that was a multi charger, another plus! The down side of that it is not compatible with data exchange. And it had the OEM wall charger. Perfect! Didn't expect less or more! 5
Is original product and works perfectly well 4
The product does not work 1
I purchased this phone which was advertised as "NEW" in Dec 2015 - It recently became unresponsive so I took it to Apple assuming they would help me under their one year warranty - they informed me that the phone was originally activated in 2013 and on top of that, it had a non-apple replacement screen installed and the sub-screen was damaged and that is why the phone no longer worked. Because of all this, there is nothing Apple could or would do- had it been a "NEW" phone like I thought, they would have fixed or replaced at N/C since it was within one year of activation..... Basically this is a refurbished phone and since it has been 6 months, I am out of luck. Very bad experience :( 1
Received in bad condition. Not working letters. 1
So far I have had two of these. And so far both phones have lasted about a month to a month and a half before the touch screen stops working and ive had to order a replacement. Don't get me wrong the phone itself was fine and had no other problems it just isn't all that I was expecting even for an aneroid. 2
Thanx for iPhone it's so great 5
For $100 bucks it an OK android phone to get you by but it's still a piece of junk in the end. It hangs constantly when flipping between apps or navigating quickly, the camera sucks, the sound output with headphones is awful, the WiFi can not seem to figure out how to switch automatically between cellular data, and the list goes on...If you only have $100 and need a phone ASAP this is better than nothing or one of the cheapo candy bar Nokias. Otherwise stay away from the Blu brand and buy a real phone. I have had two different models now and these things are junk. 2
This phone is a good choice to change from an all digital system and analogical one. The size is a middle one, and you have a good support from Black Berry at the moment that your data is lost. 4
Very disapionted as I'm in Australia and the fone can't be used I understood fone locked for sprint but would axept overseas sim for use out side the states stuck with a fone that the carriers won't unlock 1
Could not use my AT&T sim in it and it is not a good competitor to the Galaxy Gear. It sounds like a kids toy starting and not a Tech Guys Toy. 2
It's fine but the volume is really low when talking. 3
It was not a factory unlock phone but as per tech setting up the phone a T-Mobile phone unlock 2
Got my iphone and the home button was broke 1
The phone can't charge and the Sims card don't work 1
It is as described in the description box. The only miniscule issue I have is that it did not come with the nano simcard. 4
quick and easy to workhowever, the back camera will not make but dark Photos in the evening hours even with the flash 2
great phone, arrived ontime and as promised. it was just what i needed to travel. accepted the sim and i was able to change sims when i changed countries. 5
No it did not, you can't hear when you have it on speaker phone 1
This Blackberry 8520 is unlocked and therefore can be used in different countries which is goo for people travel a lot. The phone itself is quite light for being a Blackberry and it has some outdated software. The trackpad is wonderful but it feels a little too loose for my liking. Using is on T-Mobile in NYC where I always have full bars, this never gets above 3. Also it is still on edge, which is 2 generations old. But overall it is a good phone and mind you that they give some spanish intructions and a cd. It came with a headset, charger and came with world power adapters which is a nice freebie.Well, you get what you pay for and with this phone, thats a lot. 4
This was my first Apple device and I am not impressed. Very basic, no cool settings. It's always randomly asking me for my iTunes password, etc. This phone really drives me crazy.....I was also told I would be able to switch to Straight Talk with this device after purchasing an activation kit. I purchased one only to be told I'd need another kit for $100+ dollars. WTF ? Total waste of money. I regret this purchase for sure. 2
I had this phone for two days. At first I was impressed, but ultimately you get what you pay for. My screen kept going dark and wouldn't turn on as well as it shutting off on its own. I returned it for a refund. The camera also isn't as good as it seems. 2
I am happy with this purchase. It was delivered on time. Though it was a used phone, it looked like brand new, wrapped in a plastic, screen in mint condition and hardly any scratches on the back cover. Included were a new wall charger, new usb cable and new headphone. It is functionally perfect, good network, holds battery for just over a day. Overall, a nice buy for the price. 5
Phone looked worn and had lots of stratches. Bad condition - unacceptable. 1
Delivered earlier than expected in perfect condition as reported without a scratch, works perfectly well and would recommend without hesitation. 5
el articulo llego tal cual el anuncio del vendedor, el envio fue rapido lo recomiendo muy bueno. excelente producto. gracias 4
Was a blacklisted phone, couldn't activate it. Was a horrifying experience. 1
 First of all I would like to mention how slim and elegant this Android 5.1 Smartphone Unlocked 5.5" from Juning. I got the gold color and I love it!. They also have a white and black color in the website. This has a 1.3 GHz Processor and 512MB RAM/8GB ROM.Below are some of the great features on this phone:Camera - It has a dual camera (both 2MP front and back camera). But the back camera is actually really good. I have attached here some of the photos that I just took using this phone. It also has a smile feature which is pretty cool. When this feature is turned on you will be able to take a picture automatically once a smile has been detected by the camera.Video - With the 5.5" display you can have a great view of the videos and it is also pretty bright.Air Gesture - When air gesture is turned on you will be able to move the pictures/app by simply swiping your palm on the sensor in front of the phone. This feature can be found under settings - accessibility - gesture.Smart Wake - This feature would let your phone wake up while it is asleep by simply double tapping the screen. You can find this feature under settings - accessibility - gesture - smart wake.Mobile Anti-Theft - With this feature you will be able to remotely take control of your phone when you will lose it or it will get stolen. You just have to add an emergency contact number to this phone. There will be 3 things that you can do. First is to send a message from your emergency contact number a word that states "#suoding#" in order to remotely lock your phone so that nobody would be able to access it unless they know your PIN. Second is to send the word "#xiaohue#" to completely wipe out the data on your phone and lastly is to send the word "#mima#" to fetch back your PIN.Letter Gesture - This is my favorite feature of all because this serves as your quick access to apps/galleries. While your phone is asleep just simply type in the letter that you have set on the black screen. You can customized this with the apps/icons that you prefer. This can be found on settings - accessibility - gesture- letter gestures.The package incudes the following:1 x Cellphone1 x Battery1 x USB Cable1 x Charger1 x Earphone1 x Transparent silicon caseI highly recommend this inexpensive phone to everyone.I got this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I am not affiliated with this company and I am not obliged to provide a positive review when offered a discount. All my opinions are my own which are based on my experience and are in no way influenced by the discount that I received. I will certainly update my review if there's any issues that I will encounter. 5
This one is my wife's. For overall use, loves it. But she really wanted an improved camera and video over our previous Lumia phones.Yes, camera has better resolution. BUT....audio recording gets blasted out in loud environments, which the Nokia did not. So...meets the needs for talk/text/apps...does not for her quality pictures and video under certain conditions. Probably better than average for it's price point. 3
It's a good phone:). It's got a purple color in the middle of the screen but it's not that noticeable. And I have no scratches on it:) 5
Works great whenever it stays connected to my Samsung Note 3. Unfortunately the BT connection is sporadic and unreliable even when it's only a few inches away from the phone. The watch must have a poor BT transceiver or it's incompatible with Android's Lollipop OS. The price is only a little more than I would pay for a cheap watch so I guess I can't be too disappointed. 2
I ordered the phone brand new & it appears to me that is exactly what I got, it works without any issues, came exactly as described, with the charger & brand new headphones!!! The box was complete with everything you get when you buy from the actual store!!! 4
Great ipad. Its the best ipad that I've owned and it was in excellent condition when I purchased it!! Very happy 5
Much better and great upgrade from an iPhone 3gs. 5
It is a very nice phone I like it! 4
this was a waste of money. 2
Phone keep blanking out and giving error message regarding sd card. 2
Some people really like them but I'm not a fan of BlackBerry, this phone especially. The buttons feel cheap and I had to be on the phone for over an hour for at least two days while carrier and I tried to figure out how to get this thing to work. I finally gave it away after having it for only two weeks. 2
Basic phone the camera quality isn't good. Not very much storage space as expected 3
I was hurt a week later provide defective goods 1
Does not work at all. Will not turn on >:( 1
Phone is alright. Biggest problem with BLU is they don't release new software load. I want KitKat and I doubt I'll ever get it unless I hack and install custom ROM. 3
The phone was in the condition as advertised which was "fair". I felt that the scratches on the case made the condition fair. but the phone was very dirty. but once cleaned up it was good to go. there were no scratches on the screen 3
I bought this unlocked mobile for an international trip. I am sure it will meet all my needs 4
Didn't get my SIM removal tool but used an earring. Other than that it's a great phone. 4
Each day I become more and more satisfied with the Apple iPhone. Amazing performance, incredible graphics, very very functional, a great camera, great touch-screen response, thousand of useful and funny apps, excellent operating system. Apple shows why she's the market leader with this product. 5
The phone is okay. Keys are too small for my hands. The battery life is terrible, I have to keep switching back to my old phone to saty up & running. I wish I had b ought a slide-out keyboard type phone instead. For the money...disappointed! 3
1. phone comes with no manual.2. no support from lenovo usa. their primary focus is on lab tops not phones.3. tried to get manual on line no luck.4. has programs in chinese which cannot be removed.5. 5.5 screen is great + clarity! 3
Excellent product. Great smartphone taking in consideration it cost! Highly recommended. 5
The phone I got is the iphone 7 MN8K2ll/A which is not an unlocked phone but one that is listed as Verizon and locked. The product description said Apple Iphone 7 Unlocked US Version. This is very misleading advertising,UPDATE:Though I have not activated the phone this model recognized the DIgicel SIM and network easily. I upgraded the review to 4 stars 4
I received my iPhone and everything was good untill I needed an 8gb instead of an 16gb form my phone Carrier. I told the man and he told me that he was gonna send me a replacement because that was the problem. So I sent him proof that that was in fact was the problem and told him that i didn't want money back just a replacement so i could use the phone and he still told me no. I spent all this money on this phone all i wanted was a replacement so i could use it. 1
Almost perfect, didn't come with Sim Door Key had to open the Sim tray with a coaxial connector pin. 4
First of all, I am not an iPhone or Apple faithful. I use products based on how well they perform and suit my needs. This phone blows away the others. I had an iPhone 3, then switched to an HTC Android, then the Droid Razr. Now I'm back to the iPhone again. I like the clarity of the screen, which helps when reading text with these old eyes. The Facetime feature is great and the Verizon LTE is super fast. The screen and all of the apps are much more responsive than the iPhone 3 or any of the Android devices I've had. I'm sure another stunning Android phone will come around and I will just as likely switch again. For now, the iPhone 5 performs at every level. 5
So...the major downside is the non removable battery. If the phone overheats or freezes (youd have to do a forced restart) you have to remove the cover and wait up to 20minites before you're able to power it back on. The battery life is laughable, if you don't watch Netflix or play games on your device you can probably get 3days out of a single charge. I don't like the cluttered layout. I'm used to there being a central menu icon for me to open all the apps on my phone. This phone doesn't have that, ALL the app icon are displayed on the front screens, there's no shortcut.Also, it doesnt have the typical layout of the otjer blu phones like if youre in a web browser you cant change tabs, you have to press one of the icons at the bottom of your phone to find ot, its soooo inconvenient and not at all efficient. People have told me it has the look and layout of iPhones-i dont buy Apple and this only reaffirms why I will never consider one. The camera SUCKS unless you're outside. Sound is great, picture quality can be improved. I've had better BLU phones (my fave is still the Studio 5.5s) Its a great phone, phenomenal for the $127 price. 3
I bought this phone after having a blu studio 5.5 expecting something even better! I am unfortunately disappointed as this phone often freezes and crashes. The camera is supposed to be an upgrade however I find the quality to be lower. The touch screen often freezes, I'm often left tapping the screen several times before my text is added. This was so smooth on my studio 5.5The claim that the battery lasts longer is also from what I'm experiencing untrue, as soon as it's charged and used for a minute the battery drops from 100-95%The processor seems slow as well. Aside from some upgrades I'm missing my studio 5.5I'm wondering and hoping I just got a defective phone. 3
I've had this phone for about a year and a half at this point, and there are no problems with the phone itself. Obviously older generations of the iPhone run a little slower with the new OS, but that is certainly not the seller's fault. I'll probably keep this phone for at least another 6 months. 5
Phone works but had a sprint sim card in it when I received it. Had a hard time activating phone because of the sprint sim card since I have verizon service. 4
Wow. So, I'm mourning the loss f my G2X, this is a temporary fix. It's the same size which is nice. It has almost no phone memory so an SD card isn't even an option ( you Need one). The sound if fairly good, functionality is glitchy. It's made in China and prefers to be set up with a google account. Lots of time the scrolling will snag and the screen is unresponsive to the touch. I haven't been ablebto stop the hepatic feedback on the keys when texting\ typing. It can feather and be used as a WiFi hotspot which is good. It's pretty slow loading pages and downloading, I haven't taken any pics yet. It fleshy seem to want to play videos very well but that may be my phone company's hangup. If you're looking at the screen , you need to look straight on, at any angle, you can't see the screen detail. Gettingbthe back off is a struggle too but it's doable. It's plastic, not metal. The white one is white on the back, the face is black. 3
its good, exactly what is pictured 4
I received the device on time that's the only positive. The phone was completely defective, the speaker was in horrible condition it sounded like I was talking under water, really muffled. And I'd place a call and the only way I can be heard is if I'm on speaker. The charger didn't work and the battery drained way to quick and believe me I adjusted all my settings. I have to charge it 3 times a day not kidding. 1
Nice phone but way to big for my husband. So we returned it for a refund. 2
Phone dead on arrival. Only turning on for few seconds when plugged in, with battery at 100% change. Returned same day. 1
Phone had a number under it so i cant use it 😡😡😡😡 1
Still use it,came in locked,had to get a code to unlock it.It loses service and I have to keep doing a battery pull each time to reset it.Still using it but I would still recommend it as a good product. 4
I love this phone. It exactly what I wanted 5
Issues with having to reboot for WiFi and Bluetooth 2
I received this phone on 04th of March, now the phone don't work well and the clock doesn't work anymore, in addition at the apple store told me that the phone is not new but born on 2014, the supplier, the supplier don' t help me well. 1
Love it. It works like a charm. This product is highly recommended for anybody that is interested in it. Will buy again. 5
The phone had issues.first of all the upper part of the screen is discolored. When using earphones and charging or when using phone as a car ipod, the phone begins to make a loud deafening sound . The phone camera freezes too. All these continue until there's a restart of the phone. Which means you have to wait longer 2
The phone is very good..it is hard to get 4G at my job, my home etc. I have to literally walk around in order to have my 4G working. The metro pcs store said that happens alot with this phone. It's very hard to find a case that fits the phone and when i did it wasn't what I expected. 3
Kind of clunky, sometimes. I've had apps open and close by themselves to the point I've had to re-start it. This has happened about three or for times. I'm going to amend my review to, two stars and say I would NOT buy this again. Apps open and close by themselves and I just had a issue where I had a problem getting it to re-start. I would by something else at this point. 2
My 1st time using Amazon. Very pleased 5
This shipped so fast and my son was so excited to receive it earlier than expected. Great condition phone and well worth the money. Thanks for the quality product and fast shipping - it truly made his day! 5
good to great phone, great battery, cant be beat at its price but Buyer beware, the documentation is poor at best, putting a single SIM in should not be that difficult 3
not as good as vivo 5 or vivo 5r but a good phone none the less. 4
This item is not as advertised. It was to be unlocked GSM or which it is not. It is locked and requires SIM card and is a Verizon locked phone. Yes it is new, but does me no good. I do not recommend buying from this seller. 1
locked out of the phone. and it was supposed to be brand new 1
I thought I was going to get a new phone or at least like new. But I received a used phone with scratches all over. and didn't get box and any other accessories. 1
Received phone DOA. Such great specs, so bad QC. On searching noticed other are complaining about same where phone does not turn on and does not charge. Petty, I really like the specs of this phone. I will wait a little longer before giving another go. 2
Phones in great shape except the flash doesn't work wish they would have said that. 2
Bought this phone to replace my on-contract phone when it broke. This phone has so many negatives and the frustrations it causes aren't even worth the low price. The touch screen is inaccurate, the phone often freezes and slows way down and needs to be restarted. Even when I moved most of my apps to the SD card, it still didn't have enough memory to update some apps, and I don't even have that many. Today it randomly set the time back 3 hours and so the alarm woke me up early. The only good things are that the screen is pretty clear and the battery has good life. 2
I installed a SD card in this phone but the memory in this phone is always filling up and the phone unexpectedly delets all your downloaded apps. 3
Apple no longer supports this product, and it cannot be updated to the latest iOS. Buyer beware. 1
Phone worked great for like two weeks. Turns out it wasn't brand new at all, screen started ghost clicking and when I took it to the apple store to use the "warranty" it comes with they said it wasn't even new and the warranty wouldn't cover it. 1
phone came looking good except its not unlocked so i can't use it untill i get a sim card and there is no way to fully bypass sim activation 2
As much as I expected it to be - works well for me. 4
Did not work in my area so be sure to check before purchasing. It said it would work but did not. Could not even activate. 3
when i get it ,the charger is not working! 3
It was a nice and brand new phone but it wasn't factory unlocked so I had a hard time getting it to work. I had to call 3 different companies and none could provide me with an unlock code so I had to make the decision to send this phone back and settle for a different phone that is unlocked. 2
not pleased. was told sprint phone and it was not. 1
Thanks deliver on time really international unlocked 4
It works great! very pleased with this item, thank you ! 5
Ordered this iPhone 5 after much research and finding that it's the ideal phone for traveling because it is unlocked and it has the most LTE bands covered compared to the Euro/Asia GSM and US AT&T models. It has worked perfectly although currently I'm traveling to places with limited LTE coverage, so I can't say much about how fast it loads up on data connections. A few things to consider when moving from the 4 and 4s (per my experience): the wallpapers will look wrong so you'll need to get new ones especially made for the iphone 5's screen size; on the Converter that I use, I'm glad to see more of the currencies I've selected, without having to scroll down; and, the lighter weight kinda takes getting used to. It really is lighter than the 4/4s and is wonderful in that regard. For music lovers, I recommend getting the bigger memory models as the 16GB one easily get filled up. 5
I bought this phone for my 91 year old aunt. It seems very easy for to use. Would certainly recommend it. Purchased another brand senior phone same price that didn't last 2 weeks due to quality of phone screen 5
For the price it is a pretty good phone. It seems slow to me compared to the Galaxy SIII I used to have, but it is not too bad. The picture quality especially does not compare favorably, but then what do you expect from a phone that costs less than $100.00? It does most everything I need to do with a phone. The most annoying thing about it so far is that I cannot find a way to turn the notification alerts for text and email messages off while leaving the ringtone for calls on. I need to be able to get emergency alerts at night, but I do not want to wake up for every notification. For that reason, I may have to switch phones. It is a good product if you just can't afford to buy aSamsung or an iPhone. 3
pretty crappy as far as phones go, but the price is right, then again. 3
this item arrived perfectly fine, on time and it looked great on the outside but the part where it charges the phone was old, moldy and burnt, and there is no way to fix it. I wasted $250. 1
nice phone. The only problem is the memory space 4
i have to get used to it .never had a Windows. 3
Phone battery died after 4 months, I am disappointed, have to buy a new phone now. I was satisfied with the phone before that occurred. 3
We can not mute the camera and it's so slow. 2
Bad product that lasted 35 days. I believe the warranty is 30 days, so you know how convenient that was . 1
Phone looked worn and had lots of stratches. Bad condition - unacceptable. 1
I have spent an entire day and will spend much of tomorrow trying to solve this problem. Seller says this is a Verizon phone, but both Verizon and Apple say it is in fact T-Mobile. Verizon shows no record of this handset and referred me directly to Apple. Apple had a hard time figuring out how the seller got a hold of this particular model (some unusual features) and advised they are unsure if adding an Verizon SIM card will work. Anyone who has ever had to go to the Verizon store knows that takes as long as buying a new car. Not happy. 2
Showed up on time, exactly as described. Sealed packaging, charger included, earbuds as well. Looks brand new, activated within seconds thru Verizon. 4
I"m giving this phone a 3 because there seems to be (for me) a fundamental flaw in the ergonomics of the phone. The way the switches are set up they are never in the right place. Also, I seem to be constantly grabbing the phone and hitting the switches at the same time, which seems to try and shut the phone down, or take a screenshot of the phone, neither of which I like. It took me a while to figure out that when I was trying to shoot a photo I was gripping the phone in a manner that I hit the buttons and it kept shutting down.I've had similar android phones and never had this issue.The icons are cartoon-y (I put an icon pack in to create shortcuts so I didn't have to look at them) and the phone seems rather slow to respond (for example, when you change screens or shut down the open apps). The phone seems to work ok, when I'm not having trouble manipulating it, and the setup was relatively simple and straightforward (coming from another unlocked android).I would not buy the phone again, but will keep it for now as I don't want the hassle of getting another phone. My old one stopped working so this purchase, while researched, was made a bit more quickly than I might of liked. 3
Still problems with the phone that I have to get fixed but for the most part it was a good upgrade 2
It was ok but slow when it worked. After 7 to 8 moths this phone went on the blink... I may have dropped it a few times as I did with the Galaxy S" which is still working after a few years. Do not buy this phone because it is cheap -- you get what you pay for. I hope others have better experieces 2
Just as advertised. Arrived promptly. 4
Charges slowly, but good condition as promised, with a great price. 4
GRACIAS ME LLEGO EL PROCTO QUE COMPRE Y LLEVO EN EL MOMENTO INDICADO Y EN UN BUEN ENVALAJE LO RECOMIENDO SASTIFACTORIAMENTE.. 5
Excellent, i like this product 4
I ordered a blue 5c with 8 gigs, I got a beat up white 5c with 4 gigs. I'm thinking about returning it, but I can't go without a phone for long and I'm not sure how long it'll take for them to get me the right one. I'm bummed out. 1
This was supposed to be new! It's two years old! I was mislead into believing I was buying a new iPhone. Now it's messing up and I went to Apple Store and they told me its two years old and warranty is up! I got ripped of!!!!!!!!!! 1
Take a step back and think about this thing. It has an identical screen to, and RAM of, an Iphone 6 Plus, for a sixth the price. Pop in an SD for more storage. Similar or better form factor too, with nice stereo speakers and better earbuds than an Iphone. Performance is smooth, and it updated immediately to Marshmallow. What's not to like?I guess one thing. Reports around the web indicate the screen may crack under light pressure/drops. So get a case and screen protector. Because this is an older model phone, both can be found cheap at the usual suspects. 4
The iPhone works like a brand new one. I am able to listen to music, play on my apps. I am very pleased with my purchase. 5
Battery was bad from the start. I would have returned but Apple has a free battery replacement on this model number. 4
Excellent service and easy to use. Would recommend this product to others. plan to use it for a long time 5
Basically in the condition described. However, with no SIM card it could not be used out of the box. 4
Phone is OK. Only problem is home button malfunction. I have to press extra hard for it to work. 4
The 6S+ is a really incredible phone, the 4K recording and optical image stabilization is jaw-droppingly good. The screen is nice and sharp, honestly there's really nothing to complain about, other than the phone I received having a bad imei, which had to sorted out at an AT&T store. But otherwise amazing phone. 4
I'm not dissatisfied with the Energy X Plus given the extremely low price, but I'm not particularly pleased with it either.Obviously the pro's are the price and the battery size.For me, the cons are:- the 8GB onboard storage (around 4GB free to the user) coupled with the inability to move a large number of standard apps to external storage, means that I have storage capacity issues from day zero. I'm not crazy with the apps, and I don't have any games. I have basically the entire suite of google apps, my favorite texting app, the standard social media apps, some entertainment apps (Slingplayer, DirecTV, podcast app, e-book app) and some personal finance apps (my bank, my brokerage, etc). I've moved everything to external storage that the phone will let me, but none of the Google apps and none of the pre-installed apps will go. I like to set my GMail to sync the maximum amount of data to my phone (never know when you'll want to search for something while not having data access), but that's already untenable.- The phone is laggy. Don't know if it's limitations from the RAM, processor, or both, but there are often noticeable delays when opening apps. Also frequently a delay in the on-screen keyboard coming up.- It's been a little buggy. I've only been using it for a few days, but the first day I took it work, I noticed that I wasn't getting text messages (I could send but not receive; tested it with my work Blackberry). Also, the phone was getting noticeably warm, despite me not having used it in hours. I rebooted and all the texts came through, and it seemed to cool off.- It heats up. As noted above, it heated up for no reason on my desk. Also, this morning I used it to watch about 20 minutes of streaming video via Slingbox, and after about 5 minutes it had become noticeably warm in my hand - I haven't had a phone do that before.- The screen glass. I feel like it smudges more than my old phone (Moto G 2013), but I'm not 100% sure on that.Also, the fact that the glass is not Gorilla Glass is already noticeable to me. Now the following story is entirely my fault of course, but I think it's still worthwhile info for this review. I was jogging with the phone in my hand this morning, and I tripped and flung it down on concrete. It hit pretty hard, so I definitely expected to do some damage to the screen. The damage was way beyond anything I've seen on a phone before (and I tend to be rough/careless with them, that's why I buy cheap) - the cracks cover the screen top to bottom, left to right. In some areas the cracks are so dense and fine that I can barely make out lines of text underneath. Again, this is totally on me, but in case you've ever wondered if Gorilla Glass really makes a difference (and I did), my anecdotal experience is that it does make a difference.So it's basically usable as a daily phone, but before I broke the screen I was thinking of returning it. I probably would have stuck with it, but then I probably would've spent most of my time with it trying to decide how long I needed it to keeping it before I could justify to myself buying a replacement. Obviously I can't return it now. If the screen were slightly less cracked I'd probably just throw a protector on it (to ensure that no pieces of glass eventually work their way out) and keep using it. As it is, I'll probably go back to my Moto G for a while, then try something cheap again once Android 6 is out.[Any thoughts on how to repurpose my busted BLU? Its huge battery means it's going to be my new portable hotspot for traveling in Europe - throw in a cheap local data SIM, turn on the hotspot, then we can get data on our main phones without paying for international roaming while still being able to keep our US phone numbers active for calls and texting. But other than that, it's just going to be sitting in a drawer.] 3
Said that the new. Phone scratched ...Do not get in touch. Said that you can unlock ....And it is not true 1
Its OK just wasn't what I expected 3
Hard to figure out with very little instructions 2
Everything is just fine, but I hate the UI and Android is only 4.2.1. One thing that really annoys me is that they make the background image blurry. 2
I lost a Blackberry and replaced it with an updated model.I did go the Verizon (before ordering it through Amazon) who sold me a touch screen phone along with a "free" tablet which was not the easiest phone to operate AND would not accept my returning the tablet without a $175 return fee.and charging me a $10+ monthly fee to have it sit in my office. 3
Phone won't hold a charge and the volume down button doesn't work. Definitely not a quality phone. 1
i received it quickly, which was nice. And there wasn't much visible damage. Butwhat the listing failed to tell me was that the headphone jack is faulty, and only plays music outof the left headphone, no matter what wards or headphones you use. This really sums for mebecause part of there reason I like iPhones so much is the fact that they can be used for music.honestly, this blows. You're better off just buying a new one. 2
pretty crappy as far as phones go, but the price is right, then again. 3
For some reason I can't get on the Internet or get my micro sd card to sync to the watch. Need some help 2
No where does it say that this, is a global phone that has two sim cards. Couldn't work with several phone companies 2
I received this cell phone locked and I bought it unlocked, I am not satisfied. Dont sell products with features they do not have. 3
Phone did not work long but I give 5 stars to the owner he worked with me and we solve the problem. I would do business again with him.I recommend doing business with him he stands by his product. 5

This was supposed to be a Verizon phone and it was not. Very disappointed. 1
I have high anxiety so that made me very nervous purchasing an Iphone 4 off line. I had contacted the seller a number of times concerned about the shipment, but he was great at getting back with me right away. He answered every question and was very patient. I received my phone today and it is perfect there is NO damage and it works perfectly. Thank you so much for the great experiance!! 5
I bought this for my daughters birthday gift. I am having to send it back the day after her birthday. The screen backlight is jacked up. The touch screen does not work. I cannot even slide to unlock the phone because the screen won't work. Totally pissed and disappointed this is total bulls*** that i paid almost $200 just to have to return it and not to mention the sadness of my child that I am returning her birthday gift, and now have to wait to send this one back..... get credit...... order another...... wait for it to come in.....Waste of time and money. 1
It was every thing and more than I expected 5
Although this phone was supposed to work with my provider US Cellular it did not I traveled extensively to stores to find someone who could turn this phone but its system did not comply . 1
battery failure , which did not even last an hour.I want a compensation for the expense that I have to make now for the replacement of the battery. 1
I bought the phone knowing that it was refurbished. I did not look new. The glass was possibly replaced but the sides of the phone were worn, possibly from a case it was in.The phone worked for about three weeks before it crashed. Would not charge, and would not turn on. I took it to Apple and they told me that the battery only lasts 3000 cycles and that it had not been replaced on the phone. It would cost $80. to replace it!This phone is junk and was not correctly refurbished. Save your self the trouble I had, and DO NOT BUY IT! 1
It clearly was posted as a Verizon Wireless IPhone 5. It did not work at all. Verizon Wireless did not recognize the ID at all. Returning the phone for a full refund. It was a gift for my daughter. 1
Just as promised. This a great SmartPhone. Very fast interface. Just make sure you buy it "Rooted" and google Play pre-Installed. Awesome. Can't get enough of it. 5
Not bad for entry level, suprised it was discontinued to fast 4
I bought it used but it is in an excellent condition. I haven't had any problem with it. 5
Arrived quickly. Bought this a while back, and my experience with this phone it okay, kind of weird didn't have a sim card slot even though it said it would, but whatever. A good small phone that'll do the job, and a good price. 4
Very good cell phone. It is a real Unlocked International Version, I recommend it. It should be a way to have a warranty or may be we cuold have a certification that this product have been tested and it works OK. The resolution of the screen is excelent.It is not too expensive and is easy to handle. 4
So great that I thought it was brand new. Great working phone 5
i love it except the 0 key dont work when i hit it it shows up as a 6 instead 4
Phone did not work at all. It would only have power if it was plugged into a charger. It would shut off randomly, even when fully charged. 1
It was not the product that was advertised!! 1
I recommend, excellent product arrived as scheduled and as described, is unlocked and running, working with Movilnet in Venezuela. 5
I liked everything about the phone except poor call quality. Since it is 1st a phone I would think that should be no. 1 priority when designing. Its too bad because it is the perfect weight, excellent screen and snappy performance. 2
When I received this iphone 4 it was in great condition, but it somehow slipped through the cracks and the unlock and updated os was not completed. I found this out when I tried to have a prepaid service turned on and shelled out $60 for a chip that was nonrefundable. I was furious, I expected the worst to try and resolve this issue, but when I emailed him on Friday night about 6 pm western time he responded within 20 minutes. He apologized profusely and talked me through how to finish the unlock and update til 11:30. then when I installed my new chip it works fine and has been fine ever since I would definitely recommend and buy from this seller again. Things happen and he stood behind his product well past regular business hours. 5
This phone is great, BUT, I'm planing on returning them (yes, I bought two), because the bluetooth DOES NOT work on any of the two units, the connection stays on for a few seconds and it turns off.I live in California and this is a must feature to have.BTW, I updated the OS to KitKat. 2
I loved this phone it works perfectly no scrashes or finger prints but I do have a little trouble with the battery all though great apple phone! 5
Thought this was 4G LTE, but I am wrong... I am still keep it for collective ;) 2
the phone works great and it looks new 5
Phone was in great condition and works perfectly 5
I HATE THIS PHONE, much too small for me and does things I don't like it doing. I miss my Samsung Galaxy S5 1
It's OK. THe surface is very new. The speed and the baterry is Ok. I could not get its charge 4
Not happy with this phone. Not able to get but 1 gh on this phone. I have been with T-Mobile for 5 years and been very satisfied with their service. Because this phone is foreign, neither TMobile or ATT were able to get a faster internet. It is very slow and very often says it cant open the page and says retry. Also, the screen of the phone began cracking within a week of having it. This phone is only good for making phone calls and texting. 1
Because it have a fail in the screen, i have been here in the EE.UU for 8 days more, please i need an answer quickly 1
good I have problems with bb9780 phone with the trackpad, I received it on Tuesday, 9, and start using it gave me problems the center key and does not want to work, who can tell me that, it is a new phone, thanks 2
It doesn't sink to my phone. 2
It came broken. Battery is overheating. Home button doesn't work. It was a gift and it was sent far away so I can't return it anymore. Very disappointed! 1
I had been looking for a BB that I would not have to pay a lot for. This phone is great. I almost returned itit because the battery would deplete just sitting on my desk. I decided to do a system upgrade first, it upgraded to BB 10.3. My battery life has been fine ever since. I have no complaints. 4
Major cons: (not negotiable)- speaker phone function is roughly 50% of how loud it needs to be. Makes listening to music or talking to people using the speaker pointless without headphones- Bluetooth function will not even display other devices to link to. Completely inoperable Bluetooth capabilityPros:-clean screen with little scratches or dings 1
Every step of the process was perfect and easy. I received my BB the date they gave me and it works perfect 4
I bought this phone for my son. When we received it we were disappointed. The phone would shut off at 60% charge. We checked the serial number on the Apple site and discovered it was eligible for the battery replacement program. We went to the Apple store in Towson and in less than half an hour we had the phone in our hands. It is working like a gem. He loved the new IOS 8 operating system, a step up from his iPhone 4. The screen is a little larger which is also a plus. The battery life is awesome. 5
it has a glitch that drops wifi, and you can't simply turn it back on. shut it off, then reboot, and wifi capability returns. otherwise, it's been a good phone. it's used, after all. even a new one can have a glitch, over time. 4
So I bought this from the seller breed I bought the iPhone 6s Plus 128gb version for 649.99 I have had it for about 2 weeks and so far the phone is great software wise which I wasn't worried about.the phone game in a white box that said refurbished it included the charger cable and phone no earphones it had a plastic film on it and was in perfect condition on the back no marks or scratch on the back or side the front however is littered with micro scratches hundreds of them this phone probably belonged to some lady who just throw it in her purse with all her keys only one scratch about 1mm long is actually visible when the screen is on especially when displaying white all the other scratches are invisible when the screen is on so overall it's in 9/10 condition and is worth the 650 compared to the 799 for it brand new 4
This product is not big enough, but we have a durability problem as we shipped it together with Class C. 2
i love this phon, my children can not brake it :) 5
Good condition - fast shipping - works fine with minor defect in screen but overall pretty good deal 4
The battery icon is not accurate, reset too many time!!! Charging only goes up to 54% and sometime without charging say "the battery is at a 100%" and dies too many times. It better to just spend 100-300 more dollar for your money worth. 1
Phone was OK more impressed by the customer service 2
why you take from my credit carte yhe amente of 360 dollarsi send to you your apple phone because this ulockedand you telle me okwahts this 5
Phone was in great condition. New. However, the SIM card that came with it did not work so had to buy a new one. 4
I admit I was skeptical at first with an off-name brand I'd never heard of. But this phone rocks! Fast. No glitches. Great speakers. Expandable memory. Only drawbacks are it's not as bright as my old Samsung or camera quite as sharp, but they're more than good enough. I'd buy it again. Nuf said. 5
It was good when I first got it, ran really smoothly, nice size and price but soon began to deteriorate. And I mean SOON. I have had it only 6 months and am ready for a new phone. It's starting to run very slow and apps are crashing left and right. It even rebooted on me once. The camera is trash unless you are in perfect lighting and the camera angle is much too narrow. Don't buy it. I wish I had done better research on it. 2
Have a hard time activating phone because I have a Verizon carrier and normally their phone doesn't require sims cards. 4
I can not unlock the cell. It was my fault. But none can unlock it. It was a very bad busyness. 1
Cuts on and off on me on its own 3
THe phone came with a sim card of verizon and it cannot be used because need a social security from another buyer. We call Verizon and was not able to change it. Any way i cannot get it to work with the sim card of my mom carrier because i must set up using my verizon billing account. This was my mom christimas present and its being a dissapointment.Imagine my surprise when she told me she couldn't use it with her carrier because it was not unlocked, that's precisely why I bought it. 1
The phone freezes A lot and my home button barely works 1
Good phone for the price. 4
Product was exactly as described. There were no dents. The housing reflected only light wear and tear and the screen itself was flawless. The quality of customer service fell a bit short of 100%. Otherwise, my rating would have another star. From now on, I will stick to purchasing all accessories from the Apple store. 3
Good phone but battery is dieing really quick 2
I purchased this phone for my granddaughter (14) who needed more memory. So far, so good! She is very pleased with it. It arrived as promised with everything in the box. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that we've only had it a week. 4
the item arrived on time, however, I am disappointed by the product quality, as the phone looks like a child's toy. Also, it does not have a lock screen option. 3
a significant flaw in boundary, but phone has no problem 4
I purchased three phones each phone is in good condition, arrival time was great, received current update from apple, so far so good from three teenagers. 5
Llego sin la factura y me dio problemas, no me llegaron los auidifonos y no me deja cambiarle el idioma, con razon el precio 2
i like it. it works for me and the phone is new on its box :)5 5
Got what I paid for. 5
This cell phone is in Nicaragua right now, with me :); and feel it very strong and fast. I use both sim slots for Claro and Movistar, and works very well. I'm so happy for this cell phone. Thank you, it's a good product!!! Negative Note: 1) I thought that battery would give me two days at least, but it's giving me one day. 2) When I chose this product, the Amazon Website showed me that the arrival estimate date would be before december 31th, and that was the reason why I bought the cell phone, but really it arrived january 4th, half hour before to go to the airport. That I did not like. 3
They sent me the worng phone... I received a Curve.So far it seems to work fine, but the parts of the charger are wrong, they just don't fit to one another.Also there is supposed to be a memory card and it did not come with the phone either. Kind of dissapointing actually.I believe I will manage, but it is just not right and wanted you all out there to be ware. 3
Beautiful phone. Very large. I was super excited to get this. When I opened the package, everything was as it should be. . Like the phone but it's very glitchy. Sound quality in a call is not good at all. The phone randomly shuts itself off. So in the end this indeed up being a tablet for my 5 year old. 3
The phone appeared perfect when I received it... until I went to use the phone to call someone. There was the end part of a headphone cord stuck in the headphone jack and I was forced to use speakerphone in order to make any calls. I also couldn't listen to music or audiobooks. I would caution anyone to check their phones out thoroughly before accepting the product. 1
I purchased this to replace my son's stolen iphone. This phone arrived quickly, brand new in original packaging. It is working very well on our Verizon network. We are well pleased. 5
Very very very good seller i recommended 5
The phone doesn't keep time! I carry my old cracked one around so I know what time it is... Probably why I got such a good deal... 1
IT IS A CDMA PHONE THAT DOES WORK HERE IN THE BAHAMAS, I AM SO PISSED AT THIS PURCHASE! NEVER AGAIN WILL I DO THIS EVER! SO THE PHONEIS WORTHLESS HERE! 2
The phone works great! However, I had trouble getting service accepted on Tracfone because of the IMEI. Finally I talked with someone who accepted the receipt from the vendor working through Amazon.com and got the service. I have no idea why it was questioned. The phone works exactly as expected and everything was precisely as described. 4
The BB9900 phone is not a new one.1.The USB port is dirty and with mark of scratch.2.Headset is not original.Quality is bad.3.The surface of phone have mark of scratch. 2
You can barely hear when you are talking to someone 2
Unfortunately our phone started to have issues after only 2 weeks of turning the phone on so I'm not sure it was a "new" phone as advertised. The camera,video do not work. 1
It works okay. But it keeps losing the micro sd card. It keeps saying no files found. 3
First I will begin by saying I purchased this phone through Diamond Wireless, for the reason being that all the reviews are mixed up from different sellers, it was difficult to choose a reliable seller, I love this phone, it is with me 90% of the time, no problems at all! It is what was advertised, delivery was quick! It was indeed new as it was described. No problems connecting to my service provider, if you purchase through Diamond Wireless you get a 90 day store guarantee. I'm watching for the iphone 5C and will purchase from Diamond Wireless again. This phone is easy to use, I've texted, talked, played games, the screen is great! You can still see your screen when your outside! Love it! Don't have one negative thing to say. Highly recommend! I don't regret purchasing this for one minute. Is it crazy to say that I have an attachment to this phone. (: Never loved a phone so much! If you purchase through Diamond Wireless you won't be sorry. I'll say it again, highly recommend! 5
Disappointed, my phone came in yesterday with a cracked screen. 1
I love this phone. I had an ipod that died and my android phone broke. I bought this as a used phone but it was in new condition. I love the iphone because I can sync it with my ipad and use it in place of my ipod that died. I just hope the battery holds up well. 5
Received the phone after waiting 2 weeks when it was released was and SUPER excited after it was on sale for 85 bucks! I had to buy it! There is a lot to talk about lol The phone has 2 SIM cards, Slot 1 is for 4G and 3G signal while Slot 2 is 2G next to the battery which you must removed to access. Dont forget the SD card slot. Battery life is great it lasts me to the end of the day just from texts, videos and web. The screen is awesome 5.5 inches, 720p goodness! I have big hands and it is still hard for my thumb to reach to the corner of the screen, capacitive buttons to squeeze out more size I would assume. Volume buttons and the power button are located on the right side of the device, headphone jack on top and charger port on the bottom. Weight on the phone is okay though it is not balanced very well, there have been times where ive had the phone go over my index finger. (Big hands) The camera is okay 8MP with a LED light to accompany it. Front camera is 2MP which I dont really care for unless youre a selfie person or for skype for pictures youll be using those filters to help the image quality lol. The back speaker is a bit too loud in my opinion. Great phone for the price! Bloat-free, I have rooted the device with Kingo Root. Now the bad stuff oh boy..BAD!1. The smartphone did not attempt to read my 32G SD card, Ive tried MANY cards on the device and nothing. I asked for a replacement for the dead SD slot which came in to days woo! Grabbed the new replacement aaaaaand IT DID NOT WORK! Really frustrating since I have tons of music on those cards.2. On both devices Ive had the same problem. The battery seems to be picky about what phone charger can and CANT charge it! What the...3. While charging, the top half of the huge screen becomes unresponsive! Bringing down the notification bar at the home screen is almost impossible while charging. (Maybe its the voltage coming into the device??)4.So MANY bugs on the UI, such as the swipe lock screen. I touch the bubble swipe to the right and the it unlocks and locks immediately! to access my home screen I must go through my notifications bar and menus menus menus. Another example, the dial pad, dialing numbers lags really bad.5. Im not sure if it is specific apps (YouTube etc.) or the wifi hardware, but while watching 720p videos they seem to buffer too often. Making HD videos almost unwatchable. It could be the 4.4.2 KitKat OS that is contributing to 95% of these problems and hopefully they will be fixed with the 5.0 Lollipop upgrade which the ETA on that is unknown. Otherwise its a GOOD starting phone with decent specs but if problems continue to arise I might will return this phone and spend 75 bucks more for a better upgrade. I could bump to 4 stars if 5.0 Lollipop comes in. 3
The phone is OK, there have been some sound issues during calls. 3
perfect fit in my Daughter in laws lifestyle she loves it 5
The phone looked like it went through a blender. Deep scratches all over the blue part. Turned the phone on and there was nothing but a line down the side of it. Returned for refund. 1
This was a great phone it's time but my 5s was defective. I bought a SE and couldn't be happier with it. 1
Loved it even with the few chips in the screen 4
Everything was fine. It is a good device but, less than 2 months after the purchase, the screen shutted down and didnt work anymore. So I really dont know what happened and I dont know if I would recommend it. I think All depends on your luck. 2
came really fast and matched description perfectly 5
The phone was not as described . 1
It isn't new and can't be used because it is either stolen or tied to someone who is delinquent on their account! 1
This is a basic phone. It does what it's supposed to do. It's fairly small for larger hands. The construction is cheap, but considering the price, it's about what I expected. Haven't tried the dual SIM capability yet, but when I do, I'll leave an update if it doesn't work well. Instructions are sparse, but hey, it's a simple phone. If you can manage an iPhone, you can manage this. On the good side, the battery seems to last for days. Volume is decent. Internal phone memory is only 15K (as in kilobytes). If you want to do anything, you'll need an MicroSD card. It says it will take up to an 8GB card. I had a 32GB card lying around so I popped it in. No issues, well not yet anyway. If you want to change the background image, use a picture that is 220 (wide) by 176 (high) and save it as a .bmp file. No other format seems to work. The radio works. There's an antenna you can pull up for better reception, but it's flimsy and looks like it will break easily. It's really not necessary anyway. The phone receives analog TV signals, if which there are exactly zero in the US. Other countries (like Mexico) haven't made the switch yet, so you never know. Anyway, the TV is useless in the US. If you need a cheap phone, especially for your kids, this is the one. Try using "PureTalk USA" for service. Very cheap, uses AT&T's network. Again, good for kids starting out, or maybe seniors (like me) that don't need a smartphone.UPDATE: Removing two stars. The battery indicator is useless. It reports a full charge right up to the point where the battery dies. I'm a regularly a light phone user, but when I need it, I need it. If I can't tell how much juice is left in the battery, that's not good. Now I'll have to be sure I keep it on the charger every chance I get. No, wait...I won't do that. Instead, I'll start looking around for something else.UPDATE 2: OK, I was wrong about the battery indicator. It does work. The three bars on the battery indicator are light green when charged, and white when discharged. I had to use a magnifying glass to actually see the difference. What kind of genius made the two colors so close? Anyway, I'll give back one star because it does work--you just need excellent vision or a magnifying glass to see it. 3
I gave it 4 star... it was a excellent 4
Product of poor quality. I bought and brought me to use outside the USA, so it took me time to be able to test the device. To my surprise, the microphone did not work and all so the battery does not recharge properly. As I am not in the USA, I had to arrange myself the repairs to use the device which has cost me about US $ 60.00.Apple iPhone 4S 16GB Unlocked - White (Certified Refurbished) 1
Cheap price, cheap product. Buy a model that is a year old, but a brand name, and you will do better than with this. Cracked screen inside of a month, way too little storage, and the camera does not work well.Does make phone calls and texts, therefore no 1 star rating. 2
My mom loves her iphone5s for Mother's Day gift. 5
Slightly longer batter doesn't trump s*** phone. 2
Back Camera quality horrible. There's no way it's 13 mp. This is such a downgrade from my galaxy note 3. The phone comes preloaded with trash apps that slow the phone down. The emoji graphics aren't great and there's no video call option on the phone. And there's no way the space they claim you get is there sd card Inserted and all. Front camera okay. I guess it was good for the price. I believed that by having specific details and functions be mandatory that this would be a good choice reading on the spec. I was wrong 2
This refurbished phone was a piece of junk. Had to use speaker to talk to people and the home button didn't work. 1
I think I brought this refurbished for my mom, she loved it and it had no faults. No sign of wear and tear and no faults with the programs or phone overall. She has had it since 2012 up to last Christmas when I begged her to upgrade lol. This was a good buy and came unlocked as it says so she could use it with our local phone provider here in Jamaica 4
This affordable smart phone really surprised me. The software is a little generic, but it does what you expect from a unlocked device. I would recommend. Iwouldnt recommended rooting this phone unless you truely know what ur doing. Once rooted don't do the wireless update. Like I did even after reading forum that advised against it. I soft bricked my phone. Which caused it to get stuct on a bootloader loop. Eg. Stuck on phone logo. Their are a lot of good tools on the net to reverse this problem if you understand the concepts. Unlike me I don't really understand the rooting process. Just wanted to be able to get browser apk to install. But anyways if you do get stuck on bootloader loop.... Visit needrom.com their is all the tools and info to turn ur dead droid into a zombie droid. Also you will have to create a free account to be able to DL ROMs and tools to flash your phone. Also check fourms @ android area51 and don't forget your friends @ xda a lot of good info. I hope this helps someone cause finding info on this phone is few and far between. But I enjoy this phone. And theirs really no need to root this phone. Like I said I wanted the old web browser. But its not worth soft bricking to get it 4
Just over a year and there's still no android v5.0 Lollipop software upgrade as advertised on amazon.com and on the Blu Bold Like Us box..The navigation doesn't work on this phone because the GPS signal keeps dropping (AT&T) anywhere I try it.Now I need to replace it the microphone stopped working, so I got one years use out of it. 3
Phone was from Japan - could not use in the states even though the claim was that it was a brand new, unlocked phone and could be used anywhere. It was actually registered to a Japanese phone number and an account that was open. Very disappointed. 1
1. Battery keeps overheating every time it is put to charge2. The front buttons (answer & end call) are rising up *angry face*3. other than that the phone is good 4
Came in the mail a few days early, and it works perfectly. 5
The product was okay the GPS keep losing signal and while you were texting or typing on Google the phone always reverted back to the home screen so it was okay but definitely a lot of flaws in it and the camera did not maintain Focus will either neither camera front or rear. The screen quality also was not that good the colors were washed out and he needed at least a 1080 screen or an amoled would have been better. 2
Be sure to check out to confirm the phone is fully working within the 30 days. If not, no refund or credit. We purchased a phone and it completely died within (6) months. Should have just bought it through my cell company. I feel for the price I paid, it should work a lot longer. 2
nice phone for the price. 3
This phone has a defect. The sound is very low and no matter what I do I can barely hear it 3
This was a stolen or blocked phone. Good thing is I was able to return it with full refund 1
Refurbished but not properly because there is not work microphone 🎤 properly and must talk throw the speaker, at service center say OMG you must change more the one MIC 2
Good phone if only used just for calling. It's too slow for anything else. Can't use some apps because of the outdated operating system 2
I like this smartphone, good quality very very smartphone, the color, pretty, 5.5 inch perfect in the hand, I recomend this smartphone very very smart. Thank a Amazon and the other seller of china. 5
The power button does not work, so I can't get updates etc. It is a real pain. I can return it-but then I have no business phone. 2
My phone is already acting up. Shuts off randomly and over heats. 1
____I have owned every iPhone since the 3G model. Every year for 7 years I have upgraded. In my household is a slew of Apple products from iPad’s, MacBook’s to iPhones. My household now has 3 new iPhone 7 models. But I am also a bigtime Android owner with several high end Android phones and tablets from various manufactures. The thing is, my family loves high end tech and appreciates quality regardless of brand, make or model.I follow the mobile tech world religiously and stay abreast of all new technologies and products from all companies, big and small. I watched the Keynote on September 7th live and listened to Apple pitch the iPhone 7. I pre-ordered the 7 at 3am EST on the 9th so I could have it in my hands on the 16th.But then I came to a realization about the 7 and 7 Plus that struck a chord with me. All the new tech on the 7 is not new at all, in fact has been on several phones in some cases since 2011. I also realized that the tech inside the 7 only matches mid-range android versions. If you take the Apple logo off the back and re-brand this under Android, it would not be a $770-$970 device but a $350-$550 device given the hardware and features it has. In fact, Apples net cost on the 256GB 7 Plus is only $226 yet retails for $970. This is disturbing to me, not just the 403% profit margin, but the whole effort into making an average iPhone for today’s standards. Apple use to be a leading-edge company with innovations that took the industry by storm. Today, in 2016, Apple no longer excites me. Sure the integration between software and hardware is not matched by any tech company today but the gap is rapidly bridging. At such a premium price, I think after this version, considering there is nothing innovative about it and retails for double what other companies offer, has me moving away from Apple in 2017. I don’t know about you, but the old saying goes the bigger you are the harder you fall. Bye bye Apple, time for a divorce.___Update 9/22/2016: In response to criticism about my review:Apple certainly raised the bar on smartphones and has kept that bar up. My expectations are high for the iPhone and as such when they are not met, as with the iPhone 7/7 Plus, my letdown is all that much harder. The IPhone 7/7 Plus are great phones do doubt, but do I think they are $970 great? Certainly not. Apple (could have) done so much better with the iPhone 7 and didn't. That is my letdown.When it comes to raw processing power Apple wins in controlled and application tests. But in 2016/17 nearly all phones are fast enough, heck even the iPhone 5s of 4 years ago is fast enough, but today, shaving milliseconds off app switching times or load times goes beyond the human brains capacity to keep up. It's not about pure brawns, ecosystems, cultures, or social image, it's about value and making life's tasks easier.Apples multi-million dollar 12 step polishing process to get the Jet black phone to shine is not nearly as important as making it available at affordable prices and offering cutting edge features that make my whole reason for existing plausible.If I walked into my Honda dealer and saw the new 2017 Accord had a price tag of $110,000 I would walk out immediately, it's about value. Even if the Accord blew the doors off its competition I still walk because its value is lost.Truth of the matter is even India's $4 phone gets the job done, and that's a fact.Lets examine the iPhone 7/7 Plus components.CPU:The A10 Fusion chip in the Apple 7’s is manufactured by TSMC, (Samsung made the A9 chips in the 6s). It is a quad-core 16nm big.LITTLE soC running at 2.34GHz tops, 1.3GHz nominal with 3GB of LPDDR4 RAM, (2GB on the 4.7- inch version). Similar chips and even more powerful quad-core, hexi-core and even octa-core chips run in various far less expensive phones using 4GB to 6GB of LPDDR4 RAM running in dual channel mode. The one thing Apple does do extremely well is manage its RAM which is all software based. The Linux driven Android software has not got there yet. Yes, this is an advantage Apple currently holds over the competition but one that is vastly slipping away.LCD:The LCD panel is also on level with submarket phones. The LPIPS 1080 panel is rated at 401P, 1300:1 contrast, (1400:1 on the 4.7 inch), 625nits and P3 Cinematic color gamut at 125%. Let’s examine this. With the exception of the P3 color gamut, every $200 and above phone has this or better. I can list a slew of phones all under $300 that have LPIPS, (or even better OLED), 1080 FHD, 1500:1 to infinite contrast ratio, 500-700nits and sRGB color gamut at 100%. The Neo-LPIPS panel supplied on Huawei products is nearly as excellent as the S-AMOLEDS produced by Samsung and supplied on phones starting at $150. Apple has been in talks with Samsung about supplying s-AMOLED panels for the iPhone for 3 years, I believe the iPhone 8 will receive this panel next year. The cinematic P3 rating and higher brightness output (nit) was given to the iPhone 7’s to help make the photos pop on-screen better.CAMERA:The Bokeh effects of the dual camera system on the 7 Plus can easily be duplicated in Post with software. I won’t argue and say the camera implementation on the iPhone 7’s is not excellent, sure it is. But the Leica dual camera system on the P9 and Honor 8 are just as good and offered on devices that match or surpass other technical features and cost half as much. The camera system on the S7 is excellent too. LG has excellent implementations on the older G4, G5 and new V20. The LG G4 that can be had for $150, has a 2.1GHz hexi-core CPU, 3GB RAM, 5.5-ich QHD screen, 32GB on board memory, 128GB SD slot, and a 16MP camera that shoots in RAW and even by today’s standards is excellent shooter.SOFTWARE:With iOS 10 we can now delete stock Apple apps. This is Apples way of saying they understand their app versions suck and no one uses them or want them. We can replace them with much better 3rd party versions that also happen to have equally good Android versions. In the 30 days iOS 10 has been on the iPhone 7, (9/16 to 10/12), it has had two major updates, v10.0.1 and v10.0.2. Let’s not forget the epic failure of the lightening headphones, Gallery App and extensions crashing. This is a bug fix every two weeks. Also in the 30 days I have owned my iPhone 7 I have had to perform two hard resets for Apple Apps locking and seizing up, one was Safari the other iMessages. At one point I had to get Apple support on the phone. In 2016/2017 Android v7.01 (and 6.0.1) are just as stable and efficient and maybe even more so, but my point is there is no advantage one over the other, at this stage it is simply a matter of personal preferences. We can’t argue that iOS is superior to Android because surely is not. With almost all apps being cross-platform functional communications between iOS and Android is now transparent and we can fully immerse in both worlds without any effects.SAMSUNG:I have given the same review about Samsung products. Samsung is by no means the Messiah of Android. Their products are matched or outdone with less expensive variants as well. Samsung will have a very difficult time recovering from their $1B fiasco this year. When a company starts selling of its stock interest and shares on partner companies and liquidating core assets you know they are in trouble.STORAGE:The reason Apple does not offer external SD storage is twofold. One, the SD license is held by Microsoft and Apple would have to pay royalties to Microsoft in order to use it. Apple will never pay royalties to any company – royalties are paid to Apple not the other way around. Two, Apple would lose control over file sharing.APPLE TRIVIA - DID YOU KNOW:Did you know the iPhone has many Samsung components? Samsung has made the CPU/GPU for several generations of iPhones. This year with the 7 Samsung supplies the RAM chips and ROM chips. Samsung is rumored to supply its s-AMOLED screens next year for the iPhone 8.Did you know Google pays Apple $100 million/year to have Google set as the default search for Safari? Google also pays Apple a percentage for every click too.Did you know Google invests more money and R&D for its iOS apps over its own Android counterparts? Apps like Hangouts, Google Maps, Chrome, Google Now etc., get updates and new releases before its own native Android versions.Did you know that Amazon hosts the iCloud storage for Apple? Amazon is the largest cloud host in the world providing several companies with its AWS servers. Apple pays Amazon hundreds of millions of dollars every year for its cloud servers.Did you know Apple refused to pay Corning its royalties to use the Gorilla Glass name so calls its glass ‘Ionized strengthened’ even though it is Corning Gorilla glass version 4.Did you know the iPhone 6/6s also has water resistant features? Apple never published or made public this feature for liability reasons but the 6/6s has resins and glues inside to protect vital components from water damage. If you have ever dropped your 6/6s in water usually within a couple hours its up and running at 100%.___Thank you for reading___ 2
not to bad once you play with it a bit. i got it to use as an mp3 player well working around the house that i wont need head phones for and play via a blue tooth speaker. it wont sync and also i have to get a new bar for the watch band witch came (new today still in box) broken 2
It's used and there is some privete information in it. I can't recover the PIN 2
I doesn't keep the charge I want to return back 1
First the goods.Great screen, very bright and smooth. HD videos are fantastic looking. The tactile input from the vibration is very nice and solid. Easy to setup and get going. Expandable memory with 32gb storage built in and 3gb RAM which does a lot for apps. Runs very smooth on all fronts. Feels solid and the gorilla glass is a good 'whoops i dropped my phone' insurance.The meh bits.Camera is good on paper. Use is shotty. Does not have a slight pause after pressing the button to get focus back and results in blurry pictures.The bad bits.Every now and then expect to do a factory reset on your phone. Why, you ask? The text program glitches out and you will find yourself wondering where all your conversations went, why you can't open new texts and why you can't see texts you send. You are actually sending texts, but the program does not show any conversations at all. The fact you have to consider a third party texting app just so you can avoid having to factory reset your phone makes this phone not really worth getting. 2
My phone broke a month after I received it. Whole phone just shut completely down 1
The phone was published as "international unlocked", but NOT work with all carrier 1
The phone arrived on time and was working, however, the item is posted as used very good bu the phone came with many scratches/ small dings on the back of the phone on the colored part. I have t admit the screen was perfect without a scratch so that was great. I gave it a lower rating because it made me believe it would be good as new with maybe one scratch. Also, there is no sim card in the phone so you can't activate it until you go to the store and sometimes it may take some pushing to get the employees at the store to give you the card because they don't get commission on the small card. 2
I was sold a failed unlock phone that was no longer compatible with sprint. Not only this but the device arrived greasy and dirty. 1
I just bought this and its not unlocked!! How do I get my money back. Highly disappointed!! 1
The phone arrived and the touch on the screen is messed up. :( It works okay sometimes but most of the time if I touch something, it reads like I touched another part of the screen and something else opens instead. Very frustrating. 1
it doesnt even cute on now 2
DO NOT buy this phone. Within two weeks of owning it the headphone jack already had a problem and the phone will not charge. When I discovered the headphone jack problem, my left earbud was not working. I tried several pairs of headphones to find that the jack was the problem. I looked up possible ways to solve the problem only to find that I would have to replace the whole lower part of the phone. Secondly, the phone began acting funky yesterday. The phone had been charging for a while and when I checked it, it only said it had been charged up to 8%. I had to turn off my phone and turn it back on to find it was at 40%. And right now it will not charge. It told me that my charger was not a supported accessory. The phone has been plugged in all night and still hasn't charged. I have not tried a different charger yet, but I shouldn't have to. This was a waste of money. I do not blame Apple, because I've bought from them directly before and it was wonderful, but I would not recommend buying from this seller. If you want and IPhone just save up your money and buy directly from Apple. It's worth it. 1
it works as a phone 5
Whole experience was great. Product was totally as described and worked great. 5
Received as advertised: Verizon Wireless Apple iPhone 5c. Took it to the Verizon store and had them insert a SIM card and it works great. No complaints. 5
Although I love the slide out keyboard (my reason for getting this phone ), I am not able to use the Internet or send files by text. Now I need another phone 2
This phone worked great for 6 months. The battery life was phenomenal, the systems were all simple to use, no issues. Then, the nightmare began. At first, the battery would die once it hit 95%. I would have to put the phone back on the charger and wait for it to reboot up and charge back up to 100, then less than an hour later it would happen again. Eventually it stopped allowing me to do anything at all. Alcatel has no real support, save a call number that will not do anything for you. I tried replacing the battery, but same issue continued. I took it into a local repair shop and after three weeks they gave it back to me and refunded all charges, telling me that it must be a software issue, because the battery and charging ports work fine. However, because Alcatel doesn't have any real customer troubleshooting or service, I have no way to fix it. There is a reason people buy from trusted companies with well established reputations for troubleshooting and repairs. Save yourself the headache and get a Moto G or just sell your soul and get an IPhone. You shouldn't have to drop $250 on something that'll last less than six months. 2
The phone condition was good and it works well. 5
It's not what I wanted 1
This phone works perfectly. I actually bought it for my grandson to watch pbs kids without using our phones. 5
The phone is nice itself but it just don't stay hook to wifi it unhook itself 3 stars for the phone itself 3
I needed a new phone and just something as fast and durable for the time being, So far this phone been working good, I don't like the fact that it has a logo for the company it came from even tho it's unlocked, I didn't like that, Everything works fine, The battery dies somewhat a bit too fast, For me personally it last about 7 hours and that's with using BBM, Twitter, Facebook etc, So with that in mind it should last twice as long without using those applications, Other then that it works simple fine and I was satisfied with my purchase, Just did not like that logo of the company, But great product otherwise, It came with a charger and a guide battery and the battery door, Did not come with a USB cable which I find was a bit of a con, Good thing I have other Data Cables, So if you're looking for a phone to use for a few months or just something casual to keep in contact, I believe this is a good buy, I would give it a 4 out of 5 for customer service. 4
This phone is very sleek and solid in performance with 3GB RAM for good price. Battery efficiency is so good and will give standby backup of two days. Good phone for the one who looks for affordable price!! Android pay app will not be compatible with this device.. 4
Well, there is not much to say about an iphone when you have been using them since the first generation came out. There are not a lot of differences between this model and the iphone 4, just Siri a little bit of speed and more weight. I bought this one for a cousin and she loved it. I have the iPhone 5 and find its screen, besides being taller (not wider) shows richer colors. 5
Poor battery life.rest all is good. BB is designed for business use but if the battery dies in d middle of a meeting whats the use of having a phone.this is my last Blackberry handset.. henceforth no Blackberry for me. 2
not bring hands-free cell came with the case open and fingerprints on the screen. 3
I thought the screen might have better res. and phone overall would be easier to set up/use. Was not super enthused about having to remove two xs parts with the tiny tool provided, just to put a SD or SIM card in the phone.I dont appreciate these parts because although removing them might be easier then removing the whole back, those tiny pieces are so easy to loose. Also, I wish it had came with a clearer more illistrational instruction set, and temp, clear cover for the screen like my last two phones have had, but I do like their software, and think this is a great value on a phone for the asking price. 3
I have had some erratic incidents that I had not had with my previous 5s. Eventually they went away, but it has caused me to question the product or the source a bit. 3
Could not use my AT&T sim in it and it is not a good competitor to the Galaxy Gear. It sounds like a kids toy starting and not a Tech Guys Toy. 2
After buying this phone for a friend, she loved how it worked but it cracked when slipping out of a chair and falling 11 inches and it ruined the ENTIRE mid section of the input area, which denotes something of a "cheap" screen to me. When we ordered parts to repair it, we found that the wiring for the screen was so tucked and glued it was a lost cause and we had to just throw the phone in the trash (and i replace laptop LCDs for a living along with a few phones). It was just too much of a hassle so we just bought a different phone.This phone could be called a "nice" throw-away phone, kinda like the ones you get in Dollar General. Use it, you will enjoy it, but protect it like it's an infant child because it will break at the drop of a dime (so to speak) and it's a serious hassle to even get into with all the gluing going on inside of it. 2
The only phone from BLU I ever bought that didn't give me any major problems. But it is kind of slow and has poor battery life plus slow to charge. 3
I brought iPhone 6 pulse from amazon it's really good for me 4
The Idol 3 has been provided an amazing experience for me at a third of the cost of some of the top-tier phones available on the market. At $250 this smartphone provides all of the functionality I would want from a daily driver and there are only a few nit-picky features (a better camera, ir blaster, wireless charging and dedicated shutter button) missing that I would need to have to "upgrade" away from this phone. The previous phones I have used in order are the Galaxy Note II, Moto X, and the Sharp Aquos Crystal and this phone blows them all out the water.Design and Size:Simply put, this phone feels great in the hand. The symmetrical design and lack of capacitive keys really make the phone seem much smaller than other phones of the same screen size. At 5.5" this phone is relatively easy to use one-handed (and I have average to small-sized hands for a guy). It is also as light or lighter than my previous phones. It does not have "premium build quality" with metals or glass, but personally that has never mattered to me. Besides the customization of designing my Moto X nothing really stood out as "me" when looking to purchase other phones. But besides all that, the phone looks great. The brushed metal look works for me, and since it is plastic it works for my wallet as well. I have never had an issue with dropping this phone or it feeling awkward to use.Screen:This screen is great. It is 1080p, videos play well, colors pop, and I can take it out in the middle of the day and actually see the screen in direct sunlight. The size of the screen also makes reading text easier and videos feel immersive. It doesn't quite live up to the borderless Aquos Crystal experience, but there is no light leakage on this screen and it does better at an angle. Also, the screen responds well to the touch, even with a tempered-glass protective covering over it. That is something that cannot be said with the Sharp Aquos Crystal.Sound:I never realized how much having the front-facing speakers would improve the quality of gaming and video experiences. Being able to lay down the phone and watch a video without the output sounding muffled or indistiguishable from gibberish is awesome. I find myself watching videos on my phone more than ever because of the audio features. Additionally, the included JBL earbuds are a nice touch and the JBL Mix audio app is one of the coolest I have ever used. I honestly find myself making playlists just to work on my mixing and transitions between tracks. Just check out some videos on youtube to see the app for itself because honestly a description here won't do justice to how fun the app is.Operating System and features:Comes out of the box with lollipop and just updated to version 5.0.2 today. As with any android phone customization is really limitless so I won't spend time on that here. The reversible feature is pretty neat, and merits me echoing other reviews. If it was not for the button placement or the design of my screen protector there would be times when I pull my phone out of my pocket and have no idea it was upside-down. The fluidity with how it works really stands out for functionality, and I am suprized this has not been a feature in phones prior to the Idol 3.Battery Life:There are phones that will get you longer battery life, but I have never been able to kill my phone in just one day of daily use. I am not implying that it will be at 30% when you wake up the next day, but it is definitely an upgrade over my first gen Moto X. Not having to find a charger immediately when I get home from work provides a little more freedom to the daily grind. I know that usage varies by person, but outside of gamers I don't think moderate to light users will have too many gripes about battery life.Conclusion:Buy this phone. If you want a great experience at a great price, buy this phone. One of my best decisions in a while to take the plunge. Being an unlocked phone carrying no carrier bloatware and built in apps like Mix, File Explorer and Wifi Display actually adding to the experience, Im starting to see less and less reason to ever sign up for a carrier contract again. If you need financing options, there is an Amazon store card for that. At $250 though, you won't find yourself in much of a financial bind if you decide to pick one up. 5
Gave me a phone that was locked and it wasn't done being paid for . Highly upset 1
I got this to give as gift. It looks good for the price but feels cheapish. Well, for this price you can get something else also and a better name brand. It worked for few months and is slow now. The screen broke one day. I do not know how. 3
The phone I received is model number 5017O-2AALUS1, which meets the description of the "Global" Pixie 3 4.5" -- with one notable exception: It has 4.28GB of total memory, not 8GB.I'm including screen shots from "Settings-Storage" and "Settings--About Phone" which show the model number and actual memory of my phone. This was a disappointment since I need and expected 8GB. I have since tried without success to find a Pixi 3 4.5" with 8GB of memory.While it is too limited to be my primary phone at home, I am keeping it to use while traveling in Europe. In addition to the 4G LTE frequencies used by AT&T, T-Mobile, and other GSM operators on this side of the pond, it has the primary European 4G LTE frequency. My home phone does not.On the whole, this is a suitable phone for beginners, those on a budget, and anyone who doesn't need enough memory to run a lot of apps. The screen resolution is less than on more expensive models, which means text and images appear larger. On a 4.5-inch screen, that's a nice benefit for people like me who are a tad hard of seeing. 3
the microphone of the phone dont work, not able to hear in a call, just with speakers. 1
This phone was decent for a few months and one day it started glitching and completely stopped working all together. Has quite a few bugs that need to be worked out so others dont experience total shutdown as I did. 2
I got this phone for my pre-teen kid.It worked well and held a charge for a very long time.Then she sat on it and it broke.Yeah... < $20 for the phone... but it lasted a month.Not recommended. 2
I love this photo unlocked GSM like new 5
Phone was NOT NEW as described. Phone stopped working after 8 months. When I took it to the Apple store they told me my phone was a "Franken-Phone" made up of parts from many old phones. Apple will not repair it and I seriously doubt I will see my money again. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!! 1
I was forced away from Blackberry by my company and tried a few of the all touch screen phones and ultimately came back to this. I missed the keyboard so much. It is a shame developers won't make more apps for the Blackberry because it is a great product. I was able to sideload Good For Enterprise so I could still get my company email on the device. It isn't quite as good as native emails but good enough for that. It is nice they finally partnered with the amazon app store but I really wish developers would make more native Blackberry apps (I don't blame them for not doing it though as we Blackberry lovers are a dying breed) 4
Worked OK for awhile now every time I tap the back it shuts off 1
Got exactly what was asked for... so far no problems. 4
Came in great condition. No SIM included and the information booklet was missing, as well as a few dints. However this was as expected so overall I am stoked! 4
Good product. But beware on pricing. I bought this in early December, and 5 days later Amazon reduced the price by $20! Unlike the better B&M stores, unless it is a TV Amazon will NOT provide any price adjustment or offer refunds based on their new price. I chatted, called and talked to several supervisors and their only solution was to mail the product back, then re-order the phone at the lower price. I kindly pointed out that shipping costs and my time would be more than the $20 and it seemed a better solution to offer a "store credit" to a long time Prime member. Long story short, no dice. Sine the phone is activated already I am not about to return it and start the activation process all over again either.So, just know that while Amazon is eager to take your money if the price goes UP, they will not offer any relief if within as little time as one week they reduce the price (in this case by 25%). So while the phone is a good investment, not sure about Amazon customer flexibility. 4
Came in. Early but terrible! Would't get it unless you can work it properly. It didn't even come with a charger. When said it would be provided. Also it doesn't read my SIM card and won't let you use it like a regular phone. A SIM card is needed to get pass set up. 1
Product works great unfortunately several areas in the design were limited such as water / bean capacity 4
When I bought this a while ago, I was buying a 32GB phone. Then when I got the phone, the phone was reported stolen. The seller immediately responded to my claim and he sent me a new phone. Except the new one was only a 16 GB phone and it was hard to hear people when I was on a call. I also paid the amount for a 32 GB phone and ended up with a 16 GB phone that came with a bonus "box." Then the hearing part went completely out, so I just bought a new phone from Verizon. 1
Just an average phone - it works well but nothing special 3
Honestly so far I really am pleased with it. I still am not sure about everything it does and I get confused. But that's because Inc not the best with technology. It did come in a box that wasn't the original but it looked similar. Very good condition, no scratches or dings. It was indeed the 42mm Watch face and it came with a white band. Over all I am happy and new it would have cost me $349. So I saved over $100. I'm happy! 4
I unlock this phone on the site [...] for use in my country. 125 USD. 1
I LOVE the size and you can barely feel it in your pocket but the connectivity is really bad. I lose signals pretty often and it can be annoying. Was almost a perfect phone. 3
Doing its job well & is as described thank you very much. Give more information though on description of the product. Just Got charge no ear phones. 3
Was great till I dropped it lol 5
not a good experience, i can not return it 1
I played with the phone for a couple of hours after we go it activated on the carrier. It kept showing the Eastern time zone and would not change the date format per the system settings. After adding the Google account, it would not update the contacts or calendar. Finally, it kept giving me an error when I tried to update the software. For a few dollars more, you can get one of the other Dash line like "C Music" which I had no trouble with. 2
It got supposed be unlocked but one more time what have been offered is not exceeded... Terrible.. Now i had to take this Item to another Store here in Caracas to Lock it Out... Moreover waste of money and time... 2
this item was defective returned for credit 1
I bought this refurbished phone because mine was old and wouldn't hold a charge for more than a 4-5 hours and I didn't want to spend a ridiculous amount of money on a brand new phone. I was skeptical after reading some reviews, but the refurbished phone works great! No visible damages, either. The only problem is that it didn't come with a sim card. I called my carrier to have one shipped, but they needed some number that was not included with the phone so I had to go into the local store to have a sim card installed. 4
Everything good. However they didn't bring me the tool to open the chip conteiner 4
The phone was marked stolen/lost when I recieved it but there was no problem getting a refund. 3
Love the phone, I recommend buying! 5
Thank you mobile spree for accepting my return with no questions asked. The product was as advertised I will definitely purchase from you again. Thanks Pete 5
Not compatible with metro pcs or T-Mobile network,don't waste your time and money on buying this. 1
Phone arrived in perfect condition and as expected. However, these phones are not well built and I have had to have several repairs made to the phone without inflicting actual damage. Sometimes my screen won't work, the home button is falling out, vibration sometimes will suddenly not work - all within the first few months of having the phone. I have used iPhones for several years but this will be my last one. Making the switch as soon as possible. 3
Come without charger and headphone 4
I should of listened to everyone else that said the battery is terrible. It dies within an hour after a full charge. 1
Got it in great shape. Love it. A faulty charger cable caused a bit of a scare, but otherwise, got a quality product for a decent price. Very satisfied. 4
is a great phone, I made the purchase and the phone really is new. the seller is very responsible and careful, because when a problem communicating to introduce myself, did everything possible to help 4
It is great to receive a phone that was affordable its so easy to use screen is easy to see 5
My daughter had broken her phone and i thought it would take weeks to get to our house but it was just a few days. Great Job.... 5
The shipping was fast and iPhone looked in great condition. However the 3.5 mm headphone jack failed to deliver any output , the sound was garbled with noise. I wanted to take this out of United States, I am glad I checked this before I gifted this. 2
It looks brand-new, no visual flaws or scars, functions well. No complains yet. 4
Excellent smartphone but the battery is worst ! 2
Though it's only been 24 hours, I am super impressed by the Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 4.7 inch smartphone (name is terrible though). This is a great time for affordable, mid-range, unlocked, no-contract smartphones. This phone slots in between the two models of the 3rd generation Moto G. Other than the RAM (1.5 GB vs 2 GB), it's very similar in specs to the more expensive Moto G model but at the price of the less expensive Moto G model (for now). I bought the Alcatel instead of the Moto G because it has a smaller, sleeker design (4.7 inch vs 5.0 inch screen and half as thin) and terrific front-facing stereo speakers. The screen is sharp and the speakers are very loud! The Idol 4.7 looks similar to the old Google Nexus 4, which I owned, but slimmer and sleeker (and more plasticy). It's a little smaller than an iPhone 6 despite having the same screen size, and about as thin. The Moto G has much more durable build and is waterproof, and I suspect, better support. Both the Alcatel and the Moto G make great backup or travel phones, and also starter smartphones for teens. They can also be very solid everyday phones for most consumers. As the wireless companies move away from contracts and subsidizing phones, I wonder whether more folks will start moving to some of the mid-range phones. Many folks have been paying $600-800 every two years for new phones without really knowing it. Perhaps Apple will be safe with its high-end clientele--at least for now--but companies like Samsung are very vulnerable. These $200 phones are more than good enough for the typical user--with performance comparable to the flagship phones from two years ago. I worry a bit about durability given the materials it's made out of. I should probably buy a case, but the phone is so sleek and attractive that I kind of don't want to put one on. Five stars for the amazing value! The Quality to price ratio for this phone is terrific. 5
The product is good and I'm satisfied but what I don't understand why there's no original Apple box? 4
Easy to move to new AT&T non contract account. Charger wasn't iphone brand but works great. We read bad reviews on this refurbished phone, but phone exceeded our expectations. 5
Purchased phone SIM card missing and there was no sound. Quality awful! Response was they sell a lot of phones and tested does not seem likely 1
not too crazy with the Phone and windows....so not as I expected. 2
the phone never gets fully charged .... and take all day to charger 1
I'm happy with my iphone.thank for my salesman arrived on time are incredible.the iphone is everything I expected. I love it 5
The phone works but the charger does not! 2
Very nice phone for the money but maybe it is not ready for the market yet.The phone works fine with good specifications. Camera takes good pictures with a lots of features but not as good as my Samsung note 4 edge. However the front led flash is really a plus.The screen is very clear and bright but I found my wife's vivo xl's screen is better when compared side by side even it is an older model. Everything else works fine. It would be 5 stars if the following problems did not happen.1,I accidentally got into the Guest mode somehow and stuck with it and could not get out, I called blu service for help, after 45mins the first tech told me to reset the phone and said the phone is too new and there is no option built to select the users in the setting.then I was transferred to the next level of help, after half an hour, no solution and told me they will get back to me. I don't think I should reset the phone every time if my phone is in the Guest mode. If they have not thought about this simple thing ,they should not let the phone hit the market.2, I have not getting any solution at this point from blu. i lose access to my pictures and phone call log and other things still.I like the phone but can't really use it if I can't get out from the Guest mode. 3
I was so excited to get this phone although right away I had to have it repaired which was $50.00. I did not even have a clue that it would need to be unblocked until I purchased the right stuff to activate the phone and could not use it. So I am very disappointed that I have to spend more money to get it unblocked so in the long run I can only use it now to play games. I will not be buying any other phone at all from Amazon and I have purchased alot of things from this website. 4
Have not tried it yet, but looks good for a good price 4
Bad volume takes 9 hrs to fully charge speaker phone low big phone but slow and for straight talk carriers u have to buy $60 SIM kit to switch over 3
not pleased. was told sprint phone and it was not. 1
Just got this phone from Amazon. Tried with Tmobile SIM and the radio works with Edge/GSM.I am able to connect to WiFi router successfully BUT the UMA (Unlicensed Mobile Access) softwareis missing in the device !!!I badly need to make voice calls over internet through WiFi (UMA). Any ideas if it exists in it?Or can I install UMA software for 8520 from somewhereThanksRegards-bharat 2
I received my phone on yesterday and must first say I appreciate all the previous reviews that guided me to this purchase. I did some research on this phone including YouTube videos that compared this phone to other budget phones and flagships. This phone has met all of my expectations and then some! I saw remarks about the double tap not being consistent. I actually figured that out. If you do a slower tap it usually works every time. Maybe a quick could "1,2" works just about every time. The battery seems good so far. The display is outstanding. I downloaded open camera after a reviewer suggested which is good. My 2 most recent phones were the LG g4 and galaxy s6. The s6 is certainly a great piece of equipment but I realized many of the features they offer I don't need and the price is just too much. I definitely recommend this device over any other android on the market. Even some iPhone users might like this as a temporary, secondary or converter back to the android platform. 5
Sound is low quality and the speaker is in the back which is the main reason why I am returning it a few hours after I received it. My old Samsung S3 has much superior sound and the speaker is in the front where it needs to be.The unit came with a tiny instruction booklet that is essentially worthless. It took me a while to figure out how to open the damn thing just to insert the SIM. 3
i ordered a white iPhone and got a blue one... so I think that's a little unprofessional but other then that i like it. 4
No one can hear you talk on it. Can only talk with the speaker phone or via Wifi with another device.Totally bummed. Returning it as soon as I find another phone!Thought the "deal" was too good. And it came wrapped in a Iphone 4 box and all, and it sure looked New!Too bad it does not work. I can't walk around using the speaker phone, and I am not using an ear piece.Perfect if you dont actually want to talk on it! 1
Desde Venezuela confirmo que este producto es excelente. entregas eficaz. Muchas gracias.. espero volver a realizar compras a este vendedor. 5
blu is the worse types of phone... would not spend another dollar on anyone of them... I went through 3 blu in one year. Do not worth it 2
I love it excelent service acurate and fast 5
Really enjoying this item but my front facing camera is not working out. I don't know if I want to return this item or not. My front facing camera is extremely zoomed in and I can't find a way of zooming it out. Tried several things and it just doesn't work. Any help? If not returning. 3
Worked good for one year it lasted and then it showed that what it means to buy a refurbished product! Isn't this what is always expected with refurbished products. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. 1
Never buy phones or anything like that Bc it's stolen 1
Had to get camera fixed when it come in. Phone works good. Won't buy another from them. 1
Finally picked one up after a year of contemplating if I should switch to iOS. Love it so far 4
just what you would expect from an iphone. 4
Over all great phone, good long lasting battery life. Large screen size is a plus. Only downside is evertime I plug an auxiliary cord to my phone in my car it somehow plays both the speaker on the phone and the speakers of my car Idk if it's defective or my plug but I've tried it with other auxiliary cord and still the samething happenes. Can I replace it? Had for less then a month 3
Phone came on time and i was abke to get back to work right away. But it will not sync with my computer at all now whether through traditional win 10 phone app or an outside source. Without losing everything and erasing my phone it is okay of you can tolerate it. 3
it overheat and shuts down frequently..... Am I the only one having this issue??? I need a refund. 2
The phone came relatively quickly and has been working great this far (3months)However the cord that came with it doesn't work any longer and I will need to go buy one, also never came with an adapter so that was an additional expense. other than that my daughter loves her phone and I think I want one too! 4
Thank you. I'm very satisfied. 5
Look's like a new brand iPhone and works perfectly. Just what i was looking for. 5
Exceeded my expectations. It was like new and arrived very fast. 5
The phone was great had no issues..... 4
well i don't have the phone yet but right now ill give it a 5star! I hope it was worth my money update 4/3/16 phone works perfectly for to update... 9/27/16 the screen is very lose pops in and out with the slightest drop. Dropping the score 3star 3
I have ordered this phone twice, and am in the process of making the second return. I WANTED very much to like this phone - in fact, I loved the features, loved the external keypad (no stylus needed!) and it accepted my T-Mobile prepaid SIM card with no issues. However... neither of the two phones I ordered would recognize a microSD card, at all. I tried two different 2gb cards, both of which work fine in other devices, and could not get it to work. It's an unfortunate issue, on an otherwise pretty cool product. 2
Said it was a Verizon phone but...could NOT activate through Verizon and kept flashing AT&T at the top left corner when I tried to activate. Oh and it's a 5s with a new face on it....so it's been a "repaired" iPhone. 1
Needed a quick backup phone, and this could get to me the fasted, otherwise I would have gotten a nokia. It works in a pinch, but NO predictive text! So texting is a slow nightmare. Signal strength isn't that great, phone calls are hard to hear and I hear little beeps and buzzing sounds during calls. BUT it does work in a pinch. I'll probably still order the $22 simple nokia and this phone can be my backup's backup, since I did manage to break 2 phones in one weekend . . . 3
Thank you so much for the iphone! It arrived in good condition and I absolutely enjoy getting to know my first ever iphone device :) 5
It's a okay budget phone but don't expect much from it. Very slow phone due to the processor. The phone is fine but not up to my standards 3
After several weeks of use my son said the home button stopped working. I told him to make sure everything was working, but the phone part is working 2
Shipping pretty fast . They left it by my garage, not on my front door or mailbox , which confused me on where it was when I received the notification saying it was on my porch . But overall , it's in perfect shape and it works amazingly . Thank you 5
I was very satisfied with Amazon on the shipment and customer service. As far as the watch, I purchased it for my son to use with his iPhone 4s. also I like the fact that you could put a sim card in it and use it as a phone. unfortunately when you put a sim card in it it doesn't accept any of the Services. also on the Apple system it doesn't really do much with Bluetooth. if I was to do it all over again, I would have bought a Samsung gear. I have a gear 2 and it does everything expected to do. 2
Very happy with my new iPhone!!! More than I expected 5
It came with the phone and a non original charger, nothing else. The phone has some minor scratches on the bottom, so it's not exactly like getting a new phone. Not exactly what I expected. 3
I like the phone, I had some problems with it at first but it seems to be Ok now. 4
I have bought before this one had a few small issues such as the "P" button not working when upright, but It is still worth the cost to me and beats the heck out of ATT. 4
Why is it so difficult for the vendor to provide a product as specified on Amzn? This product was not factory unlocked and my T-Mobile SIM card did not get any signal on this phone, whereas it got a full signal on my Google phone. 1
2nd try at buying a phone and having it activated on my sprint account. Don't know if its the phones or sprint just sucks. Probably the latter, but I'm done with the trying to save money by buying a used phone. 1
The battery life is fantastic, but it is a slow phone to respond to actions on screen. Also they apparently decided to reverse everything, power button under volume, back button on right, slide out tray from bottom instead of top... 3
I like the phone, I hate that call volume is very low, the camera takes ok pics, the front facing camera ok pics too, I bought an micro sd card but it won't fit into my phone, I would not buy another blu phone, can anyone tell me why my micro sdhc card won't fit into my phone n how can I install it 3
The phone is genuine, BUT not very good as they describe. The worst part is all the accessories are FAKE. 1
It over heats pretty quick, I have to often restart it for my data to work and freezes a lot. 2
This phone has given me trouble since the very beginning. First the audio had a great amount of static, that problem was partially resolved after a couple of resets. Then the dropped calls started happening, I live in the heart of the city and have never had carrier-related issues with dropped calls. Then finally a few days ago, screen went completely dead. Now, I am back to using an older phone and I have no idea what to do with the phone I purchased. I have never owned an iPhone with so many issues. The earphones fell apart within a couple of days. The box that it came in seemed a bit shady, I am really not sure if the merchandise I received is actually a true out of the box Apple product. 1
Worst phone i ever had. I literally had it for a month, and its toast. It downloads virus after virus ON ITS OWN! Camera sucks, and it takes forever to make and recieve calls. That's what i get for going the cheap route.. 👎👎👎 1
I AM IN THE NAVY AND BOUGHT THIS PHONE WHILE OVERSEAS. I SENT IT TO MY HOUSE FOR WHEN I RETURNED HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS. BUT WHEN I RETURNED HOME I TRIED TO ACTIVATE THE PHONE AND VERIZON TOLD ME IT WAS STOLEN AND THAT THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD DO !!! SO I HAD TO BUY ANOTHER AT FULL RETAIL PRICE, A HUGE WASTE OF 400 $ !! 1
Very good device I've had it for a few days so far so good. I love the speakers and the screen and front facing Speaker's are awesome for media comsuption and getting LTE on ATT by way of straight talk. All in all if your looking for a phone that's tech heavy that you can root and play graphic heavy games without lag get he asus 4gb or the one plus , but if you just like me just wanted a good around phone that has a beautiful screen and great speakers and get LTE and a good battery life get this 5
I not recommend this phone, is lenght, it's not good...i for a beginners whit Blackberry Phones. This phone is for my wife use and not have 100 % satisfy but for the prize is not bad. I recommend other BB Model. 3
item that arrived did not match discription fully. Was supposed to be a black phone, but back case was white. Phone did not work properly. 2
This phone was a waste of my time I send it bk the next day it was deliver 1
the phone works fine looks good btw it works for metro pcs but i updated now it saying to enter a pass word that i do not have 3
100% reliable recommend thanks for everything 5
I have had the phone for a week now and here is my honest opinion. As you see, that I have given the phone 5 stars. This rating is for comparison to other phones in it's price range. I am not going to try and compare this phone with IPhone or Samsung. I have T-Mobile and I am on a no-contract employee plan that requires me to buy my phones outright. So price is a BIG deal. IMO the phone is great! Here are my honest thoughts:- Screen Size and looks is great! Very readable in the sun. Well above it's $250 price tag- The ONLY lag I ever experience is when I am sweeping running apps. And that is hardly a lag. It is very fluid and responsive.- No Dropped Calls- My LTE T-Mobile data has been 12.5 mbps- Front facings speakers are amazing and sound great. BUT they are louder than I want them to be at the lowest setting. I have Triplets Babies and when they are asleep, I can't have headphones in and the audio on the lowest setting is still too loud.- The Camera is Great! No issues or complaints.- The double tap to turn it on is unreliable and works less than 50% of the time. Double tapping to turn off works just fine.- BUT I am right handed and I have no issues with where the on/off button is. I don't know why others have complained.- I love the I can talk into either end of the phone. Especially when using the google search. It hears me every time!- The GPS is great and on-time! The front facing speakers were great to hear the turn by turn directions.- The head phones sound great!- The reversible setting is awesome and such a duh idea.- This may be an Android problem but is really annoying… but any group messaging that I have gets a date of Jan 17, 1970 and so they just sit at the bottom of my messages log. It’s VERY Annoying and I can’t figure out how to fix that. Anyone else have this problem?- Battery Life is about a day in a half. I use my phone mostly with Calls, Texts, Twitter, Facebook, Email, Camera, Internet. (Occasionally the GPS and Netflix, no gaming.)- In all, the phone is not "perfect". But just as close as it's going to be at this price. Definitely worth 5 stars and I recommend it every time!Now I just need a case. Not a bulky one. Any recommendations? 5
Side and rear panel of Iphone 5 very easy to be scratching , chipping. I never seen any phone like that, even cheapest phone on market now. Sorry to spend a 3/4 of thousand dollar to buy this phone. I used 16G Iphone 4, this phone's hardware very good, that why I purchased this Iphone 5. This time I wasted money. Last month I plant to buy Iphone 5S. But I think New Iphone Wiil be WORSE. 2
One day, it had a failure, it turns off and after a short time it turns on, the cellphone was not as i expected. 2
I am very happy with the product. I received the product in a timely fashion (got delivered in exactly 3 days). and the phone was in very good condition like new. Usually when you order an unlocked phone there's some minor scratches and what not but this phone is like new. The only reason I gave this only 4 stars is because I received the wrong battery cover to the phone. I am hoping the seller will send me the battery cover soon. Till then I will stay with the 4 stars. 4
Great phone! Down side is a phone with 8gb is obsolete. Learned this the hard way. I'm an android guy but daughter likes apple along with the rest of the brainwashed kids. Spend the money for more memory if iphone is a must. 5
grrrrrr... the phone came...i wet to at&t...they said the phone was stolen... phone not activatible.... -100000 stars. 1
Recently purchased this iPhone about 1 month or 2 months ago, sometimes it decides not to charge and then screen frezzes. its a "NEW" iPhone but its giving me problems.. 3
The colour is florescent pink,very light weight 3
Well, the phone works well but the 1GB of RAM seems to be the biggest pain point. Now when I'm doing normal things like recording video via the standard video app it hangs for 5-10 seconds at s time, only showing a still picture on the screen of what I was recording 10 seconds ago then jumping to the next scene that I am recording now. The battery life is great which saved the review though. Not sure if it has a front facing flash, can't get it to work though. I'll likely be returning this product due to the lack of memory. 3
For once, something that was exactly as advertised! I'm always leery when I buy something from a "new start up". 5
Product as described, good value 5
sometimes the sound on videos , music & keyboard clicks are just loud static & it won't turn down , not worth more than $100 IF THAT ... 2
Horrible experience, although shipping was fast. Received a gold and white phone, not the space gray phone I wanted and purchased. The accessories were not authentic as described except the head phones. The phone kept overheating when plugged in or if being on the phone for more than a few minutes. This phone was definitely returned. How disappointing to spend hard earned money on defective products, hoping the product holds up just until enough time passes by so that there not responsible! It's no way these people CAN'T know that there selling defective merchandise. The reviews shows. 1
Not near the phone as our previous Casio G'zone Ravines. Like the loud ring tones. 3
thanks for all, i like it 5
Good phone was unlocked and worked with other country sims.ConNo head phones jack 4
it's very nice, thank you so muchbut I miss the head phone set, it come without. 3
Very nice and good quality 3
TraduzcaTraducción HumanaVery good product, it lived up to my expectations, very well conserved, the only downside is the generic charger that they gave me exploded, fortunately had not passed anything to cellular phones in the otherwise very good team 4
I love BlackBerry and haven't had one that I didn't love. This model is no different. It's a great phone with nice features, easy to use and pretty too. I bought a 'very good' condition phone from Teczilla. It's in gorgeous condition, cost a lot less than a brand new one, and arrived 2 days early. I'm veryyy happy with my purchase, and my phone!! Giving the BlackBerry Curve 8310 5 stars.Revised Review- I've had to change my review as the phone will rarely send a picture, either one I've taken, or one I've received, without causing its appearance to be completely impossible to view or only partially viewable. Newer phones work fine. I think it's only because its such an older version phone. But disappointing because my previous phone didn't have a camera, and that's why I purchased this one. This has no reflection on Amazon. Just an FYI for future purchasers of older model phones. 4
Arrived much faster then expected, no scratches very good condition. Only complaint is that the touch screen does not sense my fingers as well as I would like. Overall good purchase for the price!!! 4
Same thing here I had to first download several manuals from web site none them were right one but from reading all of them I was able to make some progress. I figure it out 2
This is a great battery, I wish they put a little more phone on it though. For the most part it is a very nice device however everything happens in slow motion, and lots of apps have bugs, youtube randomly will not play videos, messaging apps freeze up ect. the data also cuts in and out in a very odd fashion, seems to get good reception however sometimes the phone just refuses to send or receive any data for 20-30 seconds, this probably happens 3-4 times a day at the worst possible times. I have not decided yet however I will probably return it. 3
This was for my wife. It worked, and with font size bumped up, she could read it easily - she has vision issues. It was slower than the specs would lead you to believe. Eventually the microphone quit working (it was dropped a few times) and it's been replaced with a Moto G. 3
The left side of the touch does not work at times. I am going to return it. 2
I bought it for business, only with the intention of reselling and sold very well, at least in my country do not understand how people would pay so much for a cell how it, well, we must seize! 3
I was sceptical at first despite the reviews and after owning one i am anxious for the model. I love this phone. 5
el equipo llego en buen estado pero el mismo día que lo comencé a usar se me apago y así mismo sucede cada vez que se recalienta y es un martirio porque todos los dias se me apaga quisiera devolverlo pero lamentablemente no tiene garantía y estoy en Venezuela que decepcion 2
I took it to the sprint store to get a sim card. told me it's not on their network. Now im stuck.. I have sprint. You lied to me. They don't even know which network it's apart of so i can't do anything. 1
I bought the phone due to the high advertised battery life. It definitely lives to expectations. If I use it extensively, I still have difficulty getting it down to 50% in a one day span. The phone is a bit small for today's standards, but I don't like the massive phones that barely fit in your pockets and make you feel like your weight training. The interface is very comfortable to work with, and the extra SIM slot is pretty cool, though I have yet for a use for it. This phone would be great for anyone who wants only one phone to use for both business and personal life. It does come with a few drawbacks however. I decided to wait on writing the review until I had a chance to see if there would be any negatives. The first one I noticed was that the GPS for this phone seems to be a bit inaccurate. I tried navigating with it and could get where I wanted to go in the end, but the phone seemed to have difficulty providing a precise location. My car GPS is far more accurate, so if you're planning on playing a mobile GPS game, you'll usually be about 10 feet off in a given direction. Another thing that came up is there is a discoloration on my screen now. Whenever I display a lighter background, I can see a yellow bar shaped discoloration just to the left the power button. I have no idea what caused this, though I worry that it was caused by the issue with the phone getting too hot (my next paragraph). Finally, it should be noted that the phone gets quite warm when running any apps that require more processing power. I once had to stop using the phone for a minute and let it cool down because it became unresponsive. Overall, a very solid phone. I'm a bit disappointed because of the discolored screen, which is very off-putting. The other cons are not terrible and can be overlooked honestly. If your looking for a long battery life phone or a business phone, this is worth considering. If your looking for a phone for using lots of apps though, even though the battery life is tempting for that endeavor, it is worth considering other options first. 3
This mechanical problems of overheating and battery discharge 2
I purchased this phone for my niece - I went to Tmobile to get it turned on with service plan and I was told it was blocked because it was stolen and I couldn't get it turned on after spending $80.00 with Tmobile.I am completely disappointed. 1
Very disatisfied. Had problems with it within a month. By three months it was constantly glitching and the screen had turned purple. Since it was my newly driving, 16 year old daughter's, it made for a very scary day when I was unable to contact her, and she me because it wouldn't send texts, wouldn't even allow the touch to work. Upon contacting the seller, we were told since it's past 30 days, there was nothing they could do. 1
This phone is not a good phone! I haven't had this phone a week, and the screen is already trying to go out. I want my money! 1
It was everything I expected 4
item is the same as described. i'm very satisfied. deliver even on Christmas holidays, which surprise me. full points to me!!! 5
A smartphone with touch screen plus qwerty keypad and the Blackberry trademark jockey button. what could be a better combination ! It is neither heavy nor outfits my palm. Slider is smooth. It is easy to carry, fits into my jeans pocket. I like this "Best-of-both the worlds" product. 4
great phone but the time on it would freeze 3
Bad batterie in it. Apple covers it, but said it typically would not. Apple saved the day. This could I have been a very bad deal. Phone would power off at 33% after I just got the phone. Apple stated "do to the fact this phone was a refer-be they were not going to warranty it but, the tech at the store did not note it so they will cover it"! 3
Had no problems it was perfect! 5
This product lasted 2 and a half months. Software crashed and now we're back to square one. 1
Phone was original but charger and earpiece have the look and feel of counterfeit apple products 3
Bought this phone for my daughter in college. Had to go to Sprint store to get an SIM card (not mentioned in ad). Activated the phone okay but the "Date & Time" would not set. Researched on Apple site for remedy but was unsuccessful. Seller agreed to take back the phone. Before I could send the phone back, my daughter said the phone vibrated off her coffee table and cracked the screen. Looks like I'm out of luck (and out $159.99) with bad phone with a cracked screen. Don't think Superior trading is going to help me out. 1
This phone is functional but has few of the features common of other inexpensive phones I have had. Most frustrating is the lack of earpiece volume control (as far as I have been able to tell). 3
Came as agreed. Much better than my iPhone 4. 4
I really had to drop this watch down for connectivity issues and the all around quality. the phone drops signal alot and the wristband was so small I had to give it to my girlfriend. Who could barely wear it. 2
not very good, did not last very long 4 months 2
Sometimes the phone will randomly turn off when I am trying to do something, such as video. Other than that, I have had no problems :) 4
The cell looked good, but it wasnt new, was refurbished . I had problems with keybord, had to change it. 2
Good Price for a very nice phone. It worked perfect 5
So far, I am happy with this iPhone 5, 64GB black. Thanks. 5
No, did not meet my expectations. Very poor. 1
Fast shipping! Great price. Thanks 5
It good phone, like new iphone 5
Very good service and phone working well. 4
Phone was in perfect condition when I got it, everything was fine, until I put the SIM in. Phone was blocked on my network and was reported as stolen. Needless to say, I am NOT happy with this outcome. 1
I had recently lost my old iPhone 5c and was in desperate need for a new phone. I just recieved a used iphone 5c 32gb from Dutchmoney10. Although it did come in ahead of time i am not happy with the condition and further problems that came with this iPhone. The seller neglected to notify that the phone did not come with an "active" sim card which was told to me while i was attempting to set up the new phone through at&t at my house. Now i will have to pay an extra 36 dollars to purchase and activate the new sim card. I don't understand why they would deactivate the previous sim card so that it is completely useless and basically trash and then proceed to not notify me and to make it my problem to dispose of. The product description listed that the phone had a few minor blemishes and scratches on the back but come to find out all four corners are chipped and the back side is is torn up like it was thrown across pavement. also the on/off button is loose and is difficult to press. I am not happy with this seller and the only reason that i will keep this phone is because i am in such dear need for a phone. I will never buy a used phone again and especially not from Dutchmoney10 and i suggest you don't either its deffinitely worth it to splurge a little for something with better quality. 1
I got my iphone earlier. It was as they had described it. I'm very happy with my iphone and the conditions were great.. Thank you!! :) 5
I instantly fell in love with this item and it worked great it was wonderful that it was unlocked because I could get straight talk with it no contract or anything just $45 a month BUT after a couple of months it started to act up. Turns off by itself, Deleted messages just pop back up, closing out of apps on its own & there really is not enough space on this phone.. So pretty much I don't like the item anymore and will be needing a new phone. 3
The phone was brand new as advertised but it wasn't factory unlocked. I had to return it. I guess I am gonna stop buying electronic devices through amazon 3
This phone is horrible. Battery dies out of no where WAY TOO FREQUENTLY!!!! Horrible product .. want my money back or a replacement 1
I received a verizon iPhone 5s that could only be activated in China and not in the United States 1
The phone works fine but it is more scratched up than anticipated. Also, both the charging cable and the wall plug that were sent with the phone did not work at all.. 2
I ordered this phone expecting a 5s. Imagine my shock when I opened the box to find a 5 in there. The phone is in good condition, but WAS NOT AS LISTED! 1
the item came faster then excepted. And easy to set up. 5
Sucks it doesn't have Flash 3
This item is for a friend 4
Worked fine for about two and a half months and then it stopped working. I contacted T-Mobile and they informed me that the previous owner had not paid their bill and the phone is now shut off and reported stolen. This is fraud!!! 1
really heavy phone.. compared to my Samsung tablet.. it was big it didn't bother me but people always asking if I had a tablet or a phone so got tired of it... front camera was crappy back camera was good.. it wouldn't catch up when I was texting or the home button was on the screen so it was kind of annoying while texting it would bring me right back to the home page... love the color and the screen was hard... battery lasted a very long time.. worth the price kind of yes and no but I returned it before it got the 30 month gerent so now I ordered the blu vivo 5 I cant wait to receive it its amazing and that is worth its price. 3
The phone does not hold a charge at all.I cant take it off the charger or it will die even when it says 100% 1
A very good device. My only problem is its size. It is heavy in a shirt pocket and inconvenient in hip pocket of a trouser. It slips out very easily from a pocket. I have lost it already 3 times in the last six months but fortunately each time I could find it. 4
I love my new iPhone it has a few screen scratches on the screen but it was unlocked and works great ! 5
I bought this cell phone to make a gift to my son, when I received it I realized that doesn't work: the battery is bulky, the screen is damaged, the charging cable is not the original, the start button doesn't work , where you put the sim card the iPhone don't recognized. Additionally, reasoned that the battery is bulky, all the base card Cell Phone (circuitry) is damaged. Finally, the product was a total fiasco. I wonder what the seller can do with this case, since the product was paid as New and that was not what I received. 1
It was a nice phone. I liked it except that the fact the on off button broke. I sent it back and got the refund on a gift card. I got the Huawei Honor 5X and like that phone much better so far. It is $90 more than the BLU but still a better value I think. 3
I haven't had a chance to use this phone yet so I will focus on one feature that does not work correctly on this unit (so far). During the initial setup I left the Torch settings off, only to discover a few minutes later that torch was on. My first thought was that I accidentally turned it on. I was wrong. So, after switching the torch on, the light went out (off). I will keep testing it and then decide if I want to return the unit or not.Additional testing later in the day produced following:I took a picture with an intent to test the bluetooth function by transferring this picture to my computer. To my surprise the Bluetooth function, which was supposed to be the first one within the Organizer Menu, wasn’t there (see the picture). I consulted the User Manual  (see the picture), and discovered that the STK (SIM card tool kit) function that was also supposed to be within this menu, wasn’t there either??!?At this point I decided to return the unit and took my brand new AT&T SIM card and the brand new micro SD card out.My sole purpose in purchasing this phone was to use it on my travels abroad. I needed a simple unit for phone calls and taking pictures. This phone is aesthetically appealing and the price is more than good. Having two SIM card slots would have made it possible for me to have my US SIM card and obtain a local SIM card wherever I am. This was a win - win proposition.Keeping all this in mind, there was a part of me that did not want to give up the idea of having a phone like this, so I went through the menus one more time. Imagine my surprise when I saw the Bluetooth option appear “magically” on top of the Organizer menu!! The STK function was still missing :(So I can’t tell if just this one unit is defective or there are more like this, but I will not be asking for a replacement, and I am reducing the number of stars to two, one for the looks of the unit and the other one for the price. 2
Small phone, isn't compatible with most us services but has nice color and amazing storage. 2
I use to be the biggest fan of Blackberry. I bought this cell phone thinking it was going to be the best of the best. I don't like the full touchscreen. The functions look good, but nothing works appropriately. Battery runs out after 2/3 hours. It gets restarted whenever the phone wants to. I had the hope that something went better, but i have been giving the chance for 6 months. Its the worst cell phone I have ever had. 2
Short battery life and chrome doesn't work as well as the browser already loaded on the phone. Had to purchase a larger sim to get everything to work. I use family mobile BTW. Good phone for the price, but definitely disappointed in the battery. 3
The wifi was not working 2
I followed the limited instructions and could not get the phone to work on AT&T. 2
Phone stopped working only a few weeks after received 1
the phone stopped w orking after 3 months.. the "touch" stopped working and parts are damn near impossible to find and expensive as hell.. the digitizer and lcd replacement kit costs 120+ dollars...umm so not worth it if the phone costs 200$ 2
This seller was extremely helpful, and willing to put in much appreciated extra effort so that I would have my phone shipped to me quickly. I would recommend buying any product from this seller because they are trust worthy, helpful, and extremely kind. I had my phone expedited to me, and it was no hassle or argument. Everything went smoothly, and I am very, very happy!! 5
Great Phone ! Only problem was and still is the service. This phone is Verizon towers but through straight talk. It won't let me text on iMessage or get on Internet without wifi. But the phone itself is great with wonderful pictures. Just make sure you fight hard to get a good service 4
The middle of the screen is unusable. It doesn't detect my touch. The vibration is also loud and not factory. 2
The quality of the actual product was very nice and sturdy. The only problems I had with this product was that the Bluetooth kept disconnecting every few minutes. The step counter would reset every so often without me prompting it to. 2
This watch did ok, the alarm that would go off when you left you phone just never worked right I feel, and it had some powder inside the would gather on the face when static would build up, like taking off your coat. I guess it was like only $25.00 but I am sorry if you are going to sell something cheap or not at least make it work. 2
Great purchase! It was as good as new... Screen was immaculate and had no surface scratched. I'm very satisfied with my purchase. 4
It's a ok phone with the storage but the camera doesn't have a flash which really sucks for the size of phone it is. I have had the phone for about a month and my charger port has stopped working. I really would like to send it back because it is a struggle trying to get the phone to charge. 3
It was a great phone, but wasn't the right provider, ended up being Sprint instead of AT&T. 3
It doesn't sink to my phone. 2
The phone was in great condition. It had no scratches and it works perfectly. None of the buttons were stuck or broken and the phone was just perfect. 5
This was a gift for my father who took his last phone for a swin. I was a little worried that everything would work, but it was delivered quickly and he was able to get it set up right away. It was a hit!!! 5
I wouldn't even give it one star. I got this phone for my mother. She loved it but it wouldn't charge so had to send it back! 1
I haven't had this phone a week yet and I have lines going horizontal and vertical all over my screen. Also the home button doesn't work half the time. I am going to have to buy another phone to replace this one I just bought. 1
The phone will only take a standard size SIM, you'll need an adapter for a micro or nano sim. Don't buy for it's cameras, you'll be disappointed. Great budget, or back-up, phone for AT&T or T-Mobile customers. 4
I recommend it, thank you very much 5
It's s*** and the screen pops up thank you so much for this bulls***.😊🔫 2
Purchased it to use it as a secondary phone and it worked great. Now I only use it as a backup phone but I am glad I have a phone to go to in case of emergencies. 5
Whoever "refurbished" it did a horrible job, the battery would die off within a few minutes, wouldn't hold a charge. Returned it 1
Bad product that lasted 35 days. I believe the warranty is 30 days, so you know how convenient that was . 1
I had to return this product because the speakers were shot.. It was difficult to understand what was being said on the other end of the line, but not impossible. It otherwise worked perfectly. 2
very badly ,the phone cann`t unlock ,because the seller is out of money ,the seller cheat customer,it don`t say in descrption 1
I ordered the phone brand new & it appears to me that is exactly what I got, it works without any issues, came exactly as described, with the charger & brand new headphones!!! The box was complete with everything you get when you buy from the actual store!!! 4
I have a 5S for work so I wanted to pick this one up for personal use. I was surprised how quickly it linked with my iPad. The seller had it at my door in 3 days! 5
Great company to do business with. Love my iPhone. 5
Perfect, no problems at all. Very happy, 5
Second phone I have purchased from Amazon..., This one worked two weeks before freezing up. I read all the reviews and chose to try again but was disappointed for a second time. Our phones make or break our business so not having usage for an hour can impact our lives. Amazon has always faired well with every other purchase we have made. 2
Beware. These are lemons - something is wrong with a lot of the phone these people sell. THEY ARE NOT NEW, no matter what it says. They are refurbs. I bought one from them, and wanted to return it since it had issues - they were willing to take it back. Only issue is I didn't have a back up phone, so I got lazy and didn't send it in time. PRO - great return policy, if the phone isn't working right you can and SHOULD return it. Don't get lazy like me.The phone had stripes across the screen within a few days. I ordered a new glass screen for the phone - another $80 blown. It works perfectly now. I mean I got a phone, just don't think it was worth the money they charged. 3
Lovely little phone I got after my iPhone 6 was stolen. Comes in fun colors, and everything I could ask for in a phone. Only thing that's really lacking to me is the camera, especially in low light scenes, not bad enough to knock off a star though. Besides that little kink, this phone fills the need of a digital life companion, and for the price paid, I couldn't ask for anything better. 5
excellent watch and fast delivery 4
Purchased this phone May 2016 and in December 2016 the phone began failing- screen developed lines at the top and needed to be reset to clear it. After a reset, the screen develops the symptoms again within a day. 2
Just got it thank you. 5
Phone won't hold a charge and the volume down button doesn't work. Definitely not a quality phone. 1
Originally, I was unsure about this phone as the reviews aren't great. However, my phone came in great condition and so far am not having problems with it. 5
Hard to find the app 2
Not bad ... packaging could have been a little better, but overall good purchase. Worked as expected ... thanks 3
It's ok. My only issue is that the internal memory fills fast..though i have an sd card. But i see ways to hack into it to make it larger. Apart from that it's ok 3
I really want to love this phone, but after using it for a little while, I just can't. I didn't even come here to review the phone, it's perfectly fine where its at. Great battery life for its price. What I really want to know is what's up with BLU Support. No drivers? Come on. My computer can't even recognize the thing, the average person would find it impossible to get this phone to work with a computer let alone root it. The BLU community should not have to troubleshoot the phone. They've got people practically begging for answers on the public Google plus page that the community itself created. Instead of the actual company support helping, you have average consumers that have bought the phone/gone through the same issues and giving you advice on what you should/shouldnt do. It's ridiculous. Then there's the "official" BLU Dev site, but that's run by a single person that hardly can because he's in college. A single person. Out of all the people working there, only one took money out of their own pocket to get a dev site going that only lists a handful of devices? Other than that, again, it's a great choice if you're on a budget. Just don't expect dev support until a later time 3
We had to return it. The battery was dead 1
It is a good cellphone... 3
It is good according to my mother's feedback. 4
Its a pretty good.phone... ahd mines for 3 months. & For the price everythings good. nay even wanna upgrade if a.new.verion releases. 😘😍 3
It was just as described in excellent condition . 4
I got this product and I thought that the phone was going to be working. Come to find out that the Sim card tray was no good and it couldn't ready any Sim card from any carrier. The exterior of the phone was in good condition though. 3
this phone came in a very good condition it was like new, no scratch, no prob so far, and its a bit different from other curves ive seen was a good buy 4
I got a Verizon GSM global unlocked product delivered.It did not need a sim to activate the phone. That's good. But when i saw Verizon in the product information, i tried an AT&T sim to check if its actually unlocked and it worked fine. I removed the sim. I'm using the phone just for Whatsapp, camera and sometimes songs/videos. Phone is awesome for pics. 8GB storage is the only drawback. Considering that its an apple phone, it wont let you do much anyway. Transferring photos and syncing stuff is a nightmare if you have been an android user forever(which i am). Otherwise, if your expectation is set right, this phone is an awesome steal. 4
Here's my professional review of this phone, one that should be taken into huge consideration when buying this.In my personal experience I purchased this phone because of how powerful and how amazing it sounded.An Octa-Core processor and a 2K HD Display! Sign me up. It only took around 4 days to get here. Even though it was free shipping, so it was pretty good.Now when I opened the phone, it was stunning, it came with earbuds, a quick charge wall adapter/mini usb cord, and 2 cases. Alright that's a pretty good first impression. It booted up and it was beautiful. The display was stunning. Now lets skip over some minor details.Here comes the bad parts.Now after 2 weeks of owning it, it began to heat up near the fingerprint sensor( Which works fine by the way) But this wasn't affecting performance. so I payed no mind to it.Then I came home one day and began to watch YouTube videos like I usually do. The phone had made a sort of crack sound. I turned off the screen and to my horror. The screen had cracked! Without me even dropping it once!I was agitated but still went on.Now about those 3 GBs of Ram. Only 1.3 of that ram is usable, so basically you have a phone with less than 2 gigs of ram.Then the phone one day decides to just cut off in the middle of a phone call. And that was the end of it.And since it was 2 months of owning it I couldnt get a refund.Overall, don't buy this phone, other BLU phones are recommended, But do not buy this one, its a waste of money.Thanks for reading and I hoped it helped 3
Great phone but the description needed to be clearer. 5
I've had this phone since Aug. 2015 and I Love it! I had an older version before so I figured I would like it. The screen is huge, the touch screen works great and the pictures are decent quality. I will be sticking with BLU phones from now on. I did have to contact customer service once because the phone started having an issue where my screen would freeze, vertical lines would pop up and then it would just die. I had no idea what was going on until I called and the person I talked to was super helpful and we got my phone back to working condition quickly and easily, he also sent me some other instructions for if it happened again and other possible fixes, which was great!UPDATE: My phone kept going down a bad path so I decided it was time to get in on that warranty action...which was NOT easy. I get that this company doesn't want people BSing them and they aren't looking to lose money but they made it really difficult and once I finally DID get a hold of the right people I had to print out paperwork, pay my own shipping and send the phone to a place across the country. They notified me that they received my phone a week ago but literally said nothing more about it. I have no idea if my warranty will be honored, if I'm getting my phone back or when. I'm very frustrated and unhappy right now. 3
quick shipment, smooth activation! Thanks! 5
Got it in great shape. Love it. A faulty charger cable caused a bit of a scare, but otherwise, got a quality product for a decent price. Very satisfied. 4
Love it now that my work mates can text me for any shift changes or new shift been added into work schedule 5
Takes great pics but all it does is freeze! First my screen stopped then now it freezes alot smh i am not satisfied! Do not buy! 2
not new... i'll return it... 1
Is this iPhone with a 2 year contract 😌 4
The phone looks like new but it's not 2
The condition of the phone exceeded my expectations! 5
I really wanted to like this phone. It might be alright for a preteen. Its slower than expected and a few months in it started randomly calling people.its not the best quality, either. Up until this point I was a fan of BLU phones, but this one is not a winnerUPDATE: This phone didn't even last a year. It is officially a goner. It won't turn on, or charge. Pretty disappointing. My entire family uses BLU without at hitch, but as previously stated, this model is a waste of money. 2
I bought the Iphone 6 for my niece and she loves it. Since she received the phone, she has not had any issues. I would recommend Complex Melodies to friends. The deliver was less than five days Overall, I am satisfied with the company. 4
Even though the phone was advertised as unlocked, it was not unlocked. The phone came with an AT&T SIM and worked fine the first time I turned it on. However, when I used my T-Mobile SIM it kept saying "invalid sim". I tried it two other GSM sim from a different country too. If you are buying it to use with any other carrier than AT&T please dont buy. With Amazon's great customer service policy, I was able to return it. But doesnt worth all the hassle 1
After the first phone we ordered was unable to activate because the serial number was reported Lost/Stolen. The replacement phone the glass was not even fils with the phone indicating that it was refurbished. 1
Battery is totally affected. Cellphone is failing and turning off. 1
Great phone. I use it instead of iPod, b/c I need multiples in my office and iPods are $199.I just need Pandora and another app. to run music in my officeIt's a little slow and you can't get the latest software, otherwise for the price it's a good phone and I bought 3 of them. 4
My daughter bought this phone , and she luvs it 5
The phone does not hold a charge at all.I cant take it off the charger or it will die even when it says 100% 1
Cracked all over and not unlocked 0 stars if I could 1
I was told I was buying a new phone, not a refurbished one. Very upsetting, but it works mostly well. It goes a little crazy when I put the phone in silent mode and the head jack input was dirty (also works mostly well). But I afraid that this phone won't last. I guess if you want new you should buy straight from apple. 1
Unfortunately, the item did not exactly meet to my expectations and I had some trouble but the seller was kind enough to help me out with it. 3
I found it difficult to get it working in Dominican Rep. I had to go to many different places before the " Unlocked fro any GSM carrier worldwide" would work worldwide! 3
Great phone so far at a great price! 5
The screen has been being really glitchy & my vibration has stopped working. I've only had the phone for 3 weeks 2
The screen is coming out of the phone & it had water damage when I got it.. it did not say this when I purchased it!! Not very pleased! 1
I do love the watch, the only issue is the battery life. Maybe it's just mine because my friend uses hers all day and sometimes doesn't even need to charge it at night. I am giving it a few more days to see if it is just my battery and if so, going to see about switching it out, if possible. Other than that, great buy! 4
This phone was for ATT so I had to change from Verizon over to them. It says it's compatible with all companies. The phone has already stopped working. I went this direction to save me some money for now but ended up spending more buying a new phone and going back to Verizon whom I will stay with due to issues also with ATT. There was no receipt in the box in case you needed to return or contact the seller. The phone was okay, it looked good but didn't last long. 2
Get it for my father in law since my mother in law say that he say he can't hear the ringtone so now he complain is too loud which is good he hear it. Other than that love it so much that he finally don't complain he can't hear it anymore but now complain too loud hahaha 5
after a year of using it, I think its a great phone and the seller was good too cuz I got it like new even when it was used 5
The battery did not work, but I was able to exchange it for another phone so it worked out. 3
i got really good piece, 4
My first BB. I like it 4
I recieved the phone and it only worked for about a month then it wouldnt ring on the phone text or alarm settings. 2
The phone arrived in a timely manner and had a good physical appearance, and was set up to my service easily. However, the phone is somewhat unusable as there are some technical problems. I have done everything that i can to get the phone to work as it should (gone to AT&T, contacted Apple, and researched solutions on the net). The phone has had multiple resets and still refuses to text some numbers. Everything else works fine on the phone and can be used as a phone but not to text some of my contacts. I have been unable to determine if it is a phone problem or cell service problem. Looks as though it may be a service problem. 2
I really like my new iphone. fairly easy to use, and takes very clear pics. The reason I gave it only 4 stars is because of the price, I think paying this much money for a phone is crazy....but here I am being crazy !! 4
Did not work wlth my chip 2
Ahhh purchased this and currently the screen is only showing half screen... Any suggestions on what could be wrong??? May I return for replacement??? 1
El producto llego bien y en buen estado, pero lo malo es que a pesar de que en las caracteristicas dice que tiene la frecuencia de 850Mhz para que funcione el 3G (HSDPA) el que me llego no la tiene, me siento decepcionado, Amazon debería hacer una revisión muy detallada de las caracteristicas de los productos que ofrece para que no pase este tipo de situaciones, me siento estafado y si poder hacer una devolución pues vivo en Ecuador 2
Second review. The first was about no Sims card, will not work with Verizon.This one is about the down volume button not work. 1
arrived in time before my trip, thanks a bunch! Apparently the phone was still locked! costed me an extra $40 to unlocked the unit so it could be used in Mexico. No big deal but thought I mention...Phone was in great condition as per description. Thank you 5
Phone was in good condition as advertised. Works great!!! No scratches. Unlocked as advertised. 5
We were told by carrier that phone was locked. It was not. Just had worthless employee at AT&T. Phone is fine and works well. 3
The best phone I have ever had. iPhone the way to the future. I would recommend an iPhone to my friends 5
Battery won't hold charge otherwise good phone 4
Received as expected. Much better service than the Pantech phone. Like the Hot Spot availability to use with other devices when needed. 5
COMPRE EL TELEFONO PARA USARLO CON MOVILNET EN VENEZUELA Y DE VERDAD QUE ESTOY SATISFECHO PORQUE FUNCIONA BIEN...NO ES EL DE ULTIMA GENERACION PERO TRABAJA MUY BIEN... 4
It came with a battery issue and I had to return it 1
Delivered ahead of schedule and in mint condition. Only issue was some charge cables did not seat properly and intermittently charged. We have been able to correct so it's working great! 4
I think I already reviewed this but am very happy!! Sure beats paying full price for brand new when this phone was basically a brand new phone!! 4
AT&T says this phone I bought was reported stolen. 1
Worked for 2 months now the phone earpiece doesn't work - they can hear me but I can't hear them unless I put on speaker. 1
NO IT DIDNT WORK AT ALL IT SAID TO CONNECT TO ITUNES AND NOTHIN HAPPENED. I HAD TO GET AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT PHONE. I WANT A REFUND! 1
Came exactly as described. Needed a back up phone...wasn't sure about purchasing used iPhone...but so far, so good. Works just like my iPhone 6...flawless. 5
Volume isn't the best but I love the phone 3
This was the best used iphone i could find!! It came in a right shape and no scratches. I love it 5
Everything look good when I got it in the mail 👍👌 5
Sound volume didn't go up at all for anything 3
Received the phone quickly. Everything worked very well except screen has a rattle noise when phone vibrates possibly from loose screen when refurbished. But works perfectly and not a big deal. 4
no le suena los tonos de llamadas y tampoco se escuchan los videos. no tiene tarjeta de memoria. no trajo audifonos 2
Fast shipping -new - nice! 5
This phone works good for text messages and calls, but the is about it. The camera, radio, TV functions all don't work. I kind of knew that going in, thats why my review is not less. 3
Pretty good for the price. I had some problems with my first one but was able to return it for a refund and got another. The seccond had some dings but nothing that effected the way it functions. Overall good buy. 4
my son is very pleased with his new phone other than the battery doesn't stay charged as long as it should. 4
There is an issue with the wifi chip not working which is common with a lot of 4S's. Unfortunately, there is no way of fixing it so you'd going to end up with a phone that will only be able to use data. 1
3G Would not work with T Moble carrier. You can 2G but we were expecting 3G.We returned the 2 phones and had to by new 9900 phones. 2
it's a good phone for taking pic, messaging and texting. Down side is have to log in to download every app. 4
I bought this and another brand to compare. This watch works with h20 wireless but has short Cummings. The camera is very low quality, not even to send pics online. The Bluetooth is spotty. The SD card goes under the battery. The watch does not keep time. If the battery goes dead there goes your settings. The phone is pretty good. Overall I like the other watch I bought much better that shipped from China. 2
This phone was just as I was wishing for, but one slight problem (worry). It has a sim card of AT&T and it has unlimited text, call, and 4G LTE data. So if I use those will I get charged or no? 4
I really wanted to like this device, but after opening it I noticed a bright spot near the bottom of the display. After a few days this spot grew into two and got much brighter. Tapping the screen, made that area flash almost as if it were under a lot of pressure.Performance of the phone was good, but in the end I returned it before the display issue really panned out. Does not matter how inexpensive a product is, it should arrive in 100% working condition. 3
It arrived early; however, seems to work better with a headset. 4
For the price, this watch is packed with features. Here's the line-up of apps that come with it: your choice of a digital and analog watch face, but you can't add new ones; choice of 24 or 12 hour format; pedometer, but you can't change to feet and inches; barometer with thermometer in Centigrade only; BT dialer; phone that makes and receives calls of fairly good quality, but there is no volume control; phonebook with search; Bluetooth; browser that doesn't work; Sim card slot so this can be a standalone cell phone not dependent on connection to phone; SD storage card slot; call log; lost/find app; smart search; remote camera controller; sleep monitor; multimedia player; FM radio that doesn't work; calculator; Alarms; File Manager; Calendar that doesn't sync; Audio player; Messaging for SMS, but not MMS; email doesn't work; and a Remote Notifier that doesn't work.There you have a list of the apps included with some comments. It is surprising and disappointing how many of the apps are non-functional. I'd say overall it's a deal breaker. Now maybe some of the functionality could be restored is there were any customer service or technical support for this product, but there is none whatsoever. PGD Group is a horrible company that does not respond to email and offers no support. There are no additional apps available for download.The battery life leaves something to be desired. It seems two to three days is maximum depending on usage. But it does charge quickly using a micro USB cable.The tiny scrap of paper that is supposed to pass as a manual is written in the worst English you can imagine. It is just gibberish and rudimentary. Products should not be allowed to be sold on Amazon unless they come with proper documentation.I found the most frustrating thing about this Smart Watch is that it continually disconnects from the Bluetooth link to my phone with an annoying little tune even when it's only three feet from the phone.If you are looking for a fairly attractive Smart Watch that tells time and makes and receives pretty decent phone calls for a good price, you may consider this model. But with all the non-working features, I don't really recommend it. The lack of documentation and customer support are total negative factors;Amazon should not allow companies like PGB to sell on their system until they can support and document the products properly. Their customer service is virtually non-existent. 2
Everything about this phone screems $500 phone. It is missing NFC and a few other things like fingerprint scanners, which arnt a huge deal. Especialy for the price.The real BIG problem is the lack of certain bands that AT&T use. (Bands 12 and 17) without those. Your connection will not be as good, or work at all, in some areas. Where i live in south texas. Near corpus. It was very hit or miss. In some places it worked fine. And in others not at all.my older samsung galaxy grand prime got signal everywhere. And its because it has all the antennas for all the bands (frequency ranges) that AT&T use.The mobile hotspot works good. The screen looks amazing. The speaker sounds pretty good and loud. Only a little tinny on some songs at max volume.The camera works great. And the software is not as bad as some make it sound. it actually has some cool features built into it.But I had to return this phone because I didnt get signal in places i should have. I really wanted this phone to work. If it wasnt for the missing bands, this phone would By FAR. Be the best phone for the price. 3
Phone Lasted 5 Months everyday use.Pro's- Screen size, easy to read.- Decent battery life- Question magnet, everyone asks about it.Con's- Screen durability, So big its easy to bend and crack screen (A phone this large needs a tough case Blue- Awkward to type on- Sound is slightly below average.- Brightness control barely adjusts brightness. 3
Love the phone, recieved it a day early and everything was fine except the fact that the charging cord was removed from the packaging, but everything else was in the packaging and works just fine. 4
I purchased this for my neice because the one I bought for my son at Christmas from this same seller was great! It arrived just like new in case with charger and shrink wrapped- presented like new. I was so impressed. I will purchase from this seller again if needed! 5
Recebi no tempo correto, o produto é exatamente o que eu queria, e a negociaçao foi perfeita, a embalagem estava intacta.REcomendo o site e tambem o produto. 5
I have another two (2) models of BLU, BLU 6.0 HD and Studio 5.0C HD, they are excellent, thinking of the same build from BLU I tried this one, only ended up with surprise. With new 5.0 Lollipop and bigger storage, seems a plus, the touchscreen is slow responding or NOT responding, the battery life is lasting about only 6-7 hours with fair uses. Sent it back once, got a replacement (thanks to Amazon, honestly) but came to the same result. I do not against BLU at all since we are still using other BLU phones, but pass this one if you can spend extra $50 for another BLU model.Edits: the camera is definitely the worst from all my BLUs, slow or blurry focus at times, and failed a lot. I say it because I have another 2 BLUs to compare and I take photos all the time - 5+5 will disappoint you. Also this phone is missing a magnetic sensor for any Compass app, it won't run and gives you "can not access magnetic field data" error. Not sure? Install one it will tell you. 2
worked perfect will order again when ready 5
Horrible reception. Poor GPS connectivity. Poor GPS accuracy. Constantly loses signal even when outside in a good coverage are. Overall poor phone quality. Although apps work great and makes for a great iPod. 1
Its an iPhone 4. Nothing too special about it. I got mine fairly fast for where I live (the middle of a cornfield). Ordered a Verizon phone and got a Verizon phone. There were a few small scratches on the back of the phone but I put a case on right away. The only thing wrong is there is a small spot on the screen that is more whited out than the rest of the screen. Not big and not a big issue. Ive been using it for a few months now. I have finally activated the phone and had no issues. Only reason for 4 stars is the whiter spot on the screen. Great seller. 4
The charger did not work, there was a huge scratch on the screen, and a even bigger crack by the charging port. Would have pasted with so many issue if they would have been explained in detail. Shipping was fast and timely so that's why I'm posting review 1
I have recently purchased it and it looks good and very user friendly. Although the screen is not big but that keeps the size of the device small, which is a good plus. 4
Just an average phone - it works well but nothing special 3
ok for the most part.. very durable, wish phone were still made as durable. I use it mostly for work.... 4
Everything good. However they didn't bring me the tool to open the chip conteiner 4
Is really cute, a very good phone. is easy to use. i but it for my mom and she is happy 4
I received my package, but the phone is korean version. The charger can not use in US! 2
I bought this phone specifically for travel out of the US. The camera quality sucks but it served its purpose for my trip to France. 3
My phone came in very quick, everything is fine and works okay so far 4
I'm not satisfied because because the item did not come full incomplete security and headphones What is the reason 1
the iphone does not work, its not been 2 or 3 months I bought it and it does not work at all now.. gets switched off even with full battery, and screen shows loading sign with no other display... 1
Phone in great shape, the packaging was great the devilery was very fast and I did not have any problems with the order. 5
I will be honest about this device i did not like it at first and i wanted to sell it in the next hr after opening it not because it was messed up or the packaging was destroyed because tbh the package and the device is and was flawless (for the device of course lol) but after i downloaded tons of apps (well not tons but a lot more then i had on my last phone) i love this phone. Its fast and its definitely slim. However when i go to go on Facebook i cant go live and on top of that i cant do the emojis like the heart button for the like etc Please bring back that !! 4
Zachary was great the whole time and helped me return his product to him without any hassle. He honestly made the experience great. Based on the emails we exchanged he seems like an honest person and replies promptly. 5
Hi so I ordered this phone and after arriving 2 days late, I plugged it in and everything seems normal until the charger it comes with begins to melt. Weird. I plug it into a new charger and no melting, but I do notice that it takes 5 hours to completely charge the phone from 0%, and the phone doesn't even hold a charge! I leave my home at 7:35 every morning to catch a bus and go to school. By 2:15 and using my phone only for music and maybe a few phone calls, the phone is dead again. I emailed the company and tried to fix the situation but they straight up ignored me. Terrible company, terrible product. I wish I ciuld give 0 stars. 1
Elsewhere I purchased BlackBerrys and have been installed with the Spanish language, unfortunately these do not last due tirnen download and hope it does not present other problems 3
I'm very pleased with this phone.I haven't had any issues with it since I've had it.delivery was good it got here before the estimated date which is good.its alittle slow but that's all. Overall its a good phone at least for me. 5
It says in the description that 2 batteries were included, however the package came with only one battery. The manual is horrible, it did not tell how to install the sim card. You will need to go to youtube to find out how to do it. Otherwise, the phone is a simple cheap phone, it does what it does. So for the price, I will give 3 stars. 3
My plan phone was ruined at a beach party and I wasn't due for an upgrade for many months. This was a great deal and a good phone! Amazon shipped it super fast and I couldn't be happier with the phone 4
It took me several years to persuade my husband to buy iPhone for himself. Finally, the price of this iPhone 3GS made a trick and for couple of weeks already he is a satisfied user.The phone came with all accessories, but the box and brochure were not original. So far it works perfectly, the battery keeps as it should and there are no problems with the use. 5
Its a good phone. Wouldve gave it 4 stars if the phone came with a better warranty and/or i was able to find a phone repair place to have it repaired. Was told to go to Best Buy but they told me I had to have had purchased the phone from them to have it repaired. So The phone is useless to me. On top of that I only had it for 3-4 mouths. So disappointed about that 3
I haven't had this phone too long. My second day I called TMobile and I couldn't understand the customer service person. That's worrisome when a phone doesn't work as a phone too well. And getting the SIM installed was a difficult experience for me. I couldn't figure it out. I've installed them in several phones now, so . . .? The manual just said. be sure the SIM is installed correctly. I felt like knocking off a star just for that! Thanks a lot, BLU! I saw the tiny words on the metal SIM cover - lock and unlock. But I didn't get the flip up thing - very important!!. Perhaps that's because in the past, I've bent or broken small electronic parts when I wasn't quite sure what to do. So I finally took a taxi over to a computer lab to have my super geek friend take a look. He had trouble with it, too!! I was starting to worry then. But in a while, he got it. Not too intuitive though. I've taken a couple of photos and they do look pretty good! I might update this review in a while. It's still brand new. So my three star review is based on the initial difficulties I had getting the thing running, mostly. 3
I ordered a iPhone 4s (At&t) for Christmas to give to my 15 year old son. The phone was delivered at the expected time and that is one reason why I am giving a rating of two stars. I realized that the phone was used so I was really nervous. When I opened the package, the phone was in excellent condition,no scratches or cracked screens. So that is the other reason why I rated it two stars. From this point, it receives no stars. I turned on the phone and went to settings, it said Verizon carrier. The description clearly stated At&t, my order form stated At&t. My plans to add this phone to my plan was ruined. I had to put the phone on Verizon plan which was totally out of the way. I gave the phone to my son on Christmas. He was excited to have it. When my family members asked what phone he had I said iPhone 4s. My son corrected me by saying iPhone 4,mama. The description clearly stated 4s, my order form stated 4s and I paid for a 4s. I was so upset I did not bother to try to correct the situation. I should have known better to order something used from Amazon. Please be cautious when ordering used items from Amazon. 2
Product is okay. Was not "Like New." Has scratches. Everything else is working so far. 3
Phone was not Verizon compatible. but they did refund the purchase & shipping, so it was just inconvenient. 1
So far so good! The phone works!!! 5
This phone was not originally Verizon aand for the money that was paid I can't get on the internet unless I am somewhere where someone has WiFi. Very disappointing . 1
not bad but poor battery life and shutdown often to factory settings 2
Phone is overall decent but was unaware that cannot send videos longer than 10 seconds. Asus put so much money into a great product but failed in some of the minor departments. overall a good phone but expected more 2
My son is happy with his gift for college 5
has good features but the quality is not there. 3
BlackBerry has created a very sleek design,very professional,outstanding classic edition of Passport, has lots of features,performs very well. 4
My 13 year old bought this not understanding that it only works with Sprint. It is absolutely useless where we live and she can't use it for anything. I would really appreciate if there was something we could work out, maybe a refund or an unlocked phone that could be put on straight talk. She is one of 9 children and she detassled corn all summer to by herself a phone. Please help me! Thank you 1
I noticed 2 hairline fractures about a week ago , then yesterday it fully cracked so the only thing holding everything together is the screw. I've only had this for 5 weeks 2
Horrible. Started having battery trouble after a month and then at 2 months sim card doesn't work anymore. So now have to buy a new phone again after wasting money on this one. 1
We bought this to transfer our Tracfone service to the iPhone that my 16 year-old was coveting. It came looking brand-new and the transfer was easy! We got a SIM card (nano) from Tracfone, called the automated line that walked us through the change from old Tracfone phone to new, and easypeasy we are iPhone people (very important to a teen)! He has no complaints and the transfer took less than 30 mins. I am ordering one for myself this week and loosing my "dumb phone" for a smarter one. Hehehe 5
Piece of s***. very low quality and no support 2
I received exactly what was promised, and in a timely manner. Recommend amazon to anyone. Will actually be purchasing another in the next couple of months. 5
I love my phone and it is in great condition but it is an Iphone 5 not a 5S and I payed for a 5S not a 5. The shipping and the quality of the phone was great, but I wanted a 5S. 2
I was not happy with the internet was very slow with t mobil service, the ringer volume was too low and the color was very dim 1
HI THE IPHONE WAS BROKEN FROM THE BACK NEAR TO THE CHARGE CONTACT ABOUT 1.5 in . IM SO SAD ABOUT THESE BECAUSE I WASN'T LIKE DESCRIBED AT ALL . 1
I received the device on time that's the only positive. The phone was completely defective, the speaker was in horrible condition it sounded like I was talking under water, really muffled. And I'd place a call and the only way I can be heard is if I'm on speaker. The charger didn't work and the battery drained way to quick and believe me I adjusted all my settings. I have to charge it 3 times a day not kidding. 1
I received the IPhone 4 and found that the microphone does not work; I spent a lot of money for a paperweight. I want my money back. 1
I purchased this phone to sent to the west indies and so far the phone is working perfectly. I definitely will purchade again. 3
Had the phone since February works great. Battery dies way to fast .. N it just recently start happening when I clean my screen or pull off the screen protector the screen acts all funky. It goes almost bright white like sepia affect. That will go for half hour than phone works ok.. N the top of my screen if I push it sounds like it's loose n popping in n out n I have never dropped this phone in the 3 months I've had. Never gonna order a cell phone offamazin again not worth the money better to buy at a retail price than save money online just my opinion... I ended up purchasing a brand new iPhone 6s from apple after only having for five months bc the phone stopped working n wouldn't charge. 1
Have to keep tightening the band throughout the day because it gets loose. 3
The worst decision I have ever made. This phone overheats on the charger every night now and will die in a matter of an hour. I have only had this phone for 2 months and honestly things just keep getting worse. I guess that is what I get for buying a refurbished phone. It's honestly worth the extra $100 to just buy from Apple. Then at least you know it will work and you can have them fix it or bring it back if it doesn't. I'm very disappointed. 1
Challenge to navigate. Too large for comfortable handling. Would not buy another one. 2
I have not even had this phone for a month and now the home button does not work!! Have not dropped it I don't know why it just stopped working from one day to the next very disappointed!! Also the screen on the side looks like it is about to pop out any minute!! 1
My first BB. I like it 4
touch screen too sensitive - when held to ear, hits keys continually. Would not purchase again, because also end up hanging up on people if head cheek touches the correct button. 2
The telephone receipt a bit late but enough good works of I throw only lacking him the memory of 16 gb because of it do not give him the complete qualification one sees good to be reconstructed 4
it fuctions. I ordered a 100-5 but got a 100-3 not a big deal. delivered on time. 4
Arrived in time, works great! 5
This is probably the worst $90 ever spent. First off, I got an empty package so I had to order another one and wait again. Second, the WiFi antenna is damaged, can't connect to WiFi unless i'm next to the router. The screen froze twice the same day alone, and now the screen went completely dark, barely can see some light out of it. This is a completely bad product, or maybe I don't understand "refurbished" the same way as this seller. 1
Covers a lot of LTE bands and I tested it and it works (LTE) with ATT and T-Mobile SIM cards. I have bought it because it covers the international LTE bands too - very few devices have this amount of bands, especially for this price.As opposed to other phones, both SIM's are capable of LTE (one at a time), so it's easy when you travel just to add a SIM and not deal with the "home" SIM at all.LCD screen quality is good. Not OLED good, but still good.I took one star out because the WiFi doesn't support 5GHz band. In today's crowded 2.4GHz WiFi spectrum, it is a must. 4
The shipment time take too long. When I receive the product, the product is defected. Sometimes it works and sometime is not. Supplier feedback is good. They try to fix problem or refuned to me. I change the setting and it is not stable. What you can said. It is only watch. Not really good for cell phone. I would give supplier positive review, but the product itself is not as good as you thought.GSM Quadband Voice Dialing Watch Cell Phone Unlocked 2
I am glad that I purchased this product. This product has served me well so far.I recommend it to everyone. 5
Very cool phone to have for collection 3
GOOD DEVICE BUT TOO SMALL INTERNAL MEMORY 3
No update for kitkat and a poor 13 megapixel camera in the back. Turn off wifi , blue tooth and data while not using . Drains battery fast. Cheap phone . It works.....nice display 3
Apple has incorporated so many functions that it takes a while to configure the iPhone according to your preferences and privacy concerns. However this is a great small size smartphone with a powerful processor, screen resolution and camera. There's no going back to android for me now, though I wish Apple would be more friendly to a multi OS envirnonment (which is sort of the norm nowadays) in order to transfer files, etc, between Android, Windows, Mac OS X, and IOS devices wirelessly using Bluetooth. So far I haven't been able to do that with my Windows PC and even my old Mac OS X Lion. 4
I've bought this Apple iPhone 5 in March this year. It worked in the beginning well, but it stop charging two months ago. This was supposed to be a certified iphone. That wasn't fair. 1
DONT BUY IT keep you time "Refurbished NEW " UFFF yea people rigth about the battery only 1 hour hold battery 100% to 0 WATH what is tha No good for the price 200$ Naaa is used scratch dent dirty Naaa Of course I return 1
bought this item for jamaica but it only works with one of the phone carrier out there and it not the carrier i boughtit for .. 3
So for $100 dollars It was good more than you can ask for not as good as the big brand but useable nonetheless. Then the charging circuit stop working a month in so its a terrible product 2
I came to this phone from using a Nexus 4 for the last two and a half years and my initial impressions were very mixed. Starting with the positive things, I love the LTE, the bigger and more color accurate screen, the battery life, the expandable storage, the dual front facing speakers, and how light it is and how thin it is. All big improvements! I also appreciate the very light touch Alcatel used with their skin on Android. It's almost stock.So many great things and yet it was almost all brought down by an Achilles heel. The thing that really bugged me was that moving in and out of apps was really sluggish and choppy and not smooth at all. All of these things are super smooth on the Nexus 4, which is a 2012 phone. Even swipe typing on Google Keyboard was not great. I came pretty close to sending it back and getting a new Moto G.(I have no proof of this, but my guess is that the phone sends almost all of its processes to the slower of the two chipsets in the Snapdragon 615, the one clocked at 1ghz. Unfortunately there's no "high performance" option anywhere that would make everything run on the 1.5ghz chipset. The Nexus 4 proves this is plenty to run Android smoothly.)I didn't want to get a Moto G, especially after seeing (and hearing, seriously those speakers are great) this phone. Thankfully, Android is a pretty flexible OS and I was able to take matters into my own hands and make things more palatable. First thing I did was turn all animations off in the developer options. Second thing I did was I installed Nova launcher and selected the options to make things run "faster than light." Everything is MUCH smoother after doing those two things. Still not quite as smooth as the Nexus 4, but probably 95% of the way there. Close enough where I can deal with it and I can enjoy the good things about the phone that I admittedly skimped on in the first paragraph.So I really like this phone now. It's everything I wanted. It just took some tinkering to get there. 4
after about a week or so the lock button keep sticking I would not get this if I was you keep looking elsewhere 1
I loved .. excellent seller 5
Great it shipped in a couple days and I had no problems with it at all. I would recommend getting one. 5
Can this phone work outside US with any other GSM network..... just curious 3
I paid $245.00 for this phone and when I received it the touch screen seems to be going crazy. when you touch on one app, it goes to another app. It would have cost me too much to have it returned so I'm stuck with it. 2
Phone arrived and appeared new and in a Sprint iphone box. However, when brought to the Sprint store to activate they advised that it was not a Sprint phone and they would be unable to activate it for service. 1
I am really frustrated with the customer support of this product. I've been trying to figure out how to keep the LED notification to keep blinking when a new message has arrived and to continue to blink until I use the phone the next time and see the messages. I don't walk around with my phone in my hand like many but if I have it on the table and a message comes in I'd like to see the light blinking telling me I have new notifications. It's an option that seems should be available to users to customize on their own - but to not have that option is inexcusable.Try to find a fix or a way to contact Blackberry has been a horrible experience of searching all over the internet for many hours. What I did learn was this feature used to be part of the OS but is no longer - now it times out at 15 minutes. I finally found a web form being I bought the phone from Amazon to send in the concern for a response.However, after filling out all the information and hitting the submit key it Our records indicate that your BlackBerry Smartphone was not purchased through Amazon.com and gave me other options that will not work because I did indeed buy the phone from Amazon.I'm very disappointed with this product and being an investor in the company only makes my disappointment greater. To have me take the time to fill out all this info and then to tell me it wasn't purchased where I said it was and too bad soo sad! For a company that says they're listening to the customer I have to say they have built a wall around them so customers can't contact them. What a shame! 2
It sends and receives calls and that's about it. 3
good phone great price i am happy 4
Yes, it meets my expectation. 5
Works looks and my wife is very happy with it. Thank you. She won't go any where with out it. 5
This may seem really ridiculous but I ordered this last week and got it Saturday. Before I got it activated the other night the screen was messing up on me. I was having a lot of fun trying to put in my WiFi information. Anyway, I got it activated last night and everything was working fine. But now it's back to the way it was before it was activated. The screen was acting like it was possessed or a chipmunk on rd caffeine. It kept going to comments or my messages or previous pages on the Facebook app and it even did it on the Safari app when I decided to just use Facebook on that. Still acted up. I was really looking forward to trying out Apple but I'm really disappointed. Even with that 9.0.2 update or whatever it is, it's still doing it. The phone itself is great but that touchscreen thing, REALLY needs to be fixed. As well as on their future models. The only other positive thing I can say is that it finally showed my music than my previous phone did (not an iPhone). It would show less than half of it even though it was all right on the micro SD card I had in it.I will try Apple again someday when it gets better hopefully. If not, it's either just not meant for me, I got a lemon, or I should just curse the fact that I have big fingers. Lol. 2
My company standard for wireless communications is Blacberry, so, after I lost my old 8310, I decided to get the Gemini: good looking, newer OS, trackpad instead of the trackball.To this date, I'm very happy with the phone, I realize that there are very few functions this blackberry hasn't that are being offered on the most expensive and advanced models. Nevertheless, my use of the phone is very demanding (as well as our corporate standards) and it is usual to have to wait for the phone to stop showing th clock to start using it, which is the main reason to not rate it as a 5 star product. 4
Not sure how I feel about this phone. I usually get Samsung brand and decided to give Blu a whirl since my husband loves his. All in all its set up really nice. Everything is simple to find and easily accessible. It lags a little bit in apps but not much and not constantly. The cameras are excellent! That was my big draw to it, so there's a win. But the storage is absolutely terrible. I've never had an issue with storage on any phone before, but I had to delete apps that came on it and about 400 photos from my SD card in order to operate it. Otherwise, it's a decent phone. 3
Not a Scratch 1... PERFECT phone :) Very Very Happy!!! :) 5
Almost perfect, didn't come with Sim Door Key had to open the Sim tray with a coaxial connector pin. 4
Good phone with less problem 5
i got an amazon gift card when i did my taxes...that was my first mistake. once i got the card, i had to spend it...i looked at phones and ordered a cheap iphone...but after i month i realised it was not coming...i have asked for my money back... 1
I loved .. excellent seller 5
I bought the BlackBerry Bold 9000 in spite of what other users had written. Well, it wasn't my lucky day. The battery was not an official battery (appeared to be a knockoff), the screen would go white after 20 minutes of use (I attribute this to the battery as well) and the video camera would not function properly. I have sent my defective one back to Amazon and requested a replacement so hopefully it was just a fluke. 2
This phone is absolutely beautiful and I love it! The keyboard responds very well as opposed to other android phones I have used, the battery drains quickly but there are battery saver apps that work very well, bluetooth allows this phone to automatically connect to my smart watch, I have switched from an iPhone to this phone but instead of purchasing a new standard sized SIM, I bought a nano to Standard size adapter. I haven't had any serious problems with glitching and non responsive apps as cheap android phones tend to have. The only real issue I have is with the camera, there always seems to be a red tint to the pictures and unless you have amazing lighting, Snapchat and Instagram are virtually impossible so I would not recommend this phone to photographers. I on the other hand prefer to look at pictures as opposed to take them which you can do on this phone no problem. Oh, and man did I miss this Swype keyboard! The microphone and speakers on this phone work beautifully and the responsiveness of the messages app is great! There is very little delay between when someone sends me a message and I receive it. Overall, fantastic phone. Comes with a screen protector, too! 😄 4
This not working very well the lcd about 1 month is freeze and no more working 1
The SIM card reader is messed up so it keeps sayin invalid sim 1
It can be quite buggy as you would expect with any blue phone. Apparently it's stock Android, so software wise I honestly don't like it. I downloaded Google now because the phone doesn't come with a launcher. So many aspects of the design layout remind of all the things I don't enjoy about apple products. The camera is subpar for 2016 even at the 200 price point. The phone gets the job done...and I guess for 200 it's not bad. It could definitely be worse. But I definitely have no emotional attachment to this phone. If it fell into a lake and I had to replace it, I don't think I'd be upset. Oh and the alarm clock sucks. You can't manually type in the time, you have to scroll through the numbers to get to the time you want....apple much? If I wanted an apple phone I would have gotten an apple phone and had a much better camera 3
I got this to give as gift. It looks good for the price but feels cheapish. Well, for this price you can get something else also and a better name brand. It worked for few months and is slow now. The screen broke one day. I do not know how. 3
Phone arrived well packaged, but I was never able to register it with tracfone. Everything else worked, but I could not receive calls, even after several hours on the phone/online help with both apple and tracfone, so I had to send the phone back. 4
I bought this iPhone for my husband his been using it for 3 days already , so far no problems I connect the phone with Metro PCs everything is ok so far. 4
The product is in great working conditions. It is brand new and no scratches on dents. All functions are working perfectly and in order. But I notice there is no software with the CD and I know that there is a software that should accompany the phone for the Blackberry desktop manager (BDM). I do need the CD but it was not in the box. All Blackberry phones come witht the BDM CD. That was a big minus. 4
Excelente producto lo que yo estaba esperando adquirir me sirvio aqui en Venezuela buen precio me gusta mucho lo rec 4
This phone is horrible it does not charge and when it is fully charged it only stays on for 15 mins plus when the phone charges it overheats....i needed this phone for work and one of my customers with a dying 5% iphone stayed charged longer than this phone on 30% 1
After a year my teen is fully enjoying the Studio 5 C, & I needed a replacement phone so we ordered this thinking it would be an upgrade. Software, ease of setup & organizing music, apps etc. is great like any BLU product. Although, I'm disappointed in the camera, the photos are not as clear as the 5C and unfortunately we're most having problems with the screen (my teen thinks it's singular to our device) being either not responsive enough or too responsive (there's no 'tap' it's press firmly), jumping forward even without 'auto correct' active. After a week of texting with this phone I lost patience. Tech-friend thinks maybe it's the software lagging to keep up with our fingers? Will be returning this unfortunately and trying to match the 5C or upgrade to 7.0. We gave it a good shot, & will continue to purchase BLU for their excellent quality for an unbeatable price! 3
When I read the article description i thought that i would buy a nice iPhone in good conditions for a nice price.After using it a few times i got shocked and very anoyed because the cellphone has a displaydamage.There is a line in the display probably caused by letting the phone fell down.The description said nothing about it so i feel quiet engaged by the sellar!!! 1
Buen equipo celular de muy buenas caracteristicas para el precio que posee, no ha dado problemas de ningun tipo y funciona perfectamente en la red 3G 4
The phone did not come unlocked as advertised. When the package was delivered, it was stated in the bill that was locked onto the AT&T Network, not Factory Unlocked as advertised. 3
I received the phone on Nov. 13, 2015 and today Nov. 15, 2015 the phone turns off by itself and it's hard to get it back on. The volume is low and you will surely need a bluetooth. I read the reviews and I should have listened. The phone did not come with a return label. It is very pretty in color and a huge screen. The on/off button is very unstable. I wanted this phone so bad I should have waited. Also you will need the larger sim card if you are on the T-Mobile network. Do not insert the sim without reading the instructions. 2
A good non Samsung price cell phone. A good value for money 4
this phone has poor talk quality and it is not a 3g phone itis a 2g phone i called at&t to have them send me a new sim they asked for a imei # when i gave it to them them told me that is was 2g and they do not used 2g phone anymore and the internet is slow that is because it is a edge network not 3g!!!! overall the phone is a 3 out of 10 2
Nice phone, as described. Very happy! 5
I purchased this phone in May. By August, the battery was shot and could not hold a charge. The seller would not help me because it has been over 60 days. So now I'm stuck with this phone that constantly has to be plugged in. I might as well have a landline. 1
I received the product in Venezuela in excellent condition, thanks for everything, I recommend 100% to the seller. The Blackberry has been in operation for several months without any problems, is an excellent phone and everything works fine, one of them had a little detail on the screen is a little loose, but 100% functionalThought of returning but got more expensive the shipping to the U.S. from Venezuela to send it for repair here. 4
the phone came with the front camera in the wrong place and deep scratches all over, see the pictures 2
Second BLU cell phone. The SIMM holder is flimsy, the permanent battery seems to get hot, the volume button came off. What happened to the Blu Studio I loved in the past? 3
is ok if you are not going to take pictures with your phone. doesn't have good resolution I bought the blu 6.0 and it have 8.0 this phone only have I believe 5.0. pictures come out blury 3
It's amazing for the price. Sure it isn't as fast as flagship phones being an owner of an m9, but for what I payed it's a 5/5. 5
cheap. awful quality for pictures. basically doesn't take pictures. Is perfect for a kid. 2
The phone arrived extremely fast in just 2 business days, which I wasn't expecting but completely happy with! The phone looks better than I expected, almost new. It runs great. It arrived with everything the seller said it would in the listing. This was a great buy. I am extremely happy. 5
The phone has many glitches!! 2
the earphone jack is wobbly and does not stay in place rendering it useless. phone itself is ok. 3
I got a broken one. The lock button did not work, and a week later, it couldn't take a charge. 1
Camera stop working after two weeks 2
Calling quality is poor, sound is low and barely be heared, specially when you are outside, i did alot to fix but unable. Video call or regular call using viber or akype can be a problem, video can be seen but you won't be able to hear.Losing signal and poor connection is a problem.Shape is nice and price is reasonable. 3
Was just as I was hoping for. Good one to learn on. Thanks, 5
Product arrived as advertised...had USB wall plug and connector. Phone did not have most recent update, but easily accepted it. Arrived charged which was nice. No case or instructions, but the screen was immaculate and only very minor wear was shown on the back of the phone.Fired up immediately after installing my TMobile sim card in the tray. Good deal and great price. 4
I would of gave it five stars. The phone looked great. The only issue was that it was still attached too the previous owners iTunes account. There for I was unable to activate this phone. 3
it was in good condition but it was taking too long to load and when pressing the apps it stays too long or i have to turn it side ways 3
muy buen producto, cumple con mis expectativas y requerimientos, producto llego a tiempo y en excelentes condiciones por parte del vendedor, se los recomiendo para futuras compras 3
Love my phone and the service I received from J&R they are great! 4
5 stars is not enough for a phone like this. I have had Samsung changing to Samsung was a huge leap. After some years of using smartphones, I love Android and hate Samsung. 5
Nice packaging and build quality. Software seems to work snappy. However, the speaker and camera are poor. Speaker sounds light and tinny. Camera misses focus constantly even in broad daylight. The camera preview looks good, focus locks and chirps. Take a pic and the image is out of focus. I have compared it side by side with my old Samsung Alpha and a new Moto G4. The BLU's speaker and camera WAY underperform those. Unless I can figure out why the camera is so hit or miss (when other cameras seem to have no problem) I am going to send it back.If speaker quality and camera are not a concern, then nice phone for a nice price. 3
So excited to get it but we have had our I phone 4 for 3 weeks and one speaker is out and the home button sticks. :( but you can't beat the price and the phone looks great. :) 3
Wasn't unlock had to ship it to the states to get apple to unlock it 1
It sucks, phone stopped working on 2months 2
The phone worked great the first couple of weeks. It no longer rings and frequently hangs up on calls. 2
it overheat and shuts down frequently..... Am I the only one having this issue??? I need a refund. 2
Please do not waste your time and money. The phone I got was not unlocked. It was locked to Verizon and I needed T-Mobile . some people have gotten lucky and received an unlocked phone. But that was not my case. 1
Everything ok, great product, great value 4
Battery drains within a few hours, touch ID doesn't work-Disappointed in the product 2
The phone is great, really beautifull and helpfull but it didn't worked with 3G how it showed in the publicity. just EDGE at least in Vzla is not good enought because it won't be as fact as you expect.. but it arrived completed and fine. 3
I would certainly recommend this item to others 5
Disappointed! No instructions.... Purchased it as a present for a teenager, who is very "tech" smart and they weren't sure what to do because there wasn't a brand on it to be able to go to a web sight to research. :-( 2
In the beginning, this felt like the perfect cheap phone for international travel where you don't have to worry it you got it lost or stolen. It is cheap, it can run any Android app, and has two SIM slots so you don't have to take out your home SIM card, or you can use two cards between the two countries you most travel between.But after turning it on and downloading and installing all my essential apps, the problems popped up almost immediately after.The biggest issues are that:1) The phone is just too weak to run most apps.2) There simply isn't enough memory(512MB) to store and run all the apps you need.Let me expound further. For the first problem, you would think that a 1.3 GHz dual-core processor would be good enough to run basic apps. Well, you would be wrong. I knew before buying the phone that I would not be able to play games or run memory-intensive programs like I would with my Note 3/4, so I only installed apps that I would use for my travels, like international text apps like Viber, WhatsApp, Line, and FB Messenger, travel apps like Kayak, Agoda, FlightView, and Avast and Malwarebytes for security, and a few "fun" apps like Google, Pulse news reader, Facebook, Instagram, Bleacher Report, and YouTube.This situation ran into the second issue. 512 MB of memory is only good enough for about 10 of those basic apps. Although you have an option of putting in a MicroSD card and having the programs be stored in there instead, like all Android phones, there is still a bit of memory needed to be stored on the internal phone memory portion. So if you install about 10 of those apps, then you'll have about 50-75 MB of internal phone memory left, and then everything slows to a crawl. There was a point when I couldn't even answer phone calls because by the time the phone app loads up to be usable, it would be too late and turn into a missed call. Imagine that, the phone app couldn't even load up in time! I uninstalled Avast and Malwarebytes thinking since they are always running that they might be the most memory-hogging culprits. And although that helped a little, simple things like answering the phone, replying to text messages, opening up apps are still too slow to the point of beyond simple annoyance - they really mess you up.So if you want the best user experience for this phone, just use it as is exactly out of the box, or reset to default and erase everything you've installed on there. This in effect turns this phone into feature phone, not a smart phone. You might be able to surf the net for a little, but $60 for a feature phone is just not a good value anymore. I would recommend jumping up to the other quad-core BLUs' if you want a smart phone. They cost around $100-$150, but should be a lot more worth it.Now for the few things this phone gets right:* The screen is quite nice for such a cheap phone. It is quite bright, and if you're indoors you'll never have any problems. Sun-light legibility is not nearly as good, but is passable. Although the resolution is only 480x800, you will not notice much pixelation. Also, there is no ambient light sensor, so you'll have to adjust the screen brightness manually.* It is compact and light, the shell is made of light glossy plastic. After years of using the Samsung Note 2-4, I've almost forgotten how "compact" a 4" phone can be. And to remember when I first handled the 4.2" HTC HD2 in 2009 and thought who the h*** would want a phone this big!* The form factor is quite nice! Stylish and sleek, nothing to fault here.* The camera takes decent photos. Not top-tier, but not junk either. It is passable as to not be an issue.* Finally, the battery quality is quite good, and should last you through the day with no problems. But that might be aided due to the fact that I was never able to run anything long enough to really test the battery.The other things that could be better:* The internal speaker is decent and call quality is pretty good, but the loudspeaker is very soft and almost unusable outdoors.* So, this phone comes with a screen protector. But BLU's marketing guys thought it was a grand idea to slap a sticker on top of it to advertise the phone's main features. That would be a non-issue, except for the fact that that sticker is IMPOSSIBLE to take off without taking off the whole screen protector. And before you tell me I should have tried harder to take off the sticker more carefully - oh, trust me, I really did. But the sticker just simply does not come off smoothly, and leaves behind the paper and adhesive remains. I tried really hard to rub it all off, but it was impossible, so in the end I just took off the whole screen protector. What a waste, and what a STUPID idea by BLU!So all in all, I cannot recommend this phone. It is cheap, and the duo SIM feature is a great buying point. But I felt this phone could have been so much more, so much better. If just the simple apps ran just smoothly enough, this would be the best cheap phone ever - think about, only $60! But when the most cardinal feature cannot even execute right - simply answering a phone call - then you know there is something seriously wrong.Back to the drawing board, BLU. I really do hope you can get this right, I'm really pulling for you. 2
This phone IS unlocked. The "Top reviews" are misleading. 5
Just as described Fast shipping Thank you 5
This phone was great for about the first week I had it. Now I have to restart it about 2x a day because it freezes so much. It has trouble connecting to the WIFI, and it runs really slow. It has about a gig of space left on it, and none of the apps I use are very heavy. Not to mention I close them all the time! Going to be looking for a new phone very soon. Will not buy again. 1
all fine, time to go, cel, courier and the telephone is very easy manager, all so good, 100 % satisfaced 4
Item is damaged, would like a replaced device 1
Love the phone. Works and not a single scratch. any sim works on it and you can use it in other country 5
The Q10 in an of itself is a fabulous device. The one I bought here is the Verizon version and, as advertised, is unlocked so I was able to simply plug and play my sim card from my previous AT&T Blackberry and it works great. This phone is certainly used and likely refurbished, but is in impeccable physical shape. I cannot speak to its reliability as I have only had it one day, but I will update if needed. 4
This was not what i expected the watch touch screen didn't work. 2
About what you'd expect. Didn't use it for long. In my drawer in case of emergencies. 3
There have been a few quirks now and again but a solid tool, especially for those of us who are curious about a lot of things and need to be looking things up. 4
This Iphone product didn't meet my expectations at all. There were many damages around the phone casing, and the main speaker, on the front screen, wasn't working properly. Also the phone over-heats; not to mention the battery life drains faster than usual. 1
when I bought the phone, I had cracked the screen within a week of having it so I went to get it repaired and the tech employee said some plates and screws were missing. After a few weeks, the actual screen is coming loose and falling out sometimes... This could be a manufacturer malfunction but this iPhone is not good. 1
I've purchased my first iPhone after dealing with a temperamental droid for a year. I've gone Mac and I will never go back. 5
Buttons were broken in less than a month 1
Many bugs with the phone, like vibration on call, text is not working gone through manh troble shoots but no use 2
Great phone... No problems.. Phone works great like new. Phone came and I was surprised if the quality. Thanks a lot 5
I ordered this "new" iphone on August 2nd and the battery was bad from the start. So I called the apple company for my 1 year warranty you receive from any new apple product. But as I was talking to the people from apple they informed me that my phone had been used 3 years prior to me even receiving my phone, so I was unable for the warranty. This phone is NOT new and now only 2 months later my phone is unable to even turn on due to the previous use. I recommend ordering it right from a phone provider, such as verizon, sprint, at&t, etc. due to the scams like this seller has going on. 1
This was an amazing upgrade for us since we were still using a 3Gs. I would prefer a more solid battery, and I wish that voice control/siri could function w/o internet access but other than that; it's a good product at this price point. 4
Phone speaker does not want. Tried all online suggestions with no luck. 3
That's good. Big to you thanks! I very much liked to be your client, I will surely use your services again. 5
It didn't come with a charger so I had to go buy that.This is a new phone for me because I've never had iPhone.No instructions as how to set up.I would buy from this dealer again but I'll always ask more guestions. 4
1st phone would completely discharge after 2.5 hrs. Automatically mute itself so you couldn't hear it ring. Voice quality was fuzzy. Seller was not easy to deal with and after shipping the phone back to him, he denied there was anything wrong with it and was going to charge a 6% restocking fee!! After finally convincing him of the issues, he did send a working, quality phone. 5
Shipping errorsInformation is Blackberry Q10 Black 16GB Factory Unlocked, International Version - 4G / LTE 3, 7, 8, 20 (1800/2600/900/800 MHz) (New), in fact, it is Verizon SQN100-2, LTE 13, 4 , CDMA 1xRTT / EVDO Rev A (800/1900 MHz), and, within the battery compartment, no blackberry security tags, printing fuzzy, suspected to be refurbished. 2
So far works great I've had it for a week. No issues so far. thanks 5
This phone is impressive for it's price, but has some issues. Mainly BLU's quality control. The phone I received has a defective audio jack, and only plays audio on one channel. Not a huge problem, but irritating, especially since I listen to a lot of music, and it's not worth sending back. Basically, it's a crapshoot when buying a BLU product. Some work fine, yet others don't work at all. The phone is nice, but I have had cheaper phones that don't have issues like BLU phones do.You get what you pay for. 3
Here is my bit on this Blu product.Pros:Good battery life- Can easily go a full day of use:data, music, videos and gamesGood size- The phone is easy to hold and fit in my pocket.Light- Its very light when held or in your pocketGood Aesthetics- Its an attractive phone even when in its protective case. There are only 2 buttons on the device. To the top is the power/sleep and at the right side is volume.I bought the black and have been getting alot of compliments on its look.Display- The display is of a high quality 1080 x 1920Here are the Cons:I have had the phone close to a year and nowhere near full capacity and it lags quite often which becomes really annoying.While using the phone the touch buttons stop responding(options,home and back) but I am able to use the main screen. I will have to put the phone to sleep and wake it up so that it can start back operating properly.There are no updates from BLU what so ever. this is really disappointing as I bought it expecting to be able to get the Latest version of Android. Its currently 4.4 and no update since i got it in May 2014. 3
I bought this used and it had few noticeable scratches that weren't mentioned. I enjoy this product, it works faster than the iPhone 4s and came with new fully functional charger, headphones and cord. I am very happy with my purchase. 4
Its a decent phone except the fact that the synaptics touch sensitivity doesnt respond very well a lot of the time. If not for that Id probably love it. 3
The phone is great. It's amazing especially for the price, it's just like new and it was delivered very early. I love it. 5
well i don't have the phone yet but right now ill give it a 5star! I hope it was worth my money update 4/3/16 phone works perfectly for to update... 9/27/16 the screen is very lose pops in and out with the slightest drop. Dropping the score 3star 3
Phone goes off by itself from time to time. 3
The battery issues I have with this phone make it almost unusable. After I charge it completely and start using it, the battery heats to extreme temperatures and then all the power is drained out. A full charge lasts me literally 2 hours. I bought the item with "no warranty" but didn't expect the seller to sell something in this condition. Unsatisfied. Will go back to ebay.com where I NEVER had any issues. So long Amazon! 2
Doesn't work for tmobile at all. Tried to put the SIM card in and it won't read itDon't buy this phone. 1
The phone was on time and no cracks, but minor wear. However, after a week it blanked out and gave me issues, it does this once every few weeks.But other than that, I do enjoy my phone. 4
The wireless network does not work ! 1
Thank goodness the phone worked. However the earphones were not the original apple earphones; they looked very cheap and you can tell they aren't from apple. 2
Arrived in record time! A few scratches by the charge port, but nothing real damaging.If your carrier is sprint or Verizon be aware that this is not a CDMA unlocked phone and you will need a SIM card. You can contact their support team over the phone and they will help setup a SIM card for you, but you won't be able to just walk in store and get your phone activated. Leaving you with a wait of a week or more for your new beauty. 4
I had to take this phone in after owning it for 3 months (kept in a life-proof case). I was told by Apple that it was a refurbished phone, the screen is loose, and I am having software problems. This was not a new phone as advertised. 1
They were very good and the seller is very trustworthy. 4
Was a very nice looking phone. The size was working perfectly until it said I was running out of memory so I purchased another sim card. I put into the phone and the phone stopped working. Had to return it. 2
The watch is connected and off all the time 2
Software issues within the first week, speaker issues immediately. Go buy a new one never refurbished from these guys, GREAT customer service when I emailed them about poor phone though 1
iPhone was unlocked. It didn't come with head phones tough. I took this to Argentina and it worked great with the cellular companies down there 5
I love this phone, it has a great screen its fast, it hasnt crashed on me, the camera is great, the resolution is also very good, the fingerprint lock is also a great add on, the only problem Ive had is that when I go to Mexico my data roaming doenst work, and I though it was my provider but it seems its not, I've changed the apn, network, roaming and sim settings but that has not worked 4
Phone was broken when I got it. 2
The phone unlocked, good but nothing else 4
I got this phone Monday and it's keep cutting off when it's fully charged.why is this happening 1
I first decided to buy the phone because it was relatively within my budget and I've never really been one for fancy phones. A couple weeks after I received it, the phone started acting funny. When I changed to a different screen, I'd notice that the screen I was on before would remain in the background FOREVER, I kid you not! Videos are not really clear, but sound quality is really good(louder than my laptop!) Overall, if you dont have another choice, it'll do. But I don't see it as a good quality long-term cellphone. 2
For the price not worth it. Makes a loud screeching noise during conversation speaker not loud enough 3
This phone was used. I was disappointed, but could not see spending so much money for a obviously used phone. 2
Did not work, I sent it back and never got a refund 1
The phone does work. However, the seller said that it had never been dropped and it clearly has. It had some pretty big gashes on one end of it. The screen was good though. The volume buttons don't want to work sometimes but so far, I've been able to mess with them until they do. 3
It's pretty good, i can't really complain, maybe they should send a more decent charger next time, at first I thought the battery was corrupted, it was the charger, when I used my own, it was better 5
Phone works well, no problems does exactly what a 5c apple phone should do. I have phone for months now. No scratches no marks on phone, came with a wall charger & great bargin price. 4
The front flash make all my pictures black. If it wasnt for that, i would give it 5 stars because iPhones are the best. But that is just a seller issue, not a phone issue 2
This IPhone was used, I bought as a bran new, tricky supplier :( 1
The phone was in very very good condition! Everything works perfectly on the phone. Seller shipped fast. 5
Sent back cause the imei number won't work with boost mobile service. 1
The phone glitches which hinders it being unlocked and overall performance. 2
It was a very good deal.. was the way it was described.. cosmetic condition was too good!! And totally functional 5
i love this phone but its too big for my petite hands 3
I just love it and it was a big deal!!! :D 5
Very poor reception and voice quality. Feels like a toy and performs on that level-reflects low price. Extra points for the battery which is really strong. 2
This was a fairly beat up phone that worked well and had tons of features, I bought this 2 or 3 years ago and now its sitting in a drawer but the seller was very helpful in answering my questions and the phone was great for the money 4
Phone worked great , but didn't include anything listed in the description. 3
in ma blackberry 8520 3 buttons work so bad.the box was scratched and terrible.and its buggy with windows.i rate 2 to this item,unfortunately 2
pretty crappy as far as phones go, but the price is right, then again. 3
Goog value for mony, great support from the seller 2
First, the battery will not reloaded and had to buy a new charger for the battery could work.Now the iphone does not recognize the chip and gsm is no signal to speak.The antenna of the iphone is not functional. 1
came earlier than excpected and literally seemed like a new iPhone. no need to spend $500 when you can spend a lot less on one here. 5
Updated Review:Lowering my rating to 2 stars because I'm starting to hate this phone. This phone is becoming slower and slower. I even tried cleaning up old text messages but nothing helps. I have to wait like 5 seconds for it to find a contact and then it lags a couple more seconds before it starts dialing. Blackberry has stopped releasing patches which really sucks because one the last few patches released sometime in the beginning of 2016 really screwed something up with the Bluetooth pairing. Every time I start my car up I don't know what my phone is doing but you can't send text messages for like 20 minutes!!! If you go for a short drive to meet someone up your only option is to call them because it still doesn't work even after the Bluetooth is disconnected.Previous review:Finally they started listening to their customer's! Got rid of my iPhone 6 and couldn't be happier. I stopped calling, texting and emailing people because it was a major pain with that toy. This thing just works and is great for communicating with people. For those that like to game there is the Amazon App store. Gave it 4 stars because it's a pain to install google maps and what's up with the non-removable battery. 2
Was in excellent condition and worked as advertised. 5
the sim I brought didn't fit the phone and I returned it on Wednesday the 14 3
The Phone came unlocked & its a sweet surprise for this price 5
Speaker whiskey poor, bought a different BLU model and big difference! 2
I HATE THIS PHONE, much too small for me and does things I don't like it doing. I miss my Samsung Galaxy S5 1
The phone came in alright condition. It has scratches and dings on. BUT it does not come with a SIM and it is not clearly noted on the description. Make sure you have a SIM because it's a huge pain to get one! Two to three weeks shipping for me. 3
Wasn't unlock had to ship it to the states to get apple to unlock it 1
few minor glitches bad battery had to get a new battery and the phone is only about six months old 3
I'm having problem with the charging system of this my iPhone 6s Plus. When I plug it to the charger, it rather discharges instead of charging. It discharges to zero before recharging & it's usually following difficult to start recharging. I noticed the battery is also discharging faster. All these started two days ago.I'm currently in Tel Aviv, Israel.What should I do? 4
The guy cheat to me because he sent me locked phone without headphone but I ordered locked phone. I am kind of dissapointed 1
The phone works fine with my T-mobile sim card and looks new. However it is quite slow (and I'm not sure if I've just grown used to the speed of the newer versions) and sometimes the screen freezes. 3
1,why to choose this rate? A month later, cheaper $20!2,what i like? the screen is great , no mater in the sunshine or at night. The camera is also great ,fast. Call sound more or less.3,Some android app not run well , not enough BB app. Can not set the another browser(Opera) to the default one.I can not shield the pictures in the original browser, sometimes waste much data.4, pls see 2. if u want buy one. 4
I was not looking to spend lot on a cell phone as there is always a better one available in every month. Everything, be it Processor or RAM ..are increasing and so are the Applications size. So I narrowed down to the basic features of a smart phone: Calling, browsing, music, GPS, photos/videos, VOIP etc. BLUE Life pure was a good deal.Pros: Perfect shape and design, Decent voice quality, elegant looks, holds light.Cons: Screen could have been better. I doubt there isn't Stereo speaker as well. Camera is poor in low light. 3
I brought this phone in September and it stopped working in October it was a brand new and all the accessories are non genuine. Please save your money and do not buy this phone. They only haven one month warranty. BIG WASTE OF MY MONEY PLEASE DON'T BUY. 1
False information did not mention cracked screen until last minute 1
good afternoonI make a reference question to my phone iphone 5, which acquired through you .. do four months my phone just gets the iphone logo that is on the apple which does not allow me access to the device functions .. .what can I do 1
I didn't like the idea that the watch is having a camera 2
Awesome phone and great shipping! 5
They should notify customers and let them know that you need to buy a Sim card and a memory card beware!!!! Overall good watch though 2
My husband breaks his otter box belt clip about every 5 to 6 months, so it was great to get this pack of 3. It fit perfect with his otter box. 5
This phone was not unlocked! As I live overseas I had no way to return it. After calling Apple and then AT&T (who Apple told me was the carrier my phone was locked to), AT&T was able to unlock the phone for me in a few hours... but I was one of the lucky ones! If the previous phone owner had not respected their contract AT&T would have refused to unlock the phone... 2
Good phone, but for some reason the touch functioning in the screen is messed up. If it continues I'll have it replaced and right a new review. 5 stars if the screen was working fully 3
The phone came relatively quickly and has been working great this far (3months)However the cord that came with it doesn't work any longer and I will need to go buy one, also never came with an adapter so that was an additional expense. other than that my daughter loves her phone and I think I want one too! 4
this product seems to be brand new have no problems with the phone at all no scratches or dents very happy with it 5
I like the phone, I hate that call volume is very low, the camera takes ok pics, the front facing camera ok pics too, I bought an micro sd card but it won't fit into my phone, I would not buy another blu phone, can anyone tell me why my micro sdhc card won't fit into my phone n how can I install it 3
i was real impressed its just wat we ordered thanks so much 5
I like price Vs performance. Its a good phone. 4
Minor blemishes on the back for a "New Factory Unlocked GSM IPhone 5C" but all in all I'm satisfied 3
this phone networking problem, all time network up-down. no right way receive & send call so i want to return it. 2
a fraud. battery lasts an hour having loaded completely and has operational failures. I do not recommend 1
The back feels good to use, but feels cheap for the price. 3
Phone works and was in really good condition the only reason I didnt give 5 stars is because I ordered a silver iphone and recieved the space grey iphone. 4
The phone works fine when it's not on the charger. Once the charger is plugged in, it starts glitching and closes the app/text I am currently on. 2
I really like this phone，This is a good phone，High cost,，The main thing is that it is very cheap，So, I am very satisfied 5
Good deal for an 5C iPhone. As advertise by the vendor. iPhone was in great conditions. It came with Original box, USB cable for the charger and the headphones. The only small complain was that the phone came with a not good SIM Card, which was provided at the Sprint Store. Great price for the item. Vendor was easy to contact and get a feedback. Recommend this vendor ! 4
Battery depletes faster than an ice cream in oven melts. I am not able to open pictures sent via sms. It is ok as a phone, nothing great. 3
I bring this iPhone 4 to Shanghai for gift, but in Shanghai dose not work, looks like was locked! So I have to bring back to US to unlocked! 1
Its ok...my mom uses it 3
The phone is pretty, takes good photos, has a nice display, good call quality, and is very lightweight. However mine three months in has begun to freeze multiple times a day (touching the screen does nothing and I often have to reboot). That is very frustrating and it makes the phone feel like a bad bargain instead of a good one. 3
Great iPhone 5C for a used one! Has a few miner scratches but if it wasn't cause of that would off gave it 5 stars. Other than that no complaints works well. 4
I gave this phone to my wife as a present and she loves it - works excellent! 5
quality team recommend them to everyone on amazon. 5
This has been a disspointment. After a few months of usage the phone is not working well and giving problems. Sometimes it boots and other it doesn't. If you buy from this seller you are risking to have the phone go bad in a few weeks. 2
I would definitely give 5 stars but as of the beginning of the week my sound just all of a sudden stopped working. I've only had the phone 3 months! I have tried literally everything to fix it. There is nothing online to try to help. Even did a factory reset. The back does not come off and when I attempted to try to take it off the whole screen cracked and now it won't work at all. Luckily I bought the phone when it was $200 cheaper I would never spend over $200 on an off brand phone again. I wish it didn't happen because everything was great with the phone. Only other issue was it not having 4G LTE which when I'm not around wifi can be a pain. I guess I'm to stick with the major brands from now on. 3
I thought I was the responsible one and didn't pay for the insurance for my phone. Of course I was the one who dropped their phone in the rain and it cracked all over the place. Anyway, I found one on Amazon that was about the price as if I had paid the monthly insurance premium all this time. The home button sticks sometimes but my stepdaughter put a menu icon on the front so I can quickly get the home screen. Kids know all kinds of neat stuff. 3
Phone came in mail pretty reasonably but the phone won't turn on or take a charge...seller obviously didn't check to make sure it worked before sending it out. They are based out of Brooklyn so I'm sure they are a lot of shady stores there. 1
after 1 year is having some issues 3
Excellent model for all the use I give to mobile devices. Operating system and quick access to all the applications I use daily. 100 percent preferred. 5
Bought 2x @ $199.99 pre-order price, best deal for a flagship phone. Gave them as birthday gifts to my daughters. They love it!!! Screen is bright & sharp, dual front speakers are loud and clear, both front and rear cams take good/clear pictures. Phone works great on AT&T LTE network, connection is fast for data (Youtube streaming, FB, snapchat, browsing, etc) and battery lasts all day!!! Only cons are it doesn't come with pre-installed screen protector & soft clear case (like from BLU).Overall, still 5-star rating ... 5
I didn't really like it. But before I get into it, I will say that the two things I did enjoy were the overall handsome, sturdy look and feel of the phone and the vivid brightness of the screen, which was easy on the eyes and battery life (even with the Night Filter app running). Other than that, the camera was OK.The thing I found myself getting very annoyed at was having to tap an icon or option more than once just to activate it. For example, I had Google Maps and several other apps open. There was no lag at all. But when I hit the recent apps key to get rid of a few apps (I had to tap that a couple of times), some of the apps I tried to swipe away would open because the screen was not as responsive to my quick touch. Another example was in the phone settings, when tapping on the categories, a firmer touch than what I'm used to was required to get to the next screen.Compared to the BLU Studio Super Camera I've been using for the past couple of months, which is pretty fast and responsive, the C5+5 seems lethargic. It definitely has some touch factor issues. The phone is not buggy; rather, it's just quite cumbersome when it comes to standard touch operations like scrolling and selecting.I guess what I thought might be a slightly better device than my fast Super Camera, turned out to have more of an entry-level feel to it. Even though it looked nice and felt sturdy in my hand, it was actually quite dull and sluggish. 3
Excellent!!! The seller was great to work with! 5
not to bad once you play with it a bit. i got it to use as an mp3 player well working around the house that i wont need head phones for and play via a blue tooth speaker. it wont sync and also i have to get a new bar for the watch band witch came (new today still in box) broken 2
device was working properly for the first 3-4 weeks then after that it went into recovery mode and cant come off left it over night on the charger and it was not charging for some reason now its not coming on at all. 4
Broke within two weeks and couldn't turn it back on!! Also time zone was stuck on Austria!!!! 1
Phone was purchased for my son. He's loving the phone so far and has been using it for a couple of months now. Takes pretty good pictures. Phone is snappy even only having 1.5gb of ram. Doesn't crash when he uses Snapchat which he's very happy about!!! His prior phone would crash on some apps. I'd highly recommend this phone for anybody on a budget & wanting a decent mid-range phone. Also, for anybody wondering this device did receive the Android M (Marshmallow) update. 5
Phone is great, as seller promised was in perfect condition. 3 stard because I attempted to use two different services to unlock the phone and was denied. AT&T will not unlock the phone if the phone is still considered under contract. 3
Please do not buy these phones as they will not last long. i bought 3 of them and all of them stop functioning within 3 months of use. 2
It's an Apple! It always works as it should and that is why I continue to purchase apple products 5
Packaging was good, what it can with was good, but the phone itself I had problems with. I currently have tmobile and the phone is lacking service every now and then, I had s few stops between apple and tmobile, both saying its SIM card. So far havnt figure out a solution 3
D not like it too small. the picture fools you. 2
Great compact, economical phone. The only downside is the internal storage space. I can't even fit Twitter on my new phone as it wants to install everything on the internal memory. 3
The product is find but the battery is not giving proper backup time. it's rather silly. 3
The phone it self is great, every thing is nice but the box was opened and the phone itself is as new. There are fingerprints on it and dirts under the screen firm. There was a blackberry ID registered with it before I did anything. Plus there was no initial set up when first turned on. Absolutely have been used before. 4
Not the best blu phone it keeps on turning off end up returning it 3
I love my Apple Watch Sport 42mm. The watch was in great condition and just like new. I didn't realize it was a refurb until I received it. My fault for not reading well. I would say that if you are going to spend $300 for an Apple Watch, you might as well by a new one. I am a tech geek and I love Apple products. The Apple watch was a must have for me. I would by Apple Watch again. But I would shop a little more sensibly next time and for this price, I would probably just spend a few more dollars to get a new one. 4
The phone is very nice. I bought it for the stereo speakers built-in and they don't disappoint. The speakers are loud. The screen is clear and can show good videos. The size is just right in my hand. The inverting screen is a great feature to use. 5
The phone works but we find ourselves having to shut it off and turn it back on more than normal. 4
Smaller than I anticipated. Bought for elderly person with poor eyesight. 3
Parts of my screen did not work. I had to go get it fix 2
If I talk on the phone for more than 10 minutes it dies then sometimes it dies even if I'm not using it..sometimes it can have 95% and it will die...The only reason why I haven't sent it back yet is due to the fact that my job requires me to have a phone so going even two days without it will disturb my job...so all day it stays on the charger even if I'm at work if I'm sleeping when I'm in the car if I talk more than two minutes it has to be on the charge so it won't die...physically the phone it looks great as described no broken screen no cracks is just the battery....then when I emailed I was told it can take four weeks or longer to get a refund 1
its a great phone, and it has last compared with my other phones 5
arrive not on time was expected,, was arrive in new year 2013...disapointedGooday & happy new year god bless peace. 3
I purchased this phone as a emergency replacement for my LG Optimus G Pro. Phone build is decent. Very thin phone. The screen is bright and responsive. Sound (speakerphone) is rather "tinny" sounding, as the speaker is small. Phone is very laggy. Although it has a Octo core cpu, the phone is held back tremendously by the rather paltry 1 gb ram. If this was a 2010 phone, that may have sufficed, but the Android OS has grown, and apps and games require much more memory to perform optimally. Overall 3/5. 3
I was very skeptical about purchasing a used phone, especially an iPhone. But I found myself in a desperate situation to replace my old cell phone in a hurry. So I took a chance, hoping for the best, but expecting the worst. However, when I opened box I couldn't have been more pleasantly surprised.The device is not only in "good" condition, as described by the seller, it suprassed my expectations! There wasn't a scratch on it and it looks and works like new. And it even came with the free case as promised. The delivery was speedy. In fact the package arrived lot quicker than I expected. All in all, I am very happy with my purchase. I would highly recommend anyone to buy from this seller. 5
This phone was listed as stolen 1

Phone was fine at first, but after two weeks it was constantly shutting down. The power button got stuck down. Took the phone to Apple and they said it was toast. I was able to return this phone through Amazon though for a full refund and ended up just buying a new I-Phone 6 from my wireless provider. 1
Phone arrived and appeared new and in a Sprint iphone box. However, when brought to the Sprint store to activate they advised that it was not a Sprint phone and they would be unable to activate it for service. 1
I bought this phone back in October 2015 and added a Protection Plan. Now only 7 mos. later the Home button is not working properly. I called the protection plan service provider to submit a repair/replacement claim and they referred me to Apple. Apple said the Limited Warranty expired and referred me back to the service provider. Well, it seems no one is willing to make good on this purchase. I totally understand this is an older phone model, but that's why I purchased a protection plan, now I'm out $274.95 for a bad phone. 1
Completely unlockec new phone. Pretty good though seems a bit slow. But if you consider doing only basic phone functions and chats, then shouldnt face troubles. 5
My son purchased this phone for $432.99 on August the 20th. He has taken extremely good care of this phone, and has not let anything come into contact except for a phone case and charger cord. 4 months and 2 days later, the phone crashes with a faulty logic board. The phone was new, as advertised, but he is unable to return it for an exchange. I would like to know how to get into contact with the seller for a refund to my son's debit card, as he is now without a phone. 1
Speaker sound from phone when making a call is not good 2
The phone was exactly as stated in the description! I'm very excited about the item! 5
Love blackberries, but this one is little bit slower that Z30 so I had to return. 4
Very happy with the phone, it takes a while to learn how to use all the options and functions but there is good on-line documentation available. 4
Great condition, works perfect. fast delivery seller, 100% recomended 5
Nice nice nice 100% !! 👌👌 5
Listing said refurbished but you'd never know--looks like a brand new phone sealed in the box. Works great and arrived quickly. 5
I wanted this phone because it was new in the box and unlocked. 5
Doesn't do enough. I sold it on Ebay within 30 days of purchasing it. 2
Item as advertised delivered promptly and securely... 5 stars!!! 5
The phone died after just over 30 days, retuned to distributor at a cost to me, awaiting a fix or refund 1
I changed from Android to Apple and I don't regret it. I absolutely love this phone. Works great and fast. The battery life is way better, too. 5
Thank you so much . I love my phone it came faster than I expected . Worth every penny. 4
I love the phone, and the communication with Cellstore33 was amazing! I cannot express how helpful they were! 5
Love the phone 📱 works great 👍 no problems .Will continue to use Amazon for such great deal finds ". Thanks Amazon 5
You bought a phone that was supposed to be new and was refurbished, you send it me on a napkin whitout charger or accesories and when i return it rather than returning me 300 dollars that i pay for it, you only give me 200 dollar, abusive. Get unable to retur 80 percent at least. 1
It was only gold. Not rose gold 2
This phone was in good condition but was not able to work in my country...advise ensure you have all the info so you would not be at a loset..but I was please with the product just didn't get to enjoy the use of it. 3
The battery doesn't hold a charge even for one day. Really unhappy with this item. I had a BLU phone with the larger battery and held the charge sometimes for 3 days but this one is just useless. Wish I hadn't bought it. 2
I'm so glad with this order about everything, from the product to its price and delivery time as well. Strongly recommended. 5
I like it becouse the price is razonable 5
Gave me a phone that was locked and it wasn't done being paid for . Highly upset 1
I am writing this to inform you that the phone that acquired through this page June 22, stopped working at first that damage the battery "bulged" and then phone software that started to fail 2
It said gold but it's a old scratched up phone and it's white I want a refund that's hard to get back not a happy camper 1
Phone arrived in good condition as advertised. 4
At this price I think that Idole 3 can be considered one of the best smartphones on the market.It is a good device and very easy to handle.PRO: LTE frequencies working with AT&T and other US carriers, Android Lollipop, excellent and brilliant screen, very good cameras (front camera is 8 mp!), excellent stereo speakers, good battery.CON: processor MSM8939 is not fast: avoid multitasking! audio during calls could have a little more clarity. 5
Let's hope he can keep from cracking this one. LOL 5
nice phone. holds all my junk 4
In a world of smartphones, if you want a basic function phone that's just for calling and/or texting, this would appear to meet your needs. I recently purchased one for my mother to use with a prepaid calling plan. What wasn't clear when I bought this is that this phone only works with a 2G network, and the carrier I obtained service from is shutting down its 2G network at the end of 2016. If you need a 3G-compatible phone, you'll need something else. From what I've read, each major carrier is handling their 2G shutdown on a different timeframe, so this may still work for you, depending on your carrier. 3
Unresponsive screen. Returned same day it was delivered 2
Great phone, just so you know it only can be in service with sprint but 5
I really had to drop this watch down for connectivity issues and the all around quality. the phone drops signal alot and the wristband was so small I had to give it to my girlfriend. Who could barely wear it. 2
The phone is absolutely perfect. It was able to do everything I needed it to do plus much more. Hopefully I can find a 5 at a great price so I can upgrade 5
Valid for Movilnet in Venezuela, low memory, bad camera, low price, great!! 3
I originally picked this up as a costume piece, but I ended up using it when I dropped my smartphone. It's a fine device. The communication features are a bit limited, but it also includes a handful of nifty features most modern smartphone users will be used to.The phone only features a very dated network connection, no data options here. Voice calls and text messaging are available on the device, but email, internet, and other data connection features are not available. Even modern baseline options like visual voicemail are not featured here (of course, holding the 1 key will get you to your messages just like the old days).Voice quality is okay, a little quiet on the normal earpiece speaker, but the handsfree speakerphone has a respectable volume. The connection is not nearly as clear as you'll get on any smartphone though, and is not even comparable to a wifi-call. Texting on a classic dialpad is a bit of a pain, especially without something like T9 predictive text. There are multiple keyboard options, so most special characters should be covered.The device charges quickly via a micro USB port, though I have yet to find any way to use that to transmit data to the phones internal storage or expandable microSD storage. Speaking of, the device does allow for 32GB of expandable storage (on top of the measley 5.5KB of internal). You can load images, songs, and video to the device (though video may be restricted to the archaic .3gp file type - I've yet to experiment). The music player is pretty bare-bones, but it does allow for background play, and the phone has a 1/8" audio jack for headphones/auxiliarry output. You can also pair with blutooth devices and play audio that way, but the quality is very bad. I haven't done any testing with a blutooth headset, but I imagine it would not have any issue using that.Some weird things with the phone I've noticed include a lack of a discreet volume setting. Instead, the phone has 4 ring profiles - General (normal), Silent (no ring/vibrate), Meeting (vibrate), and Outdoor (loud). Custom ringtones are possible with any mp3 audio file you load on the device, which is nice, but you cannot update the text message notification tone.The calendar function on the device is nothing more than a date tracker. You can view a calendar, but cannot make any appointments. There are also 5 alarms that can be set simultaneously, with custom day repeat options.The camera sucks. Not much else to say about that.I haven't used the Dual SIM feature, since I only have one SIM card, but my AT&T card works without any issues in both slots (located inside the battery compartment). Battery life is great as well, lasting well over a day - my battery indicator shows, at worst, 2/3 battery left after a full day (though that's probably because I only play music from it for about 1-2 hours during the day and maybe a few texts - still better than my iPhone used to do).It's not a bad backup phone (though BLU makes budget smartphones too, so that might be a better option), and I'll be keeping it on-hand in the future. Just in case. :) 3
Does the job and has some nice features. I would recommend it for the price 3
Great new condition, no problem activating. Great phone! 5
Worked for a while like a year or so.....then suddenly stopped. Takes pictures horrible. low storage as well. 2
screen will eventually pop off of the cheap plastic back. do not get it 2
So I first received my phone in February and all was fine except for missing add-ons (memory card, headphones, manuals, etc.)but the seller stated that those items do not come with it if it is purchased USED...while I did not agree with the notion, I accepted it. But now after two and a half months, my phone no longer works.Please be careful when buying used items...now what do I do?The phone is a good purchase but did not last long enough to be enjoyed... 3
You may run into issues with AT&t: Big brother does not like IMEI numbers it does not have in its database. Unless I am wrong and the phone is broken ( screen becomes unresponsive when you put SIM in ) AT&T may be blocking this phone on their network. Its a disappointment. We had this gadget for our kiddo from another vendor for over a year and it worked fine. 2
Blackberry Gemini 8520 Curve Unlocked Quadband GSM Smart Phone with 2 MP Camera, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi--International Version (WHITE), HE ESTADO UNSANDO ESTE EQUIPO Y ME PARECE QUE ES MUY BUENO Y CUMPLE CON TODAS LAS EXPECTATIVAS QUE YO ESPERABA, CONSIDERO QUE ESTA EMPRESA ES SERIA Y RESPONSABLE.

They are OK.. Very slow doesn't work so good with T-Mobile.Yellow one works better then the pink one. Pink one won't run half the apps the yellow one will. Pic quality isn't all that great. 3
Love it! Everything and more than I expected! How did I come right without it?! Ha! Siri is great, delivery was fast, phone condition is as mentioned. 5 stars all around! 5
very nice phone and i like it 5
There are not many phone in this price range when buying unlocked and this is one of the best. The performance is fine for every day tasks and the call quality is decent. For this price you can not expect much from the phone, and it performs mostly how you would expect... decent for almost all uses. My biggest complaint about this product is the storage space, after the software, you only have room for a couple of apps and pictures. Overall this phone is the best for the price, but do not expect it to perform like a brand new flagship phone. 4
Did not work wlth my chip 2
Ha! I can use it in China! However, I should use iPhone 7 carefully! Chinese Apple Store never help me to repair my iPhone 7 from America . 4
The Screen can Crack easy 3
this is not new used scrtch ,bad box 2
I really love this iPhone it looks brand new its was well packedand i have no problem with it so far. I will be buying another one from this seller in the future i recommend this to anyone 5
Almost perfect, didn't come with Sim Door Key had to open the Sim tray with a coaxial connector pin. 4

The volume does not workIt also came in late very lateIts nice phone dough 3
the phone is working fine,but the earphone and its accessary that came with the phone doesn't seem to be original earphone, it looks chinese and the production is not good. 4
the phone works great and it looks new 5
the phone was locked i waste the money 1
Don't waste your time . 1
The phone was in better shape than advertised. 4
I got this for my son to get him started on the IPhone but without having to break the bank. It will last him a couple of years and then we can upgrade again. The product was brand new, works great and does everything he needs. The seller was prompt. It came right away. 4
Very happy with the phone! Great buy 3
 So i got this Juning phone 3 days ago, and i started using it already, and i have no complains about this phone. Everything works well, i downloaded music as well and the built in speaker is super clear. As you can see it or hear on my video. You be the judge. Not just that, the apps works perfectly fine. And also before i forget, one thing that i ,ove about thins phone also is that it has BUILT in TORCH flashlight app already which we can use if or when there's a block out on a certain place that needs light.The quality of this JUNING phone is great i could not ask for more. Everything that i wrote and you've seen in the video is all true. Everything i say on my review is based on my personal experience for days that i have been using this juning phone. And lastly i will personally recommend this product to my family and friends. Its user friendly very easy to operate and Its really a great phone and its worth of your money as well too.I got this phone for free in return only of my honest and unbiased review of this product, I am writing what I experienced and only based of my experience, while using the JUNING PHONE. I would just like to thank sophie also, you are one of kind. 5
I was really excited to get this phone. I had previously purchased a BLU phone and loved it but after 2 yrs it was time to replace it. I saw this one and ordered it. It came quickly and was packaged nicely. It came with a slim case which is just a snap on cover, a charger and headphones. I watched a you tube video before I received the phone and was really looking forward to its arrival. It came on my Birthday so it was a nice gift. I ordered the gold one which I absolutely loved. The reviews and description boost about its long battery life and quick charging. I un-packaged it at 75%. Started to set it up, adding my gmail account, setting alarms. Just the basics. Took me about 30 min. At that time the battery level had dropped to 22%. Since it was right out of the box I decided to charge it. I used the charger that came with it. It was late so I set it on the dresser and went to bed. In the morning I checked it and it was at 66%. I didn't understand. It was supposed to charge completely in 10 min. After that I had to have it on the charger constantly. The screen started to freeze before the end of the same day. Then the screen wasn't reacting to my finger swipes. I tried to use GPS but if I opened another app or got a text or call it would close the maps app. I found myself restarting the phone about a dozen times in just the first day. I am really sad that I have to return it. I read all the review about trying to return the phone through the company. I avoided that mess by doing the return through Amazon. It was quick and easy. I got the return slip and shipped the phone back. 2
It didn't work. The microphone wouldn't work half the time and the person couldn't hear me. Photos were unclear with lines across the screen! 1
for the price is what you get, I would like to have the old school designs, with some modern functions, but now every cellphone seems to be very generic product on that segment, the screen is not so responsive, and it feels very very slow. for that segment of price I recommend a windows phone with abetter touchscreen. 3
I brought this for my girlfriend and she loves the phone. I don't like Apple I prefer Samsung but she like this product! 4
Phone won't hold a charge and the volume down button doesn't work. Definitely not a quality phone. 1
Bought the phone from RnD Outlet - 'New' from Amazon. Recieved the phone and took it to an Apple store to give it a check over. Unsurprising the phone is not New. It was Sold in a Best Buy in 2010 (thanks to the apple store guys for checking it for me). It has no warranty, obviously because it is not new but at least the internal parts are all legitimate apple components. The plastic screen protectors have been removed and put back on again - you can tell because there are specks of dirt or grit all over it (another point to it being second hand). On the plus side it does indeed appear to be Unlocked. Not going to return it, it looks in good enough condition. Hopefully it is not going to die in the first few months. 3
Verizon store couldn't get phone service to work. Had to return. 1
When I recharge the battery is very hot hot hot 3
This phone worked fine for about 5 months and then it quit capturing v-mail messages and would only show text messages sporadically and mostly only when I was at home and in close range of Wi-Fi. I took it to the Apple Store and they said there was nothing they could do and it is no longer in warranty. A total bust! 1
nice phone. The only problem is the memory space 4
I love it but you will run out of memory fast. 3
u sold me this phone and told me that charger is on the way and is been 3 month,when is the charger coming 3
So the phone stop working not even a month later. When I tried to email the company I got no response on what could be wrong. 1
Was very please with it when i bought it back in October 2015. It's 1 year later now and BLU have not released an OS update. Still operating with Android 5.1!!!I would not buy another BLU product. 2
The phone was a good price, arrived promptly and was packaged well. As a phone, it functions fine. Two things that drive me a little crazy: First, the camera is horrible. The photos are grainy and fuzzy. I thought 13 megapixels would produce clearer photos than my iPhone 4's 5 megapixels, but it does not. I can't deposit checks with my phone because the bank's app can not read the picture, it's too blurry. The other is when I'm typing a text or an email, I often hit the button on the bottom that brings you back to the main screen. I guess this is something I need to get used to. 3
It's OK but it could be better 2
In short I end up spending $92.00 in fixing this specious deal, i will never make such a mistake of buying USED electronics from you again 2
Great product and arrived in reasonable time! 4
Received on time works just like new only minor ware but it's alright 5
5 plums out of 5 5
I like it, but this price is a little expensive. 4
Love my new IPhone and it was a great price there was a small issue with the phone and the seller didn't have a replacement in my color. 5
Poor quality sound and reception. I bought another phone to replace it. 2
Phone sounds much more tinny than previous iPhones. Otherwise everything else is great. 4
Great phone but the sim card installation instructions were non existent and did not advise that sim card portal must be raised before inserting sim card 1. My card broke and I bent pins in portal. 3
Purchased as a gift for my 12 year old daughter. Functions perfectly, is durable (I watch her drop it regularly), and does everything she wants it to do. Only negative is we had to take it to AT&T for problems with it burning through 10 gigs of data in TWO WEEKS! It is better since, but still heavy on the data usage, even when using wifi. I have been told this is a known issue with this model. Other than that, it's her best friend. 4
Phone is in perfect condition, it's a little slow but probably only because it's a later version of iPhone 4
The phone is not new! In a new, disgusting smelling body established fee from your old phone, which apparently returned by reason of marriage. Unstable network and in standby mode not received calls. What a disappointment! Moreover, it was a gift! In the end, I throw away 169 dollars. 1
Its a good, working phone with minkmal cosmetic damage. One of the speakers does not work at all though. 4
The studs on the case come off easily , I don't like the way it snags my clothing 2
Phone I got was in decent visual condition. However, battery does not last with more than 1 hour of use. Also, after 3 days the speaker stopped working. Buyer beware, these are junk refurbished phones. 1
Very upset with this product. It says its unlocked using Gevey sim which it is not. The phone i received had too new of a baseband to unlock. Had sratches on back too... Looks like i just bought a $350 paper weight until baseband can be unlocked..... what a SCAM 1
The phone had scratches as said it would. It worked fine. However the problem I had was the charger cord stopped working after a week or two. I received new ones after contacting them about that. 4
I just got the phone today! Blackberry 9780 Unlocked! It appears good!I just bought this phone to give to my brother who lives in another country. 3
i love the phone it is grate thank u so much i am happy that i got it an it was on time i do recommend it 5
As advertised, arrived quickly. Thanks. 5
The phone have a problem with the earphone to listen to people when you call. 3
I bought this phone because I needed a non camera phone for my job. The seller (OEM Store) claimed that it would be shipped with instructions on how to change the settings for GSM use and how to download the Service Books for At&t and T-mobile GSM services (MMS, Internet, etc.) None of this was included with the shipment, although the phone did work on my GSM service, only after I searched the web for a while to find the information that I needed.The phone itself is exactly what you would expect from a blackberry bold, the phone shipped with OS 5, but it was quick and easy to upgrade it to OS 6 through the blackberry desktop software. (even though this phone is a Verizon CDMA phone, it still upgraded through the desktop software with an AT&T sim card active)Although this phone works perfectly fine on the Verizon CDMA 3G networks, this phone DOES NOT work on GSM 3G networks, however it does work on the EDGE and GPRS networks (2G). The charger included is not the standard blackberry USB to Mini USB cord charger, its a regular Mini USB to wall charger, so connecting to your PC or Mac for the desktop software isn't straight out of the box. Also, the phones manual is not included nor the desktop software install disc, you will have to download the latest version of the desktop software from blackberry's website. 4
battery went to zero in a matter of minutes, took 3 days to shutoff completely so the buttons would work. battery is not swappable so you can't just pop the battery to get your phone rebooted fast. if no reset button, battery should be swappable by the customer. returned it. otherwise it was a slick phone. maybe bigger than I wanted, can't really carry it in your front jeans pocket or top shirt pocket. 5 inch max outer dimension is the perfect size and still big enough for smart phone use. 2
Speakers r not working fair, the phone is not a locked one 1
si viene liberado lo estoy utilizando en venezuela buen telefono. le puse un chip movilnet y tiene señal. la corneta suena un poco baja 4
The phone looked nice but only worked for three months and four days. The return policy is good for three months only! :( 1
It did come faster than expected but it came with many complications. The functionality is great but it did have multiple cracks in the screen. Whoever had it before me didn't fulfill there AT&T contract so I have to pay to get the phone unkocked instead of having it f one through the carrier. Lastly, when I turn on the Photo Stream, pictures that aren't mine pop up... Most of them very explicit pictures. 2
Bad buy battery is problem and phone do what it want 2
Don't particularly like this item. It's okay..not too great. 3
Phone said it was lost/stolen and gave a # to call so we could return it. 1
Way to big for me. Might be better for a child.. 3
I bought a refurbished phone it did not look right at all. The silver trim would easily peel away from the phone and the piece of plastic above the keyboard with the call/end keys did not line up correctly with the rest of the phone.It ran pretty slow, but I'm sure that can be attributed to the BlackBerry OS. 2
Very disappointed in this phone. We spent around 3 hours on another phone with apple support trying to get the wifi to work. Final determination was that this phone was grossly defective. Wifi icon would not even light up let alone work. In addition to wasting my time, I also wasted a $60 straight talk activation kit. I returned to Amazon and am waiting refund. 1
The speaker is (staticky) Can"t really talk to someone. Text works! 3
Although the phone itself was good, it turns out to be a non-verizon machine. which doesn't work with verizon simcard. I think they didn't test it. before selling. 1
It is okay so far, no problems 3
Was suppose t be unlocked but showed up locked and way more scratches than it was portrayed not very happy may have to return 1
For the most part the phone works well. However, it does not work as well as the description says. Phone shuts down and shows low battery icon whenever the camera is opened or flash is used. The power cord that came with the home did not work. Overall, it meets every expectation you think of when you order a cell phone online for $100. 3
The phone was still connected to another account, was unable to activate phone for this reason. 1
The iphone5S Sprint I bought came locked and with a sprint financial obligation flag tied to its MEID. Niether problem was disclosed by the reseller After two weeks of talking to Sprint I was able to get those issues resolved and activated the phone. Within 3 days of use the phone had developed the known 5s screen display malfunction, luckily the phone was under warranty with Apple. Apple sent me an completely new 5s sprint phone but that came locked also so after 2 more days I was able to get it unlocked an activated. So If you buy one I hope your not in a hurry to use it. 2
wine damage the phone warms and off, I was asked to return the cell I 'm from Venezuela and send out very expensive , I'll stay without phone I get very expensive return , Thanks 2
Phone is in awesome condition except didn't come with a the accsesories not even a charger so that's why I have 4 stars 4
Receive the phone in excellent condition just as the seller said and work beautiful a really nice phone 5
it was smaller than I expected or I shall say it looked lot bigger online than physically it looks like. 3
Hola, compre este equipo y funciona perfectamente con digitel 3G. lo recomiendo 100%, ademas cumplio con la fecha de entrega por ambas partes 4
The phone came as promised in the original packaging. The AT&T store was able to transfer the information from the old phone easily. Great purchase! 5
This is a versatile basic phone. Although, it is not advanced in the "IPhone" tradition, it has it's own usefulness. I'm still investigating it...... 3
iphone is iCloud locked please send me email and password via email toaaronnation23@aol.com 1
Part of right side screen doesn't work. Other than that, good phone! 3
After one month, a chip on the logic board failed which controlled recharging the battery. Not Repairable. Had to purchase a new phone. I could have exchanged the phone with Apple for Ver5, but chose to upgrade to 6S and get a new phone. 1
It was unblocked and never been unblocked. Charger was so dirty and disgusting! I could not finalize talk to seller who promised to unlock the phone but never did 1
Unfortunately our phone started to have issues after only 2 weeks of turning the phone on so I'm not sure it was a "new" phone as advertised. The camera,video do not work. 1
Wouldn't let me upgrade to the newest software for Iphones. 2
omg i am so happy i found this phone i had one and the on and off button quit working on me and i was searching amazon and found one just like it and i received it fast thankyou so very much for the fast shipping 5
This phone was refurbished but still worked perfectly! There were a few noticeable scratches and scuffs on the back of the phone, but nothing a good case couldnt take away. Nothing was wrong with the phone and was exactly what I was expecting for $150. A very good deal indeed 3
this iphone was worth the money i paid, it was cheap therefore i was expecting some sort of minimum malfunction, happens that the home button was a bit warned out but still workedno complains 3
Did not receive a charger with phone 3
Bought this phone for my son, great buy! 5
This is a cheaply made phone, but I needed a phone badly at the time and it did the job. 2
Great phone look just as described in perfect condition. Order it on the 22nd recieved it on the 25th fast shipping. very happy :) 5
The phone came in, and I thought it was okay, but the phone turns off randomly and doesn't turn back on until I plug it in, even if it has charge. I have contacted the seller, and have to wait two business days to hear back. 2
I was looking forward to the Vivo 5 but I was actually very disappointed and returned it.First off their "gold" is actually more of a ROSE GOLD. So it was more pink than gold. The AMOLED screen is clean and wasn't as great as reviewed, its way too oversaturated. The reds appear orange making skin tones in video look natural. Scrolling through Instagram, I could see the 720p screen pixelate pictures. The speaker was very loud and clear which I liked.As for camera, I have a Blu Life One (2015) and figured the Vivo will be just as good if not better, but it was actually a downgrade. The 3GB RAM was good, made phone overall nice and snappy, no lag. I ended up returning it and getting the Honor 5X. Its not as snappy (less RAM) but has so many more features (fingerprint scanner), 1080p screen with better / natural colors, better camera.I would say if you are looking for a 5.5" budget phone, Vivo 5 and Honor 5X are good buys, but it comes down to preference. 2
Bought for my teenage daughter is works as described she is very happy with it. 4
the headphone does not work. 2
Phone did not want to turn. 1
No updates for software, blue seems to create and forget. Could not play marvel contest of champions without locking and restarting. Vudu app could stream but not download videos. Videos were crisp, speaker volume was low and battery life was sub par. The screen cracked on me the other day and with the one little crack, the entire touch screen was rendered unresponsive.In short, a poor smart phone, but with a descent Bluetooth speaker it is a pretty nice mobile video unit 2
Came neatly, basically new. Price was good. 4
Phone works good! Charger that came with it broke like 4 days after I got it & the earphones that also came with it, didn't work. 4
The iPhone work good but the battery no. 3
Perfect working condition. Love the phone. No complaints at all. There is nothing not to like about the phone. Good. 5
I order this phone as a gift for my niece. I was really unsure to get this on Amazon because I never got an iPhone other than the Apple Store but ended up being a good experience. This is my review:1. Works good.2. The outside conditions are 9/10.3. Software ok!4. Fast delivery5. Headphones and charger works perfect 5
Lovely first Iphone for me! Great service! 5
I got this for my husband and he absolutely loves it. 5
Not refurbished very well. It acts up and has trouble at times with certain actions. It did have a new screen, though, so that part seems fine. 2
This one was not for me but I know it was a good phone and it worked good, so everything is ok with it :) 3
I was able to not give this item/seller any star, I would do it. My phone stopped working after two months after I start using it!!... Since it was not covered any more under amazon 30 day return policy, I contacted the seller but they never answered my emails. I called apple customer service for my one year warranty, I made an appointment with apple store and provided them with phone serial number. I was shocked when they said that the serial number on the outside is different from the one inside the phone, and the original serial number was for a different phone (a black phone, non GSM, with 32GB)!! even though I bought it as described (unlocked GSM 8GB). which means this is FRAUDULENT PHONE!! 1
total waste ... starts malfunctioning in no time 2
I would recommend this to anyone. I got the white iPhone 5 and it's amazing for a certified refurbished phone. I don't usually write reviews but this product is so good I had to 5
It was a pretty good phone, but it did not last long. I purchased another Blu phone and it has worked great. 3
As of November 2015 this phones memory is just about full. 16 GB is simply NOT enough space....and I'm not a big "apps" person, but I do like to save my pictures. Otherwise I have no complaints. 4
Didn't know that had to get a whole new number for the watch instead of using the number already have 2
Good novelty item, not very good at being a phone... or a watch... 2
I bought this phone specifically for travel out of the US. The camera quality sucks but it served its purpose for my trip to France. 3
Nice phone overall, worth the money you pay but be aware latest firmware may ruin your battery life so do your research before you update your firmware. Would give 5 stars when Asus fixes battery drain problem via firmware update. OTG does not work the way it suppose to....not enough power in USB port. 3
the phone is in good condition with wear and tear, but the phone its self is not. it gets super hot and there are parts of the screen that dont work correctly. for a used iphone 5c this should not be happening for that price... i am not satisfied what so ever. 2
So Far its working ok, looks like new not refurbished so great product! 4
Phone is in great condition & has no functional issues. I'm satisfied with my purchase 4
I bought this phone " 5.5"unlocked GSM phone" and shipped to Africa , but this phone never work...I waisted my money 1
The phone arrived right on time and came in the condition described by the seller. The one minor issue was that the volume button on the site is stuck and needs to be fixed in order to adjust the ring/speaker volume. 4
My kid is happy with it 3
I like the size of the screen but this phone is very slow especially when you are downloading a app it takes forever. when your going from one screen to back to home page it takes forever I don't know why....what doesn't it play videos it stops half way thru very very slow moving is there anything I can do to make it move faster and it freezes up 2
It sucked I got my iPhone 5 64gb AT&T and the screen was cracked and I paid 225 and it said on here while buying it it said nothing was wrong with it And they won't get your money back 1
el telefono tiene una falla en el conector de carga, no es nuevo, yo soy comprador desde venezuela, por lo tanto no recomiendo comprar porque es muy riesgosoThe telephone has a fault in the connector of load, is not new, I am buying from venezuela, therefore I do not recommend to buy because it is very risky 2
For you pay for this phone is good. My biggest complaint is the battery. It takes forever to charge and if you are lucky, it will last a day. Worked fine with my T-Mobile service in the USA and worked fine in Brazil too. 3
It's nice and works just fine, 5
It came perfectly fine with the charger and everything but I expected it to be unlocked. When I got it, and tried to take it to a phone service company, they said it wasn't unlocked so...yeah....good overall though. Works great. 3
Works like new. Reccomend for everyone. 4
I absolutely love my blackberry q5. The os is wonderful and the keypad feels really great. My only issue is that the camera freezes sometimes instead of taking the picture. This happens when the camera is on flash. Everything else works great. 4
Broke in a couple of days 5
So far so good. No complaints. 4
Update: I am not blaming the vendor, but I did purchase an internally damaged phone from Cellular Trendz.Over a year ago I bought a white iPhone 5c on here from "WeSellCellular" and the phone was great and at a great price. I needed another cheap 5c so I got a green one from Cellular Trendz. Everything was fine except the battery life lasted a few hours even without me touching the phone. I am tech savvy and I've done numerous iPhone repairs myself so I bought a reputable battery here on Amazon. I opened the phone and I noticed one of the water damage indicators was red. Red= water damaged, white = never been exposed to water. I checked the other internal water damage indicator and it was also red. One of the screws that holds the battery connector in place was missing, but, it gets worse. There are RICE GRAINS inside the phone!! Not one or two random unidentifiable crumbs but multiple rice grains lodged in crevices of the phone. This leads me to believe someone water damaged the phone, removed the battery, and stuck it in rice.Good for a backup phone or someone who really wants an iPhone while on a budget. However, with the latest iOS 9 update this phone is slower than ever! Try and get one with iOS 8.4 or prior, but for long-term use I would go for a newer model. 1
Attractive phone but did not work upon arrival. I would not recommend. 1
I received it with out Sim card. There is no Sim card. 3
Fast Delivery. The reason I only gave it 3 stars is because the phone has period static during conversation. 3
Very good phone at a cheapest price 3
Great product and works well. 5
this was the last blackberry I bought, the battery did not work well, really bad!The phone was wrong but the battery is terrible, do not know if it was just my case or something generic on these phones 2
Phone worked as advertised. Arrived in good condition and charged ready to go. Shipping was a week behind even with prime shipping. 4
All I have to say is that they do not tell you enough about their products. This phone was in great condition when I received it, but it did not work properly. I took it to a cellular resale place, they opened it up and discovered that the battery was not an Apple battery. As a result, the phone would not charge or hold a charge. I am very disappointed. 1
Like any apple product it works great. I needed to get one that would work with T-mobile and this one did, awesome. 5
"Acceptable" but the condition was actually impeccable. 👍🏽 4
bluetooth doesnt workits a tad glitchy now and thencharging is a tad spotty and slow at timesit can get really laggybut i can live with all these things; it was a great price! 4
It is perfect. Just some scratches but is fine. It worked with a different sim card so it is unlocked. Arrived eralier than expected. 4
I didn't read the fine print it's not USD it's all in Chinese I'm going to have to send it back 3
battery doesn't last and the phone randomly restarts. Definitely will be getting my money back. 1
Outdated phone would not accept updates and locked up if you tried. We ended up trading it on a new IPhone for our son and got more on trade than I paid for the phone. 3
the phone has been tempered with and was not written the review but i ordered for the phone in the first place 2
We used the phone with AT&T with out a problem, but unfortunately when we switched to another carrier we learned that the phone was not unlocked as advertised and all attempts to unlock it have futile! (First Straightalk and then Metro PCS) 2
I use this phone for the apps and for wi-fi. I cannot use it as a phone because everyone I tried said they were not capatible the whole reason I picked a phone without a SIM card was so I could choose who I wanted as my carrier but after spending an entire day driving around I found out it wasn't capatible with Straight Talk, Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, Boost, or T- Mobile. So if you need a phone to use as a phone don't pick this one but if you are looking for something you can use for the apps and to get on line using wifi then the phone works great. 3
i love this phone but its too big for my petite hands 3
Cheap. Chintzy. Flimsy. All of those words describe the build quality of this phone. I compare the durability of this model to a cheap import toy from China. Every other phone I have purchased in the US was more more durable by a large margin. I'll admit that you can get quite a bit for your money, but be prepared to shell out more for a large protective case. Even a slight drop of this phone will render it totally useless and since there is nothing but on board storage, you may not be able to retrieve what you store on it.Will I buy another phone from Blu? Nope. I need a phone that can take the wear and tear of everyday life and this phone ain't it. 2
Claimed "excellent " condition but battery life is very short. Phone itself is fine 3
phone very poor quality. I recommend not to buy 1
Love the pink blackberry but the battery does not hold charge. Good price overall 4
Great condition looks brand new 5
On time and not other relevant comment. 5
Its a pretty nice phone, but in my case I couldn't stand it. I bought this iPhone to be a 'backup' if you will. I have the Galaxy S 3, and switching to the iPhone (which isn't even 4G) is a major downgrade. 3
I have had it for 2 months now. It definitely is a great phone, but does have some shortfalls. The phone is well built and although made of plastic, does feel like a very good solid build - almost as solid as an Iphone, without the weight. Screen is good, although I tend to keep my brightness at 60% to get a comparable display to my iphone. The colors are not as luch as my iphone - a tad washed out but after a while you dont even notice. the sound of the external speakers is amazing! I love it. the sound of the phone with headphones/earphones, both good quality and the ones it came with it, is good - but very low - no matter what app i use to watch videos/hear music, i find it to be a little low for my taste. The vanilla OS is awesome, but after installing just a few apps and 2 months use, the phone now feels very sluggish and and slow.. I find myself constantly having to clean my ram etc. For the price point, its OK.. I think it should cost a little lower considering other phones out there in the under $200 range which easily outperform this device. my true love and reason for buying this phone is the thickness and feel of it... besides that, didnt fine much special about it. Also, my phone appeard to be a 're-pack' as the box was not sealed, and my headphones were defective. I called Alcatel support for an exchange on the headphones and they were very nice and said they will simply send me out a new pair. That was two months ago, i never got anything. I still have to call them again. sux i have to chase them down for something I purchased (supposedly) brand new. the 3 stars however are for the phone, and have nothing to do with the headphone/used phone experience. 3
Its original ı like this 5
I bought 5 unlocked phones, it turns out only 4 phones were unlocked. 2
Do not believe that that was a new phone, it came with non-Apple charger and ear plugs. Unit broke in 7 months. 1
The phone seems to work well so far. But it was not a Verizon phone as advertised. I had to go with the less reliable AT&T network to make use of the phone. 3
The date and time are always wrong, the GPS thinks I'm where I was 2 hours ago, the map won't display and the front camera shows black. I've tried hard resetting, restoring from backup, DFU mode and upgrading iOS. The problem persists with different SIM cards from different carriers on different continents. I hate this phone so much I'm ready to smash it into pieces. I tried to return it but despite telling the CSR ten times that I cannot use UPS ground from Africa, a return is still pending. 1
This phone is huge! doesn't fit in pocket and has poor instructions. (Can't figure out how to turn on the light).Also, the phone won't work with my sim card which works in other phones. This was a total waste of money for us. We can't use it. 1
I purchased this phone which was advertised as "NEW" in Dec 2015 - It recently became unresponsive so I took it to Apple assuming they would help me under their one year warranty - they informed me that the phone was originally activated in 2013 and on top of that, it had a non-apple replacement screen installed and the sub-screen was damaged and that is why the phone no longer worked. Because of all this, there is nothing Apple could or would do- had it been a "NEW" phone like I thought, they would have fixed or replaced at N/C since it was within one year of activation..... Basically this is a refurbished phone and since it has been 6 months, I am out of luck. Very bad experience :( 1
Locked to Verizon, so useless as an unlocked phone. 1
Was good first day then started cutting off ... Phone sucked 2
No problem so far. So good 4
This product is not big enough, but we have a durability problem as we shipped it together with Class C. 2
Every step of the process was perfect and easy. I received my BB the date they gave me and it works perfect 4
The phone is beautiful work lovely and no scratches All I have to do is put my Sim card and turn it on and goes work right away I Gave this a five-star cousin I have no problem with it 5
Stopped charging with a cable and that costs $300 to repair. 1
Not a bad phone. The phone seems to lose battery life a bit quick, but I plan on changing the battery myself. 3
works great ! Love it ! 5
It was cheap, it broke within two weeks. 1
Well when I purchased it for my teen for a grad gift he loved it until he found out that it was on the block list which means it was still locked and the person that had it prior never paid it off smh..I tried to get my son to let me send it back but he wouldn't part with it,Now I hv to pay additional money to get it unlocked! 2
Well when i got it it looked new and it hasnt fail on me at all 4
Have only had this phone for sub two weeks and have had nothing but issues out of the box. Constant freezing and crashing, i cant even use certain apps, my photos don't load and the phone straight up goes black screen and restarts at least once a day. Very unhappy customer at this point in time. 1
Phone was in good condition, but it was described as unlocked and it wasn't 3
Works grea. BUT, cracks and break very easily and this is not a real iPhone so you cannot take it to the Apple store! 2
This is not a good devise I do not recommend it to any one it just waste your money . I bought last week when I got it I found out it did not work . It is not unlocked . No no no . It is locked . 1
It did, it works perfectly fine with everything include. 4
0 complainsthe iphone came to me brand new....and im using it in Caracas Venezuela, without any trouble!!!!!I think, these models come from europe, cause the battery charger, but these people incorporates an adaptor plug!!! 5
Great Phone, it is scratched a little on the side but the case will cover it. Works well like brand new! 4
Even considering the low price I simply can not recommend this phone. GPS started failing after 6 months of heavy use (used daily as my GPS device). Apparently tech support does not exist. The Android GUI has been butchered, no app button, blurred wallpaper, lots of modifications that don't help at all making the phone run slow despite pretty decent specs (I really hated the PIN entry delay or the phone not even registering my touch). I was forced to root my device and remove a lot of BLU added modifications, installed NOVA launcher and was able to finally have a decent GUI with clear wallpaper that scrolls (for some odd reason this is not available with stock setup). This of course voids the warranty. It is running Android 4.2.1 that is affected by Stagefright vulnerability and you should expect no updates. Ever. No third party ROMs are available and there seems to be very little interest among developer community to do any work with this phone. This will be my first and last BLU phone (this seems to be fairly common among BLU users).For those of you still willing to try to make this phone usable this is what I did to gain root access and modify settingsGained root with framaroot (google it, very simple)Check for app updates in Google Play and install themInstalled NOVA launcher (you can use other launchers just make sure you install one BEFORE you do the next steps)Install Build Prop Tweaker Lite (free) and modify the followingro.gn.navil.lock.scrn=yes change it to noro.gn.navi.launcher.support=yes change it to noRebootPS Keep in mind this will void your warranty but considering you should expect no support from BLU it makes no difference. I have moved on and upgraded to Google Nexus 6 and could not be happier. 2
This Phone is NOT unlocked, or at least the one sens to me was NOT unlocked!! Could not use an AT&T sim card with it, waste of time! 1
i live in ecuador it works really good works in others cuontries but i need it in spanish so have to download like 3 programs to change it to spanish but i like it 4
I just bought one for use it in venezuela and it works perfectly. I`m very happy with this new buy. 5
Not what i wanted and had to return it back 1
Good were received on time and i am happy with my order. Also the correct good was received and is very well serving its purpose 3
Came on time. Works great. 5
Really nice phone... the one i received is just like a new handset.no issues so far. 4
The Blu Win JR phone works great with the dual SIM card. This saves me from having to carry 2 phones around. I only have a few minor issues. First, they keyboard seems "smaller" than other devices. I find myself having to fix mis-spelled words more often. The only other issue was the screen protectors. It did not come already on the phone like one I purchased earlier for my wife. I have put screen protectors on several phones but on the Blu, the things just would not completely stick. 3
the equipment is released please do not publish false information that is all I play it back, that waste of time do not recommend 3
The iPhone heats up & battery dies too fast & I only had it for 2 weeks, supposed to be new but it don't seem like it. From internal conditions. looks great, don't work great:( 2
It was great. Has worked well. but I would like to kindly request for the name that was attached to the sprint account. It is equested for the unlocking of the device. Please contact on my email ubong21@gmail.com 4
After the first phone we ordered was unable to activate because the serial number was reported Lost/Stolen. The replacement phone the glass was not even fils with the phone indicating that it was refurbished. 1
im sorry but my IPhone 4S 32 GB is not working perfectly, the battery does not charge, i would like to know about guarantee, what can i do?? 2
i like the phone but when you put your sim card its don't take the my network provider so i can be able too make call the phone I can make is emergies call only. other wise the phone it great. Its have a lot of features. 3
The product was in good condition, definitely what I needed, but it did not come in the original box as stated and neither did it come with the head phones but all that can be over looked since the phone was my main focus of the purchase. 3
Went from an LG G2 to this iPhone 5. Battery Life is 5x better than that of an Android...No Complaints 5
Yeah just make sure you buy or have an AT&T Sim card...you can get one from Amazon for like a buck and it will activate the iPhone just fine...and then you could even do what I did and get the GoPhone Sim and have unlimited texting a 250 min voice for $25/month. Really cheap bro. 5
quick shipment, smooth activation! Thanks! 5
So far, so good . 4
Camera is GREAT, and the phone has a replaceable battery, but the phone just started to "fail". I couldn't always swipe to answer calls. The screens would all merge together. Had to CONSTANTLY restart the phone! 2
Faster than a Nexus 5. Great screen. Excellent battery life. Attractive (unbranded) front face. Overall I'm blown away by this device primarly because of it's price point. There's no reason to pay $600+ for a smartphone these days. 5
the phone is good i liked it its amaizing a loved it the only thing that i oreder in white and they send mi in blackbut is an amaizing phone 4
The screen had a sort of smudge in the center. We bought the telephone for testing, so we can live with that. But is a defect that wasn't advertised and in my opinion that's not "very good" quality. 2
Nice! Great condition! Good price, Thank you very much 5
We can not mute the camera and it's so slow. 2
works good for 3G and above. Simple to use. No frills. 5
The audio quality in phone mode was very poor. I frequently had problems hearing if there was any background noise at all. The most troubling aspect of the phone was the raised keys on the keyboard, which caused the device to turn off and on whenever it was in my front pocket and sat down or bent over. After about one month I have already replaced it with another model. 2
I love this phone, recieved it in perfect condition and it works with my car audio, even reads texts!!! 5
Phone works GREAT.... Looks like new.... Works like it new. I have Metro PCS.. I'm completely satisfied 5
My iPhone 5 was stolen so this was my replacement. Fit the description, working fine - saved me a few hundred dollars. 4
Its okay, opening the back is a pain. 3
good afternoon this is to notify my dissatisfaction with the iphone 4 to buy, I tell him that is CDMA technology and that technology does not work in my country Venezuela today there is technology GCM sim car (ie with Chip) when I buy your produto of features not described in that technology, we show that I can not use the iphone in my country if it could be actual return him mind I feel cheated 1
Charge does not last. Will never buy from this person again. 1
It said comparable to AT&T but I received a Verizon Apple iPhone. And it keeps dying at random times first time my phone was at 30% yesterday it was 52% nor today at 40%. 1
My sister loves it except the volume button does not work and one of the speakers are blown out.... Crap for the money you pay. 4
 First let me begin with a specific piece of information that I think needs to be stated. I will test this phone with a SIM borrowed but I won't really be using it long term with cellular service at this time. I do want to offer an opinion on call and reception quality though so it will be tested in this way.Results... calls are clear on both ends without any issues and seems to be working fine in relation to both 3G and 4G.On to the rest of the phone done with the pro/con format:Pro:Big screen, bright and easy to see.MicroSD expansion option3000mAh batteryPretty good cameras (mostly the rear is what I care about)Lot of memoryNice colorDual SIM (not that I'm likely to use it though)Cons:Plastic (I'm used to aluminum phones)Fixed batteryLower clocked CPU @ 1.8Ghz (Quad core though)Button placement (biggest con for me)Speakers (I'm used to front facing Harman Kardon speakers)Additional thoughts:The interface is a love hate thing for most people. I really love the HTC Sense GUI and so I am used to that in my last three phones. The Asus Zen GUI is really nice and many useful Asus apps are included. The layout I was originally concerned about but turns out I could VERY easily live with it daily. I was very pleasantly shocked by how smooth and fast and intuitive things are with this phone. In the end it comes down to personal preference. (I really dislike the Samsung GUI for example but like their hardware).Price... I feel for the speed and overall look and feel and being unlocked it is a very good phone, feels a lot like a flagship model in operation also it doesn't offer all the bells and whistles some phones are currently sporting.Question:Since I am not using it like a normal cell phone why do I want it?Answer:I dislike killing my main phone's battery and want the portability of a phone but the functionality of a tablet. This phablet is the perfect compromise offering a great size and feature set.I have a drone that needs a phone to control it and portability is an important factor so this is a nice quick device that I am hoping works well to use with my drone as the remote control. Around WiFi I can surf the web and check emails and not use my main cell. Also nice to have a backup phone and I may even use this as a pay as you go option at some point so I didn't want to get into big money with a phone to find out I won't use it.So plenty of good and not so good but overall none of the cons are all that bad considering $250 beats $600+. If you can use this phone on your network then I don't think you can go wrong with it.Review sample provided free or at a discounted price for a fair, unbiased, and honest review. 4
A very cool design, awsome layout, and good quality for a really fair price. The only problem with the phone that I've had is with putting in the SD card and SIMs card in and phone will reboot itself sometimes but all is good for how much it is 5
este producto esta bien en la condiciones esperadas, entrega por el vendedor a tiempo, sin ningún problema segun lo requerido gracias, lo recomiendo. 4
It works, though, it came with livable but annoying touch screen issues. The top half inch of screen doesn't always register my finger. 2
Pretty good physical condition, works well 4
Love it! Came in pristine condition, meets all criteria. Excellent service and value! 5
Horrible phone kicked the bucket in one month. Would not replace it 1
Phone was used for a few days (not brand new as said in the ad listing) but packing was good and was in box along with new charger and new ear phones.Overall happy with the service. 3
I still have this phone, I am determined to unlock it, it is super tied toVerizon, and it is not anyones fault except Verizon, they tell everyone who buysthese phones from them they are unlocked but they are not. On Blackberry wasabsolutely sealed on the back, so no sim card could be put in or another battery.The absolute nerve of these people. But, still the way to get it unlocked is tofind a teenager who knows cell phones, which ones don't? Or go to a geek I willgo to a geek. I love this phone, easy to carry and easy to use.It meets all my needs and was shipped right away. I will prevail as soon asI can get to the city and find a geek place to get this opened and running.Again Amazon has the best prices and fast shipping on such great cell phones,check them out first. 2
1st one wouldn't activate on ATT network. Seller was great and send out a replacement. Replacement woudn't activate either. Spent an hour on chat with ATT and got it to activate. Worked for about 2 hour and then lost connection. Connection would come and go for a couple hours, usually came back after a reboot or when connected to computer via USB. Then would disconnect when unplugged or after a call was made. Totally unusable. Seller again offered to send a replacement but by that time the phone was smashed into many small pieces. Too bad, I really like the old school RAZR form and function, but I guess I'll be forced into using new technology. 2
Ear piece doesn't work, we have to use the speaker to hear the caller. 2
great phone!!! happy with it!! thanks for getting it to me in great condition as stated. 5
Works great no issues so far. Unlocked and works well on my AT&T account. Looks great like new. 5
I recently purchased this to replace my fiance's LG G2 (screen cracked 2 times on the darn thing). The order was fulfilled by Avid Cell, and came in perfect working condition. It holds a charge, has full functionality, and looks as though it was never even used. My fiance and I are both very pleased with the purchase. 5
Okay the phone seems to work fine but it is a super cheap feel they put weight on it to give it weight like it's metal but is completely plastic and plastic you feel and does not Benchmark like a phone with 4 gigs of RAM it is not optimized correctly my three-year-old HTC with 2 gigs of RAM need it on every benchmark test 3
The phone came in a small box, surrounded with bubble rap. When I first was checking how the batter life was, i thought it was ok, because it lasted 3 days until it died. It was only after we bought the plan, sim card, and other accessories to set up the phone, that it began to die in less than an hour. But other than that, very small scratches hardly can notice them, and not laggy what so ever. Just annoyed with how we have to spend $15 or more on a new battery and kit... Very annoyed. 2
Phone sucks!! no battery life - can not go 8 hours without is going dead- and that is not even using it. Never had this problem with my Android. 1
the phone doesn't even starts, it doesn't work, please let me know what I have to do to solve this. 1
Great phone just what I wanted for someone who does not need high powered cellphones with a bigger size. 4
This phone works great for a middle-of-the-line phone. It is functional and easy to use. Compact and holds a charge better than most smart phones on the market. 4
It's nice and all until it keeps breaking every two months, I had to get a second one after the 1st one broke and it broke again out of nowhere. Just stopped working and wouldn't turn on! Awful but if you are only having it for 2 months, not bad at all then. 2
IPhone have some problems which wasn't mention in the description 1
received the phone quickly, though this says black I received a white one which is just as good reguardless.. nothing wrong with the seller or anything just the phone itself has a few quirks I think is due to maybe the phone company. other then that it is in great condition 4
Had this phone for 6 months now with no issues. Works just as well and better than any $700 phone I have had. Seriously folks, it's a phone. We call, we text and we surf the web, why pay $700 for the newest Samsung. It's crazy. Will never buy another high priced phone again. 5
The phone did not work properly I doubt if I buy anymore devices from here 1
Had to purchase a new phone, dropped mine in water, this phone worked just like my old one. In very good condition was really impressed! 5
excellent taste but I could be more lasting battery 4
The battery Is horrible !! Dies within 20 minutes. 2
The phone is ok. No talk to text. It will not pick up my verizon hot spot 3
I had to send the phone back because it would not hook up to my account. I even had people from the verizon place try and they could not get it to activate on to my account. 1
The product itself I love. (the iphone 6) This listing though is a little misleading. It does NOT come with an SIM card. This ad says it is for Verizon wireless network, but when I took it to the Verizon store, they said it is not a Verizon phone. They also said it should have came with and SIM card. If it weren't for my daughter having and iphone on my account, I would NOT have been able to activate this phone. That being said. Did not like the hoops that I had to jump through to get the phone working, but since I have got it working, I really do like the iphone 6!!! 4
one of the worse phones i done owned 2
The 6S+ is a really incredible phone, the 4K recording and optical image stabilization is jaw-droppingly good. The screen is nice and sharp, honestly there's really nothing to complain about, other than the phone I received having a bad imei, which had to sorted out at an AT&T store. But otherwise amazing phone. 4
Product looked and functioned like brand new, arrived quickly, great price. 5
Unresponsive screen. Returned same day it was delivered 2
The front sensor on the phone was broken when purchased, I purchased this phone as a little present because the person needed a new phone. Unfortunately I'm stationed in Korea and only received the product in this condition after the expiration period. I filed a claim and asked if I could return it but they didn't offer any help. Now I have to pay another 200 dollars to send the phone back to Apple and get it fixed since apparently it's been "used" for the past six months and the service warranty no longer applies. 1
I'm pleased with my purchase. I would definitely do it again. It's taken some getting used to, after being an avid droid user always, but I have not been let down. I've had the phone a week now. The clarity of my is much better than the previous droid, or couple of previous droids, I had. Overall, I am a happy customer at this point and happy with my phone. 4
Instructions not clear hard to set. Never got it set. Returned it. 2
My back camera stop working da first day i got it.... N I forgot it has no flash on it camera sucks 3
The phone packaging was great! However, when it came to the actual phone I was rather a but disappointed!Firstly, the phones home button is not properly in and wabbles around like it will pop out any second! Secondly, the battery life is not the greatest, especially for the price. And lastly, the phone is rather laggy and quite slow! 4
Even though the shipping was delayed it arrived in good condition just as described. Ive only been using it for a couple of days but so far everything is working just fine 5
The phone is good but you sent me the wrong charger.I had to buy another one 2
The phone works great the plastic over the sceen looked old but when I removed it the phone look like new.... 4
This product does not meet my specification,why becos it's verizon it does not work in Nigeria and I wouldn't recommend it for African use except for the United States.i also use this medium to beg amazon to tell the seller to kindly send me a return authorization,so I can get what is useful to my locality.Thanks! 2
Cheap quality touch screen broke on a 8 inch fall. The accessories that comes with the equipment are cheap also. 1
AT&T not covered in my area 1
I returned this item because it would not charge. However, the credit back to my credit card was immediate. 1
It works! It doesn't hold a charge all day but it is ok for now. Not sure I would buy a refurbished again, especially from this seller due to the under charging. 3
At first there were two problems with the product iPhone 4s unlocked I purchased . The WiFi tab was greyed out dim and I can't connect to Internet even I have a sim card with high speed internet and Wi Fi at home. There is no cellular data network tab on the phone to edit the APN. I called Wireless 2 go They told me they had never had this issue before and they were ready to refund me and sent me a label to return the product. After consideration I decided not to return the product. I reset and erased all the the content and network and started activating the iPhone again. It was a hard time! Finally the Wi Fi tab works and the Internet is connected. However when I browsed Google the Wi Fi stopped working and the screen displayed "could not activate cellular dater network" . I had to redo everything again. Totally 3 times. Now it is connected to Wi Fi and Internet but I don't know how long this status can maintain. I even dare not to browse Google website on this iphone. I think the shadow of the former carrier is still there even the phone is unlocked. Is there a way to find out the cellular data network tab and APN to solve this problem?Anyway I have to say that this iPhone 4s has a good look and almost no scratches. 2
Wasn't able to use because it's Verizon 3
I should of listened to everyone else that said the battery is terrible. It dies within an hour after a full charge. 1
good items, the condition is good, working perfect, i apreciated that the description is real, the software is correct, the hardware is very aceptable, work fine great item dear seller!!! five start for your 5
Comes ready to activate and simple instructions to activate it. It just didn't come with extra chargers or car charger 5
Challenge to navigate. Too large for comfortable handling. Would not buy another one. 2
Bought this device to use with my existing cricKet wireless plan and while connectivity went smoothly and battery life is great, the device lags horribly and while I knew what I was getting in regards to the 8MP main cam, I didn't expect it to freeze almost everytime. Now I know this is a $130 unlocked device and I can't compare it to much, this one will probably not suit anyone other than a first time smartphone buyer or a severely cash strapped individual who doesn't are about adequate performance. I have owned BLU smartphones prior to this that were better spec'd and a lot smoother than the Energy X LTE but cost more. I will say that the build quality is very nice on this device and if you didn't know it, you may be inclined to believe you were holding a much more expensive device. If you are any more than a light user, save your money and look at the VIVO XL or VIVO 5. 2
Excellent value, product as stated 5
This is defiantly the best phone I have ever owned! The speakers are phenomenal! They are loud, clear, and do have a little bit of bass! The display is also one of the best on any budget phone! Also the camera isn't bad either! But to wrap it all up, this is the best phone under $300! 5
Bought this for my teen as I was looking for a low-budget, limited phone that didn't rely on internet access and would be an upgrade screen size from the LG L9. We're big Samsung and LG phone users but thought I would save a few bucks and get something half their cost. On the 3rd day of owning it, it powered off on it's own even though it was at a charge of 100%. Tried to add events to the Calendar when we discovered that the only way to do so is to link the calendar to an online email calendar which would require connecting to the internet. We don't use online calendars and I def don't want my teen's activity calendar floating around in cyber space. Will be returning. The Calendar function should not require account sync to use. That's just basic. 2
Good phone. Some minor scratches but a case on it and you never know. 4
Disappointed! No instructions.... Purchased it as a present for a teenager, who is very "tech" smart and they weren't sure what to do because there wasn't a brand on it to be able to go to a web sight to research. :-( 2
A bit disappointed with this one. Just lacking in some of the critical aspects that I purchased the phone based on. The camera might be 13mp, but the pictures are constantly out of focus and of poor quality. I've tried every mode possible and still the pics are poor. The battery life isn't as good I might expect. It is good for about 3/4 day, but I still have to charge. It does charge very rapidly. My main complaint is that the phone compresses images for sending texts. My photos look really strange when I send them. I also have trouble with various apps. 3
Was unable to use this phone because it arrived LOCKED. Had to return it. 1
it had a few minor scratches in the back but other than that, very good! 4
I purchased this phone,it stopped working after 3 months. 1
is a good product and I is working very well, this provider met my expectations by giving me a good quality product, I am very pleased with this purchasethanks 3
Very early delivery and great quality! 5
Had to return as it was not "unlocked" ... would only work with AT&T ..... 1
Great entry phone and it would be a good phone for average users too. Smooth performance for everyday tasks. Both cameras are fair, take shots quite fast. Sound quality is above average, nice and loud, and it comes with JBL in-ear earphones, which are quite good too. Also features an update to Android Marshmallow, available as soon as you turn on the phone. Battery isn't great but it lasts for the day. Overall quality is really good, it's as good as I expected for the money I spent. 5
Love this phone. Needs charging probably because I am learning with it much. Has nice camera with flash, calendar, browser, contacts, clock, pictures, can't email yet, BB world not featuring apps, (server?). Four and a half stars, good value. 4
I received my phone with bad batteries that I dies in less than 3 hours. And now the battery is worse than before and the power button isn't working. However the iPhone system is not bad 1
Not bad for entry level, suprised it was discontinued to fast 4
The phone is great, easy to work with and comfortable in my hand. 4
Wasn't what I was looking for. 2
This unit came with only 8GB of internal storage. I couldn't do much with that. I inserted an SD card and installed new apps only on it but that was of little help since a part of the app still got installed in the internal storage and once used, some of the data also. As I used the phone along, I kept getting warning that there was no storage left. I checked Settings and indeed, it said 0MB. I had to keep clearing data and eventually un-install all, except two, apps that I originally downloaded. Apps that came with the unit all were put in the internal storage and can't be moved anywhere nor uninsalled; they together took a big chunk of storage. I decided to return and am now awaiting the seller's approval. Do I recommend this phone? I do if all you want to do is making calls, texting, taking pics/videos,use Google map, and maybe play a few games. Beyond that, I don't. I guess I have to be willing to spend a little extra to get another phone with 32GB internal storage.March 21 update:In the last few days the phone was totally useless except for making/receiving calls. I couldn't even SMS. Finally I un-installed the last two apps I downloaded AND removed all updates from apps that came with the handset. This did free up a few dozens MBs thus allowing me to send and receive text messages, an important function for me. 2
Screen stopped working after only a month. Already had to buy a new phone. Never buying another phone from Amazon 1
I was pretty skeptical once I read some of these reviews. My phone got here with only one or two small scratches & the only complaint I have is that when charging, my screen doesn't act right when I try to use my phone so I have to unplug it, do the task, then plug it back in. I love my phone though, I'd still recommend buying it. 4
This item it excellent product .I and joy it.Thank 5
this is a great upgrade from the 3gs it has mainly 3 features i love the 32gb hard drive that allows me to get more apps, the better camera with flashh i love it and the front camera it makes it fun to take photos highly recommended 5
So far so good. No complaints. 4
The phone That Was selected in the section of unlocked phones, so It was like I was looking, for When I Get My Hands I Noticed That the equipment is locked and in my country I can not unlock. I am not Satisfied with the purchase and request that I change it so we can make use of the phone you buy. Apple iPhone 4 Black Smartphone 32GB (AT&T) 1
Be aware, this is a 2G GSM phone. AT&T won't activate it (maybe they would with a go-phone SIM, but after 4 hours of customer service, I gave up.)However, at the time of writing this review, T-Mobile is still activating 2G phones.Eventually, 2G will be phased out. When that happens, this phone won't be useable. 3
There is definitely something wrong with the battery. When you charge it to full battery, in about 1 hour it says low battery. And. I think there is also a problem with the microphone. The most disappointing is that I ordered it as a gift, and it did not work properly. 2
I bought this phone to give as gift to my sister in law and since i gave her this phone, i did not receive any wrong comments about it, i think she liked . and if she is happy then i am happy too.I do remember to everyone to try Blu. 3
This product arrived on time. I haven't had the phone activated. But this experience was a A+.No problems. 4
The touch screen is messed up. It types or dials other things than what I dial or type. Its annoying. I had another phone just like this that did the same thing. I thought maybe my phone was messed up but no its the product. 2
I ordered BlackBerry 8520 for my mom and my uncle since they did not want to use touch screen, but I had to return the phones. Its keyboard has very small prints and its buttons are also tiny, and therefore it's hard to text or even to dial phone numbers, especially if your fingers are big . The screen is so small that it's hard to surf and read the Internet easily. The setting is complicated and its functions are not user-friendly at all. FYI, my mom and my uncle are using touch-screen phones now. After using them for a while, they love them. One of the main reasons is that the keyboard appears on the big screen with big fonts.I hope the information is helpful to you. 2
The Battery power is great! It usually lasts me 3 days when I use it only when needed. Only downside is that Windows doesn't carry most of the apps as Androids. The camera was decent but not great. Sound was again just decent. I like the size perfect for people with small hands like myself. Storage is poor but perfect with a MicroSD. In all I give it a 3 out of five. I still prefer Androids with Google Playstore 3
The only problem I had is the screen had a blemish line, but it's a used phone. Other than that no complaints. 3
Still playing with it, but so far it's been working perfectly... 4
Buen Dia,se recibio en el casillero correspondiente destino de mi actual direccion el paquete de la compra realizada, sin embargo NO SE RECIBIO LA FACTURA COMERCIAL.FAVOR ENVIAR LA FACTURA COMERCIAL A LA DIRECCION DE ENVIO INDICADA EN MI CUENTA 2
Item came just as expected, and was well packed. I had to return mine, though, because the friend I got it for got a new phone the day after it arrived. 5
don't like this phone and company! if you are blind by apple toys then it is best out there. however, If you are not afraid of trying new phones, look for windows phone 8.1 and later. they are way better in compare to iphone so far and price are half of what apple is asking for it. choices are yours to make. i'll recommend this phone if you are apple fan. if you are not, try windows phone 8.1 or later. 2
The phone does not hold a charge for very long and shuts off when it at 50% charge. 3
Charge doesnt last long and started to glitch when watching video after 2 months 3
I am extremely disappointed in this product the phone was not unlocked like they said and did not work with at&t. 0/10 would not recommend. 1
My iPhone 3GS crashed so I needed a phone to replace it. Since I am hooked on the iPhones, I got this iPhone 5 and am very happy with it. 5
Didn't know that had to get a whole new number for the watch instead of using the number already have 2
I'm not an Apple fan but a friend of mine suggested i get this phone for my temporal use and so i did.I have only spent a few hours with it since activation but i can tell you already that i like what i have experienced so far,Especially the battery life,How it quickly connects up to the internet and loads the page up in no time.I am not sure yet if i will use most of its features but i don't regret the choice i made.It came unlocked as posted on the site and i had no issues at all activating it. 5
The phone we got was it new 1
Got the iphone a little bit early. They said it would be in perfect condition. Well the iphone came and I had to restore it. After I restored it, I tried to play music and one of the speakers doesn't work. The call volume is also very low. nobody can hear me forreal but I can hear them. it'll sound like my fone is breaking up. 2
They listed the product as NEW and it is VERY USED. 1
The phone that I ordered was stolen. When I tried to activate it at tMobile, I was informed that the phone had an insurance claim against it and had been reported stolen. Therefore, I could not activate it. I was inconvenienced of my time and lost important calls trying to activate and transfer my service from one phone to this stolen iphone. Lesson learned. Do not buy a used iphone from the internet. 2
Sprint iPhone 4 doesn't come with 4G capability.If you pay for 4G services (meaning you own a smartphone already), you'll be wasting your money.Plus, if you're on iMessage, and you switch over to Android, you'll never receive another text again until you close the service.Design and Interface - 5 StarsNetwork Capability - 1 StarSoftware - 4 StarsCamera - 3 StarsOverall 3 Stars 3
Great phone - my daughter loves it! She on it all the time - in mom's opinion too much. 5
It's an okay phone but has a lot of specs that are kind of useless 3
It started out great. My galaxy slll was literally falling to pieces, so as a Christmas present to myself I purchased the Life Pure. It performed very well, although the camera leaves much to be desired. Unfortunately, less than a month after buying this phone it has stopped working. I cannot find any tech support and not so much as limited warranty means I'm left with a pretty hunk of useless plastic. The phone has not suffered any trauma and had at least a 50% charge. The notification light still turns blue when I plug it in, but i cannot get the phone to respond to anything else. I can only hope that the problem corrects itself once the battery has died completely, since I cant just remove the battery. Very disappointed. 2
This vendor sold us an 'as is' phone that didn't work. From day one there was a short in the charge terminal. We tried many different methods to charge the phone and it just wouldn't take a charge. You had to hold the wire 'just so' to get any action and then, it may or may not charge. This phone was a complete waste of money for us. 2
The phone is not in good working order it gets stuck at times 2
This phone was in great condition. I bought this phone for a friend and it came with all of its original packaging and accessories. I'd buy from this person again. 5
Phone was great but the screen was shaky. Felt like it could pop out. But a great buy 4
What an upgrade compared to the iPhone 4. Going to love this phone. Glad I got a case for it already and everything. 5
Needs more memory and the screen isn't bright enough in sun 3
The phone keeps overheating, even sometimes when im not using it 2
Its original ı like this 5
This phone is not Verizon! I did not get what I was expecting. I received a phone that is useless to me! 1
Pretty good since it was a present and I'm perfect condition 5
Freezes alot. But i bought primarily for playing back my music instead of my BB. Its a great phone for SMS and rings really loud. The body is strong and neat 4
I was under the impression that this was going to be a Series 1 version of the Apple Watch, which has the dual core processor. It was not a Series 1, but a FIRST GENERATION model of the watch (Model #A1554). The speed/performance of the watch is definitely not adequate. Previously answered Amazon questions (by the seller) indicated that this was a going to be a Series 1 watch. WRONG!Don't get me wrong, the look of the watch is awesome: stainless steel silver is sleek! Looks great with stock black band. Good weight, functional heart rate monitor, activity tracker and notification tool. Just upset since I feel like I was mislead by the advertising of the product and the previously answered questions. 2
First let me identify the seller "Phone-Zone". So many people complain about a seller, but they don't give the name.First the phone (IPhone 5s) took longer than normal to get here, but the weathers been bad, so ok. The real problem was that while everything stated by the seller and Amazon on the website, receipt and labeling, implied that the phone was new and T-Mobile ready, is now in doubt. I was unable to activate the phone with my carrier T-Mobile because the SIM was unusable or not installed. After some trouble I was able to get the SIM cover off, and there was a T-Mobile SIM installed. So the SIM is either defective or had been activated before. So no phone.I am driving the 30 miles to my local T-Mobile store tomorrow, to try and get the phone working, and to find out its history. I'm hoping they're good with IPhones, because while working over the phone with T-Mobile to resolve the problem, the SIM card became jammed in the IPhone (poor design). SO NO PHONE!When you spend the kind of money Apple asks for their products, you expect more. I've owned three Apple products, including this one, and had problems with two of the three. That's Not Good.Overall, I give the 5s just 2 stars and the seller Phone-Zone 0 stars. 2
Having problems already with it 3
Works well. Great price. Unlocked and dual sim. 4
These are the type of people who make you not want to buy anything on-line. I lost 500 dollars and will never trust buying on-line again. This is the type of seller who makes it difficult for other who are just starting out. I just can not express how much this seller should be in jail. 1
Item arrived fast and as described! Arrived with phone and accessories! 5
I'm surprise with this, new and no one scratch in the phone, really good price for 32gb, compare with the other store I save lot money for this, very happy 5
Works well. It accepted my sim card with no issues. If I had one, It would be the fact the Internet Explorer crashes on certain sites (such as Wikia). Outside of that, No other problems. 3
We previously reviewed this purchase as 5 stars with Usale100. We were wrong. The phone was advertised as "new and sealed." When we attempted to register the warranty on this "New" phone, we discovered that the phone's warranty expired already because the phone has been registered and used by another person 2 years ago. This phone is neither New nor certified as refurbished. It also looked like it may have been tampered with. Buyer beware!!!!!!!! 1
The seller has nothing to do with the shotty craftsmanship of this phone. Screen/phone popped apart in my purse and it just wasn't the same after. Buy a better iPhone lol. 1

Buy ticket is missing. I need it. 3
Worked for 2 months now the phone earpiece doesn't work - they can hear me but I can't hear them unless I put on speaker. 1
downgraded from v 5 & very happy... needs to last until my contract comes do. May not trade it in. 5
It's been a month and so far the phone is doing very good. 5
I was told that this iPhone would work with the Verizon network, but it is for AT&T instead. Otherwise I would love it because the seller was really accommodating and the price was great. 4
I think that I have written a review on this phone already, but I'm very happy so far! I got for my God Childrens Grandmother in Jamaica and I tested it out! It is unlocked works with my att sim card too 4
Phone started out great, then went down the drain no less than 6 months later (it was so great I convinced my brother to buy one) I was drawn in by the low price, and then 6 months later started running into multiple problems. The first is that BLU will not be updating this phone to Lollipop or Marshmallow, which I thought was weird since it was only released last year. It wasn't a huge problem at first, just a mild inconvenience. (Some apps might not be the latest version, big whoop.) Then I ran into a huge problem where it would disconnect me from the cell towers and I would have to call T-Mobile in order to receive texts. This was/is extremely frustrating. My last problem was the battery just randomly decided to drop out on me and I had to spend $20+ for a new one. Overall, it was great while it lasted, but really not meant to be in for the long haul. I don't think I'll be buying any other BLU products again. I really wish so many companies didn't use obsolescence to get profit, but I guess that's just how it is. 2
I actually bought this for my brother and the description said used - like new but when it came, it wasn't i expected and the packaging was even not that good. I wasn't satisfied. 3
Originally, I was unsure about this phone as the reviews aren't great. However, my phone came in great condition and so far am not having problems with it. 5
very good but not the color you requested, but it works well 4
It Works good but does not have direction manual book or software. 3
It's a good quality phone had a problem updating it, but after that works fine, but someone changed the password to my account so might be something but overall okay buy 3
I received the phone not in the original box. Definitely it is not genuine. It stopped working after ten days of really careful use. It does not receive a signal no more. I wish I had not bought it from this supplier. Do not buy it or you would be disappointed. 1
My son loves this phone. Pricey for second hand though. Came fast and looked new. 5
This phone had information on it from the previous owner and it was very disturbing when I was told it was from Apple but it had a fry brothers box and item number. 2
It was a great device but the sound needs improving. 4
Great sale... No problem was sent and delivered as promised... 5
is an acceptable product, the total description of the product is as advertised as such at the time of purchase ....very pleasedthanks 4
Was exactly what description said it would be love it 5
Until when the phone is Sprint. When is unlocked basically 2
Comes locked to AT&T. Thankfully, it's super easy to unlock a legit model number on AT&T's website and it works great. 4
Phone works great. No problems getting access to AT&T network. A cost-effective upgrade for lost 4s. 5
It is slow comparing to nowadays phones , it cant detect far wifi spots . 3
Despite claiming the product only has minor cosmetic defects possibly and has been tested by professional technicians, the front camera does not work. I am disappointed that this product was able to pass any seller or professional's quality standards as a properly refurbished product. Not only does this cause me a significant inconvenience in that I will have to find a way to return it, but I will also have to be without a working phone when I am waiting for calls regarding important personal commitments. 1
The phone works fine but it is more scratched up than anticipated. Also, both the charging cable and the wall plug that were sent with the phone did not work at all.. 2
It is ok though linking everything to iTunes is rather limiting -updates, playing games, etc. I think the more liberal android phones are much user friendly. The Bluetooth will not link with other phone type Bluetooth. Maybe I missed something 4
The only problem I encountered with this product is that the battery gets really hot while being charged, and also that it doesn't retain the charge for at least a day, even with less than moderate use. 3
Beautiful....but the camera has stopped working. I tried several ways to see if it would work, but without success. 2
HELL YES! GREAT PRODUCT and so cheap!! 5
Worked for a while like a year or so.....then suddenly stopped. Takes pictures horrible. low storage as well. 2
The Battery is not lasting for more than two hours 1
The phone works great I have sprint service and I got my old SIM card out my iPhone 4s cuz it broke and put it in to this and it works i am really impressed 4
NO GOOD.. I ordered it in November been having problems with it since it came. Its full of viruses! It always black out and lockup. Continues to download everything . please people don't east your money on this phone. My boyfriend and I both order them and still had to buy new phones because this phone is no good. I did not want to give this phone a one star. Wish we could get our money back. This phone is/was very stressful to have 1
It cane in really good condition as described in the ad. 4
I have had and used this phone for the past month. It works and serves the basic needs for which I bought it. However, the phone has occasionally switched "on" and "off" while I attempted to use GPS in an area with limited network service: the phone would go off and then restart, as if there is an issue with the power. After about five such occurrences, the issue has been working Ok, and I want to wait it out a few more days before contacting the seller/manufacturer; I suppose the "on" and "off" issue was an usual thing, which might not be the same for every user. I wonder if other users have noticed this issue before. 3
Apple iPhone 4 16GB (Black) - VerizonI feel really stupid. I should have read all the reviews about Wireovia. Like so many others the home button is locked and the only way I can move from app to app is to turn the phone off and on. I am surprised that Amazon is still allowing them to sell on their site. 1
la batería no funcionaba en un iPhone. 1
I got this iPhone right on time but there were many problems with that. Camera didn't work. All information from previous owner was their. Basically seller didn't clean up the phone and everything such as email contact numbers and etc we're there. I return the item and got my money back. 2
I try to activate the iphone 4s in front of the Verizon wireless, but the service told me that the iphone 4s I just bought from Werehouse Deal is a stolen one!!!! 1
The GPS signal reception is not good with this cellI tested with another cell (another brand) and the signal was much better. 2
I don't think I've ever received and decided to return a product so quickly.I'm a biker who just upgraded to a phablet, which is cumbersome beyond reason to carry on the bike. An mp3 watch seems like the perfect solution (yes, an mp3 player might be simpler. However I don't always have pockets, I hate arm bands, and I hate clipping things to my clothing. I know, first world problems). An option for communicating in case of emergencies might also be nice, so an mp3 watch it is. So all I'm really looking for is an mp3 player that's easy to wear, with a time function and possibly texting in a pinch, not a device to be my new best friend.I first tried a GT08, which seemed to work nicely but it bothered me when I noticed I had paid twice as much as I should have (the problem with these Chinese knock-offs is the same product is available from different sellers at vastly different price points). Plus I really disliked the "nucleus" menu style, so thought I'd try a different model.There was a lot to like about the CNPGD. Right out of the box, the silver metal finish looks very high quality and the band is much nicer than the GT08, very supple and comfortable. The menus are much cleaner and easier to navigate, having only 4 rather than 8 (mostly useless) options per screen. It let me transfer all my music into the required "my music" folder (something I suspect all these watches have in common to use the music player from your SD card) via PC, much more painless than the GT08 that made me hand select each song from the watch screen individually to move (note: I had to reboot the watch for it to find them, a minor inconvenience since the boot sequence is very quick).However, the love affair ended instantly when I realized to my dismay there was no shuffle option to be found anywhere for the player. I really wish if this isn't to be a standard feature that it would be mentioned in the item description. Who wants to listen to their playlist straight through in alphabetical order? Stupidest omission on an mp3 player ever.Another maybe not so small complaint is there seems to be no way to change the truly ugly watch face -- tapping the screen (which the GT08 required) did nothing, and I couldn't find any theme settings anywhere (not like there are a ton of places to look).So the search continues. Thank goodness for Amazon's painless return process, however I'm now out $12 in return shipping fees. If my third attempt is a bust, I may have to start considering something in a much higher price range (although from what reviews I've read on a few products, that's not necessarily a guarantee of quality either). 2
I was hesitant to buy a certified refurbished Apple Watch, but at the same time didn't want to spend over $300 to get it from apple. So I took the chance. It came in taped apple packaging which was fine. Inside was the entire watch with the charger/ USB and the square for charging. The only thing was I wished it came charged because it took a long time to initially charge and update and sync. Otherwise I'm extremely happy and loving my product! 4
The screen resolution is no that good. When you use a picture as a background it looks a bit pixialted but apart from that it's a ok basic phone. 3
Good!! excellent items, its perfect and work excellent this is best good and I think buy more again thank you!!! 5
I just love my iPhone 4S that I use with Tracfone! iPhone came in excellent condition and looked brand new. There was extra time involved with Tracfone but well worth the time to be able to use an iPhone. One suggestion with dealing with Tracfone, if the first Tracfone person you talk to isn't able to help you definitely call back again to get another Tracfone person. First time I called Tracfone the guy, who sounded intelligent but wasn't, told me I couldn't use the phone with Tracfone something to do with Verizon. I called Verizon (Verizon also checked out the phone serial number and said it wasn't stolen) and to call Tracfone back. I was glad I called Tracfone back. Tracfone person I got knew her job, was intelligent, very nice, and very helpful! She spent time on the phone putting in information, getting any problems straightened out, and was nice the whole time. I was willing to put time in with the call and was never at any time impatient. I was told that I'd lose my minutes from my old Tracfone. She was able to get around that. She put in just a few minutes and told me to call back in a few days to get the rest of the minutes if the minutes didn't automatically show up on the iPhone. I called back and yes it did take time but I got all my minutes from my old Tracfone! I live where there is hills and trees and get good reception with the iPhone 4S. Was all the time spent on the phone with Tracfone worth it? YES!! I now have an iPhone and service that doesn't cost and arm and a leg!! Just remember when calling Tracfone if you get someone that doesn't help you or is rude, definitely call back. Tracfone does have excellent personal that actually do know their job and are very nice. So far the phone is working perfectly. 5
The begging, i had a problem with verder.but the company is sincerity help me, service is good and hope deal with this company next time! 5
great, If U are the one who sent me the meid # so I could check it with my phone carrier. U were quick, honest and we love it. 5
This phone is okay. Worth maybe a 2.75/5. The phone freezes up quite a bit. The first phone I got I had to send back to Amazon a week later since it froze up so much on the lock screen. I have only had this new one for about 6 months but I will have to replace it soon since as I am typing this it has been stuck on the "Blu Bold Like Us" screen for the past 15 minutes or so. I wanted to like this phone. The picture is nice & the screen size is nice. I have not even had an issue with app storage space with this phone yet! But I can't do too much if this thing keeps freezing up on me. There also seems to be a bug where I can't view call history past the first 10 or so. It just closes out every time I try. This is not my first Blu phone that I have owned but it will probably be my last. The phones are not that expensive but for $150 or so I was hoping to get more than 6 months out of it. 2
They were very good and the seller is very trustworthy. 4
Purchased this phone May 2016 and in December 2016 the phone began failing- screen developed lines at the top and needed to be reset to clear it. After a reset, the screen develops the symptoms again within a day. 2
It's ok but not really what I wanted.but its good in other ways . 3
It was as expected...used.. BUT.. did not disclose that the video was not working properly and that I would have to put the ball 2 to 3 times to get the phone to react to a command. But for a used phone at the cost I paid, it was pretty decent. 3
This phone is great, until it breaks. I had it for 9 months. It worked quite well, better than I expected, frankly. Connection was good, decently fast. Internal memory is pretty low, so I couldn't have a lot of apps, and it ran really poorly when it got below 50% batter. But for $70 that's fine with me.Nine months later, the phone somehow loses Google Play Services. Nothing works to reinstall, so I do a hard reset, which also doesn't work. Tech support is little help (basically just told me the things I found through googling, none of which worked). Then they say I can trade-in my phone for a new one. The prices with my trade-in are essentially the same as you would get FROM THEIR STORE on Amazon. So, pretty lame. If this phone had worked for even 18 months I would have been overjoyed. (I have a SUPER cheap Samsung that works, although slowly, and its 7 years old. Holds a charge better, too.) 3
Purchased to replace an aging white 8520, this phone has proven equal to the task. It is hampered, although not as much, by the rapidly declining T-Mobile service in my area. Once my T-Mobile contract is over, I plan to use it exclusively as an international phone when I travel and am considering using Virgin's I-Phone (Sprint service is more reliable here) domestically if Blackberry's demise appears more imminent. 4
The phone was great had no issues..... 4
I've had no issues with this phone. This is my third iPhone. My original one from Apple had a button that stopped working while it was under warranty, so they replaced it with a refurbished one. That didn't last as long unfortunately. So we had to buy out of pocket. So far no complaints with this product. 5
I bought 2 of these phones, great price yes...BUT...after each update so far we either lost all our stuff that was on these phones...contacts, pic, music...ect. unless the phone is rooted you can't have things sync up to SD cards, so phone runs out of space quick, suppose to have 8gb of space. Well after the operating system and bloat ware you can't delete you have about 6gb, 5.89 to be exact if....and here is the big if...you don't update! 1st update lost everything, messages, pics, contacts...2nd update killed the storage...shows 0 gb out of 5.68 remaining...called BLU and they told me I had to do a Hard reset/restore...again lost everything! and the funny thing is, out of the storage we used about 700-800mb total. waiting to see if there will be a 5.0 update...Im thinking not and going to cut my losses and toss it! 3
The phone came in, and I thought it was okay, but the phone turns off randomly and doesn't turn back on until I plug it in, even if it has charge. I have contacted the seller, and have to wait two business days to hear back. 2
Worked only for a month 2
i bought this phone to use when i travel to the carribbean and it worked.. it looked new..if it was used i can't tell. it is a great phone and good price...and best of all it worked overseas with an international sim card. 4
Every step of the process was perfect and easy. I received my BB the date they gave me and it works perfect 4
You may run into issues with AT&t: Big brother does not like IMEI numbers it does not have in its database. Unless I am wrong and the phone is broken ( screen becomes unresponsive when you put SIM in ) AT&T may be blocking this phone on their network. Its a disappointment. We had this gadget for our kiddo from another vendor for over a year and it worked fine. 2
beware this is the no camera verson, you can get it for 20 at other places with no camera, and 40 with the camera 2
This phone has to be brand new, there is not a mark on it and it is packaged in the original packaging with all original contents. Great buy!!! 5
SHAME ON "Solid PUrchases" as a shipping company. I placed my order on 2/7/2014, and received a dirty used phone on 2/19/2014. It was shipped in just a flimsy soft envelope, with a bit of bubble wrap. It certainly should have been shipped in a small box! The apple box was previously opened and the corner smashed. The phone was covered with greasy fingerprints. All the attachments, except the cheap earbuds were missing. No info or operating instructions. There is no identification if it is an 15s, or 15, or locked or not.Now I have to wait up to three days to obtain approval from "Solid (Crap) Purchases" to return it, and wait again for a refund.. Other shipping companies associated with Amazon have better wrapped and cared more in delivering a $10 item, in comparison to a fragile new apple iphone costing several hundred dollars. I will never purchase anything from "Solid Purchases" again. Avoid the big disappoint I am experiencing, and consider selecting another shipper. 2
i called apple about this phone and gave them the serial number they informed me that it was activated in another country .i highly would not buy an i phone with out calling apple first too see if it was ever activated .watch out......this i phone was not new and i paid and thought it was new.watch out its a scam they tell you that its new but its been activated in another country,do your self a favor call apple with the serial number before you buy an phone advertise as new and check to see if it was ever activated.and do not buy anything from these people..... 1
Broke within two weeks and couldn't turn it back on!! Also time zone was stuck on Austria!!!! 1
The above distributors sold me an I phone 5 that had already been returned to them since it was defective.The I phone arrived to me with the SIM card of the earlier customer.The I phone's sound was bad and its speed mediocre compared to the one my daugther has . I paid nearly 1000 dolalrs for this unlocked phone WorldWide Distributors .Since I travel a lot I was not able to return it on time and the 30 days passed . WorldWide Distributors refuses to deal with me anymore.BEWARE OF ITEMS Sold by WorldWide Distributors...they coud be defective as my i phone 5 is. 1
Locked to Verizon, so useless as an unlocked phone. 1
It was honestly terrible quality 1
I,m very sad because i ordered this blackberry as a gift for my daughter`s birthday. She really loves fuschia color, and when i saw that you were selling one in this color, i had no doubt in buying it. As i live in other country, i wrote a delivery adrees in the U.S., bacause i was going there at the time the phone arrived. But for my surprise, when i got the phone, it was red and not fuschia. Iam very disappointed because i order 2 blackberry phones, one in red, for my son`s birthday; and the other one in fuschia for my daughter`s birthday. Now i have two red phones and my daughter saying to me that she doesn`t like that color because it is for boys.My surprise was ruined, and my daughter is really sad because the most incredible gift for her was supouse to be a blackberry in fuschia.As i only spent 3 days in the U.S. i couldn`t return the secong red blackberry.Sorry for spelling mistakes, but i am from Ecuador, South AmericaKatiuska 3
Its a good phone for me just that it always has low signal and my provider is simple mobile. For some apperant reason my headphones can't seem to work at the same time and I know it's the phone since I bought some other headphones and I'm still having the same problem. I would better my review if blu would fix it. 2
Perfect Phone expected it to look gently used. Pleasantly surprised. It looks and functions like a new one. 5
I bought two of these phones because I wanted to surprise my friends, who were going away on a trip and both of them needed new phones. I looked at many different smart phones on here, specifically with 4G LTE, which in itself narrows the selection. This phone stood out to me. The price seemed ok, the specs sounded fine and the reviews were encouraging. So I bought two. I was excited about getting them, and giving them away but the joy of the surprise didn't last very long. Both phones have inaccurate sensors. If I tap a letter in the top row, it gives me language selection. I need four, sometimes five attempts to open an app because it doesn't respond to lighter touch. It becomes extremely annoying when you type a message and it frequently inserts a suggestion, just because you typed the letter slightly upward. Even for a budget phone like this one, I expected better adjustment. I also couldn't, like in my own phone, (which was the same price but seems a much better quality) calibrate the sensor to have a more accurate typing experience. There was no way to fix this.As I gave the two phones away, the frustration was high as I felt I had made a bad choice. I am returning at least one of them and have already ordered a phone of which I know that it works.There is some good about these phones however. The wifi is relatively fast and the phone itself is fast in opening apps for example. The screen is very clear and almost looks like a retina screen, very high quality. The colors are vibrant. This phone comes with a screen protector and a slim silicone case. All of that is absolutely great and I like that the sellers do sell a product with thought behind it. But all the good doesn't help if the one thing that makes a phone useable, being able to type or press on a symbol is not working well. 3
The BLU is working ok much better than the yess andy 3
The phone had already some repair done to it. The on and off device was broken and I had to bring it to a repair shop to make it again. It costs me 50$. The repairman discovered it was repaired before. Since I was abroad it was to hard to sent the phone back. Very bad business. I was conned. Severina Kolloffel 1
The quality of the actual product was very nice and sturdy. The only problems I had with this product was that the Bluetooth kept disconnecting every few minutes. The step counter would reset every so often without me prompting it to. 2
Very happy! Using my new phone now.Thanks! 5
Needs to be updated. Get rid of the things in Chinese. The QR code doesn't do anything. I keep being told to refer to the app, which does nothing except for work with the pedometer. Couldn't figure out for the life of me how to get text messages to show on the phone. The font is so small and hard to read, and I've had Lasik surgery and was wearing reading glasses to try and see it. The instructions are very hard to understand. 2
its ok but my start locking up and know I got to get a new phone 2
Has worked out perfectly.. since its an older model, we were worried that it might be missing some essential tasks such as a good camera.. it has been more than we expected. 5
Had to return because it didn't work with my provider. Very quick refund.. 5
The watch is connected and off all the time 2
The look met my expectations. Nothing else just happy it came exactly how it said in the description 4
I was really scared by seeing the review after I bought the item but I got it today and It is brand new came with a sealed original packing and also works perfectly with my carrier :) thank you so much 5
This shipped so fast and my son was so excited to receive it earlier than expected. Great condition phone and well worth the money. Thanks for the quality product and fast shipping - it truly made his day! 5
Only had fone for about month and it was stolen. I'm out all that money. No one would do anything for me. Even a discount when I'm ready to purchase another fone. I just felt something could of been done that's a lot of money to be out 1
Wasn't what I was looking for. 2
This was a great buy for me. 5
No problem with this iPhone it is nice and working well. 5
You can barely hear when you are talking to someone 2
the phone is in great condition however it has some small issues that my daughter is learning to live with 4
Phone looks goodShipping was fast 4
Phone arrived and wouldn't turn on but still in guarantee so got a brand new phone exactly the same. Love it. Glad i had my Samsung galaxy stolen! 4
The deal sounds amazing but the home button is really hard to press to work. The heat plate and screws aren't on the inside so you will have poor wifi connection. 3
My IPhone came exactly on time with everything stated in the ad. Basically, it's brand new! I am so pleased with it. Fantastic! 5
I was expecting the phone to be in better condition than I received it. One of the speakers doesn't work, AT ALL and there are 2 pretty big dents along the edges of the phone. 3
Ended up returning, not what I expected. 2
Great phone, works perfectly. It has a fast operating system, and I have had it for about a month and never had an issue with it. 5
It's an good phone for the price. 3
The camera is garbage and as soon as you open more than two apps the phones turns drastically slow. 3
Brought for my teenage daughter..she says she loves it! 4
the output ratio - price are very good . It is much more than I expected cell phone. 4
BEWARE! THIS PHONE IS A FORGERY, AND NOT MADE WITH APPLE PRODUCTS!! I bought this iPhone for my daughter as a birthday gift to replace her broken phone IN May. Last week, the battery got too hot and it melted the screen. She took it to Apple to repair, and Apple told the parts were not APPLE PRODUCTS AND THAT IT IS A FORGERY AND THEY WILL NOT SUPPORT OR FIX IT. She had to buy a new phone.HAD I KNOWN THAT THIS WAS A FORGERY, I WOULD HAVE NOT BOUGHT IT. I WAS CHEATED. 1
Horrible sending it back after a week trying to get it set up. NEVER AGAIN 1
Recibi el producto en buenas condiciones, el empaque un poco deteriorado, pero el equipo celular en perfecto estado. Llego a venezuela un mes despues. el celular esta en servicio, no presenta problemas. El unico detalle, es que la betria esta trabajando aproximadamente 36 horas, y se descarga, pero en lineas generales, fue satisfactorio la compra con AMAZON...Gracias 4
I got it earlier than expected, but it didn't come with a charger like it said . 3
So far so good . Sound is quirky and plays out the speaker even when headphones are plugged in . I'm hoping that next update will fix that. I'm also hoping this one lasts longer than my last two blu phones. They died within weeks 3
The phone came with some crusty crap on the screen. Seriously? The seller couldn't wipe it off? Also the touch screen doesn't work. Like, it won't swipe or press or anything. If Apple can't fix it for free I'm returning it. 1
Well this review is for a phone I purchased a couple of years ago to use on my trips to South America. Not sure of any of the current vendors but as for the phone it self it is good and does what it is made to do. It is dated now but if you are in the market for a Blackberry this is a decent choice. It was unlocked all I had to do was pop in a sim and add some minutes and was good to go. This is a great phone to use while traveling thru South America in my experience as I am always warned not to pull out my new iPhone and it works so yeah. Even though I don't see many people looking to purchase this phone as 2016 is only a few days away. Reading a few of the other reviews I would advise you to research the seller more than this phone itself as it is a solid product. I guess another point to make is that you can probably find a android smart phone with apps galore for the same price as this phone that would serve the same purpose with more functionality which is why I am only giving 4 stars. 4
Don't waste your time . 1
Thought I ordered a NEW phone according to the product description, however, when I received it, it had someone else's icloud account, photos and phone numbers. I spent a few hours deleting and setting it up with my info and then found that the earpiece speaker doesn't work. Can't hear the person on the other end. Feel a little deceived. 1
Arrived on time! Has a few scratches but it works and I'm happy about this product 5
Unfortunately, this item did not come quite as promised. It's in great condition, no question, but it arrived without a sim card. It was a gift and when I gave it to my son, he discovered the sim card was missing and took the one from his old iPhone 5 and put it in this one. This phone does not hold a charge and doesn't always work as it should. The Verizon staff told us that often when a phone arrives without a sim card (and this one was supposed to have been a Verizon phone, it is often stolen. I hope that isn't the case with this one, but either way, I'm pretty disappointed that I spent $176.00 on a phone that didn't arrive the way it was promised, and doesn't work properly. 2
I love it. It came really fast and is in perfect condition. Side Note: There may be a screen protector on the device that may look a little worn. 5
I needed to replace my cellphone. My cellphone that I have had for 3 years wasn't a smart phone, just regular. I looked around and studied and found this was the best low priced unlocked smart phone. I can use it on WiFi to play games and browse. I use the cellphone strictly for calls and texts. I haven't tried it for texting, but I find it works wonderfully for calls. I had to re-learn how to make and receive calls, since this is the first time I have used a smart phone. I have an android tablet that I enjoy so I find this android smartphone to be handy to take with me if I want to browse on WiFi when I am away from home. I used to take the tablet and the cellphone with me when I went out. Now they are combined in one unit. This android cellphone/tablet is slow for a quad-core OS. I guess it is the .5 G of RAM that limits how fast it goes. I am satisfied with it however, and bring a lithium battery pack along to plug into the smartphone when the battery gets low and I want to play games or browse. 4
Customer loved the replacement phone 5
Camera quality isn't what I exoected, but overall Love it! 3
Great phone! I really thought there would a lot pf scratches on it but there was totally nothing it is like brand new the only complaint i have was that the charger was broken but is ok i bought one and it works perfectly fine thank you for the phone 5
I like it because I being a Blackberry buff get to use an efficient SMART Phone along with a convenient key pad. It looks difficult to use in the beginning but once you get the hang of it its pretty cool.I tried installing Viber on it but surprisingly got a message that it is not available for this device. 4
worked great until it got ground up by a piece of equipment 5
This little fella haz more than what he's name and price can tell.Mid range price for a bit more than that.I haven't installed an app that he won't run, it's impressive what this underestimated brand can give. I've had 2 blus by now and they have worked perfectly. Just hope the can get on plot with their devices getting updated on time and not having to buy a new phone everytime I want a new Android version. 4
Was NOT AT&T carrier. It was actually sprint. Failed to mention the giant gash in the bottom corner, and the fact it came with no headphones. Also it was still registered to another user. Just awful. 1
Lower Speaker stop working two days after I got it 2
This cell phone outside is very hurt, a lot of dust, too bad, all the accessories are not original, I want like to return, but I'm in China. I think I will not be here to buy second-hand goods.Feeling too bad! ! ! 1
The longer I have it the less I use it. It's nice for reminders of my meetings and seeing weather and such. Was disappointed at the lack of apps written for this. 3
i returned the phone right away. It takes a mini Sim card, which I did not know, although it may have been in the reviews, I did not see it. The phone looks and feels like a really light and cheap iphone. I did not like how the phone was set up either. You cannot take the back off the remove the battery, which is a very big downfall for me. 2
No problems activating. So far, so good. 5
this is my best bye of the year it is a brand new phone 5
My phone broke and I needed a quick fix without spending $500 to replace it. Got this one and was a little worried ordering it used, but luckily everything worked out great! Product was exactly as described, if not better. The phone looks brand new, and came with all new accessories. Like it says in the description, it doesn't come with a SIM card, but they will give you one for free in the Sprint store when you go in! It was ready to activate and did so with no problem, which was awesome, easy, and most importantly, I have a working phone again! I definitely recommend ordering from this company. 5
I didn't check when it arrived and I send them to India .one is working fine but other is asking for PIN number .Not able to use that phone.what to do. 1
I have been a BB user for at least 5 years and have often owned the latest models mostly for business use. I purchased this one as a personal BB. Unfortunately, automatically I could tell it was not of the same quality as the others. It was much lighter and just felt flimsier. It also took a while to figure out how to download BB messenger which came pre-loaded in my past BBs. Perhaps that is standard, but it just seemed a bit odd to me that BB did not include BB messenger pre-loaded in its own devices... 3
This is in great condition, looks brand new and works great. I've tried to acquire another one at this price. 5
So far, so good . 4
"I don't like this phone because the phone switches off and this pen calibration thing pops up say touch the pen in each corner/middle of screen and when it does that it resets ALL the settings. Other than the seller...A+++ Seller" 2
Received it in 4 days. Refurbished to appear brand new, works perfectly, came with case, screen protector and charger. All for less than half the regular price! 5
I loved the phone's appearance and all was good with the functions too, right up till it just died. I had it just about than 2 months. 4
Felt like new, but there are two speakers on the phone and one didnt produce sound.. This didn't bother me that much... I'm still happy with it 4
One of the speakers doesn't work.. 3
Sometimes the keys and buttons don't work on the screen 3
Exactly what I was expecting.thank you. 5
I bought this I-Phone for my dtr. but I had to return it because it couldn't be unlocked for any other network. phone is beautiful blue. great phone but we just didn't want to be on phone plan 3
I have recvd. the product.It is beyond my expectations.It works great.Thank you Amazon. 4
This product will not connect to wifi. 3
My husband hates it. You can't change the ring tone, and the volume is too low for him to hear if he's not in a quiet room. It works fine, it's just not very good for someone with hearing issues. 3
The phone is great. My son is very happy with it! 5
The Gold iphone 6s Plus work fine, the only app that doesn't function is the Audio-Recording App, but with tons of other App that does the same function i wasn't perturbed by it malfunctioning. 4
If I could give zero stars I would. This phone was advertised to me as new but sold to me clearly refurbished with scratches on the back. A week after activating it the lock button became defective and it keeps going to the "slide to power off screen" every 10 seconds which practically makes the phone unusable. I called apple support and they informed me the phone was not new and was 200 days past warranty so now I'm forced to return the phone and go buy a phone from somewhere else for much less since I'm not on a contract and I refuse to pay full price for another defective phone. 1
The battery does not last long at all, but it is cheap so deal with it! 3
Did not work properly. They let me return it without any problems. 1
Received garbage its defeated phones 1
After buying this phone for a friend, she loved how it worked but it cracked when slipping out of a chair and falling 11 inches and it ruined the ENTIRE mid section of the input area, which denotes something of a "cheap" screen to me. When we ordered parts to repair it, we found that the wiring for the screen was so tucked and glued it was a lost cause and we had to just throw the phone in the trash (and i replace laptop LCDs for a living along with a few phones). It was just too much of a hassle so we just bought a different phone.This phone could be called a "nice" throw-away phone, kinda like the ones you get in Dollar General. Use it, you will enjoy it, but protect it like it's an infant child because it will break at the drop of a dime (so to speak) and it's a serious hassle to even get into with all the gluing going on inside of it. 2
I like the phone, I hate that call volume is very low, the camera takes ok pics, the front facing camera ok pics too, I bought an micro sd card but it won't fit into my phone, I would not buy another blu phone, can anyone tell me why my micro sdhc card won't fit into my phone n how can I install it 3
This is not the same as the more expensive version in Rose Gold.Customer service is the company's worst fault. In the long run, if you buy a Blu product, you need an extra warranty, as Blu will not be there for you. 3
So far, so good. Just wanted to comment that my order came in OVERNIGHT. I ordered it at 10 pm and it was there the next day by 10 am. Its pretty impressive. 4
Phone was new and came in Apple packaging 4
In compelled to write a review. I read them consistently, but never write them. You'd never know this phone wasn't brand new. My daughter was ecstatic and I saved a lot of money. Delivery was fast as always. Came with earbuds and charger and packaging looked exactly like new iPhone. Loved it!! 5
I love this phone it is the greatest purchase ever! I recommend this phone to everyone but be careful of the seller you purchase it from I had to have a blank sim card in order to setup my phone to get the apple apps that came with the phone after my seller reset the phone. 5
D not like it too small. the picture fools you. 2
I am happy with the BlackBerry Classic: love the keyboard and the 'touch' features; the Blackberry Hub makes accessing all messages a breeze; the screen size works for me; with the features and apps I literallyhave a tablet in my hand. However, the charging feature is a serious short-coming: I can only charge this device when it is turned on. 4
This was a great product, however I couldn't see myself constantly using this enough through out the day to spend that kind of money on it. 3
I bought three of these phones before,I got case and ear piece this time I did not get a case or an ear piece>The phone looks ok haven't used it Im giving my sister it as a gift 3
Worked fine for 2 weeks and then the speaker went out 2
First off i put in my sim card and it wouldn't read it for like a whole night. it kept saying searching but wouldn't read it. When it finally read it the problem was it kept turning off randomly even though i was at 70% . Waste of $190 1
Thank you very much for the excellent product 5
The watch lasted two days. If it wasn't for the shipping fees to send it back; I would have. 2
Delivery was on time . The phone look good ,product details says excellent physical condition will come with box,manual and USB charger,but when I try to turn the on/off button is not function I was so disappointed and no USB charger, now I don't even know if I get someone fix it would the phone still work . I was so mad . 1
This is cell phone is not very Good for Europa! 1
Good in battery but poor on specs. 3
It's not straight talk and we thought it was 1
Very nice phone arrived as advertised. Bought it for my son and he is quite pleased with it. 4
+Cheap.+No lag.+Stock Android.+Well made.+Good looking.+Did what I needed which was texted, called, browsed YouTube, had GPS, played music, and browsed Reddit.-Battery life is pretty bad.-First phone was DOA.-Had some MMS issues with T-Mobile. Not sure wh 2
It heats up too quick with minimal usage, battery runs down quick, will not save pictures taken. Reboot several times with same results. Also printed on manual cover of FM radio from website but does not support it. 2
The phone showed up a day early which i was excited about! It was unlocked and easy to set up! It actually didn't have any scratches or noticeable damage or scratches anywhere! I knew the charger wouldn't be the orginal but the charger i got didn't last long. the charger started to mess up and i have to play with it to get it to charge until i can get a new charger :( the charger is the only reason i don't give 5 stars. 3
6 months later and screen has two blacked pixed regions and a paler swipe area on the display. Contacting company to see if they honor warranty 2
I was very excited to receive this in the mail and it came earlier than the estimated arrival date. An extra charger was also included, free of charge. Unfortunately, when I was trying to activate the phone, I was informed that the SIM card was still linked to another person's account so I had to go to the Apple store to get a replacement in order for the phone to work. Overall, I love the phone but didn't like how I had to do extra steps to get it to work. 3
Very useless "smartwatch." Would consider saving a little more and buying something more like a real smart watch. I used it for about a week and decided to storage it forever. Also headset wire was broken. Think twice before getting it! 2
Good! I just didn't like about the recharger, cause is not original but the rest is ok! 4
It has some scratches on the frame and it looks like it has been used for a few months. Not brand new. 2
It works. It's terrible. There are, like, 120mb of free data. I spent $40 on a phone, I'm clearly not trying to pay extra for more space.Android 4.0 is WAAY older than I thought.No 4g. 2
This phone was locked, although I ordered an unlocked phone. It also came with a verizon sim although I ordered an international unlocked phone. Would not recommend this to anyone. 2
This phone is awesome, and the price was excellent. My daughter is very pleased with this phone. 5
THE PHONE IS ALL CRACKED AND LOCK BUTTON IS STUCK YET THE DESCRIPTION SAID USED:VERY GOOD CONDITION. ENOUGH HAS BEEN SAID. 1
I asked other people questions on Amazon about whether it would work with digi mobil (movistar). Everyone said it would. It required a sim adapter.So now on to my review.Anyone who gives this phone 5 stars has never owned a premium smartphone. For this review I am comparing to my Samsung Galaxy S5Touchscreen: With the factory provided screen protector on, sometimes its unresponsive, sometimes it freezes. I have to hold down on a touch screen button most of the time for the phone to realize its being touched and then less than half the time the button will respond. Take the screen protector off and it works marvelously, but then you risk damaging the screen.Network: Movistar DigiMobil (pay as you go plan) When I got my SIM I bought a Samsung Galaxy Young 2 to use it in. No major issues aside from phone size. In the young 2 my whatsapp worked fine and I could send texts and make phone calls in my whatsapp on only my mobile network no Wifi. Now that my SIM is in the Lenovo, it will not allow me to transmit in whatsapp at all unless connected to wifi.-In addition, there is no Internet or google play access without wifi.This is a s*** phone and is being returned 1
It was great. Has worked well. but I would like to kindly request for the name that was attached to the sprint account. It is equested for the unlocking of the device. Please contact on my email ubong21@gmail.com 4
Cosmetically flawed on the home screen. Lots of scratches. Biggest issue is the battery status of the iPhone I received. I am very disappointed that the phone was shipped with a battery that seems faulty. It constantly jumps around and dies extremely fast. I may end up purchasing a new battery for the phone. 2
very good i like a product 5
screen cracked already cant get fixed no part 3
Pro: It's an iPhone. Con: needs to ship with a sim tool and apple certified lighting cable. 4
I bought this phone for my wife because she was wanting a phablet and her neice has the BLUE STUDIO 5.0 and has been very happy with it.HOWEVER, my wife has used the phone for about a month and there are some things that have been annoying to her. For example: there are times when a call will come in and she swipes to answer and the call ends. Other times the phone will ring for a 5 or 10 seconds and then the call ends. (This happens often enough not to be a case of someone changing their mind and hanging up. And it happens very rarely on my phone). Sometimes the phone will start scrolling uncontrollablly. I think that these issues may be due to the STUDIO 6.0 LTE being a new phone and given a year or so to get the final bugs worked out, it could be a great phone. 3
This is a sham. I ordered a new one and the piece of junk I got was such a waste of money. It can't tell time for one, it's always the same time, 7:49. Secondly, Bluetooth doesn't work! Along with a series of errors this phone is a piece of crap. 1
Tried to complete a wireless update and the phone wont come back on, it boots in recovery mode only. Called Blu Tech support which is only mon-fri, and they could not fixed the problem attempted to contact Amazon for another phone 2
First off the phone is beautiful a little heavy but still solid. It looks just like an iPhone or a Samsung. After getting the right SIM card the phone works like a charm. The speaker is very loud but when your using an earpiece and talking to someone you can barely hear that person. How the apps are laid out is very corny and you should have been able to delete what you don't want but you can't. I thought cortana software was going to be installed on the phone but that was a no no (big disappointment there). The phone works perfectly fine except when your playing music through an auxiliary cord in your car you can hear it blasting the phone and not the speakers of the car which sucks. The battery life is ok I haven't tested that part out to the fullest yet. Another annoying thing is that when you unlock the phone it goes directly to phone section which I hate. Other than a couple of flaws it's a nice phone. Oh yeah! The camera is not that great. Blu studio HD 6.0 is by far a better phone.Update: the phone sucks in so many ways. It gives you a hard time when your trying to go on the internet. It's very slow even when you use Wi-Fi. I finally figured out how to use the other features while on the phone. It takes a long time to charge. The phone have a tendency of going on speaker while your talking or going to headset while using Bluetooth. I wouldn't recommend this phone. I'm sick with it since I need a phone. Such a waste of my money. 3
the phone works great and it looks new 5
I have bought before this one had a few small issues such as the "P" button not working when upright, but It is still worth the cost to me and beats the heck out of ATT. 4
Phone is in good condition, but it was not in MINT condition as advertised. 3
No memory even after adding 32 GB to it still can't download anything 3
Worked perfectly. Met my expectations. 5
I bought this phone for my son & he loves it especially it's being his first iPhone. Great product at a great price. Item arrived at the time it said it would 5
Great phone but the charging port died after 5 months. Since it is a Blu phone it is hard to find replacement parts. 3
looks good but very flimsy. I thought i was gonna break my battery cover. power button required a firmer press to turn on or off device. 2
I bought this phone back in May and it has been working great. The main problems are:1. When I received the phone I noticed that the power cube was not working. The power cord was fine, but i had to get a new cube.2. As you might know, since September 2013 all NEW apple products that are bought come with Pages, Numbers and Keynote for free. When I contacted Apple they stated that the phone was actually bought and first turned on in August 2013. 3
There was one major scratch on the front but all the buttons worked and shipping was faster than expected 4
I bought this phone for my sister as a replacement for her older 3GS that quit working. She has limited funds so newer model iPhones were not possible and past problems with used phones made that not an option. The 3GS is a dinosaur but it still has great features and is very easy for almost anyone to use. The iPhone 3GS purchased from Tablet Distributors and fulfilled by Amazon was as described, new and unlocked. It came in the original packaging with wall charger and headphones. I do not think the wall charger provided works but the old one is fine so I don't care. I upgraded to the latest iOS, restored contacts, and connected to Straight Talk without problems. Very happy with this purchase. 5
Good condition and love it, I recomend, Not the best deal $300 but its fair.I don't want any contract and new is too expensive 4
Awesome phone. For what you are paying for it is worth it. It exceeded my expectations. 4
I purchased this new iphone 5c and went to Sprint to activate it. I was told by Sprint that this phone is a stolen one, and can not be activated!!!!! 1
great phone, good price, fast shipping, only problem was the extra charge by FedEx that I did not expect. 3
Was horrible they ropped me off the sound don't work at all 1
The phone came dirty. It works but is cleaning it off too much to ask? 3
I am very happy with this phone ... what needed to be 100% complete q would be the flash of the camera.It is my second purchase of this phone I do, and the latter buying the phone I came with a 2GB memory, this purchase Amazon.LLC sent me instead with my first purchase I sent it another store and brought me no memory. 4
Thank you for the wonderful phone. I was giving this phone as a gift and I really appreciate the great service 4
Will not sync with my Samsung phone like the advertisement said it would 2
To be honest.. for a budget phone it's not that bad. Warning though..if you're into a good camera for your phone.. I wouldn't recommend this one. Its HUGE also lol...but I like big phones. But you absolutely can't beat the price..you get a lot 3
The iPhone is new and came in a perfect condition, really well packed! I loved it! It's a really good deal! 5
This Iphone is on IOS 7.02 I tried so many time to update to current IOS but it won't work. Also iphone 4 camera is pretty bad I can't video call or record videos clear nor can I take selfies clear its blurry. I was expecting better quality iphone for What I have paid but this is so bad iphone. Very disappointed 1
The phone is excellent, but the announcement say that include flip case, and it's false and neither has the headphones. 3
it was not open so i had to take it to someone to get it open. HHH HHH HHH HH HHH HHH 3
Screen died after 3 months use. Warranty covered replacement but was a hassle.A bit too large a bezel. Buttons are not naturally spaced. Selfie flashlight is actually too bright. 3
My daughter is very happy with it 4
I just got a replacement of this device and it auto restarts like crazy......I wish I didn't have to have this phone anymore 1
Cosmetically it's in good shape but the battery life is rather poor. 3
The phone works perfectly fine and it's in good conditions but the charger and the headphones were not original apple products. 3
It worked perfectly well! It was what expected. 5
So far so good.It was purchased for my daughter she uses metro pcs and the phone has been fine. 4
bought for someone else and no complain made so far. 3
quite heavy.sound not to good at times...takes nice pics. like large screen...will know what to look for in next phone.. 3
Really enjoying this item but my front facing camera is not working out. I don't know if I want to return this item or not. My front facing camera is extremely zoomed in and I can't find a way of zooming it out. Tried several things and it just doesn't work. Any help? If not returning. 3
Bought this item for my father for Father's Day. He is a gadget guy so I THOUGHT it would be the perfect gift. He opened the gift and started playing with it only to find that the quality of this item was terrible, not to mention the fact that the box was ripped and the item had already been tampered with. The description on this site is very misleading. Do not waste your money 2
Love it, just what I expected! 5
I gave it one star because i didnt get the color I wanted I got white and I didnt give it back or return it because I have been waiting for a phone for along time I wasn't about to give my phone back jus because of the color of it but I was made at first but then I got over it 1
I got it for my uncle and I no he is going to enjoy his new phone 3
I liked using this phone a lot during the first 4-5 months, and then it started to crash every so often, with the battery starting to drain very fast, like 1% per every 2-3 minutes? That wasn't what I was expecting from a very nice looking smartphone, I use this phone as a backup now, and bought a more expensive phone to use for everyday purposes. 3
Great phone, few probs. Love that it's up to date 3
the phone works fine looks good btw it works for metro pcs but i updated now it saying to enter a pass word that i do not have 3
exactly what you want they put a brand new screen in before it came love it 5
phone was damaged so bad it could not be used i was blamed for the damage it was not unlocked as promised either i was refused a refund 1
The battery died in less than 24/hours.... 1
So the phone stop working not even a month later. When I tried to email the company I got no response on what could be wrong. 1
So far its a some what good phone.. only gripes are not enough volume to speaker and pics are blurry. 2
This phone is huge. If you are going to buy it, make sure you look at the photo where the gentleman has it in his hand. It is a monster, basically a mini-tablet. The battery lasts forever. The combo of screen size and battery make it awesome for watching movies... but man it does not fit easily in your pocket. I can't say the build quality is great, as mine died due to a 3 foot drop. No cracked screen, just completely un-functioning. While is worked it was pretty decent, but I expect a little more survivability from my electronics. 3
Love the phone & the fact it was almost $100 cheaper than Apple Store. 5
I didn't check when it arrived and I send them to India .one is working fine but other is asking for PIN number .Not able to use that phone.what to do. 1
Bought this phone a couple months ago. Yesterday went to the apple (I bought the apple protection plan) because the screen wasnt working amnd they told me that it was not apple screws in the phone so it couldnt have been new when you bought it...im so pissed that I was lied to and noww have a phone that is broken. Please contact me about this issue. 1
the charger that brings the phone comes with problems and not burden and also has problems microphone output, not recommended because pay for something new and seems used 2
This phone is aesthetically pleasing, and would be great if it didn't start freezing moments after taking it out of the box. Honestly, I wish it wasn't so slow, but that's what you get for the price. 2
Great seller, great product. Perfect! 5
Same day I got it stopped working 1
The phone was in great conditions make sure to ask for the real descriptions of the phone and that the phone is ESN clean 3
It does look nice, but the antenna is terrible, and I haven't found a workaround. 2
I may never buy a new phone again. Buying a refurbished phone works just fine. 4
This product is sold as being unlocked and compatible with T Mobile. After going through the long process of resetting the phone using itunes, it will not work with the T Mobile SIM card. Useless! 1
Blu studio 5.0 unlocked phone is not good. Battery stability is only 30-40 minutes. So as new phone it is not up to the mark does not fulfill my demand. 2
The battery is useless, I have to almost always have it on a charger and it doesn't qualify for the free swap out. The mic that a phone call and snapchat use doesn't work, and it has a horrible time picking up Wifi. This was good in a pinch, but I wish I'd saved my money up and bought one from Apple. 2
The best.phone for the price.haha. 5
It's a shame that the only reason I am tossing this away (or returning) is because I can't read text messages. I was hoping to be able to minimally read texts ; I wasn't expecting to be able to text back from the watch. I have an iphone 5s. 2
The phone is good, but not perfect. The number of apps is enough, but it is not so fluent when using the apps. 4
it was actually the wrong phone.....yeah its a yellow 5.5 but its the wrong model number....2 much of a headache to return 2
Not good , It is To Old , I need may many back please. 1
I like iphone great condition 5
the battery is unremovable. We not aware of this. 2
So far its being doing fine. 4
I wrote a previous review about this phone. It was not a 32GB as listed, but a 16GB. It was not unlocked either. After contacting Amazon, they did all that was necessary to correct the problem along with a full upfront refund before receiving the phone back. Thank you to Amazon for their hard work in the customer service department. 5
Finally picked one up after a year of contemplating if I should switch to iOS. Love it so far 4
even the outdoor mode does not have a sufficient ring volume. what's the use for a phone you can't hear??? 2
I purchased this phone less than a year ago and was under the assumption that this was a NEW phone. It is not. The battery has been horrible from the start and now It has quit working and since TechRay advertised it as "new" I thought it had the standard apple warranty on it. But it doesn't. It was used before I purchased it and they advertised it as new. I spoke to two apple guys from two different places and they both said the warranty was up in 2013 because it had been purchased and used in 2012. I do not recommend this phone or the seller TechRay. 1
Phone performance and quality is good but if you want parts or support... you can as well forget BLU.I have tried to buy an extra battery and was told by BLU support to search on Google as they do not sell retail.When you search parts for BLU Life one L120 on Google, you find NO PARTS.So.... enjoy it while it works and pray it does not break.BLU manufactures NOTING; it is made in China and their support is from order till you receive your phone. After this, forget IT! 2
phone has not worked since purchase 1
This is the second one I purchased, one for each parent. Since the price had dropped significantly it was a steal. At under $200 this phone is a solid buy. So far it's up to Marshmallow, and has a great screen, great performance, and amazing dual front facing speakers. Battery like is solid and the added benefit of expandable storage with a very stock interface (after adding the Google launcher) are an added bonus. The only issue with this phone is the camera. It's slow, and in medium to low light blurring does occur. I expect this from a phone at this price, but if you have decent light and steady hands you can take average photos. 5
Cheap price, cheap product. Buy a model that is a year old, but a brand name, and you will do better than with this. Cracked screen inside of a month, way too little storage, and the camera does not work well.Does make phone calls and texts, therefore no 1 star rating. 2
Awesome phone! Wouldn't trade it for the world! Delivered on time- I will be a repeat customer! 5
Phone looked like new and worked great. It made my grand daughter very happy! 5
The phone is chunky because of the battery but otherwise a top notch phone. I had to return it because when I would set it down it would power cycle for some reason. Defects happen, Amazon as usual was great with the return. 2
2 weeks after delivery the phone went off and won't start.i'm taking it to the apple store tomorrowi hope they have a good explanation 2
The item's charger did not work and it seems as though this is a fake or replica iPhone. I will have to take it to the Apple Store to know for sure but I'm unhappy with the product besides the fact that it took over two weeks to get here. 1
Screen stopped working after only a month. Already had to buy a new phone. Never buying another phone from Amazon 1
I tested the phone for a couple of days because I bought as a gift, on my experience this is what I saw.Phone works really fluent even when having a bunch of apps open, have some useful Asus tools to purge memory to close apps which in my opinion is too much but for people that don't like to go deep into the phone options will be a great tool.Camera focus as expected really really fast it is quite great for the price at night it could be a little better but still it's a really good one.I will recommend this phone for someone looking for a good phone at an affordable price, works perfect, and having the 2 SIM slots is pretty cool as well. 4
The camera volume isn't work 1
Horrible the owner had all his info and i couldn't activate it because the owner never cleared his bill 1
I had gotten the phone and the condition is great but the screen had issues and I had to pay an extra amount of money to get it replaced. But otherwise works great. 3
Fast shipping, the phone arrived in a really good condition, i'm impressed. Just a little scratch on back but it took me days to see it. 5
I ordered this phone for my son for Christmas, so that I wouldn't have to pay AT&T's high price for a new phone through them, when it arrived, it would not hold a charge. So I ended up having to return this phone, which I had no issues with the seller over this. But it was so close to Christmas by this time that I had to get my son a phone through AT&T after all. 1
Arrived in new condition. Excellent!! 5
Terrible phone. Quit working after about 1 month 2
I haven't been able to use the internet since I got ot turned on and my service has data with it. 2
was in rough shape and wasnt unlocked 2
it has a glitch that drops wifi, and you can't simply turn it back on. shut it off, then reboot, and wifi capability returns. otherwise, it's been a good phone. it's used, after all. even a new one can have a glitch, over time. 4
The phone is ok. Replaced a smashed Samsung until my contract expires. The FIDO reps have never seen this brand and had some trouble getting it open and working. Still can't get photos by text. Def need a micro sd card, since the internal memory is not great. As well, do not buy this phone and expect to take decent photos. 3
The phone works pretty well and has a wealth of features, however.It has some quirks that were for me too cumbersome to overcome.In the case of answering the phone on incoming calls, it popped up a menu, of answer later, leave a message and so on with no way to answer the call.If that menu did not rear it's ugly head and you swiped to answer any direction except for the one very limited swipe it would hang up.If this were solved this would be a great phone. 3
I do not believe I was shipped an Apple product. The rep at the Verizon store could not register the phone on the Verizon system. After closer inspection, he felt that it was a knock-off. I agree as the home button was not correct and was off center and the body of the phone had pulled away from the screen on one end. So far I have spent over 2 hours dealing with this phone. I did process a return for a refund and will purchase another 5C from a different supplier. 1
It has line in the screen, at times I can't see anything 1
Antenna is very weak. Old blackberry had better reception, now I have to go outside of the building to talk. 2
Just ok for the price 3
I've had the phone for a few months now and is still working pretty good.. 4
Ok and worked with Verizon as stated. Had some problems with phone hanging up/disconnecting a lot. 4
The only problem I have is that the phone is in another language. I changed it to English but I couldn't change the app store to English fully. 3
This phone sucks!!😒 Do not waste your money on this product. The first day I got it, it was powering off by itself many times. It always froze. I bought it 4 months ago and now it does not work at all!!! The screen popped out all the time. Even tho it says new it is definitely used! Worst phone I probably ever had ! 1
I PURCHASE THIS PHONE FOR A FRIEND IN THE END SHE LIKE IT AND WISH IT CAME WITH A MANUAL 3
It loses/lost signal and will only come back with booting; contacted Blu, they suggested resetting the phone to default, I did and had same results. I returned to Amazon and replaced with Moto G 2014 and no it has no problem. Network is T-Mobile. 2
Words can't describe how unsatisfied I am. The product I order was an iPhone 4 the phone was stolen. I could not connect it with sprint. Thanks for nothing. 1
The phone looks good for it's price point, but it is kind of tiny.The bad thing about this phone is it has very choppy communication. It drops the voice every few seconds. The line isn't disconnected, but the voice between the conversation just disappears and comes back. Forcing the need to constantly repeat oneself. 2
I bought this for my daughter less than 1 yr ago.. phone was working fine & up until a few days ago starts going haywire-- calling multiple people at once, hanging up on phone calls she has made, texting random letters to various contacts in her phone, screen freezes, etc.. She took it to a phone repair store to pinpoint these sudden issues with her phone.. only to find this is NOT a legitimate iPhone-- & I quote "the insides are refurbished, refurbished parts to make up this phone AND some parts are even MISSING... That is likely why your phone is going down so suddenly." 1
I've bought several Blu phones over the last 4 years and overall I think they are a great buy for the money.I returned a Vivo xl before buying this as there were many issues I didn't like with that phone. I did a review on that one also.Starting off with this one seemed very familiar with my previous life XL.Here's my negatives so far after a month and a half.1) Notifications (again) Most of my app notifications do not sound. They worked for a while, now most don't.Don't know if it's me or the phone. I some cases, I will set a tone and after hitting ok, it will reset to none.2) incoming calls. There is supposed to be a drop down Dismiss/Answer box to handle the call.Most of the time it doesn't show up, or if it's hidden, I don't know how to open it. Really frustrating.3) Still don't know if connecting LTE, no icon I can see. I'm assuming it does.4) there are only 2 pages available for apps? Not a big negative for me, as the app icon at the bottom is now back (missing on the vivo xl)5) I also had trouble connecting to windows to get pictures off (same with vivo xl). Found solutions online. Should be simple plug in featurePluses.I did find a 64gb card that worked.SanDisc. My Vivo would not accept any brand.the back is easy to remove as they have put a notch back in it. Vivo did not have and was near impossible to get off. Only place was to use the charg port edge to pry off. 3
the phone was not exactly like new. it was looking old. I bought few 'used like new' phones earlier and they were good, but this was not. 3
Not compatible with the GSM network as promised. Locked to CDMA (Verizon and Sprint Network) Very disappointed. Perhaps, they sent the wrong phone. 1
A very solid phone for the asking price.I was able to purchase this device during promotion for 199 dollar, but in this review i will compare to the Mate 2, Note 4 and Nexus 4, iphone5, which at the time of my purchase was 300 dollar, 750 dollar, 360 dollar and 600 dollar. I'd like to mention that the asus zenfone 2 is a very capable phone and priced at 199/299, but i do not have a unit to compare with.pro1. build quality is superb. the phone is assembled with high precision, the unit is very thin and very solid. the entire phone has no creaking when pressed and each button has very nice tactile feel. it is very similar to the feeling of Nexus 4, which was also superb in term of build quality and overall finishing.2. the speaker is superb. it is up there with HTC boomsound and i think it might actually better at bass (HTC may be better at treble). at any rate. the speaker is miles apart from anything else and even better than most tables (that includes ipad). the true stereo speaker and high definition sound (for a phone) really helps when you watch video or play game without headphones or boombox. and most importantly, this phone's speaker are very well placed and it hides within the frames. so all the glory without HTC's huge ugly speaker grills.3. screen is awesome. it has one of the brightest screen on a phone. no issue to use in the day light and it is capable of display vivid images at a extreme wide angle. it easily rivals the screen found on iphone 5. in the realm of IPS, this screen is as good as it goes. (but i still prefer the ALMOED on Note 4 better for its deep contrast).4. stock andriod. pretty much the vanilla andriod with very little touch to add alcatel's reversible screen. which means very little overhead and smooth operation.5. support SD card. while most say SD card is useless, i would not purchase a device without capability of expanding storage. i often travel for business and leisure. and many place i go does not have cellphone reception or in an country that cell data is very slow. I always keep the Here map and its offline data in my phone in case i need direction, and that's a good 15 to 20G of data all by itself. and if one uses the phone to take photo or video, he/she will use few gig of storage in a week or two. bottom line, after 9 month of using Note 4, i have already exhausted the 64G SD card and just moved to 200G SD card. and having SD card on a phone, even if you don't think you need it, is a big plus to me.average1. camera is very average for 2015 flagship phone (but very good for 2013 standard). the only other phone i have at the time of the photo comparison is Note 4, which was released in 2014 but has one of the very best camera in smart phone at the time of this review. compared with Note 4, the onetouch idol lacks resolution, white balancing and image sharpness in pretty much any lighting condition. However, i would say that Idol3 does perform very well compared to the flagship phone from two generations ago (e.g. iphone5, Galaxy S4). do bear in mind that this phone does not have a sticking out camera housing like the latest smart phones, and this phone is VERY thin (7.4 mm compared with iphone 5's 7.6 mm). it's optics will suffer even with a capable CMOS sensor.2. performance. again, this phone would have no problem when compared with flagship phones from two generations ago (like HTC M7, S4 or iPhone 5) and might even be slightly faster. which is to say that phone is perfectly capable for daily tasks such as reading email, browsing web or play games (even the very intensive games like implosion). you would probably see occasion lag when scrolling through a huge PDF file or some complicated websites, or a longer loading time for games, but not a deal breaker in my mind. it is not until you doing transcoding or running benchmarks will you see the huge difference between current gen flagship and this phone, but who dose transcoding in the phone anyways?3. reception. in the same location, this phone's reported reception is always about 11 to 15 dbm lower than the Note 4. which would technically translate to 20% of signal strength (since the highest is probably -60 dbm if you standing right next to the tower and lowest usable cell phone strength is around -125).4. compromises: with such wonderful design and display, there are sacrifices has to be made for this release price. for one thing: you don't have 802.11 ac, you don't have Magnetometer or a Gyroscope, all of which zenfone 2 has for similar and cheaper MSRP (199). while i do miss the magnetometer and gyroscope for fast location and direction. i do not miss the 802.11 ac feature. the ac allows you to transfer files at a much greater speed (about twice as fast compared to n in my test with computers), but this is completely useless because the phone's internal storage is so slow that it doesn't matter how fast you can pull down the data. at least on my Note 4, the transfer rate doesn't seem to have any difference when running ac or n.4. processor: i am not against weak processors and i have said this processor does do it job. BUT the 615 is just gimmicky. technically with its octa core, it should be little-big design that you have two cluster of computing units, one is fast but power hungry (A57/A15) while another (A53/A7) is slow but power efficient. but in this device, you have 8 A53 core, just one cluster is clocked faster. REALLY??? qualcomm has no reason to not just release it with standard 4core A53s and add a speed governor to achieve the same effect. in fact, qualcomm said themselves that 615 was released due to market demand for more cores not due to power efficiency or performance. i'd much rather see a 801 or intel's core in this phone than 615 for the similar price.overall, a very solid phone that actually have a good design. it is one of those product that doesn't do all the justice just by reading the spec sheet. you have to see it in person and feel it in hand to appreciate its craftsmanship and balanced performance. while not perfect, it does have a lot of merit for its price tag even at 250 USD. This 5
Phone was used for a few days (not brand new as said in the ad listing) but packing was good and was in box along with new charger and new ear phones.Overall happy with the service. 3
Loved everything about the phone except the camera which totally sucked if you didn't have the perfect lighting situation. If having a good camera isn't important to you then it's a good phone. 2
A friend asked me to order this item, the phone came with no charger, screen corners are darker than usual, ICCID says unknown and I paid $189 for this. I want my money back ASAP, pleassse somebody. 1
It did not work. It would not keep a password. I changed my apple password 6 times. I took the phone to tmobile they couldn't figure it out they told me to take it to apple. They couldn't get it to remember a password either. I sent back last Monday. 1
It doesn't work with my husband's at&t chip. It turned on and everything but no service. We thought it was at&t but they said his service is active and working so I'm very disappointed and would like a solution to this. 1
The iPhone 7 plus has good camera shoot and amazing 3D Touch and 5.5" screen size but less apps and games. I think the iOS 10.2 will bring more amazing apps and games in the store. 4
Product delivered as promised in a timely manner 5
This unlocked phone is good option. It fits in a jacket pocket. It has double camera. The photos are nice. A goog interface easy to use. Applications are functioning well. In short, Unfortunately the ram is very low and has little memory. 3
I love this iphone. It shipped to my home in a reasonable amount of time and was truly in great working condition. 5
Great condition and works great on tracfone 5
battery life is not impressiveno charging status light, you don't know if its charging unless you look a home screen.WiFi is very weak, takes long to detect.the rest is ok android os work alrite. for the price it works! 2
I'm Having problems receiving calls with this phone...the calls go straight to the voice mail. not every single call though, some friends say that they had to call twice or three times to reach me...I get notifications for missed calls and I can see who called me, but still it's a frustrating problem to have! 1
I was definitely scared to buy a phone online, but it was completely legit. Came with headphones and a charger. Brand new. The screen has always had a little defect though. I don't blame this at all on the shipper though. The screen has always been a little u calibrated when a case is on my phone. But I bought this phone almost a year ago and still does what I want it to. 4
phone in good shape but battery very weak. 3
Needs to be updated. Get rid of the things in Chinese. The QR code doesn't do anything. I keep being told to refer to the app, which does nothing except for work with the pedometer. Couldn't figure out for the life of me how to get text messages to show on the phone. The font is so small and hard to read, and I've had Lasik surgery and was wearing reading glasses to try and see it. The instructions are very hard to understand. 2
the phone it self is small. the selfie side of the camera (front side) it terrible. it make it seem like your face/object is 10x its size. so if you like taking pictures I wouldn't recommend this phone 2
el equipo llego en buen estado pero el mismo día que lo comencé a usar se me apago y así mismo sucede cada vez que se recalienta y es un martirio porque todos los dias se me apaga quisiera devolverlo pero lamentablemente no tiene garantía y estoy en Venezuela que decepcion 2
Not what I expected. Phone shuts down for no apparent reason 3
I will never shop at amazon again to this date I still cannot use the phone I purchased because there was no user name and pass word to unlocked the device and to make things worst the website that was provided to unlocked the phone was not able to do so 1
Very disappointed with this phone. The charger base never worked from day one. It has given me constant trouble. It even wiped out all my contacts, pictures, and texts. I will have to bring it to the Apple store to see if they can fix it. 1
waterproof - but not rugged. Screen broke and BLU was very difficult to deal with -- not customer friendly at all 3
The phone died after just over 30 days, retuned to distributor at a cost to me, awaiting a fix or refund 1
Phone did not work properly. The store I used was quick to fix. All in all I am still a satisfied customer. 1
very nice iphone .very good quality as write in description ..came early then expected..very good coustmer services .i suggest this dealer(greensqd) to everyone ..nice job . thank you very much . 5
The phone meets everything I need it to do for a great price. 5
Unlocked? If you are an AT&T customer maybe that is true but this phone would simply not work for Verizon. Find another seller this phone was in perfect condition but not capable of doing what the description says. What an enormous waste of time buying, bringing to the Verizon store, having them tell me it is not unlocked and having to return it. 1
Purchased this unit as a gift. When it worked, it performed great. After two weeks it lost network connectivity. When I tried for warranty replacement, I found out that this was not actually a blue iPhone; the original seller had taken a pink iPhone and put a blue cover on it. From Apple's perspective (or possibly Verizon's), this is a hardware modification which voids the warranty. Lesson learned...think twice before buying a phone from this seller. 1
On the description for the iphone It said it didnt work but could be fixed but it wasnt coming on and you didnt drop it or do anything to it! but i took it to the shop to be fixed and they said that it had water damage to it and could not be fixed! :-( 1
Its really a Excellent product but charger plug on cell phone side is super loose. Since its charger is not universal that creates dependency incase of loose plug otherwise its worth to give 5 stars. 2
I never write reviews..but I'm pretty disappointed about this phone. It was fine when I first got it back in September..about 3months after I started having problems.. The screen doesn't lock when you're on a call,so you're constantly hitting buttons,ending calls,putting on hold.. The hearing part decided to fade out so you can barely hear anyone while you're talking..on speaker you hear perfectly,but they can't really hear you. I can say this, I haven't had a problem browsing - its fast. Takes "ok" pictures. Personally,I wouldn't waste your money on this phone..find something better for your buck! -_- 2
I like my phone it's really nice comparing to other ones. It works perfectly but the only concern I have is the battery doesn't last for long time don't know why. 5
had a few months wasn't a unlocked phone and people can't understand me unless I am using headphones with mic plus only after a couple months and this doesn't leave desk where I charge it cable I use to charge is falling apart don't buy waste of money 1
I was pleasantly surprised my 13yr old lost his cell. Verizon wasn't able to provide another 4s at the time. I searched around and found a new phone never used before here on Amazon. It worked out very well, I was able to activate with Verizon no problems at all. I kept waiting for something to go wrong or fail with the phone but it didn't. 5
The battery not too good after use 2 hours it's low we have to plug in most of the time when we at home 2
no charger no headphone i though its a package with accessories so cant use it immediately and lcd have already 2lines on lcd 3
It's nice for a basic smartphone, but nothing fancy. 4
phone was locked - cannot use 1
When the phone arrived, I was unable to use it, due to the phone not holding a charge. Also, the screen sometimes fades and goes blank. This is very disappointing! 1
It arrived on time, was wrapped well.. And I haven't had a problem it..no scratches or crack.. And was able to use with sprint as said... Thanks 5
The phone glitches which hinders it being unlocked and overall performance. 2
IOS 7 is great. This phone is for my wife and she likes the simplicity and didn't like all the options in Android. The one issue I have with the iPhone in general is not everyone is 21 with sharp eyes and text and some menus are really hard to see. 4
i got a broken batery, it doesn't work. the screen has a pale spot, it looks like the surface is sticked to the inner scree 2
It arrived fast, but had chips and nicks, was disappointed, but works great. 3
Phone works great & arrived really fast! 5
I did not receive my order items. 1
Having so many problems it's only been 7 months! 1
Hard to find the app 2
old android died, found this as a great deal and perfect condition when I received it. Hooked up with my Straight talk service with no problem 5
Over a it's a Great phone and I really like it. Only down side is one of the speakers DON'T work, so just know your taking your chances cause the phones are "refurbished". But for the price (even with only one working speaker) it's still a Great buy. 4
The phone has only worked properly one week. It constantly cuts off and on whether on the charger or not. The phones is now dead. I threw away packaging and good money....need to send back. Horrible! 1
not bad but not as good as q10 3
Its was great. Jist when i got it. I had to have a SIM card. Thank god for my sister. And few minor scufs 4
The phone I received was defective. The home button does not work. It did arrive a day earlier than expected. Phone powers on and all but cannot exit any app. Cannot return to home screen. Phone is useless. I have to power it off then back on again to get to home screen. 1
a significant flaw in boundary, but phone has no problem 4
All was going well until I tried to remove the sim card. It was very difficult than it should be. Maybe I just got a defected product. I'm much better of with this one theirs the BLU Q170T Samba TV Unlocked Dual SIM Quad-Band GSM Phone. 2
The product worked well, but lacking an accessory (the key to the SIM card). 3
Hard to figure out with very little instructions 2
The phone seems to be ok but the battery had to be replaced after less than 6 months 2
I'm really disappointed about my phone and service. The phone went out on me over a week ago. Instead of handling it when issue first surfaced. I've been told to do this and do that. Now I'm stick with no phone and I'm out 55 dollars for service that I'm not using. I still haven't received a mailing label to return item. This was my first purchase on amazon. I'm not rushing to use theirs or smartphones 288 business Anytime soon. I thought I was getting a deal but it seems like I'm the one who lucked out. 1
Finally picked one up after a year of contemplating if I should switch to iOS. Love it so far 4
Amazing! Got an iPhone 5c that looks like a brand new phone! We had one small issue with the charger, but customer service was awesome and got the problem taken care of immediately. They were very nice and beyond helpful. This is the second phone we have gotten and they have both been amazing! Would definitely reccommend this to anybody! 5
I expected the watch to have all the features. Of. An android device. Be. Able to sync all my important apps via bluetooth but it would only sync a few apps. 2
Its not even 2 months that i have it and it started freezing. The camera is also blurry. 1
It was not locked to Sprint. It had been used on a Metro PCS plan and caused issues at the Sprint store when I was trying to activate. 1
The device is awesome. But why i don't have Blackberry maps in my home folder? I have it when i search for it. When i use it, its not working. I downloaded Google maps as well and that is not working either. Its connectivity to WiFi networks is slow and the GPS is not properly working I use H2O wireless carrier whit n plan. U think that is it? I think if i get one of those T-mobile or AT&T monthly data plans it can work but still, this bugs me alot. 4
I bought this phone back in October 2015 and added a Protection Plan. Now only 7 mos. later the Home button is not working properly. I called the protection plan service provider to submit a repair/replacement claim and they referred me to Apple. Apple said the Limited Warranty expired and referred me back to the service provider. Well, it seems no one is willing to make good on this purchase. I totally understand this is an older phone model, but that's why I purchased a protection plan, now I'm out $274.95 for a bad phone. 1
Shipping was a bit slow but overall the product is excellent! Glad that I didn't believe what others were saying about this phone (buggy and such). If you own an iphone 4, and what to switch, go ahead because this is totally worth the dough! 4
good afternoon I received the phone is locked does not recognize the card without my line is movistar sim trajeta says that is not compatible 3
This phone is OK but the speaker and ring tone are not loud enough. I always miss my callsI don't recommend to others to buy this phone 2
don't understand the process for sending back the phone so I will not be sending it back, I will just call it a lost. 2
I got this phone because I travel often and am looking forward to using it. So far it has been functional with T-mobile network.I had to purchase the phone twice because the first one I got did not turn on. The battery would say it's charging but never charge and the power button did not work. So I sent that one back and got the exact same phone.The second one I have turns on and everything works except the volume control buttons on the side. However, seeing as I am travelling soon I will probably not get it replaced.I am assuming the problem is with the dealership not with the phone themselves. They need to do a quality check to make sure the phone is functional before they ship it out. 2
The only complaint I have is the keyboard is kinda hard to text on, and the case it came with was flimsy. The rest is good, decent camera for a phone, good service, long battery life if you keep the brightness down. Pretty durable and stylish. 4
I have some trouble with a independent seller and the order was canceled but after the reorder through amazon direct handling everything was ok.... 3
The phone is in great condition. no scratches , no acting funny , just the cord charger that came with the phone wont charge it. The box works just not the cord. I'm not happy with the charger not working but overall its been good ! 3
This is a great phone with a great price. The phone had virtually no scratches. It works well with my T-Mobile sim card. The phone was already updated to iOS 6 when I received it, so I only had to insert my sim to use it. 5
it was a refurbished phone, it's unlocked and works OK. i wish they could be more clear and say the phone is refurbished. 3
Purchased this phone for a Christmas present. The phone arrived as promised, unopened, and has worked perfect since my daughter started using it. 5
It was a good product for fair price. I just did not like the Display. Even though the resolution numbers are high, somehow the display was not thrilling. Still a good product. Other than display quality, all the features were working fine. 3
Delivered in time and phone condition was as described. 5
Phone is in perfect condition, it's a little slow but probably only because it's a later version of iPhone 4
Just what was advertised. Would buy from what again. Phone looks brand new 5
It came faulty, scratches and with the screen a little loose. I bought in my trip to Usa, so now is impossible to ask for a refund. Avoid this "refurbished" stuff! 2
This phone is garbage. I've had it for less than three months and it's always having problems. Constantly freezing, kicking me out of apps, and dying way above 0% (yesterday it was at 43% when it decided to die).I had such high hopes for this seller and was very disappointed. 1
I would give zero stars they sent me 3 phones n all 3 phone didn't work n they even told merge phones r expired n the batteries dead so y do u take our. 400$ rip off 1
Good phone, but it is locked to TMobile network and I had couple problems with them, their service is not the greatest. 4
Great product, the phone was in great shape and has had no problems so far. No scratches or anything, looked almost new to me. 5
I expected to receive the key thingy to open the phone and insert my Sim card. Now I have to look it in order to make it work with my cell plan. 5
Phone works great had it for over year now would buy from them again 5
I was cautious about ordering a phone from a second party like this, but I was very pleasantly surprised at the service and the quality of the phone. The phone is very nice. There are no scratches anywhere. It works perfectly. I was also contacted by the company about a week after I received the phone just to be sure that it was received fine. They were very professional. I have recommended them to my friends. 4
goodnight you have black iphone accessories ? 3
the phone works fine looks good btw it works for metro pcs but i updated now it saying to enter a pass word that i do not have 3
good looks, functional and sturdy, except I was hoping the qwerty keyboard would be bigger, and the window screen is a bit small, plus there isn't a text app built in that anticipates and spell checks your texting. 3
I'm no techie or heavy user, so this has worked well for my needs. SD card reader has gone out, so I'm not as happy as I'd like to be. Manufacturer says to do a factory reset to try to restore functionality before shipping it back while under warranty. I'll have to find some time to be willing to lose everything and try that before the warranty is up. 3
its kind of big when we talk about iPhone the size is very big but the phone is ow some.. 3
i got my phone today in the mail and it wont turn on, i have no information to return it to you guys! i need a reply now! 1
Received the phone and the battery would not hold a charge and the charging port doesn't work !!!!!! 1
The iphone is the same that the seller discribe. Is new, and work perfect.I recomend this product for all people who wants to have an iphone and don't want to pay to much por a cel phone. 5
I was accused by my grandkids of buying a "dinosaur phone", but all I wanted was a phone that I could make calls and texts on, and was told that it could handle that no problem. Well it won't ! When I pull up in my drive it shuts down, and the guy at my carrier (T-Mobile) says it is because it isn't a T-Mobile phone. I haven't figured out what the problem is yet, but I am working on it. So far the phone has been a total disappointment. If I can get the problem solved I might learn to love the phone, but you can't be pleased with something that doesn't work. 1
Product met expectations to the T 4
Perfect condition, very reliable, great phone just 100% 5
After three weeks of having the phone. The screen came off the phone. 1
Camera & memory is very limited need to add memory card to get the best use of this phone 2
It's OK but it could be better 2
The camera didn't function well. Camera flip didn't work at all. 3
Great phone. Sadly its not 4G. And doesnt work as well yet has great features. 3
It was horrible.. The phone was stolen!!!! It was already active in someonelse's account.. NEED I SAY MORE!!! 1
Disappointed of the fact that phone is not equipped with replaceable battery and there is not available space for memory chip. 3
the phone doesn't work , no charger no nothing 1
It is good. Only the speakers. The volume of audio is not much as expected 4
Was not actually UNLOCKED. It was Verizon. 3
Battery was dead (like in need of replacement) when I received it. 1
DIf not come with the sim or a charger 1
The phone was delivered in apparently good condition. We took it to TMobile, where they activated it with only minor problems. However, the phone was only able to charge once and then never a second time. We tried multiple charging cables with no success. We also could not get the phone to accept entry of its phone number. Based on the charging issues, we gave up and returned it. Very disappointing and I will not try this approach again. 1
Great I believe it was new 4
Phone works great. In better condition than what I imagined! 5
So far so good, we've had this a month with no issues. Had a hard time locating a good IPhone 5s in this price range, and it's in great shape. 4
It was advertised as a Verizon phone but in reality it was a sprint phone. Completely useless to me considering my provider is Verizon. 1
The truth is, they are both fabulous pieces of equipment that we are all very lucky to have in our lives. I actually remember having a 4 digit phone number and 5 people sharing the same line!! But, for reasons subtle which I am not even totally conscious of, I love my iPhone and I didn't love my Android. 5
the Iphone 4 .. its unlocked and clear.. it just had a imvisible scracth in the back but it is 99% REAL GOOD!!.. works really well and i love it!!.. 5
Buenos díasEl producto llego en excelentes condiciones y el proceso de compra fue rapido y muy efectivo. muy buena compra les recomiendo este proveedor para sus futuras compras 4
I've had this phone since August 2014 and I've had zero problems with it. I feel bad for those that did have problems with it getting shut off. Maybe it's cause I bought it for 500$ not long after it came out. 5
It's a very nice phone. I bought it thinking it would have Android 6.0 OS by now. All the reviews I read said BLU told them that the upgrade would be in Q2. It's well worth $200 though.The WiFi stopped working when Bluetooth was enabled, it's being repaired as I write this. 3
You may run into issues with AT&t: Big brother does not like IMEI numbers it does not have in its database. Unless I am wrong and the phone is broken ( screen becomes unresponsive when you put SIM in ) AT&T may be blocking this phone on their network. Its a disappointment. We had this gadget for our kiddo from another vendor for over a year and it worked fine. 2
works ok........over time u just have to upgrade. 3
After 5 full discharge and 5 full charge, I get just over 48 hours of stand-by time of battery life. According to the specifications I found on line, the stand-by time should be closer to 200 hours. This is the last time I purchase any refurbished product. 1
The phone has too many nicks on the case for a new item. 3
I both that phone and it last 3 weeks it just stop work not good plz don't buy phone from there no good 1
I'm extremely satisfied with this purchase . It came in the box brand new and perfect! I bought another one for a friend. 5
I sent back the iPHONE 4 one month ago because it does not respond when you push the bottom button to cancel or go back some of the time. I haven't received refund yet. What's going on? Please issue refund as soon as possible. Thank you. 1
It's just what I needed,good phone 3
Before being an Iphone Junkie, this phone was perfect for me. It's durable and good in all aspects. The only thing is the same thing that all bb has: software is very unstable. But when you buy one, you know it. 3
Battery was a little crazy but good for the most part 4
Great phone, works perfectly. The lightning cable and the charger didn't work well though. 4
So great that I thought it was brand new. Great working phone 5
No scratchesBattery life is good 4
Just got my phone and it already running hot, I haven't over charge it or nothing! Other than that it's ok 3
It's ok but it freezes up from time to time. 4
Was nervous about getting a refurbished phone but everything works perfectly fine. Charger had minor problems connecting. 4
Excellent. It is like new. I am happy!!! 5
My husband purchased it. HIs comments are: OK so everyone is entitled to one mistake. This was mine. Should have read the reviews more closely. The wrist strap is way to small. The instruction manual is less than useless. Can't get the ring tone volume to increase. Unless you are tech savvy I would not buy it. Gave it one extra star because the mp3 player worked. ( Had to buy Bluetooth head phones and keep the watch in my pocket.) 2
This is great for a budget phone. Gorgeous display. If you are on the fence about this phone, just go ahead and get it. Can't go wrong for 250 bucks. 5
Yes the iPhone was in better condition than described. And battery life and call quality is better then my Samsung s6 edge. 5
Love it, my iPhone 5 never stayed charged and the 6 holds a charge all day. 5
Phone does not hold a charge very long 1
I wanted this phone because it was new in the box and unlocked. 5
This is a great phone for those of us who want a VERY nice, large screen, excellent battery life and don't need the fastest phone on the market. Yeah, it's slower than the Sammie S6 I got from work, but it isn't a long, painful wait for it to complete a task, just a slight hesitation. Unless you are a serious power user I doubt you'll have a problem with performance. The battery life is better than the S6. And it works as well as the Samsung as an actual phone (yes, I actually make calls on my phone... I'm old).The rear camera is fine... far better than my photography, that's for sure. I don't do selfies, so I don't know how well the front camera works (as indicated above, I'm old).The sound is MUCH better than the Samsung, both from the speaker and headphones, and the music program is easy to use and plays FLAC files.It is light enough that even with an armored case it isn't too heavy, and I quickly got used to the size. It is easier to carry on my belt, but it fits in my pocket. The S6 seems too small to me now, and I will almost certainly get another 5.5" phone next time..I would have no hesitation buying another Alcatel phone when this one is ready to retire in another year or two. Or maybe three if it keeps working, since it certainly is meeting my phone, e-mail, snapshot and web surfing needs very well. 5
Phone is a bit more quirky than I'd hoped, touchscreen seems to lose letters and motions here and there, but I think that's just iOS8 being weird, hopefully it'll get better with the next update. 4
Less than a year, USB port already defective. Good phone otherwise. 2
The speaker isn't loud enough calls are very low and music is very low 3
Ordered this IPhone 5c as a gift. Out of the box it was locked with a Indiana phone number. I brought it to an Apple Store, where they found the phone defective. Luckily they gave me a brand new phone without a hassle. 2
I got this to give as gift. It looks good for the price but feels cheapish. Well, for this price you can get something else also and a better name brand. It worked for few months and is slow now. The screen broke one day. I do not know how. 3
Makes a call and the screen goes blank and cant hang up on them. 2
I bought one but it has a defect on the cover , the line around on phone is not straight , I have a picture but don't know how to show . That is only one I have a little bit I dislike but everything good . 3
i bought this product and i choose the option ''new'' now it results its refubrished. it doesnt have warranty anymore, i bought it 4 months ago. What can i do if a need the warranty now. i need an answer 1
I would have given this phone 5 stars if I was able to use it with Cricket Wireless. Apparently, they didn't know what they were doing because I took it to T-Mobile and within 5 minutes of walking through their doors, they were able to get it to work. I wound up switching to T-Mobile and getting a different phone that I fell in love with, the Samsung S6 Edge+. Long story short, I couldn't get my money back because it didn't meet the warranty requirements. 3
Battery life was pretty bad. Would go from 30+% to a completely dead battery in a few minuets. 2
I love the size and speed of the phone, but the volume is extremely low when turned up as high as it will go. I have also had issues with the sensitivity of the screen and the gravity sensor doesn't work. The GPS also acts like it isn't on when it is. 3
When I received this phone it was already activated to another persons name so I can not put in on my account as I wanted to. I either want the phone deactivated or my money back I am very unsatisfied with this product. I have went to three sprint stores and they have all said the same thing to me in such this phone is most likely stolen, if so I want my money back as soon as possible. 1
It did, it works perfectly fine with everything include. 4
Love the phone, recieved it a day early and everything was fine except the fact that the charging cord was removed from the packaging, but everything else was in the packaging and works just fine. 4
This phone is in great condition! It looks like it is new!! Beyond what I expected! 5
It was good for 3 months . i sent about 100 try to fix the problem ,but it never come on . 2
The phone was in better shape than advertised. 4
I waited for so long to upgrade my BB Torch. But sadly, this was just too big for me to operate with 1 hand :(Also, i was disappointed that the apps market didn't improve as i had expected with the addition of Amazon apps. No Google Voice, Hulu or Netflix etc. 3
it didn't even have the SIM card and it was scratched from the corners 1
Although the sticker says "Verizon" I was able to take this to the AT&T Store and have it set up under my current plan. My one complaint is there is a pink shadow on the screen, that looks like pixel damage. I think this is a case of you get what you pay for. If you want a perfect phone, this might not be the seller for you, but so far it works as expected. 3
Phone came with screen popped out, but still working, and a scratch on the back. A day later, the phone screen was completely popped out. Sending it back as soon as possible. 1
The phone was claimed to be new but it was not & it had problems! 3
Worked fine for about two and a half months and then it stopped working. I contacted T-Mobile and they informed me that the previous owner had not paid their bill and the phone is now shut off and reported stolen. This is fraud!!! 1
My phone don't even work half the time 1
I bought iphone5s in 2014. but yesterday my earphone was bad.I went to the Apple Store to repair earphone.They told me the earphone is not original earphone.I find I can not find any word in the earphone about Assembled in China.I think you sell me fake accessories！！！I think this is a very serious problem. 1
Apple iPhone 5 16GB - Desbloqueado - Negro (reacondicionado certificado)Vendido por: RAZAThis iphone not come completely miss your accessory like taco, only wine I need cable and check it as such in its operation 1
Ideal phone for kids but not the best for adults who are looking for more advance stuff to do with their phones, if that's not the case then its perfect. However, it is good for basic games and other basic usage that a phone offers. 4
The phone have a problem with the earphone to listen to people when you call. 3
Phone is in good condition. Small scratches on the back in the form of someone's a initials. Which is hilarious to me. Doesn't come with phone charger or head phones. 4
I purchased this product a few months ago and from the very beginning it was an awful phone. I would charge the phone to its full capacity which was 81% according to the phone, it would only last me about 5 hours if that without me even using it. as the weeks went on it only got worse and worse. The IPhone would die on 50% and not turn back on until i connected it to a charger, after i plugged it in it would go back to 50 % charged. to this day it continues to not hold a charge 1
It glitches really bad when on the charger. And it just recently started glitching even when not on the charger. 3
I've had this phone for just over 6 months now.First, my first one flat out died around Christmas. I woke up and it was just dead, not even a response to power.I sent it to ASUS and they sent me a replacement since it could not be repaired. Process took 3 weeks; kinda long to go without a new phone in hand.PROS- Phone is typically speedy- Plenty of storage with a 64GB microSD card- Phone looks great- Battery lasts over a day for my typical usage. Fast charger works great- First Android phone I haven't felt the need to root- Pictures are crisp and colorfulCONS- Sometimes it takes several minutes after booting for the phone to recognize the apps installed on the external SD card- Crashes are fairly frequent when navigating and streaming music at the same time- First phone died, support was slow for a device you need everyday- Cell reception can vary, usually decent, newer updates have been helping- Some apps fail to load or crash the system frequently, could be due to the Intel processor translating apps made for ARM?- Used to have a case with the cutout, but the ASUS Cover app used a lot of battery- Bloat apps can't be uninstalled, just disabled without root.OverallGreat phone for the price but has a few issues. ASUS trickles out updates slowly. Expected the marshmallow update by now.Case: ASUS Cell Phone Case for Zenfone2 - Retail Packaging - Black/BlackScreen Protector: ASUS ZenFone 2 Screen Protector, iVoler® [2 Pack] ASUS ZenFone 2 Tempered Glass Screen Protector, 0.2mm Slim 2.5D 9H Hardness Featuring Anti-Scratch, Anti-Fingerprint, Bubble Free, Lifetime Warranty 3
Phone doesn't have much storage & has lots of popups. 2
got just like they said and im happy with it however it was missing the on/off switch cover and I had to have that repaired but my otter box cover is the only thing that keeps it in place- phone looks and works fine but I was a tad disappointed with the missing part 4
Is great phone love it 5
is ok, but sometimes is hard because the touch is so sensitive.also the pictures are really bad quality. 3
It is good for me 4
Great phone for the price. 4
Very good item thanks amazon, your are wonderful 5
My son is using it w ATT and it is great 5
Wrote review with phone it's cool:) 5
Need a battery for the phone 3
As much as I expected it to be - works well for me. 4
The phone was the correct color and in perfect condition. I had to return it because after taking it to multiple carriers...TMobile, Verizon, and Sprint no one would support it on their network. Evidently unlocked 4s's have this issue. 3
Ha! I can use it in China! However, I should use iPhone 7 carefully! Chinese Apple Store never help me to repair my iPhone 7 from America . 4
Very inferior camera and came with a bubble in the screen. It had to be returned. 2
I was impressed with the condition of the phone. It didn't even look like it was ever used. My daughter was very happy with the phone. Thank you. 5
I was excited about buying this phone because of the network compatibility, camera resolution, processor speed, and the internal memory.. I am extremely dissapointed with 3/4 of these specs.As you will see in the picture below, this was the best of 5 pictures that I could take at night, I was trying to photograph my truck, mind you I was not moving. The specs description says it is a 13 MP, not even close. It resembles a 3.0 - 3.2 MP Camera. Also, when recording, it says it is 720 P, not a chance, not even 480. The system offers you 13 MEGABYTE size pictures, but they are all the same. You have to have a very very steady hand in very good lighting for it to even look mediocre (still pixelated).The internal memory is shown to be 8MB, but in reality it is around 6. I just recently bought it, and have taken around 40 pictures, and installed 6 apps, now I cannot take more pictures without adding an external SD card. I am posting a screenshot of what it says, this would be fine, but it says that I have almost filled up capacity with audio (4.04 GB), and I only have ONE 7 MB song on it.Very disappointing. 2
The screen was replaced already and it cracked way too easy. But other than that I really enjoy having it and it is better than any other phone that I've had. 5
This phone has nice features, but does not have the storage space it claims. There is only 2.34 GB Total phone storage space that shows up on my phone which is eaten up primarily with pre-loaded items that state your phone may have issues if you delete them. These pre-loaded items are unable to be moved to my SD card. So unfortunately I had to uninstall any updates to free up space to keep my phone working. 2
satisfied might purchase gift again 5
It over heats pretty quick, I have to often restart it for my data to work and freezes a lot. 2
The phone was in great shape, had no problem getting service plan 4
not the colour as seen online, but it is working well. 4
Battery won't hold charge otherwise good phone 4
Thw phone is not unlocked. I can't use in Venezuela. The description isn't true. Is a fraud. 1
Wonderful phone, came as described. 5
Everything works great but the screen feels just a little plastic and not good on my fingers but overall it's great for the price 4
I have never used or seen anything better than Iphone and iphone5, 5S of course. Simple, light, very fast and clever,colourful monitor..... no comments more - just super!And enduring.I was in horrible accident last year I mean fire in a contryside house. I left my new (only 3 months using) divice at a sill in the house...After 4 hours the fire was blown down I found my Iphone in black dust at the burnt sill in addition too it was a bit wet and hot. Toy plastic helicopter stayed next to the iphone turned to knot of molten mass.I was going to throw out my divice but soon changed up my mind to delay it till the next morning.When I took off melted bumper and screen protect I switched on it. The iphone showed sings of its life. First I sow a picture what iphone made about warning of high temperature.Testing all functions of my divice I found out it works! I was so happy that I can't discribe, you may guess... Nevertheless there were some problems.First damage was microphone (my opponent didn't hear my voice)and the second - small spot yellow color at the right top side of display.At the service centre micropfon was succesfully replaced. To change display for the new one I'm not going because the yellow spot is not too critically for me. 5
Volume down button was broken upon arrival and that was not specified when I purchased the phone. 1
Very happy with the performance. The apps worked flawlessly, camera could be better but no complaints considering it is only $50. 4
The headphones connection doesn't work. I try with different headphones and it's all the same. Only work one side headphone. The problem is in the phone headphone plug in 3
Wired less earphones came broken to my home and no refund at all I try but for my husband bday I was so upset I give and he opened its was broke!!! 3
DID not work well with My T- Mobile service.. had spotty service if At all... and constantly locked up thinking about the next process...I returned within 30 Days of Reciept, after having tried to work with it and finally gave up... 3
The phone is lighting fast however it only allows you to change language settings to English and Chinese it wasn't routed in Goole play store it has a lenovo store that is in Chinese. Won't buy again. Amazon try to help but wasn't any help to me. 1
This phone so far has been a good mix between value, design and performance. I can only hope that Alcatel continues building a budget/ performance friendly phone for the Android OS. 4
I bought this for my wife's grandmother (88) who mcuh preferred to use a simple flip phone over a touch screen. Though, this is a disappointing experience as the ring tone is very very low even at the highest volume setting. Another aspect I dont like is the phone is nog that responsive. Im in my 30s with perfect hearing and this has very low volume for eing tone - imagine it being use for an 88 yrs old 3
This is our third Android phone in about a year. This replaced a Blu Studio C that my wife had that stopped working. She never liked that phone, it replaced her iPhone 4GS. This model, the X LTE is much better than the Studio C and my Kata i3s IMO. Newest Version of android software, 5.1 and the build quality is just amazing at this price point. It's a very solid phone. She's had no problems with either reliability, software or reception. The battery life is just incredible. Also my wife is very hard on her phone, yesterday she accidentally dropped it right in front me from a height of about 4 feet, very hard landing, and it came out of that working fine. I actually think I'm going to replace my phone with this model. Excellent for the money. Comes with a hardback case and a screen protector. However my wife wanted the leather cover that has the magnetic tab on it seen in the accessories and that seems to be protecting it OK. Note, this is a GSM phone, so works with ATT, etc.UPDATE Its been a month and some of the initial luster is gone. My wife has had some problems with dropped calls, apps stop working, have to turn the phone off to end the call. This will be our last Blu phone.2nd UPDATE The new Moto 4g that just shipped blows this away. The Amazon ads and offer version of that phone is not much more than this phone and competes with flagship phones in performance. I wish it was available back when we bought this phone. The Moto 4g has twice the RAM, a much better processor, Marshmallow OS, 1080p, full 4G LTE compatibility and works with ALL U.S. Carriers. 3
There have been a few quirks now and again but a solid tool, especially for those of us who are curious about a lot of things and need to be looking things up. 4
looked brand new; had to get a sim card from my carrier and i was good to go! 5
great starter phone for an 11 year old. 4
Its working just fine i rate it a 5 star.... My daughter is very happy and Pleased with it.... 5
The best phone I've ever owned. 5
My friend loves it. But had a little defect! Good thing I knew how to fix phones so problem solved. 4
It doesn't sink to my phone. 2
Speaker sound from phone when making a call is not good 2
battery drained too fast everytime, had to return it. 2
Needed a simple phone for my mom. This phone fits the bill. Great price.it's not a touch screen phone, but that's fine. 5
thanks for the phone. I recommend people buying products from you in the feature your once again thanks for the phone 5
Incredibly poor build quality, in my limited experience. The first phone I received had a failed LCD panel when I took it out of the box (box and packaging had no visible damage). The second one's LCD panel is seperating from the phone's casing and I've been very gentle with it for the few months I've had it. Given this 0/2 track record so far as the two I've received, I can't recommend this phone, especially since purchasing the international version (this version) via Amazon means you won't have a manufacturer warranty for any defects or repairs.The phone also performs more poorly than the Moto G 3rd Gen (same price range, but better build quality) on the original firmware, the newest official firmware, and several of the third party firmwares I've tried (CM, BlissPop, RR, and others). 1
Everything I expected. No complaints. Even arrived days before I expected. 5
Didn't know that had to get a whole new number for the watch instead of using the number already have 2
I bought The iphone unlocked and it has a Verizon chip. 1
Pretty good but the operating instructions are weak. 3
It worked for a week 1
just amazing unlocked from factory im realy happy with my iphone 5 nothing like this thinking in order more from this company. 5
it is good. no problems so far, it isnt slow and i got it set up nice and easily. good stuff 4
Phone had some issues upon arrival such as lacking some sensibility to touch making it more difficult to use, managed to crack slightly from simply holding the phone making it even harder to use - wonder if phone was damaged prior 2
LMAO...still going strong. Going back to the Galaxy tho 5
It came on time just wouldnt work whit my sims 2
The phone has issues with the text part it deletes texts after a bit and won't put up notifications when I do get texts its a big pos sorry I bought I don't recommend buying anything from the seller 1
I dislike the product. For the reason that i cannot activated with Verizon. I even called Verizon and they don't know how to activate it. At this point, i wasted my money for a phone i can't use. 1
Got a silver one instead of gold . It had one visible scratch and two minor scratches in it . Honestly disappointed 2
Phone looked great when it arrived, but when we went to activate it at the Verizon store, they said it couldn't connect to anything cellular. Completely defective, need to return now. 1
"The phone arrived without key Blackberry software loaded and the touch pad appears to be indented. I've attempted to contact CL using ref. no in the heading - they've replied to send them the order number.... it's a holiday weekend. Stay tuned."The BB World programming software was not loaded and does not appear to be downloadable according to my carrier. The touch pad is depressed below the top of the cover, making it less effective to use - could be a defective phone - working with the folks at Cell Lounge to exchange - for a fully functional model I hope. UPDATE - Cell Lounge called me and is arranging to have phone exchanged for replacement. New phone arrived over night service at no extra cost to me. The physical condition of this phone appears good - touch pad is not defective on this one - and even though I still had to find a way to download the BB World app, (apparently on universal type phones such as these available aftermarket), it's possible not to have them all loaded. T Mobile was able to connect me with a BB specialist who was able to walk me through the process so I could get it on the phone and synced to my table. yay! Thank you Cynthia for your kind help and excellent follow up! 4
When I received this phone, which it took about a month. I got the phone I was excited for how big it is, but after waiting so long to get the phone I couldn't even use it without a sim card. Finally got the sim and found out that the internet doesn't work, which means the google play store doesn't work, which means I cant do anything with this phone but call and text. This sucks because im into apps and the internet. Am I the only one who had this problem????? 2
Mobile phone appearance at a line still, there is a slight scratches, can accept, but found that the battery is charging when use more than 300 times, for it is not satisfied 2
The glass screen started to rise and come off from the cell phone in less than 1 month, and finally where it looked like it was glued on, completely just want to pop off. I do have an otter box for it, and I would notice the screen wanting to keep coming off when I took it out of its case. Everything else worked fine, but ere I am buying another cell phone 4/5 months later because now since the glass is lifted off, I can no longer use it because it doesn't detect touch commands and the screen is just plain black. 3
I bought this cell as a little birthday gift for my friend- he likes it! and it is not expensive, right? 4
Love my new phone-It help ler 5
The phone works but we find ourselves having to shut it off and turn it back on more than normal. 4
Well you definitely get what you pay for. Freezes constantly. Feels well built, but with the lagging issue, I should have paid more for a better phone. 2 stars instead of 1 just because of the price. Other than that, unless you're desperate for a smart phone, look elsewhere. It takes so much will just to not throw this phone against the wall. I think it just took me twice as long to type out this review than it would have on my old Samsung. I feel like I need a cigarette and I don't even smoke! 2
I'm sending it back only having it a few days. Reason why is that the battery sucks on this phone. If it was not for the battery it would have been a good phone. The battery runs down so gas and I have to charge it a few times a day and it takes forever to charge as well. So that's why I'm sending it back. 2
This is a awesome Case , Got this for my Sister -n-law for Christmas, Its looks better in person, than it did when I ordered it ! 5
Love this phone, everyone who sees it oohs and aahs. When they see see "BLU" on the back of the phone they are thoroughly confused. I am one of the early converts to cutting cords and contracts for cable and phone and anything else. This phone is high high quality and the price is not cheap, it is simply how much a phone is supposed to cost. Especially when you know technology changes and you will scratch your tech itch in another 2 years. Their phones come with everything you need including a screen protector and a phone cover that will not hide the cool sealed metal handset. The fingerprint recognition is much better than my Samsung Galaxy ever was. It's not buggy, takes good pictures, smoothly plays videos, call volume and call quality is excellent. Thanks to Google seamless transition of apps and contacts.Cons- That being said I have played with it for a month and there are 3 issues. I have downloaded security software to monitor my web activity. When I set this as a default action in settings (hard to locate too) the system will ignore what I have done and turn off my changes. 2nd issue I use cast at times to show websites on my TV through Roku. This option at times simply does not work. This being said the cause could be because it uses Android 6.0 Marshmallow as an operating system. While other providers have updated patches, BLU has not. I have no idea if my phone will even contemplate upgrading to 7.0 Nougat. The lack of updates could be a major no go for some consumers. Also I hate the ugly finger shaped emoji and wish I didn't have to download an ad riddled app for more choices. 3
Arrived super quick & works perfectly fine 5
I purchased this phone 2/28/16, it was perfect. As I travel I wanted an unlocked phone that I could use in the places I visit. The first few weeks the phone was terrific, transferring info from my Samsung galaxy was a breeze, the setup was straight forward and a no brainier. After the third week or so I noticed the phone would restart when plugged into charge then an update came to my phone and the restarting on charging stopped. However, since that time quite a few other anomalies have showed up. The phone now restarts sporadically, in the middle of calls and just about anytime. Then, even when not using the phone it would start emitting a very shrill loud sound which can not be stopped until it shuts itself down.I will be returning this phone, and will try the US model, if that does not work any better I wont be purchasing any more ASUS phones. 2
Worst thing ever..... Ordered the home thinking I was gonna be able to use it.... And turns out it was for the wrong carrier as described in the ad. I was very upset... This is the first time something like this has ever happened. 1
A fabulous phone- great value 5
A+++ very good product and it works great! 5
Nice phone for someone that has a hard time seeing the dial pad. 1 problem I couldn't get service for this phone will not accept the sim card.This phone was a paper weight. I traded it in for a phone that does work. 3
My hubby is an old dinosaur who didn't want to give up his Blackberry, my sons and I purchased the refurbished iPhone 4 and now he's in love with the phone which arrived promptly and in excellent condition. 5
I got this phone in May as a backup phone and it runs as you'd expect for $30 price. You need a micro SD, which is nice it has one, but if you take it out and forget, you're screwed. The Play Store is too slow to actually work, I downloaded about 5-10 apps and it stopped working. It will attempt to download apps for 15 minutes and then say it had an error. I'm on a very powerful WiFi network, so this should not be happening. The web browser works, it's very slow, but my main phone is an s7 so it probably would run fast for the targeted audience. The screen is washed out, but I say as long as you can see the screen (which you can) it shouldn't make you buy a different phone. I'm not saying you should get the phone, considering it tried to die on day two from memory errors. It took about 10 minutes until it'd stop giving me warnings and actually let me delete apps.The cameras are okay, but they're better than what I expected for $30. The pictures are way too sharpened and the colors are a bit off. Every pic of the sky has made it a light purple.The texting app is total garbage. Every message comes in individually, just like a flip phone. Pretty sad for an android device.Don't get the phone if you're able to save up a little extra money, for only $80 the Galaxy Core Prime is a much better deal.My video review is here> [...]Overall the phone is slow and confusing, not really a good mixture. 3
This phone would not turn on and will not charge. Unfortunately I didn't open it until after 30 days and have no recourse. I am very disappointed. 1
ITs ok for the price 2
This phone came with a malfunctioning battery that was $80 to replace because the phone was purchased over 3 years ago. The seller clearly knew about the issue and decided to pawn off the problem to an innocent buyer. The camera also failed the diagnostics test--another problem that was not made apparent until after purchase. It is ridiculous to not be notified of this upon purchase. I looked through several other phones and decided this one was the best choice because i was not made aware by the seller that the phone was not able to function. I am extremely frustrated with the results and hope that no one else has to experience this ridiculousness. 1
Phone is in great condition other than the proximity sensor not working. 3
Phone worked perfectly with minimal scratches. Very Satisfied. 4
Received on time and is great. 5
I was so hesitiant to buy an iphon after reading all the reviews but i made the leap and did it anyway. and i am beyond satisfied. this phone is perfect. best buy i have made 5
cheap. awful quality for pictures. basically doesn't take pictures. Is perfect for a kid. 2
Hi so I ordered this phone and after arriving 2 days late, I plugged it in and everything seems normal until the charger it comes with begins to melt. Weird. I plug it into a new charger and no melting, but I do notice that it takes 5 hours to completely charge the phone from 0%, and the phone doesn't even hold a charge! I leave my home at 7:35 every morning to catch a bus and go to school. By 2:15 and using my phone only for music and maybe a few phone calls, the phone is dead again. I emailed the company and tried to fix the situation but they straight up ignored me. Terrible company, terrible product. I wish I ciuld give 0 stars. 1
Likes-Cheap!-Bright color choices-Lightweight-Good specs for price-Zippy out-of-the-box (...but not for long, read on in "dislikes")-Reputable company/manufacturer-Battery life is EXCELLENT-Battery charges fast-FABULOUS backup phone for those little "oopsies" and "the baby stole my phone" instancesDislikes-Preinstalled screen protector lessens capacitive touchscreen sensitivity (just like on my BLU WIN HD LTE)-Sluggish, laggy with minimal non-stock apps (<5) installed (Google Keep, Mint, Inbox by Google, Google Rewards, Hangouts)-Wallpaper/lock screen issue - 1.) If set to just a slide lock the phone will unlock when you slide your finger across the screen but will glitch and immediately lock again. Only way to unlock is if I swipe up from bottom of lock screen to open up Google. 2.) If I change the wallpaper to anything but the one that was preset out-of-the-box AND swipe-to-unlock is the lock screen setting then the lock screen issue somehow reverts the wallpaper change back to the preset out-of-the-box wallpaper (obviously wallpaper glitches aren't a deal breaker but the lock screen issue itself is) (May be software issue?)-Camera autofocus issue - Camera will be in focus but when I press the button to take the photo the camera re-focuses and blurs. (May be software issue?)-Screen is way too bright even on lowest setting with auto turned off or on.-Screen produces what looks like to me to be a washed out appearance. I'm comparing it to the iPhone 6+, Nexus 5, LG G4, iPhone 5S.-Screen seems sub-par for color reproduction-Wide lip at the bottom of the phone makes holding it awkward (I have small hands, maybe that's why)-Preinstalled screen protector is a fingerprint MAGNET. I'd rather just peel it off.-System sound issue - When typing the keyboard sounds come out sporadically and at different volumes no matter what volume the sound is set to in the settings menu or the keyboard menu. Software issue?-No Lollipop and no definitive answer as to when the upgrade will be available.-Will not read any microSD card I have installed (8-16-32GB, SanDisk-Lexar-Sony-Samsung-LG-et cetera). Tells me "damaged SD card" or doesn't acknowledge it's in there at all. Computers (Apple + Windows) read all the microSD cards I have tried to install into this phone perfectly.-No response from BLU customer service regarding any of these issues/questions. 3
Ordered the silver one with a white front and was sent the black space grey one I actually was trying to avoid while searching for an iPhone 6. The phone works great though so I can't complain too much, just wish I would've gotten the color I wanted 3
Unfortunately my experience was not entirely positive with the product. It arrived still wrapped in its box and looked beautiful. After I went to the AT& T store got its SIM card and was already to go, I found out that the home button only works occasionally. It is unfortunate for such a high priced item. I still love the Apple products but I am wondering whether buying direct from Apple or AT&T is cheaper and less hassle in the long run 3
Mixed reviews. I bought this phone for myself, set up, transfered my Straighttalk service, everything fine. Went to leave one day and turned mobile data on, and 3 apps I use didn't work, Google play store, Pokemon go and Snapchat. But all others worked, Facebook, banking apps, googling websites.Called Blu, but because those aps worked on wifi, it wasn't phone. Called Straighttalk, wasn't their fault either.So I got a replacement phone, came 2 days later. Set up, transfered service again, same 3 apps did not work.Returned first phone, planned to get a different phone completely, since I had never had trouble with Blu before. I've had 2 other phones of theirs. Day later, mobile data worked for those 3 apps. Then day after that, I restarted my phone, stopped working again.So my husband is on Cricket, and he and I switched phones, my service all works on his old Blu and now he has the Life One X2, and those apps works fine on mobile data on Cricket.So I am completely confused as to what was happening. Maybe when my Straighttalk service ends, I'll purchase this phone again and switch to Cricket, and see if it works for me as well.64gb at $200 is nice, besides the fact that those 3 apps wouldn't work on mobile data for me, the phone is great. 3
Was worried about buying a used phone. I'm very happy with my purchase. Looks and works great! Definitely recommend it! 5
I was conscious of buying a iphone online due too so many people getting ripped off by a broken iphone sent to them or stolen one that can't be activated even. Best advice i can give read the sellers reviews and positive reviews number anywhere between 90 to 98 you should be fine. I have been wanting a iphone for awhile but i don't have 600 to shell out for one. About this iphone it is a 4s it has a sim card slot side it was a unlocked phone which it maybe but said cell phone carrier Verizon. So my best guess it is unlocked and previous owner used them. either way it worked just fine with Straight Talk i could text and send photos. I have a sim card slot but did not have to use it they ask me for some numbers and it worked. The video is ok i would say a lot better then old cellphone. 1080/30p good for taking pics with family friends video. Or a good stand by but by no means should this be used for professional filmography. The buttons are on the left a two volume buttons up and down and button to set the phone to ring on be silent. Theres a home buttom that is round wit a Square graphic the to button right issleep/shut down towards the left is a head phone jack and what seems to be a mic. Wifi works the apps store is great you can download a free magic app or google voice to make free wifi calls. Wifi does work. It runs IOS 9.3 the newest one. Memory 16GB you may want to a little more on a 32 GB. Icloud gives you 5GB free which is not a lot. 5
theres a lot of space to hold music movies and books along with having room for contacts, apps, and pics! 5
JUST A GREAT PHONE- IM SO HAPPY AND SO IS MY PRINCESS 5
When I first received the phone, it was wonderful. Then about after a month the power button started to have issues. The screen would turn on, but would be red in color or only the back-light would turn on.I called support to get an RMA, based on what is posted out there I thought I could get an advance replacement. One support representative said yes, but the other said no.The repair is going to take about 5-7 days, but in the mean time I would have no phone. So I had to spend another $200 to get a Moto G4 as a replacement while this one is sent in.I have purchased unlocked phones on a regular basis, but this has not been one of the best purchases over time. I would stay away from this one, spend a little more money to get the Moto G4 or if you can afford it go with a OnePlus3. 3
I'm so surprised that Amazon SUPORT this kind of seller. This phone is STOLEN!!!! 1
Not at all happy with this product, not geared for adult wrist, too clumsey to really use..cannot navigate around the design to eve really use it. would not recommend..save your money to buy the real thing. 2
Should have been 32GB, A very good purchase in phones. Took me some time to get use to it. The camera quality is a bit off so far Samsung has the best quality in cameras. Other than that in terms of privacy and reliability you bet I got a son of a phone! 4
Great phone! Great service by the seller!! 5
The device was everything I wanted at a very low budget price. I couldn't believe it was real until I actually saw it.. amazing featured too 5
not to bad once you play with it a bit. i got it to use as an mp3 player well working around the house that i wont need head phones for and play via a blue tooth speaker. it wont sync and also i have to get a new bar for the watch band witch came (new today still in box) broken 2
I hate smartphones. Only the need for an unlocked device persuaded me to sup with the devil. I long for a simple flip-phone. OK this phartsmone seems to be very acceptable. Once I figured out how to answer a phone call I was very happy. What I cannot shake is the feeling that all these icon things are sucking my PAYG airtime into a black hole. So I keep it turned off - that defeats the gremlins! Should you buy this phone? I'd say it does the job that you would expect of a more expensive unit and it's worth the money. I transitioned from the USA to South Africa and it's fine. I'm not fond of micro-sims for SA because the USB modems for my laptop take full size sims and I don't want to access the internet from a phone, dammit. I hate it. But you'll like it because you are not old and crotchety like me. 4
My issue was not resolved. I received a lone phone with no charger, box or anything that comes from the factory. 2
Was sold as new, but was used. Box was beat up, parts loose. Phone didn't look new. It works fine but I should have got the used price. Other than that the phone is what it is-middle of the road. What would you expect when current phones sell for 700 and this was 90. Like I said it is what it is. Very good replacement for broken phone. 3
I really liked my blackberry, I received it in perfect condition the only problem I had is that I sent the memory card, do not understand that if a few weeks before I buy, I had bought my mother and came with all its accessories including memory card and the box was a bit large for the size of the package 4
a whole lot more memory then I need but worth it 5
Wasn't what I was looking for. 2
I purchased this product because it was listed as "New". It has worked well, but the battery doesn't seem to hold a charge as well as I thought a new product's battery should. The initial battery charge I made seemed to take almost a full 24 hours, much longer than I thought it would take. I took the phone to the Apple Genius Bar tonight to run a diagnostic on the battery and the result was disappointing. The diagnostic indicated the battery was working properly, it also indicated that it had been connected to a charging device more than 500 times, which the genius bar tech said was not a "new" phone. 3
Received used / like new phone. It was virtually 'new', no scratches in near pristine condition. Came with small carring case and charger. EIN number was clearly labeled. Works great, no problems getting activated or charging. Seller is A+! 5
I must say there customers service is very good and they are doing everything possible to resolve my problem. So as a result i will recommend everyone to shop with Wireovia 4
This phone worked fantastic for about 6 months. Now it's constantly having issues functioning and seems to be progressively getting worse. Little to no updates from the company. Sorry but I definitely won't ever purchase another phone made my this company. 1
Because the body is all score up, I tough that the casing was going to be changed 3
Phone itself is pretty fast. But you get short battery life, leftover images from previous apps and sometimes it gets to be a bit slow when you have multiple apps running in the background. Otherwise it has a pretty loud speaker, fairly bright screen and decent size memory. Definitely better than a Windows phone. So 3 out of 5 stars seems right. Hopefully Lollipop comes out soon for this phone. 3
did not work correctly. Out of 20 times that we tried to swipe to unlock the screen, it only unlocked maybe 2 times. However, we contacted seller and were able to return it. 2
Needs to be updated. Get rid of the things in Chinese. The QR code doesn't do anything. I keep being told to refer to the app, which does nothing except for work with the pedometer. Couldn't figure out for the life of me how to get text messages to show on the phone. The font is so small and hard to read, and I've had Lasik surgery and was wearing reading glasses to try and see it. The instructions are very hard to understand. 2
Phone was in decent physical shape but the battery sucks. When I went to replace it someone had glued the battery in, some the screws were missing to the circuit boards. Now the phone freezes and restarts very often. 1
The phone is really good and in great condition, works properly. 5
Camera stopped working after doing a OTA Update. I contacted Blu, and they replied quickly with RMA instructions. Currently device is in their hands waiting for a response regarding the RMA. Will keep updated. 3
Degraded very quickly. Unusable in a short time. Buy a casio gzone rock instead. Or better yet, a samsung galaxy S5 2
The menu button don't work. 2
I bought a BRAND NEW Iphone 4s 32gb about a week ago, I just received it in the mail a few days ago. I looked at it, looked into the ports (charging ports and head phone port), There was dirt within it, it was all warn down. On the site it said they had new ones they sent me a refurbished phone. My receipt said it was a brand new phone still in the original packaging. I would not recommend ANYONE to buy from this buyer they are scamming everyone selling used phones for the price of a brand new one. 1
Basic use for calls and texting. Works great. 5
Product was great! Could not tell that it was used! Perfect condition with no scratches, scuffs or any marks! Works great and had no issues getting it activated. 5
The phone flash does not work and it's 6 GB instead of 8GB. Other than that, no complains. thank you 3
for the great price it worked and there was no damage when I received it but I already lost it never fails when I buy a apple product. 5
The phone will only take a standard size SIM, you'll need an adapter for a micro or nano sim. Don't buy for it's cameras, you'll be disappointed. Great budget, or back-up, phone for AT&T or T-Mobile customers. 4
I set the phone up with AT&T and the first call I made found that I cannot hear the call, the earphone portion is defective, after all that trouble now I have to return the phone for credit. 1
I bought it on Sep 2014. Less than half a year touch screen failure, unable to return. There are som duct inside and mask the camera after one year 1
This is factory unlock can use any gsm/ sim card 2
I've had it for a couple of months and now it is beginning to freeze at the worst possible time. I've moved all apps to the SD card, and it has a ton of available space and still freezes. Spend a little more money if you can and get the Samsung. 2
This phone was in excellent condition and it was shipped fast. It was the best deal we could find on the older 3G model and I needed one fast because mine bit the dust. 5
Phone was nice for our intended purpose, but after 2 weeks it stopped working. Would not hold charge nor turn on. Seems this is a common problem if you read reviews. Was sold as new, but packaging makes me thing is may have been refurbished. Was not sealed in any manor. 2
You kids might think this phone is clunky...... 3
I received the cell phone really quickly and ive been using it since... its a little sluggish at times but its managable but the one thing that pissed me off about it is that the sound only comes out of one of the speakers and at one time, the sound wasn't even working. literally have to slam the phone on the back then the sound came back on..... 3
I have wanted an iPhone since they came out, but I am with Tmobile and I don't want to leave them. I now have both and I am thrilled! 5
I instantly fell in love with this item and it worked great it was wonderful that it was unlocked because I could get straight talk with it no contract or anything just $45 a month BUT after a couple of months it started to act up. Turns off by itself, Deleted messages just pop back up, closing out of apps on its own & there really is not enough space on this phone.. So pretty much I don't like the item anymore and will be needing a new phone. 3
The phone I got is not unlocked. My SIM card is not accepted, although it works in other cellphones. 1
I am very pleased with my iphone 5C so much when I am able, I am ordering one for my daughter in white! 5
attention !!! a crook !!! 1
It is very slow and is widely paste this phone have never liked the Blackberry just buy it for the pin but not recommended and fees are lots download. 3
This product arrived in 3 weeks after my purchased. I had to return because I was in my country when it wasreceived in Houston. 3
Everything about the purchase was good except the battery. The item was delievred quickly, it came with all the accesories and in good condition. However, there were big issues with the batter. The battery life of the phone was terrible, if I listened to music for a hour or so right after charging the phone I would have to recharge it immediatly....same with intensive texting....and somehimes battery said 50% and it would just shut off receiving a phone call....the cell phone shut off on me so many times that I had to keep it plugged in....which entirely defeats the purpose of having a phone! I would strongly suggest that before you buy a used cell phone you ask the seller about the battery. In the end I returned the phone and they were quick with the refund. I give them one star because everything was good, except the phone!! 1
I enjoyed the phone but it kept freezing up saying this or that service had stopped and the phone had to be rebooted. I had the phone with Straight Talk - ATT sim chip. There is no OTA update (but expected in March `17). Amazon sent a second phone but there was no change. I sent the phone back and Amazon charged a $55 restocking fee. I bought a similar phone from Amazon and now very happy. 4
Bought two for my kids Christmas present. They are going to be so happy. Looks brand new!! 5
I WAS EXCITED ABOUT GOING BACK TO REG TYPING INSTEAD OF TOUCH THAT WAS DRIVING ME NUTS...THE PHONE LOOKS AWESOME KEYS PRETTY ITSY BITS..IF YOUR OVER 40 AND HAVE THE PROBLEM OF NOT BEING ABLE TO SEE ANYMORE...THIS PHONE IS NOT FOR YOU..UNLESS YOU PUT YOUR READERS ON ALL THE TIME..EVERYTHING IS SO TINY..EVERYTHING I TRIED TO DO ON HERE SAYS THIS PHONE NOT COMPATIBLE...WHEN TRIED TO BUY APPS SAYS OWNER DOES NOT ALLOW YOU TO BUY? UMM THE OWNER? THE SPEAKERPHONE WAS GREAT..HAD LOST OS RING TONES AND NICE WALLPAPER SELECTIONS...I LIKED THE PHONE BUT IT JUST WOULDN'T LET ME DO SO MANY THINGS...I TRIED TO DOWNLOAD FACEBOOK WHICH I USE EVERYDAY..AGAIN SAYS PHONE NOT COMPATIBLE :o*( SO I AM RETURNING.... 3
Good phone but the internal memory should be more 3
Every thing was Good ! 4
I equip Completely New and he/she lifts 3g in Venezuela for Digitel and Edge for Movistar and Movilnet, I recommend it for their funcionabilidad and yield of the battery. 3
The Apple Watch is a glimpse into the future of wearable tech. It is however a first generation product and shouldn't be expected to change the world for you at least. It has changed the world however for wearable technology. It has as almost all Apple products do, set the bar for other wearable tech. The watches operating system is good but could use improvement. I find it annoying to not be able to read full things such as emails and news. I do however like the fitness tracking capabilities as well as the health tracking. The watch has capabilities that aren't being used at the current time but the health app says it all. It has capabilities for tracking blood o2 levels as well as a whole comprehensive list of things to do. People are expecting to much for a first generation product but it is amazing and quite useful for everyday use. 4
Slow, closed apps randomly, virtually no memory to store apps etc on. 2
I paid for a new phone and received a refurbished defect some of the phone , but this seller was easy kind Contemplating sending it back and getting a good phone I'm very satisfied.That right I give a 4 star was extra work because I pay delivered. 4
Good phone but when you call someone or get a call you can't talk in the phone. The person on the other line can't hear you. 2
I bought it for a gif to a friend in Venezuela but she told me that the memory is too small so it is almost impossible to download apps as Instagram or Facebook so keep on mind because I think that it is very important to know it . 2
Good phone, minor scratches and dents but works perfect. 4
Love the extra memory. Try as I might I can not fill up the 32GB of memory. 5
The Blackberry 8520 show here, turns to be a Curve and not a Gemini, although this is not really important because the phone as exactly the same features.Now let's try a pros/cons list.Pros:- The phone keyboard is quite good, it takes some time to get use to but is pretty good!- The OS is easy to use and easy to update too.- The phone has many applications, of course, this is not an Iphone (which is good!) and you will not find thousands of applications but still there are quite a few and so far, all of them work really good.- Receiving emails directly to the phone is useful but this is a feature that many other phones already have.- Love the trackpad (I personally hate the trackball, is kinda sucky)Now let's try some consCons:- The camera, is above average and in my opinion, it could be a lot better.- The battery life is kinda short, only like 5-6 hours using ONLY the BlackBerry Msn. Using other applications like the Windows live messenger, ubersocial and facebook can diminish this time roughly to the half and maybe less.- Rebooting times takes forever, sometimes it takes over 7-10 mins!In another matters, the phone arrived at perfect conditions with all it's accessories. It took my sim card without a problem and is working like a charm with my mobile company. 4
I got it for less than 60 bucks. Have had it for like two weeks and I have no complains so far.The Camera could be better (specially the front facing) but is not that bad [I'm not a selfie fan anyway].The system is fluid. It works better than muy old BLU Avance 4 which was kind of slow.Speaker quality is also not the best, but to me not a big deal.I'm happy with it, considering what I paid.'''''''''''''''''''''UPDATE''''''''''''''''''''''''''Well, just after 5 months with this cellphone, it DIED. Not even a year it lasted.I was happy with it.Now it just will not turn on.I plug in the charger and the LED turns on but that's it. 1
Nice phone, as described. Very happy! 5
Looked Great but Was stolen before i got home is there any way todo reportó it. 3
The phone I got is the iphone 7 MN8K2ll/A which is not an unlocked phone but one that is listed as Verizon and locked. The product description said Apple Iphone 7 Unlocked US Version. This is very misleading advertising,UPDATE:Though I have not activated the phone this model recognized the DIgicel SIM and network easily. I upgraded the review to 4 stars 4
It would in the area where I live. 2
I received the phone on time. The phone works really good, but there is a scratch on the back but its not really a big deal for me. I would recommend this phone and the apple outlet store. 100% satisfied on this phone. 4
Good quality. Fast. No problems. 5
im returning this phone to Warehouse Deals, Inc. its so wrong to put up false advertisement. i thought that it was an ATT iphone but its not. be careful 1
Okay for a Temp Phone. Internal Memory/storage sucks. Glad I can use a 64gb micro SD card.Dual sim great!! able to use service phone is completely unlocked and ready to use. 3
the phone is very good, 4,5-inch screen, touch very docile, is very nice, very well built, equipped and bluetooth, Gps, wifi, 3G, 4G Lte android lollipop 5.1, play store, whatsapp, and all applications android, finally very good phone, very low cost 5
Bought the phone thinking it was unlocked. However found out later that it was locked to AT&T. Becomes pretty much useless after that 1
The phone is ok apple could've done better with the ear piece it can be hard to hear the person you're talking to and but the phone being a sim phone the phone signal suck big time. 4
Really good no scratches and sealed, i can only connect it to AT&T & Verizon and some other carriersill update when i get it connected 4
Good product. But it started over heating. Good thing it still has the apple warranty. Will be sending to apple to get a refurbished phone. 3
Very upset did not come with sim card or directions on how to use the phone. Also phone had scratches on it 1
completely satisfied with this product orders arrived the day stipulated ... agree with the request if this provider would advisebut does not work with 3g 4
I purchased 2 of these phones for my kids and after just a few weeks, they are already complaining that the phone freezes. They have to remove the battery and sometimes reset the phone to factory settings to get it to be responsive again. Not sure if it needs some updates or if the hardware is just not good. If anyone else has encountered these issues and has any fixes or work-arounds please let me know. Otherwise I will continue to troubleshoot and see if I am able to come up with a fix. 3
I really like my new iphone. fairly easy to use, and takes very clear pics. The reason I gave it only 4 stars is because of the price, I think paying this much money for a phone is crazy....but here I am being crazy !! 4
without earphone, but phone is OK 3
This iPhone does not work. It appears that at some point in the life of the phone it was submerged in water. The screen resolution does not work and the battery does not charge. Where should I return it? 1
It's an average phone. I do get pretty good use but it does have a few small problems. 3
This unlocked phone works great on T-Mobile. I just had to insert the SIM card from my old black-berry phone. Within a few minutes, it got signal. Because it was factory unlocked, it was updated to to iOS 6 just fine and remained unlocked afterward. Don't buy those iPhones that are unlocked by software, because you can't update iOS.My existing T-Mobile contract doesn't have a data plan. All I had to do was disabling 3G and Data from Settings > General > Cellular. After that Wi-Fi works fine and I don't have to pay for a data plan.Note that if you do a factory reset on the phone, the only way to get through the initial setup is either by having a data plan or activate via USB cable attached to a computer having iTune installed.The condition of the phone is dependent on who you buy it from. My copy was near perfect. 5
So far, so good . 4
It looked good, but the battery is shot and it won't charge very fast. Now we are stuck. That was all her Christmas money. Don't buy used! Or refurbished...it took an hour and a half in the Sprint store to get all the updates loaded. 2
Disappointed! No instructions.... Purchased it as a present for a teenager, who is very "tech" smart and they weren't sure what to do because there wasn't a brand on it to be able to go to a web sight to research. :-( 2
About this phone? My issues battery life really bad need to charges it twice a day! I don't have games on my phone,no fb. I only use my phone text and calling. I got this phone March 31,2016. And camera so blurry Specially front camera dark. Nothing special on this phone, only the style and the color will fool you. Now I'm thinking buying another phone that I don't need to charge twice a day. You get what you pay for...I wish the battery life at least last 1 day..I don't really care much about camera. 2
Camera stop working after two weeks 2
Excellent everything perfect, good new product such as this in which the publication, i recommend it because of its seriousness 5
Phone is a Christmas present for grand daughter who really wants one but can't get it for herself. I think she will really love it. Price was right, packing secure, and delivery fast. 5
got phone and didn't work! wasn't even cleaned as i was pulling lint out plug in port 1
Very pleased with the phone, however the SIM card removal tool was missing 4
I would have liked to know more about ordering ipods so I could have helped my grandkids make thecorrect order. As it stands, the wrong items were ordered and only one of them has indicated arefund will be issued. 2
I ordered black but 😍😍 5
It is a nice size has all the features I want really like the camery 5
It's a respectable smartphone that will do all the necessary task you need a phone to do. The big issue with it rest with the windows mobile operating system which suffers from bad support and the huge app gap from android and iOS. The only hardware issue I have had is with the display which has bad artifacting when the brightness is turned up. Don't know if it is a result of upgrading to windows 10 mobile or if it is a hardware issue. 3
The phone looked like it went through a blender. Deep scratches all over the blue part. Turned the phone on and there was nothing but a line down the side of it. Returned for refund. 1
Don't waste your money. This is the cheapest phone ever! Does not save to SD card for downloads and can only download a few things on internal hard drive. If there were 0 stars I would give left that! 1
Absolutely perfect, excellent battery life, and I truly abuse it in this respect, yet it lasts for the entire day and I still have 30-40% battery left in the evening. If I just use it for calls, when I am not working, it will easily last 4-5 days.... You can get BB and Amazon apps, so I dont understand why they dont simply allow for Google apps, since most will work with no issues, in fact I have not tried one that didnt work, but there is a special process to get them to install. And finally the BB OS which as far as I am concerned is the best out there in every respect, with functionality that no one else offers....Blackberry could easily be the market leader, the reason they are not I attribute to idiotic Executive Decisions. 4
i think this iphone is not like new, but good 4
I purchased the smart watch but the watch could not be activated. For me that is not a good buy 2
good basic pone... Works very well with companies in Venezuela (Movilnet, movistar and digitel) 4
I have this phone. I mostly love it! BUT I have had a problem with downloading apps. I have a 16gb memory card in it and plenty of storage yet it says "insufficient storage" when I try to download new apps. Despite knowing there is lots of storage I have found if I delete an app that I don't use anymore I can squeeze one on (I have moved what I can to the SD card so that is not the problem).Super bummer! Love the color and the case that is the same color! 3
Arrived diligently . Phone was as new. I installed micro chip and called 5
Love this iPhone 4s says my mom thank u verry much.... 5
This is a good model by blackberry,very portable for ladies who likes small things,I have being using it for five month now is very durable and cute,it's picture guality is clear and fine and browses for very well too.i don't regret having it.Thanks 4
If I talk on the phone for more than 10 minutes it dies then sometimes it dies even if I'm not using it..sometimes it can have 95% and it will die...The only reason why I haven't sent it back yet is due to the fact that my job requires me to have a phone so going even two days without it will disturb my job...so all day it stays on the charger even if I'm at work if I'm sleeping when I'm in the car if I talk more than two minutes it has to be on the charge so it won't die...physically the phone it looks great as described no broken screen no cracks is just the battery....then when I emailed I was told it can take four weeks or longer to get a refund 1
Description said new phone. Phone had been used not hard to tell considering it came in its original packaging all dirty with finger prints all over screen not very happy was expecting new sealed phone other than that the is in very good condition but not what I was expecting 1
i have to get used to it .never had a Windows. 3
Phone is OK but it doesn't allow you to get picture or group text 2
good quality product and was ordered and arrived in time . 5
This is very bad. I ordered a 32 gb factory unlocked iphone I got a 16 GB with bad wifi and not really god battery. 1
its fine. I hate I cant turn of the swipe to text but the phones fine 3
Phone works as advertised. Has a very good battery life. But BLU has failed to deliver the promised Lollipop 5.0 update by the posted end of July 2015. 3
It got supposed be unlocked but one more time what have been offered is not exceeded... Terrible.. Now i had to take this Item to another Store here in Caracas to Lock it Out... Moreover waste of money and time... 2
The iphone is good, the cable is not. Doesn't work, must not be an Apple cable. 4
My iPhone had some problems at first the headphones jack stopped working for 3 days and I'm having some problem with the internet connection sometimes I have all the bars full and the internet just stops working but other then that is perfect that been the only problem I hade with this iPhone 6s 3
My son loves his iPhone. Great product! 4
Has worked for 2+ years. 4
Have had issues with "no service" several times, so far made 3 trips to AT and T.Replaced sim card and does not hold charge well. We keep hoping the issues will stop, still not sure if we will keep or return. 3
This is a good all around phone. The camera is a little lacking in my opinion. It takes very grainy photos no matter the ambient lighting. It also takes quite a while for the camera to focus and take the photo and then the subject ends up out of frame, if it happened to be an action shot. The performance on the device is fantastic if you like gaming, or just have multiple apps frequently running this phone gets the job done in the spu/ram department. The overall build quality feels quite cheap to me though and does not feel like a premium device although what can you expect for this price tag but at the same time there are many other asus devices that have quite the premium feel to them. I have become accustomed to the high quality build quality of Sony devices. Overall this seems to be a decent phone especially for the price. And will serve as a good temporary device until the Sony xperia perfomance x comes out. 4
Had to return it, it just stopped working. EZ for anything electronic to fail but if they do its right out of the box - this has been my experience. 2
This unit is the second unit that I got off line. The unit I got was supposed to be very good but this is the third I have gotten and this on like the others does not work correctly. This unit when slid open reset and it takes 2 to 3 minutes to reset. I do not believe there is a working Blackberry 9800 torch. A working Torch is great but The first one worked great for 1 year and the speaker blew out. The next one just did not work but it was reconditioned and returned. The next one was a very good unit that again did not work. This one locks the screen or resets the whole phone and very seldom rings. I just bought a new one but I am not holding my breath. 3
It was fine . The charger they sent with the phone didn't work . Phone works good 4
I sent the phone to Colombia, and They had to change the battery because the one the phone came with, did not work. They had to pay almost $50 to replace it.The phone is working as expected after that. 3
This phone did not work! 50% of calls were either dropped or wouldn't go through. I can't return because window has been closed. Apple won't replace because I didn't purchase from them. I'm out $300. I recommend you do not buy! 1
Phone is a Christmas present for grand daughter who really wants one but can't get it for herself. I think she will really love it. Price was right, packing secure, and delivery fast. 5
this product is just wonderful and the price is just great, it works perfectly and you should buy it if you are planning on doing so. 5
Haven't gotten around to thinking about dislikes yet 4
When the phone states that it is UNLOCKED, that means it should work. But since this is with Sprint that can't be done. So therefore the phone is nothing but a big Ipod and useless. Let buys be ware, When Iphones are purchased through Sprint they can't be transferred to another service. This sucks as you can never get out or away from Sprint. Hook line and sunk - you are stuck 2
i mean it works but the screen is horrendous, the viewing angles are absolutely horrible 3
Phone works perfectly!! Activated with no issues. Description was on point. Screen was fine with minor minor minor scratches. No nicks or chips anywhere. VERY SATISFIED with this purchase. And I got it in a timely fashion without expedited shipping. Definitely would recommend to anyone!!! 5
same thing i like the blu phone but everyone of them have space issue .. 4
Too good to be true. When I received this phone (fulfilled by Amazon), it looked new. It was sealed. But upon using it, it's obviously refurbished??? It wouldn't read my wi-fi and sim card. Also it keeps shutting off on its own even when it's fully charged. The browser freezes a lot as well. Beware. 1
creo que el producto segun los comentarios que lei antes de comprar decia que funcionaba bien para las bandas 3G de movistar y movilnet venezuela y por eso lo compre, pero el que me llego a mi trae las bandas 1, 4 , 8 que aqui en venezuela funciona para digitel 3
Hard to figure out with very little instructions 2
worked a whole 3 days. Power button was faulty. 2
I REALLY LIKED THE IPHONE IT WAS A PLACE WHERE I COULD LISTEN TO ALL MY MUSIC. BUT TO DOWNLOAD APPS WAS HARD BECAUSE OF THE IOS 3
So disappointed that it stopped working right after the 1 month return period was over.. I have no phone and I'm using my ipad to tex. 2
I am really enjoying my phone... Thankful for the extra USB cords I was giving. Everything works to fit my satisfaction 5
They should notify customers and let them know that you need to buy a Sim card and a memory card beware!!!! Overall good watch though 2
Product was in good condition. 4
Just love it, wonder what took me so long. Had to buy a book about "how to" and will learn Siri soon. Great product 5
The software crashes often. Its hard to make use of your data plan. On the plus side the dual sim function is excellent. I loved that. 3
Yeah, I still own an older iphone 4s, but it's a great deal for a quality product. Unfortunately, the camera cannot be silenced because this is an import model from Japan, but that info was not shared in the description. Also, the volume down button will not function; I have to use the CC menu. 3
Great. Really new, with plastics and everything! Very pleased. Fully recomend 5
very good but not the color you requested, but it works well 4
I'm wondering if my phone is even new.... starting to regret buying this phone & I just received it today. I cant even silence the camera shutter sound... 1
The iPhone stopped working after 3 months of regular use. It was never dropped or water damaged. Extremely disappointed! 1
It keeps messing up everytime I am on the phone I hear static then I have to turn the phone off then back on. 2
Went with an iphone 4 32gb when my ipod 5th generation video finally bit the dust. I can say that I'm very happy with this phone, the call quality, bluetooth quality, and music quality are all excellent. In addition I recently added a Paypal card swipe which is something I could not have done with my old phone.Very easy to get used to after a few days, and the battery life is astounding. Later model iPhones have a special feature with the recently released OS to sync with newer cars better. I might upgrade my phone if I ever get a new car, but for now the used iPhone 4 I have works great with my old car's aftermarket JVC stereo (purchased probably 4 years ago!) USB interface and I'm totally satisfied with my purchase. 5
For an used phone I give this a great review. It just had one small scratch by the speaker, but that was it. No major scratches on the screen or back. It can a little dirty, but it wiped right off. Overall, I'm very pleased with how good of a condition the used iPhone 5c was when I got it. 5
Amazing cellphone. The OS(processor) consume > 50% of battery, i don't like that. If Asus fix the problem the cellphone is the best. The battery drain its a biggest problem. 4
I have no problem taking the phone to straight talk.The phone came in about 3weeks. The only thing I didn't like was the camera its horrible when trying to get a take picture the pictures wasn't clear 4
I'm fairly disappointed with this purchase. First off, the home button doesn't work very well as you almost have to pound on the button to get it to work. Secondly, I specifically purchased this listing because it claimed to be unlocked which was not true. Overall I am quite disappointed with this purchase. 2
For $50 it does the job... in my case using it as a cheap phone while traveling in Europe. 4
Apple IPhone 5S is working perfectly. No problem getting phone connected thru Verizon service and their free SIMM Card. Very happy with Amazon timely service also.Thank you. 4
Works great, clean, great condition. 5
She loves it like a newborn baby 5
It came in excellent condition, runs very good, only sidenote would be a slight scuff on the Sim card tray but other than that very good phone 10/10 would recommend 4
Fast ship and exactly as described. Thank you. 5
The phone worked on arrival but after 3-4 days my daughter noticed that the battery charge did not hold and the phone turned itseld off whenhalf of the battery was discharged. But that is not all. Some days after Wifi stopped working (Wifi button in control center is grayed out).I'm hereby requesting the warranty replacement, but I wouldn't buy another of these "factory refurbished" phones from this seller. 1
Love my phone for the first 2 weeks and now every time I put it down it shuts off. 3
Never been a huge fan of iPhones since I was able to escape the brainwashing after the 3GS. Only purchased this for my mother in law who, like all eastern Europeans, love anything apple because it's "premium". The truth is, the iPhone 5 is an outdated, small phone that's very overpriced on the market. 2
Ordered this iPhone as a replacement phone for samsung captivate. Although there were a few mistakes made I am enjoying my new phone (day 1). The seller was very helpful and very courteous and helped solve any issues I had! Good customer service! Completely recommend. 4
Could not connect with verizon after 3 sim cards. They said the cell ID was already in use as everything else worked perfectly but could not make calls. 1
Do Not BUY!!!NOT UNLOCKED. Why would Amazon even put up with this? 1
For the price it's a good buy. 2
This is my second Blu, I upgrade form a Blu Life Play X...good product for half of the price of another brand....amazing performance.........buy it but do not count with customer service...my phone needed an update, but at the time of the install had a problem. this happen two months ago. I sent a mail with the screen shot of the problem and I am still wating for the answer and the solution. I will down grade to 3 stars 3
It was not locked to Sprint. It had been used on a Metro PCS plan and caused issues at the Sprint store when I was trying to activate. 1
The phone they sent me was manufactured for sale in Japan (or another similar country) and thus I cannot shut off the camera shutter sound. It's very annoying. 2
It works well with apps but Google maps doesn't function well at all. And it is slow with processing becomes very annoying . But for the price it pretty much gets the job done most of the time. You get what you pay for. 3
The phone looks promising on paper, but once In hand it's a different story. The camera is just horrible and the performance was good for 10 mins until apps were installed. The worst thing was that it would not pick up at&t LTE in my area. Force touch Is a joke on this phone. My recommendation is to spend $100 more and get a axon 7, honor 8, Alcatel 4s, or oneplus 3. 2
Interestingly, the phone actually came with a Verizon simcard though it claims it will not work with Verizon. My from the big apple is model A1532 which is prossibly an verizon unlocked version. I tested it with my H2O prepaid card and it works well though. Hope this help. 4
It's a good phone for who ever likes small phones however I'm a big phone lover so I didn't like that and I initially ordered this phone on the first of October just received it on the 13 of October the tracking information was outdated on amazon website and the tracking number couldn't be tracked just a mess then the USPS dropped it off at the front door step on the porch bad service but good phone 2
Very disappointing, the back cover and a defect does not say, even the two - year contract contract, I want to complain!!!! 1
Awesome I love my phone. Thank you so much for reseeding me a new charger because the previous one didn't work :) I totally recommend them!!!! 5
It is not charging not working 1
This BB works well. Not great. The Bold 9780 works much better, faster, and has much better photo quality. Both might freeze once in a while but this will do it more often. If you don't mind spending twice as much on a phone, I suggest you the Bold model. But if your budget is tight this phone will do it. This phone is a bit pricy, should be $120 for what it is, but BB are generally overpriced. This is a great phone for a person that loses phones constantly and wants a working BB. Or if you let your phone fall a lot or let it go for a dive in the pool (even though it will not work later). But if you are a careful person I suggest you buy a Bold model, take good care of it, and enjoy its benefits, avoid headaches, and take very good pictures. I value greatly a good camera on a phone because these pictures will last forever if you save them properly. And it is always better to have a good quality camera. Imagine taking the picture of your life (with a celebrity, or friends, or idk who) with a bad camera. Not worth risking. The curve is ok but the Bold is better. The bold is twice the price but twice as better (not perfect thought). 4
This model is not good for China Mobile. 2
When trying to order an iPhone 5 I was specifically looking for the cdma Verizon version. The seller was very clear in his description and it was exactly what I was looking for. The phone was brand new, in the package still wrapped with all accessories as expected. The seller also provided the MEID of the phone upon placing an order as to confirm that it was a clean esn. This also allowed me to check if the phone was compatible for straight talk in my area and it was. When I paid the extra couple dollars for expedited shipping it was upgraded to 2 day priority mail. I placed my order on Wednesday and received my order the following Friday. Couldn't ask for any more. 5
The speaker didn't work on the phone had to buy headphones with a speaker in order for it to work 2
Phone came to me clean and beautiful looked like it was never used before. Shipped to me super fast in only 2-3 days. Problem came with activation... Whoever had this phone HAS AN OUTSTANDING BALANCE and it will not allow me to unlock this phone for use. I am promptly returning it ASAP buyer beware... 1
The Battery is not lasting for more than two hours 1
So far I'm pleased with it. Let's see how it holds up. 4
This cell phone had a total system failure after only 9 months. The cost to have it repaired is almost equal to the purchase price. But after taking the Iphone to the local Apple store who tried to identify the problem, we learned there is not an option for Apple to repair the phone. It turns out the phone was previously damaged & repaired by a non-Apple repair center using non-Apple approved parts. So we quickly learned all Apple warranties are voided & they will not even attempt to repair the modified phone for any price. 1
After one month, a chip on the logic board failed which controlled recharging the battery. Not Repairable. Had to purchase a new phone. I could have exchanged the phone with Apple for Ver5, but chose to upgrade to 6S and get a new phone. 1
This phone is locked, and thats really a bad way to do business by displaying another label.I cannot afford to come back to US to send it back but I think this would serve as a reminder 1
The phone was in good condition the only problem I had was that I could not open the slide were you put the sim card and it was very hard to open and closed, also the phone did not work with my AT & T sim card, however I did not had to much of a problem getting my money back, Amazon help me with my credit being put back to my account....thanks Amazon for your help. 2
Great price for a great phone 5
screen will eventually pop off of the cheap plastic back. do not get it 2
It started off ok, but now it locks up. Maybe a drop of water got in the USB port (right side), but the button is now locked out within minutes of starting. Pretty much a writeoff. 2
This phone is not strong enough. The phone I wanted to replace is a 16GB. I don't live in the United States and purchased the phone to pick up while I was on vacation in the U.S. Could not get all my Aps and info on the phone so had to go back to using the old phone. I will use this phone when I'm in the United States about 5 weeks a year and I'll make sure I don't have many aps on it. Sorry I bought it but it was my fault, not anything wrong with the phone. When I return to the U.S. I'll be sure to purchase either 16GB or higher. 2
The screen is coming out of the phone & it had water damage when I got it.. it did not say this when I purchased it!! Not very pleased! 1
After receiving the iPhone 4 I called to activate it and the customer service representative told me I could not because it was reported lost or stolen!!!!! 1
I have spent an entire day and will spend much of tomorrow trying to solve this problem. Seller says this is a Verizon phone, but both Verizon and Apple say it is in fact T-Mobile. Verizon shows no record of this handset and referred me directly to Apple. Apple had a hard time figuring out how the seller got a hold of this particular model (some unusual features) and advised they are unsure if adding an Verizon SIM card will work. Anyone who has ever had to go to the Verizon store knows that takes as long as buying a new car. Not happy. 2
to receive and open it seems of good quality wine in a box well protected. The number of stars not complete because I have not completely exceeds my expectations 4
El envio fue mas rapido de lo previsto. EL aparato muy similar al Iphone 4. No es incomodo el tamaño de la pantalla. Muchas Gracias!! 5
We ordered this factory refurbished phone! We missed the return date otherwise we would have returned it! It really never worked properly! We will never buy a refurbished phone again! It is a scam! 1
I bought this phone as an unlocked phone but later found upon revving it found out that it was locked with Verizon . I felt cheated because I was not expecting this from Amazon , seller of the phones . 3
I messed up my new Blackberry and refused to pay the full price to get another. My daughter insisted I have a replacement, since I love Blackberry phones. This phone works great. Only thing I have not figured out is how to get the WiFi to boost my signal inside my home. 4
Good quality used product! imei was clean and worked perfectly. Same as new! 5
I sent back the iPHONE 4 one month ago because it does not respond when you push the bottom button to cancel or go back some of the time. I haven't received refund yet. What's going on? Please issue refund as soon as possible. Thank you. 1
Speech quality is bad. Navigation is poor. 2
Shuts off on its own with a full battery charge. Good phone for a back up. 3
I bought this phone for my husband in an emergency. It works well, with decent 4G connection. The phone reception is generally pretty good too. It doesn't have an amazing display or camera, but it's fully functional. It's a great buy if you're looking for an inexpensive smartphone. 4
perfect, practical, easy to handle, good resolution, well packed 4
Not work as good as describe, but price is ok！ 2
5 stars is not enough for a phone like this. I have had Samsung changing to Samsung was a huge leap. After some years of using smartphones, I love Android and hate Samsung. 5
Thin and fast, nice screen 5
The pin to unlock the sim card opening was not included in the package. 3
There are only a couple problems with the phone.. 1) I can't turn off this extremely loud defining beep that goes off ever 30sec-1min. I tired to get help from the company but they never responded to my emails. The people on the other end of the phone conversation say they can hear it too which leads them to sometimes think its a call coming in on there end. 2) the camera is extremely touchy. You have to have it very still or shots will be blurred.3) internal memory is very low, you can only download a few apps. It reads storage space running low all the time after clearing everything. Other than that its not a bad phone. 4
It arrived fast, but had chips and nicks, was disappointed, but works great. 3
I love it and the price is very good for the iPhone I recomend any body who intrest on it purchase the out any doubt.Manny Depina 5
Bluetooth don't stay connected to my car, downloaded the latest update and that didn't help, otherwise the phone its fast and work excellent on straight-talk. Battery last all day plus. Bluetooth its very important for us and that's why the low rating. 3
It is a great phone,but I cannot install new software....it showed error....maybe some kind of advice because I don't know what is the problem??!!! 5
Great phone for the price 5
Great Iphone good price don't have a problem it all since I get it 5
This item was damaged really bad I ended up having to pay for repairs...this wasn't a good buy on my end....in case your wondering the screen fell off the device. 1
It's awesome. I bought one for my husband, one for myself. 5
so i ordered this phone and i love everything about it i did have to send my first one back due to te internal storeage wasnt what was stated so they shipped me another one and the box arrived empty i did however i did end up etting another one and i now have one ordered for my aunt the photo quality is amazing its a nice big screen i cant do screen shots thou but other then that i love this phone 3
device was working properly for the first 3-4 weeks then after that it went into recovery mode and cant come off left it over night on the charger and it was not charging for some reason now its not coming on at all. 4
It's was somewhat okay being that it's refurbished. But I had expected be neater than it was.And I didn't expect the accessories to more than a charger. At least an earpiece added would not be bad. 3
The phone was working great until 3 months after I got the phone. Now, the signal is spotty in the locations where they were working just fine, and the voicemail box and logging in with my fingerprint will freeze and lag often. 2
This unlocked phone is good option. It fits in a jacket pocket. It has double camera. The photos are nice. A goog interface easy to use. Applications are functioning well. In short, Unfortunately the ram is very low and has little memory. 3
The phone made me sound muffled & under water. I also could not hear well and had to use speaker phone. 1
in ma blackberry 8520 3 buttons work so bad.the box was scratched and terrible.and its buggy with windows.i rate 2 to this item,unfortunately 2
I would like to give a 5 star if the seller don't delay my stuff. Phone is awesome! 4
This is factory unlock can use any gsm/ sim card 2
I haven't put it to use yet, but definitely 5 stars for receiving everything that was advertised was in the package. 5
recieved this phone today, when i started to set it up I couldnt as it told me it had to be activated by a certain icloud account which was not mine!!!!!!! 1
My wife likes the phone and will upgrade as soon as our provider allows he too. also very happy with the camera. 5
Phone I got was REALLY slow and laggy! I hate it compared to the BLU Studio 5.0C HD Quad Core I purchased last year! That phone rocked!! Thought I was buying the same one again, as that what seller showed in photos; however, that is NOT what arrived! 2
I have purchased this item as a gift for some one.. unfortunately when the person began to use this unit it was found that this unit has a number of physical and mechanical faults and/or problems.. the screen is loose or slack when it is depressed. also the battery get extremely hot after 10-15 minutes use.the phone discharges in about 1hr and needs to be constantly recharge some times 4 times in one day ( 8-12 hrs ). THE unit itself tends to lock up or seize up regularly .I AM DISSAPOINTED.. 3
The only think I don't like you send me the Cheapest usb cord n no earpod other than that everything look good n perfect 4
I phone 5 is the worst phone I ever had 1
Phone is pretty terrible. Just bought it less than a week ago and barely any apps work without it being slow/freezing/crashing. Even unlocking the phone sometimes freezes the phone. Camera is also all quite bad, don't expect a single photo worth sharing. You get what you pay for... 2
I was very excited to receive this in the mail and it came earlier than the estimated arrival date. An extra charger was also included, free of charge. Unfortunately, when I was trying to activate the phone, I was informed that the SIM card was still linked to another person's account so I had to go to the Apple store to get a replacement in order for the phone to work. Overall, I love the phone but didn't like how I had to do extra steps to get it to work. 3
Better than I had hoped. - great deal! Wish I had bought two 5
Very good phone runs smooth never had virus issues top security from bb a little bit more effort on marketing wold of brought BlackBerry right back on top.looking forward to the dtek 60 4
Phone was in good condition, with the only exception being that the ear piece was not working. 4
As of today I still DO NOT have it working with StraightTalk. NOT happy. 3 times!!! We have had to get a different SIM card and still no luck. 1
Not bad ... packaging could have been a little better, but overall good purchase. Worked as expected ... thanks 3
Phone in perfect condition other than tiny scratch near edge of screen. More than $100 less than phone store. Would like ability to purchase warranty, however. 4
Very useless "smartwatch." Would consider saving a little more and buying something more like a real smart watch. I used it for about a week and decided to storage it forever. Also headset wire was broken. Think twice before getting it! 2
No scratchesBattery life is good 4
At first, it was really hard to set up and I thought it was stollen. Which had me worried. But the Lady on Sprint said the iphone setup network was down and will take some time. So a few hours after midnight, I did the ritual and, BOOM it works. I love this phone. Easily the best phone I have ever had. 5
The phone did not come with a manual so I went on line but was not able to download any info. about that model. I tried using it to get familiar with the functions. It kept dropping text messages and wifi would not work. Also the sound quality was not great. 2
Great cellphone, I received it in very good conditions 4
~>>NOT A MINI USB ADAPTED PHONE!<<~Be ready to Buy a crapload of 'custum' cords for this one.That being said, phone has a quality feel, and the Ui is fast and intuitive. (Android) 3
Battery not removable other than that good phone 3
This phone is not ready for primetime! It has several software bugs. IMO it was not ready to be released because of the bugs. The phone I had would not even properly sync my google and facebook contacts. This is the first device I have owned that had this issue. I don't mind it not having LTE for the price and I liked the expandable memory. Lollipop is not even ready to be released for this yet. Other than the things I mentioned it was not up to par... 2
I bought this phone to give as a gift to a friend, she called me today to informed that the phone is not working and she was not able to use it at all. Is there a way to exchange it? 1
Decent phone if not used heavily. When I first received this phone, I was so excited to see that there was already a screen protector installed, along with a clear case and nice headphones. The headphones must be to make up for the crappy speaker quality of the phone. The back speakers are hard to hear unless sound is turned up all the way, but it's still bad quality sound. The front speaker for phone calls is also terrible, I could barely hear anyone I was on the phone with, and my volume was up all the way. Thankfully there's an "audio boost" button on phone calls to compensate for that.As for the cameras, I have no real complaints. Picture quality is good for this phone.Now the battery is a whole nother story. Ever since I got the phone, its battery has run out so fast. It's just as bad (or worse) than an iPhone's battery. You can charge it up to 100% in the morning and it'll be almost dead by late afternoon/evening. I use my phone often, so it decharges at about 10% an hour. Very inconvenient if you're going somewhere all day without a phone charger and will need your phone by the end of the day. Sure it's normal for the battery to die so quickly when you're using your phone often, but when compared to other phones, it's significantly worse.Now let's talk about the network issues. I have metroPCS. When I first received the phone and tried to use my 4gLTE, it would come and go very often. I'd have data for a few minutes, then have no network at all for a few minutes. Same goes for cellular service. I had lots of dropped calls and text messages rarely went through because my phone would often say "Emergency Calls Only" even though I have a SIM card and metro told me everything was fine. After a few more visits with them, they finally went into advanced network settings and found out that it was set to AT&T network even though it's an unlocked phone and shouldn't be set to any specific one. However, once they programmed it to be on metroPCS's network, my cellular service and data worked fine.I've only had this phone for a month and a half and I already need a different phone. In the past few days, the touch screen randomly started messing up...I'd touch one app and it'd open a completely different one, or even worse - when trying to send a text message, one touch of a letter would input a bunch of random letters and I can't even text anymore without using speech to text. Also, it was charged at 52% today, and after talking on the phone for half an hour, it was at 1%. I've talked on the phone for hours before without it discharging that excessively. Now my phone's on the charger and it says 0% and isn't charging any higher. My phone has not suffered any trauma and this truly came out of nowhere.Overall, I'm very disappointed in this phone's battery, sound quality, and touch screen issues. Would not reccomend unless you're a light phone user and like the big screen. 2
Great just what I hoped for. Love Amazon marketplace. 5
The battery was dead on arrival. No pun intended.Would have appreciated a link indicating the specs for the batteries so that I could have gotten a spare as a backup. 3
One of the speakers is broken from water damage, i learned cause i got it with a broken screen also and when i went to get it fixed they told me why complete waste. 1
the phone its good, really fast, came with a 2gb sd memory and only english, but the t-mobile doesnt work 3G movistar venezuela, should have known before the purchase. 4
Phone is really busted up around the edges 2
Does NOT work with Verizon service.. Very disappointed. 2
returned would not read sim card. 3
I purchased this phone inJanuary 2015. The phone was supposed to be like new but had already visible signs of wear. When I checked the warranty it was expired. The sleep button stopped working after a couple of months and sometimes the home button was not working properly. For some time now I have issues using the power cable and the camera has some issues as well so I would need a new phone now. Overall it wasn't terrybly bad but definitely not "like new" as advertised. 2
I'm so happy but it takes a really small SIM card my T-Mobile sim was to big so I had to go buy on for 20$ 5
I took this phone to the Sprint store to have it activated but they kept getting an error message that it was not recognized on the sprint network, and so could not be activated. I have tried to get some help from apple online but technical support for this phone is expired. I regret buying from this seller - Unlimited wireless. I will be returning this phone. 1
Need to go to the Apple Store. Technical problems like voice volume of the other person is not audible else it's good 3
The only think I don't like you send me the Cheapest usb cord n no earpod other than that everything look good n perfect 4
The phone is realy slow, it dont works very well. Every time i use an app (and i dont have a lot of them dounload) it sais "the app has stoped, do you whant to close or wait?" Ass well, the camera isnt good... im really disapointed 2
Returned - no issue w/product - changed mind 3
The phone looks nice and works smoothly. Definitely worth the price. The cameras, both front and back, take crisp clear pictures. Very happy with the product. 5
Very much content with the phone. Works really good. 4
The phone works pretty well and has a wealth of features, however.It has some quirks that were for me too cumbersome to overcome.In the case of answering the phone on incoming calls, it popped up a menu, of answer later, leave a message and so on with no way to answer the call.If that menu did not rear it's ugly head and you swiped to answer any direction except for the one very limited swipe it would hang up.If this were solved this would be a great phone. 3
I'm very disappointed with this smart phone. Too many features do not work! Only one SIM card slot works, keypad is a mess, the 8 and 5 are crossed, some letters are crossed and the battery has to be recharged very often and I could be considered an average phone user. I'm very disappointed with this purchase especially that I'm in the Caribbean and to make returns is difficult and expensive. 2
- NICE AND PRACTICAL- Basic but not cheap .- very resistant to daily accidents / rain / food etc... 4
It's a nice looking phone. I don't know about anywhere else or if it's the phone itself, but the GPS does not work in the US. The picture quality is alright. Pictures look great on the phone but when transferred to the computer the quality isn't great. Also, using an aux cord to connect the phone with a car is a little troublesome. I have to play around with the jack, making sure it's not completely in the phone but inserted maybe halfway in?If you don't care about the GPS or picture quality, then this phone is more than alright. 3
Phone is good but picture quality poor 3
The best i phone i by it thanx man ♡♡ 1
Nice, but do not meet the specifications necessary for the very useful for the user basic everyday use, but advanced android users will make them tedious to use. 3
Item came fast and everything was great up until I broke my screen after a week of having it. It's a plastic screen and not a real glass one👎. All in all still a great phone be buy and mind blowing price 4
Not what I was expecting. 2
I would recommend this to anyone. I got the white iPhone 5 and it's amazing for a certified refurbished phone. I don't usually write reviews but this product is so good I had to 5
First iPhone. Have always used a Blackberry. Am happy with the iPhone 4S, works well and iOS easy to use. Have not used Siri. Don't like the fact that you have to have an account at Apple with a Credit card on file if you want to download any apps (even free ones). You cannot set up the account without entering a valid Credit card, but if you use a itunes card (min I've ever seen is $15) you don't need to enter a Credit card. Happy with the product. Find nice headphones and sound is OK. Found Cowon much better as Mp3 player though for music quality. 4
So far, so good . 4
This is my first time with my own smartphone and my experience is very limited. But for the price, I guess it could be expected that there seems to be something lacking in the phone. The manual is lacking in details about the phone, no explanations on how to open phone and installing SIM and microSD cards or that if you use a SD card that you can only use one SIM card. 3
I set the phone up with AT&T and the first call I made found that I cannot hear the call, the earphone portion is defective, after all that trouble now I have to return the phone for credit. 1
Todo bien pero lo unico malo no me llego la funda no se si se la robarian en la aduana o es que esta version no la trae 4
This phone was nice more advance than the Blu Life One L120 but you could not hear well and it was returned 3
I did not receive a Verizon wireless,as stated in the title, but instead a T-mobile wireless. 1
Nice phone initially, but it makes a clicking sound when an app like whatsapp receives a message, and it gets hot when apps are running, so much so that it shuts down after about 15 minutes when using WAZE due to overheating. Battery life is short, less than half day from just using WAZE a bit and Whatsapp. For some reason contacts are showing up repeated when I search, as much as 19 times the same contact shows up. 3
got shipped to me right away and worked well but it had a lot of scratches on front glass screen part and a lot of chips around the edge of the phone. wish he would've been more straight up with me about the shape of the phone. 3
Everything is outdated! You literally can't download any apps. Kik, sc, etc. The safari breaks down all the time too. Waste of money. Only thing that works is the camera with bad quality. 1
good, but is was from sprint and I have to get a code for service activation and I don't know how to do that, because a message that says "activation required". 3
This is coming from a BB lover since 2002My issues w/ this phone and the BB OS- No Uber app.- This new BB is too wide. 9900 was perfect.Otherwise, the phone is great with the return of the 4 BB hard buttons.Sidenote: I wish that BB didn't waste it's precious resources developing it's own new OS - as their are major glitches w/ Android apps from Amazon Store. A BB running native Android with a BB interface and keyboard would have been the best solution IMO 2
Bought this for my grandson who is especially hard on phones. He is using it with a good case and is happy with it. 5
arrived on time, had a bit of an issue activating it since the box it came in had a t mobile serial code. No cosmetic issues or anything otherwise. 5
Phone is great, as seller promised was in perfect condition. 3 stard because I attempted to use two different services to unlock the phone and was denied. AT&T will not unlock the phone if the phone is still considered under contract. 3
Awesome phone, I'm probably the happiest person right now on earth regarding some concerns that I had with online shopping. The phone arrived in time, brand new and sealed off, unlocked with earphones and wall charge + cable☺️☺️☺️ 5
Let me just start out by telling you that the seller I ordered from (BREED) listed this item as "new", not LIKE NEW but actually "NEW" and it was actually refurbished. The phone had dust under the screen and came in a strange (probably fake) box without a berry symbol next to the logo type. All the accessories were new and included though.CARRIERI have AT&T in the U.S. and the phone was unlocked and clean (no carrier info/settings) so manually programming the phone was difficult, even with AT&T's help. Nonetheless, it did work very well on AT&T's network and it had very fast data speeds. The call quality was very clear and SMS was like clockwork.HARDWAREThe phone itself worked well, everything was sturdy and felt very new. The speaker is very loud and clear, the display is decently sized and of good resolution.COMPLAINTSThe only big complaint I had was the keyboard. I'm 6'2" and 270lbs. I'm a pretty big guy. I have decently big hands and the keyboard was near impossible to type on. Other than that, the phone is good but BEWARE OF SELLERS CALLING IT "NEW" if it's not.I ended up returning this phone for the 9900/9930 Bold Touch though. Bigger screen, bigger buttons, faster, but sacrifice of battery life. that's all. 3
Yes, it was used. However, you would never know it without me telling you. It is in awesome shape and works like a charm! I had to get a page plus cellular SIM card but after that it works fine on their network! Very happy with this purchase! 5
The Iphone battery goes down quickly, it isnt new 1
Disappointed....wouldn't hold charge so right away had new battery installed. Inside phone was water damaged and corrosion. 1
battery dead top power off button not working sent back 1
It was exactly what I wanted and what it said it was, few very minor scuffs but basically brand new and works perfectly so far.. The company it came from was nice to put two chargers and a set of earbuds in with it, made a really good impression on me to go to them again 5
I am very busy and use my phone a lot for business. I am always hesitant to get a new phone because I hate to "figure it out".This Iphone 4s has been the easiest phone that I have EVER owned and it's FUN! 5
It was advertised as being unlocked and compatible with AT&T- It didn't work with my sim card and when I took it into the AT&T store they tried there and weren't able to get it to work either, so I had to return it. Frustrating experience. 1
No scratchesBattery life is good 4
quick and easy to workhowever, the back camera will not make but dark Photos in the evening hours even with the flash 2
It's OK. For $200 I expected more. It's really hard to hold at times. Slippery. 3
Everything good. However they didn't bring me the tool to open the chip conteiner 4
Good mid-level phone and very much worth the price. The phone looks expensive, is very responsive and fits the needs of your basic user. Works well in the Metro Chicago area, but has some challenges in rural areas. Not enough of a problem to consider replacing the phone. T-Mobile user here and I'm told that LTE channel 11 isn't supported on this phone, though the phone always shows a 4G symbol and metro area performance is pretty good. Good sound quality, great display (LARGE, SO BEWARE), and limited bloatware is nice! Already running Android 6 without a problem. Asus, you've done good! 4
I recieved the product pretty quick, and its in good condition turns on and works great for the price I paid I am happy. 4
I really liked this phone. it worked well for me...until it didn't I had it for a week and was loving every minute and then I went to work one day and went to turn it on after work and it wouldnt wake up. I would hold the power button it would flash and then back again. I really wanted it to work well for me. I'm considering trying it again but I havent decided if it is worth the hassel. 2
I had problems getting the phone activated 3
This phone drove me crazy. I returned it because it didn't work very well. It was OK most of the time on Wi-Fi. Using the cell tower was another thing entirely. I would be sitting in my recliner and it would go from 3 or 4 bars to no signal at all for no apparent reason. A minute later it would be back. Bluetooth would send but not receive. Data transmission would frequently stop. I had to turn off data and then turn it back on to get it to work again. Then I figured out I could just put it in airplane mode and then switch that off again, which was faster. If I laid it down on my leg it would block the signal. Once I missed about ten seconds of a call from doing that.Among good points to the phone would be a pretty good camera and a ridiculous number of ring tones to choose from, I'd guess at least 120. I'd advise against buying this phone, though some folks seem to like it. 2
the volume of calls is very low. I not hear almost nothing. 2
it had a few minor scratches in the back but other than that, very good! 4
i bought this product and i choose the option ''new'' now it results its refubrished. it doesnt have warranty anymore, i bought it 4 months ago. What can i do if a need the warranty now. i need an answer 1
The phone was a Christmas gift for my daughter and it said it was Sprint ready, which is my cell phone carrier. So, on Christmas day, I planned to have the phone activated so she could enjoy her gift. What I discovered was that the phone did not come with a SIM card. So, I had to go to a special, Sprint manufacturer store, get the card (which was free from Sprint), have it installed and activated at the store. If the advertisement said it didn't come with a SIM card, I sure missed it! That was a pain in the butt and disappointing for my daughter on Christmas. Other than that, the phone works great and as always, Amazon did a great job getting the phone delivered. Thanks for the great service Amazon!! 4
heavy big and clumsy small memory and the battery wasn't that astonishing 2
battery drained too fast everytime, had to return it. 2
This phone has been reset several times without working correctly, very disappointingCompany "fixed" and still hardly works!!! 1
good service, fast delivery. I didn't arrange appearance of iphone 3gs received by me, namely attritions, scratches, chips and cracks. In the description them it wasn't mentioned 3
janky... not worth it buy the real thing 2
I bought this phone for my Daughter and she is loving it. It was delivered quickly and the condition of the phone was just as was stated. She was able to turn it on and use it right away with absolutely no problems. I would highly recommend purchasing from this seller. He was honest about the product and even added a person thanks in our receipt and was available to us if there was a problem. 5
Seems to be a good value. 5
The phone is working as expected, however it had a few scratches. 3
Arrived in top condition. I wouldn't be able to tell if it were like new or just new. It's shiny and the price was oh-so-good. 5
There was no SIM card and no Charger there for I could not use the phone, sprint would not buy it back so was out $280 1
Please note I specifically ordered a BlackBerry 8520 unlocked phone, however the phone I received was a locked phone for the AT&T network. This was a very disappointing moment for me, because I unwrapped the phone months after I bought it with the intention of using it to find that it was not what I ordered.Wolsey Griffith 2
I brought this phone but its is not a Factory Unlocked as mentioned. Mine was locked to Mexico Carrier, and is definitely NOT a NEW one. I got myself confirmed from the Apple, where they checked the product with serial number and told me that it was expired 198 days ago . So i guess it is a repacked one.So kindly dont go for it .(My product was Sold by BLUTEKUSA) 1
I would have given it 5 stars except the bezel has a noticable scratch and I bought the device to use on T-Mobile in which it was advertised for.It had a Verizon sticker on it but seems to work OK so far. Otherwise its a decent iPhone and arrived on time through Amazon Prime which is a terrific service 3
It was not Locked to Sprint it was locked to Verizon. 2
It was honestly terrible quality 1
It works with my T-Mobile SIM card and functions properly I love it 5
i like it and it's very good condition,and that's cool 4
Absolutely Beautiful device. IF you have GSM service!!!NOT VERIZON COMPATIBLE. 2
I bought this device and works great, 2 weeks after lightning cable was damage and the IPhone battery was complety dead, I bought an original Apple lightning cable and surprise, phone doesn't works anymore. 1
Sometimes one can be a little skeptical when purchasing a refurbished iphone. I had 2 positive experience with iphone I bought from this company. The iphone has been working flawlessly. 5
good night,,, would buy two phones, BLU Dash C Music-Global GSM - Unlocked Cell Phone (White) and blu studio unn x black,,, I buy them separately and now each has a bill and the same traking !!! It is a problem because I did not record the shipping company that will bring him to Venezuela 2
Battery running out too fast! Price is cheap, you have to charge it everyday. 2
IT LOOKS NICE BUT IT HAS FEW GLICHES THAT YOU CANT FIX, AND IT DOESNT FUNCTION WELL AT ALL TIMES. ITS SOMEWHAT IFFFY IF THATS A WORD FAR AS IT WORKS WHEN IT WANTS TOO IC=NSTEAD OF BEING RELIBLE AT ALL TIMES AND ITS 3G REALLY SLOWS YOU DOWN. 3
The phone is being returned because the battery would not charge properly. The phone appeared new and I never had the Apple store check it out, so it may or may not be a refurb, returned or used one. Remember that these 4S phones were all built at the same time. So that means that even if you get a new phone, it will have an ancient battery. The phone would take an inordinately long time to charge and would never get up to 100%. After three weeks it got so bad that I was trying to charge it almost all day long. and had to put it into airplane mode so that it could even get up to 40% charge.I would recommend that anyone buying an older phone be very careful to see that the phone charges normally right out of the gate. If it does not, send it back. 2
it is awesome i can feel the phone ,its very handy & it had a high performance 4
I was not impressed. There is no talk-to-text feature, which would be fine except that the keyboard had a hard time recognizing what I was typing. I honestly would recommend buying a different phone. 2
Battery was pretty much shot when we got it. Should have bought new. 2
Very happy with product. Not happy at all with seller! 4
The phone is reliable it works a lilttle slow and the home button has to be pressed hard but after that it is a good product 3
Was lock. Phone was in good condition 4
Total waste of money unless all you want is phone/text everything is outdated and you can't get newer apps 1
Phone is not clear! I need my money back 1
I'm a senior citizen and have been puzzled by many of the newer phones so I started out slow with the I-phone 3G. I knew right away I should have gone all the way and purchased the newest one. It has been so easy to learn. I recommend it to anyone 5
Arrives earlier than expected. Great 4
It cane in really good condition as described in the ad. 4
It may say that it is unblocked but it doesnt work for virfin mobile it doesnt have the right material and thus doesnt work 1
It's ok but it needs a better case 3
Update: So, here is an essential list of important pros and cons.Pros: Great cameras, great feel in hand, decent screen, great price.Cons: Camera app is a bit slow and stutters occasionally, MOST IMPORTANTLY the sound quality is muffled and quiet (on the phone). This was supposed to be a present for my mom, and she really likes the phone, but nobody can understand what she while talking on the phone because the sound is so muffled. Unfortunately, I'm going to have to return it because of that. 3
Love my phone . It was used but it look brand NEW! The only thing I wasn't impressed with is that she sent me fake iPhone headsets but that's okay. Overall great seller. I recommend this seller. @Sharri International Inc 'i got the green one ' 5
Not work as good as describe, but price is ok！ 2
Got it for my sister because she needed a new phone. Her iPhone 4 had lag especially on iOS 7. It made me cry how slow her phone was. The iPhone 5C was a perfect replacement. Fast and reliable. She runs up the bill like crazy now.!! 5
I did not receive a Verizon wireless,as stated in the title, but instead a T-mobile wireless. 1
my son loves his iPhone 5
This is the first phone I have ever had such challenges with. The back of the phone consistently is popping out, the battery has to be removed and replaced at least 3 times a day to "reset" the phone, and loses charge within a couple of hours.The charging works inconsistently, even when the same micro charger is used on a daily basis.A complete waste of money, and causes frustration every single day.... 2
I bought this phone hoping it was unlocked because I rather like my boost service, and long behold it wasn't unlocked this phone only works with either T-Mobile or Verizon nothing else. But I did end up changing my plan to T-Mobile I'm paying the same amount with not that great of service but I guess boost doesn't work with the 7 plus yet so ill have to wait. but my phone was not opened or anything like that. other then the service s*** I'm very pleased with my phone 4
thanks , this is ver good . 5
Nicely packaged and professionally refurbished. I am total happy as will be my relative who lives in Thailand. 5
defective, had to send back 2
The phone looks like new but the wifi doesnt works! 1
Excellent condition as stated! Very happy custumer 5
Positive items: the wide array of apps.; the speed; the sound; the cameraNegative: the short live of the battery 3
Well let me start by saying this phone is not green like it says it's like a blue color. Also this phone dies very fast! The headphones for it don't work well people can't hear you I had to purchase headphones that can work for my phone. This is my first and last time with a Blu Phone it's definitely not all that, more of a temporary phone then a everyday phone. 2
The phone was good,but it didnt came with charger neither data cable 3
Positive:- Good condition, no scratches! Is like a new in outside.- No software and speed problems, like a new too.- Working great on Brazilian network, I believe is really worldwide.Negative:- The battery is not 100%, I believe that battery is long 20-30% less than original.Neutral:- Don't came with the earphone and the original box, but is fine to a refurbished one. 4
This Iphone is fine, unfortunately, it is rated this way because the charger is defaulted and therefore the phone cannot perform to its best since the accessory is not working. This rating will change with a change made towards another charger. 3
I bought this as a gift for a friend and she has been satisfied with it so far. Only problem was how long it took to arrive, but all in all, a good buy. 4
Dear to whom it may concern that the iPhone charger for the walk jack are way to big that I couldn't be able plug it in on my house jack. So is there a way that you could send me another one that would be a able to plug in my wall jack and be able to charge my phone 3
Did not get a 5.0 got a 3.2 cell phone 2
This Device works fine on some days but then won't work at all on others. The speaker seems to go out a lot and more frequently now since it has been used for a month now? 3
Great so far. no issues. product had no scratches! 5
I bought this mobil to my Mon! It is beautiful and very light the only one I dont like is that some keys (of right side of the keyboard) are a little bit crushed and for this is to write...On the other hand, the mobil works good!! 4
Screen size, brightness and color are good. But the phone itself has too much lag even with only 1 app running. Camera quality is really bad. Can only get the focus right 4 out of 10. Had to return it. 2
They were very good and the seller is very trustworthy. 4
not new... i'll return it... 1
It's work very good thank you 4
i only used the phone for four months and it is mal-fuctioning. the phone has no warranty on it because i took it to the apple store and it says out of warranty so how can i get a replacement. it is really annoying. 2
The item was listed as "like new", but there were some problems. First, the ear speaker's filter is missing. Second, camera's flash does not work. I cannot understand how they call this item as "like new". However, I received %40 discount after buying this item because of these problems. 1
I purchased this iPhone for my daugher a few weeks a go.. It first took over two weeks to receive. After finally receiving it discovered that the keyboard was not functioning correctly. In other words certain keys where just not working. How disappointing!! They apologized and asked me to send them a receipt of my shipping charges... At first I thought ok no big deal i will just re-order another phone once I get my credit.. We returned the item expecting a full refund when two weeks later discover that they charged us $81.58 for re-stocking fee... Not acceptable for a phone that doesn't function as advertised. Not only did I lose my time and money but had to deal with the aggravation of the incompetence of this Company... Take my advice... Avoid!!!! 1
This phone did not work! 50% of calls were either dropped or wouldn't go through. I can't return because window has been closed. Apple won't replace because I didn't purchase from them. I'm out $300. I recommend you do not buy! 1
Nice phone, so far !!! 5
New iPhone at a great price. Fast ship, great experience. Daughter tried 2 used iPhones on Ebay and was burned both time, Go new, go Amazon and you can't lose. 5
OK..Did not come with SIM card slot pin.Did not come with "includes all original accessories" as stated in the product description.The included charger is cheaply made.Has some scratches. 3
I purchased 2 of this phone, they were delivered in October 6 . I didn't not use them right away, I charged them. October 31 I turned them on, one of the phone works the other one showing a green robot on the screen. I sent an email to the vendor on 11/1/2016 to see if there is something I should do. He hasn't got back to me yet. Here is the screen picture photo 1
in the description it said it was unlocked but the sim card was locked to att, I had to go to a lot of trouble just to try and unlock the from from att, I had to go in the store presonnally and it took forever. but the phone it self is good. 3
The phone has been working well for me. Thank you 5
Very nice well taken care of phone.... Works great! 4
Phone was unlocked upon purchase and worked fine until a restore caused it to restore to its locked status. SIM card no longer works in it. From the best I can tell, the provider unlocked the phone through hacking methods. Do not buy, 1
Got here a day early, however the battery would constantly act up, the phone would shut off and say it was dead, it over heated and lastly--it just stopped sending texts. Returning asap. 1
It's a beautiful phone and runs smoothly, but the screen came with three small defects. They look like pinpricks and are very distracting. Wish I could return it, but I'm overseas and someone just brought it to me.Also, it doesn't seem as though you can use a nano sim card and a memory card at the same time. Had I known this before purchasing, I would've gone with a different brand. 2
The phone had issues.first of all the upper part of the screen is discolored. When using earphones and charging or when using phone as a car ipod, the phone begins to make a loud deafening sound . The phone camera freezes too. All these continue until there's a restart of the phone. Which means you have to wait longer 2
good afternoon my user is velis33@gmail.com I make a purchase of a 32GB iPhone 4 used the day February 15, 2014, I wonder if I'm already happened with the team why not come ah me anything yet and I waiting time 1
The phone was on time and no cracks, but minor wear. However, after a week it blanked out and gave me issues, it does this once every few weeks.But other than that, I do enjoy my phone. 4
8 gb not enough. Should have gone with a 16gb. 4
As up today there is no problem. Only the charger take a hard time to charge the phone . Too much. Time to charge 3
The condition is just as listed to be like new and it works well. It is much better than my old device which was used for 2 years. 5
It arrived fast, but had chips and nicks, was disappointed, but works great. 3
This phone came with problems of access to the camera, not accomplished connect to any wifi network. I could not use it and this caused me a waste of money. 2
Product was exactly as described. There were no dents. The housing reflected only light wear and tear and the screen itself was flawless. The quality of customer service fell a bit short of 100%. Otherwise, my rating would have another star. From now on, I will stick to purchasing all accessories from the Apple store. 3
Works excellent, Came UNLOCKED...only had problems tracking the item, customer service didnt really help me but we got it straightened out. 4
The phone was in good condition but I couldn't activate. It was reported stolen 1
The item is very nice 5
Can not download certain app 3
I bought a used one, but condition is very good like new as described, love it, will recommend it to my friends. 5
excellent value for the money. phones have worked well as starter phones for my 12 year old twins 4
Ordered for my daughter, and she has been so happy with her new phone. 5
I was really excited about this phone that is why i was willing to pay extra for it. The only down side is when it is charging it malfunctions if you try to use it while charging. The sender put way too much tape on the case, but all & all pretty happy with my phone. 4
the keyboard has two keys that came defective, if you're from venezuela buy the american version, because the 3g of this version dosen't work here. 4
Features are amazing. Clean and neat. 5
I've had this phone for a few months now and the phone works great. Though, I have switched from this phone to another phone and I was trying to sell it and I'm not seeing that the phone has an outstanding balance on the IMEI which is not allowing me to sell it on swappa. I'm upset at this because now I am either being forced to use it or use it as a paper weight. I'd like some answers. 2
Looks like a new phone. Works well. 5
It will take awhile to get use to it. 3
The iPhone 5c in blue the chargers port won't hold the charges. So that why I return the iPhone 5c. You guys need to check all phones before shipping it. 2
Fast ship and exactly as described. Thank you. 5
We had to return it. The battery was dead 1
The phone features from screen, number dial was too small. 2
For the price, it should be a great value. I commend BLU for offering a phone at this price point. I really wanted to see a low cost option. Initially my review was one star but I am now changing it to 3 stars.I ignored the one star reviews about phone rebooting itself constantly. When I first got it, that's all it did with the AT&T SIM in the phone. It couldn't charge because it rebooted constantly.As for ATT, I tried two SIMS, ensured the right IMEI number was registered (remember this has two SIM capability so there are two IMEI numbers). At the ATT store, we gave up as well.To save you some hassle, here are some tips:1. Tech support requires an enormous amount of personal information which is not necessary to troubleshoot this problem. I can understand email address, maybe a first and last name but why do you need my cell phone number when any contact info would suffice in case we get disconnected? You are not marketing, stick to troubleshooting my problem4. Troubleshooting is simply nothing more than doing a hard reset, instructions available on the web. By the way, a hard reset through the settings did not work for me. Technical support did offer an alternative method (below). However, I have 3 other Windows phones and I knew tech support's instructions were wrong (key sequence). I also did not receive their email for whatever reason.1st way to reset:Go to settings, about, scroll down to reset your phone (easier)ORUse the key sequences below:*Make sure your phone is off.*Press and hold Volume Down button then power button (together)*The moment it vibrates, Release the power button till an exclamation sign appearsNow release the Volume Down button.Now enter the following sequence within a second or two of each other*Press Volume Up button.*Press Volume Down button.*Press Power button.*Press Volume Down button.Phone rebootsIf you see spinning gears, you have done it correctly. If not, you screwed something up, start the sequence again (or do it the easy way above :)).I was ready to ship this back after doing a hard reset (easy way twice and hard way once). For some reason, I decided to uncheck 3g under cellular. The moment I did that, it connected to AT&t and all was well. Or it was just a coincidence, maybe I had to hard reset 3 times. I checked 3G once again and all is well. Maybe ATT issue not accepting a 3G connection or just a coincidence.The phone also updated twice during the process by the way so I have the latest 8.1 release. Note the hard reset doesn't revert back to previous OS versions so that's good news, it just cleans the data.Bottom line, I shouldn't have to do all this but if your phone reboots and you still want to keep it, hope this review/troubleshooting helps.If your phone works out of the box, you were luckier than I.Now the phone has been working for 8 hours with no problems. I desperately need a storage card as my daughter already decided to load 1GB of apps on it so 116MB available, oops. If the phone is dependable, I will up the stars to 4 or even 5 due to its value.As for Windows OS, I like it but this review is for the phone only.Update: 6/22/15. Phone is now rebooting on its own and inoperable for the most part. I tried a hard reset but screen freezes, it reboots, it's a mess. Still under warranty. Note you must pay for shipping and it takes 10-15 days for BLU to assess and give you options. Will update but that's a long time without a phone so it's a bummer that they don't cross ship.Update 7/9/15: They sent me a refurbished phone, took about 2 weeks for the end to end exchange. Seems to be working ok. 3
I am far from being an expert. I got this phone becuase my 4 year old Blackberry died and had to upgrade, thus new in Android and the phone. All works well except: Battery life is too short. I dont download videos or play games, regular use, but before 6 pm the battery is at 4 % after an all night charge.Second and last issue: Very weak WiFi signal. Within 10 feet to get half decent signal.All the rest work very well. 3
This SELLER stated that he would give me a discount for my troubles. A discount of $10.00?? I spent that much just sending him BACK his defective iPhone. So were is my DISCOUNT?? He must really though I was a fool twice?? I may have to file in a small claims court to get a working iPhone plus a REAL DISCOUNT!! 1
It came locked and i cant get in it and it still set ass there phone and i need all information so i can get in to it 1
There are not many phone in this price range when buying unlocked and this is one of the best. The performance is fine for every day tasks and the call quality is decent. For this price you can not expect much from the phone, and it performs mostly how you would expect... decent for almost all uses. My biggest complaint about this product is the storage space, after the software, you only have room for a couple of apps and pictures. Overall this phone is the best for the price, but do not expect it to perform like a brand new flagship phone. 4
Cons : A lot of Bloatware and lags on the system. Camera and gallery launch very slow, andros 5.0., no buttons backlit, poor updates ..Pro: quality camera, gesture system, storage 3
So it fell out of my pocket the screen broke and the phone couldnt turn on, i went to 2 differemt places who said they cant fix it i gotta buy a new phone. Great! Lasted a full 40 days.. If someone has an idea where i could fix it maybe please let me know 2
Very slowly. Not what I wanted.. 2
I think I got a fake phone, with a problem on a the main button which is not straight, the screen who is not probably fixed 1
Great condition no problem with refurbished phone ..would buy again 4
Parts of my screen did not work. I had to go get it fix 2
Phone as arrived better condition than description. Happy :) 4
If you want a phone with a keyboard this is definitely your best option if not your only option with a modern OS. Its has excellent build quality and feels great in the hand. You will not regret buying this provided you invest some time to overcome the learning curve with the OS 4
Came sooner and is a lot better then the last phone i ordered. 5
Got to my house early and it still works fantastic in the month I've had it. If u need a new iPhone 4 get it here. 5
Was lock. Phone was in good condition 4
When I first got this phone it was great I like screen size after having the blu music I though it was an upgrade. first the sound is terrible thers is one tiny speaker at the bottom I've tried every booster app nothing happens even if you have headphones 2nd internal memory is a joke I even have a SD card and I can't switch all apps to it the camera is excellent I'll say that but I'll be going back to the blue life play real soon its the only phone that made me happy 3
My experience with the BB was excellent, very friendly and complete device, but I recommend that you include, before the purchase, lists of the phone accessories like the earphones or battery charger 4
Arrived in condition as advertised. I did not have any problems with upgrade. Works and looks great. 5
Apperantly the package got lost so I didn't get my item at all. I was really mad and waiter for 3 weeks. The only thing I got was my money back 1
I did like the product and was all set too purchase another until I found out none of my callers could hear me and the phone kept losing my network connection to my Sim card and i missed countless calls. Other than that great phone i guess. Thanks for swift response for the refund. 1
Works great. Bit clunky but can not complain 3
Just what I was expecting. thanks 4
This phone did not maintain its charge more than 2 hours and after a month it died never to turn on again. 1
I had the phone about 2 months and the touch screen stopped working. If the screen is unresponsive the phone is useless. Was hoping for a better product. 2
the signal is super weak, the phone is out of signal most the time.The battery is ran out so quick and also the phone gets boiling hot just after 20 mins on calling.Often, the shop pauses by itself and you cannot return the home page.Definitely wasting my money on this phone !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 1
Well, the camera appeared to be broken and the phone itself is kinda slow. Not satisfied at all. Need to order another phone now. 1
I waited a month before writing a review.I love this phone! I have my data/minutes thru Net10 and I had no problems switching from my LG phone to this. I use this for everything! As my kindle, social media, shopping, Netflix, camera, everything but as a phone.I hate talking on the phone but when I do this is fine. The only thing that keeps me from giving this 5 stars is sometimes when I'm texting or commenting on FB it posts before I finish. Honesty it's s terrific phone with tons of coolness for less than $100.****August 8, 2016*****Well, I loved this phone up until a week ago. I had problems turning/keeping it on and now its dead. I think $100+ is a lot for a phone to only last a year. It refused to charge, not the battery, it was the charging port. It broke my heart cause I really loved this phone. Im using the $50 phone I bought with a Net10 package several years ago. No problems with that little LG phone.Im doubtful I'll buy Blu again. 2
I bought this used item though it doesn't look like used. Except that it has a minor scratch on the back which is unnoticeable. Device is working good but the charging cable looks like not the original one because it broke at the joint exposing the inner wire otherwise great product as expected. 4
Came exactly as advertised with hardly any sign of wear. 4
Watch would be fine if apk download wasn't so buggy. Crashed my phone twice and had to uninstall apk. Guess you get what you pay for...needs an updated version 2
This arrived before time. Was as per the description. 4
I not recommend this phone, is lenght, it's not good...i for a beginners whit Blackberry Phones. This phone is for my wife use and not have 100 % satisfy but for the prize is not bad. I recommend other BB Model. 3
I finally decided to get a smart phone and this iPhone 3GS is perfect for me. Has more features than those on the 3 and almost as much as the 4.For a retired person like myself, it is perfect. The iPhone 3GS was brand new and unlocked as stated. I set it up on Consumer Cellular phone and data service and I will be using it in Europe with a European SIM card for phone, # and data there.It works perfectly. Loved it so much we bought another for my spouse!NO DISAPPOINTMENT OR DISSATISFACTION HERE!VERY PLEASED! 5
Not exactly what i expected had a lot of storage which is good but isn't so fast and the camera that i thought would be good isn't so great i think i will keep this phone because of the storage though will update the review if anymore issues occur 3
I've only had it about a month so far but it's been great! 5
I received the phone on time. It's in very good condition. I put in a sim card that I had from T-mobile and it works fine. It came with ear buds and a charger which unfortunately doesn't work. Overall I'm satisfied I've only had it for a few weeks but everything ( apart from the charger) has been OK so far. I would buy from them again. 4
great I just ordered the wrong one 5
Amazing phone for the price. If you're looking for a good Android device and don't want to throw down a chunk, this is well worth it. 5
It's a good deal.The iPhone 5 is great including phone accessories earphone, charger and transmission cable.they also gave me the screen protection and phone case. They are really thoughtful. 5
The home button and on button don't work on this item which was not mentioned in the seller notes. Otherwise good purchase. Certainly worth the amount I paid for it. 3
To future buyers: note that the charger and data cable are not by Apple, they are each a 3rd party made-in-China item. The protective film also does not fit the phone properly, so you will need to get a new one. The iPhone itself has a chip at the bottom, but overall in decent condition and works as expected. The seller is shrewd in the wording of the description - it sounds as if it's an excellent condition iPhone coming in Apple's original packaging with Apple's data cable and charger and a screen protector, but no, it's a good condition Apple iPhone coming in a random "industrial" box with a 3rd party made-in-China charger data cable and a screen protector that does not fit the phone, so you will indeed need to get a new one.Overall, 4 stars and I am satisfied with my purchase, but it is not exactly as I expected. 4
Glitches and freezes a lot while useing it, espeacially while texting.... 2
One side of camera didnt work 3
Yes it was perfect thanks 5
So far so good, this phone works great, capacitive screen is very responsive and you have a full qwerty keyboard if your not into the whole type on screen thing. Only issue with this phone is when speaking with on it on your ear, your ear somehow manages to press either the hold button or the mute button, hence the 4 star rating. 4
Serious problems with the phone. Isnt compatible with tmobile but says in the factory settings that the carrier is tmobile. Also isn't unlocked like they claim to be. Don't buy the phone it's just a huge hassle 1
It works fine! No issues so far! Good purchase ' 4
I'm just an average lady, definitely not a tech head, so if any of my complaints can be fixed, please tell me!This phone is just for personal use. I don't need a high end phone with a million features (they're all too big anyway).I know this phone is inexpensive, but so is the Lumia ,so comparing the two is fair.Coming from a Lumia 530, I am not at all impressed with this battery life! From a full charge, it's down to 70% after a 20 minute Facebook check. I've turned off most apps that can run in the background and the display is on low brightness. There are some apps that don't give you achoice to turn off in the background, but according to the battery saver they don't use up very much. I don't know what else I could do (suggestions welcome). My Lumia would still be at a full charge after just 20 minutes.There's no block call feature. I found that feature very very useful for avoiding those cruises I keep winning and the weird pharmacy calls.There are a few apps that don't work with this phone, nothing to cry about though.The camera is definitely better than the Lumia because it has a flash, which is nice. I've never used my phone in place of a camera, but the improvement from the Lumia is definitely noticeable.I like the size. It's bigger but not ginormous like most phones. I can carry it in my pocket still, but I do have to use both hands when I use it.The display is a nice size and very clear and the sound is nice too.As it stands at the moment, I might switch back to my Lumia but I'm on the fence. I'll keep this as a spare because I didn't spend a lot for it.If I get any tips that improve its performance, I'll update this review. 3
The phone quality sucks, and it freezes sometimes. I am surprised, i did not expect this at all..from the description. 2
Awesome price for this phone. Set up with AT&T in minutes! 5
Very nice phone, great for the price, it does everything I need, is a great working tool. The email synchronization works great and the touchscreen is a nice touch 4
There was no disclosure about receiving a Spanish manual and CD. I do not speak nor understand Spanish and Amazon.com did not disclose that I would strictly receive a Spanish manual & CD. I did chat with Amazon representative who could not give a satisfactory answer than to go download English manual online. What about the CD? BlackBerry 8520 Unlocked Phone with 2 MP Camera, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi--International Version with No Warranty (Black) 2
The phone was horrible it did not work at all I would never buy a Blu phone in my life again 3
I have had zero problems with the phone itself. I love Apple products and so far it stands up to any other I have had. The phone arrived sooner than expected, so as for the iPhone 6 it is a great device. 4
the battery only lasts an hour. its terrible. 1
The software experienced some problems, I need to reset it very frequently. Very nice sreen and takes nice pictures but doesn't work so well. 2
I was able to load all of my music onto this phone. 5
The phone is realy slow, it dont works very well. Every time i use an app (and i dont have a lot of them dounload) it sais "the app has stoped, do you whant to close or wait?" Ass well, the camera isnt good... im really disapointed 2
I bought this blackberry bold 9780 hoping to arrive as stated in the specification. BUT unfortunately it was not. on the website says it is RCN72UV model but the model that comes to me is RBE41GW. is a model that does not work 3G in my country. IS A PITY THAT HAVE TO FEEL BUYING FROM AMAZON FRUSTRATION. The phone itself is fine, it's new (I think). Battery comes without any details or leave me the impression that it is fake?..............yo compre este blackberry bold 9780 con la esperanza de que llegara tal como decía en la especificación. PERO lastimosamente no fue así. en la página web dice que es modelo RCN72UV pero el modelo que me llega es RBE41GW. es un modelo que no funciona 3G en mi país. ES UNA LÁSTIMA QUE TENGA QUE SENTIR FRUSTRACIÓN COMPRANDO DE AMAZON. El teléfono en sí esta bien, es nuevo (creo). la batería viene sin ningún detalle o sea me deja la impresión que es falsificado? 3
I really enjoyed this little dual SIM phone the few days I had it, but it wouldn't install downloaded updates so had to go back. I'm trying another one thru Breed that's refurbished, so that should have fixed the flaw. 3
We all know BlackBerry has gone though some difficulty in the past but I feel like this device might help them progress. The keyboard is absolutely amazing; phones fits perfectly in your hand, hub takes time to get used to but after a while I grew to actually like it. I was an android user. The only reason this device gets a 4 and not a 5 would be because of the lack of applications compared to android devices. Even with the amazon store you are still limited. Also the restart time is slow although it doesn't make the biggest difference 4
Like new, bought to use with tracfone and everything went smoothly, very happy with it 4
this phone that i ordered from this CadamL was a piece of crap, the speaker was busted on it and it didnt work properly, after trying to fix it, not aware that there was a month i had to get it back to this sorry ass vendor, i wrote him when i finally gave up on it and it was to late to do anything with and he told me and i quote, "The speaker works perfect and you had the phone for a month! The phone was in perfect condition when I sent it. The phone had insurance from UPS take it up ith them! No refunds you had for over a month with insurance from UPS! It's no telling what conditions the phone is in now!!" ............ now tell me this, how do you figgure that you get insurance from ups????? ok A$$4013 1
I like this phone a lot, came very fast and was a breeze to activate. I have been buying BLU phones because they are actually cheaper than the deductible from my carrier. A good product at a great price! 4
el telefono tiene una falla en el conector de carga, no es nuevo, yo soy comprador desde venezuela, por lo tanto no recomiendo comprar porque es muy riesgosoThe telephone has a fault in the connector of load, is not new, I am buying from venezuela, therefore I do not recommend to buy because it is very risky 2
It works like new. Got here faster than expected 5
I bought this for my husband because his 5 yr old phone finally gave up the ghost. This works well enough. It is a little slow, but that is probably because it is older and refurbished. 4
Great phone! I really thought there would a lot pf scratches on it but there was totally nothing it is like brand new the only complaint i have was that the charger was broken but is ok i bought one and it works perfectly fine thank you for the phone 5
