Phone is overall decent but was unaware that cannot send videos longer than 10 seconds. Asus put so much money into a great product but failed in some of the minor departments. overall a good phone but expected more 2 3
Completely unlockec new phone. Pretty good though seems a bit slow. But if you consider doing only basic phone functions and chats, then shouldnt face troubles. 5 3
Great phone! I really thought there would a lot pf scratches on it but there was totally nothing it is like brand new the only complaint i have was that the charger was broken but is ok i bought one and it works perfectly fine thank you for the phone 5 4
I like it because I being a Blackberry buff get to use an efficient SMART Phone along with a convenient key pad. It looks difficult to use in the beginning but once you get the hang of it its pretty cool.I tried installing Viber on it but surprisingly got a message that it is not available for this device. 4 3
Very good device I've had it for a few days so far so good. I love the speakers and the screen and front facing Speaker's are awesome for media comsuption and getting LTE on ATT by way of straight talk. All in all if your looking for a phone that's tech heavy that you can root and play graphic heavy games without lag get he asus 4gb or the one plus , but if you just like me just wanted a good around phone that has a beautiful screen and great speakers and get LTE and a good battery life get this 5 4
Slow, closed apps randomly, virtually no memory to store apps etc on. 2 1
I bought it for a gif to a friend in Venezuela but she told me that the memory is too small so it is almost impossible to download apps as Instagram or Facebook so keep on mind because I think that it is very important to know it . 2 3
Side and rear panel of Iphone 5 very easy to be scratching , chipping. I never seen any phone like that, even cheapest phone on market now. Sorry to spend a 3/4 of thousand dollar to buy this phone. I used 16G Iphone 4, this phone's hardware very good, that why I purchased this Iphone 5. This time I wasted money. Last month I plant to buy Iphone 5S. But I think New Iphone Wiil be WORSE. 2 1
It was only gold. Not rose gold 2 1
This phone was in good condition but was not able to work in my country...advise ensure you have all the info so you would not be at a loset..but I was please with the product just didn't get to enjoy the use of it. 3 2
the name of the product just misrepresented it self http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003BNYD24/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2 it says PURPLE when i recieved the phone it is red i was totally disappointed smhh 2 1
was in rough shape and wasnt unlocked 2 4
did work after three month 4 1
Not near the phone as our previous Casio G'zone Ravines. Like the loud ring tones. 3 2
Makes a call and the screen goes blank and cant hang up on them. 2 3
it's very nice, thank you so muchbut I miss the head phone set, it come without. 3 4
completely satisfied with this product orders arrived the day stipulated ... agree with the request if this provider would advisebut does not work with 3g 4 3
TraduzcaTraducci√≥n HumanaVery good product, it lived up to my expectations, very well conserved, the only downside is the generic charger that they gave me exploded, fortunately had not passed anything to cellular phones in the otherwise very good team 4 3
The phone is reliable it works a lilttle slow and the home button has to be pressed hard but after that it is a good product 3 4
I had no problem with the product, was surprise that I received it so fast. The style of the phone was also amazing, really thin and small, fits perfectly in my purses. Good buy. 4 5
The phone doesn't keep time! I carry my old cracked one around so I know what time it is... Probably why I got such a good deal... 1 5
It has some scratches on the frame and it looks like it has been used for a few months. Not brand new. 2 4
I am happy with the BlackBerry Classic: love the keyboard and the 'touch' features; the Blackberry Hub makes accessing all messages a breeze; the screen size works for me; with the features and apps I literallyhave a tablet in my hand. However, the charging feature is a serious short-coming: I can only charge this device when it is turned on. 4 3
very nice phone and i like it 5 4
This phone immediately had issues.- Data was slow everywhere-Phone froze, was stuck in a white screen. Even after restarting and trying other recommended remedies.-Luckily I got a full refund, ordered from the same seller. New Iphone 5 looked and worked great. 1 4
I would have given this phone 5 stars if I was able to use it with Cricket Wireless. Apparently, they didn't know what they were doing because I took it to T-Mobile and within 5 minutes of walking through their doors, they were able to get it to work. I wound up switching to T-Mobile and getting a different phone that I fell in love with, the Samsung S6 Edge+. Long story short, I couldn't get my money back because it didn't meet the warranty requirements. 3 2
Updated Review:Lowering my rating to 2 stars because I'm starting to hate this phone. This phone is becoming slower and slower. I even tried cleaning up old text messages but nothing helps. I have to wait like 5 seconds for it to find a contact and then it lags a couple more seconds before it starts dialing. Blackberry has stopped releasing patches which really sucks because one the last few patches released sometime in the beginning of 2016 really screwed something up with the Bluetooth pairing. Every time I start my car up I don't know what my phone is doing but you can't send text messages for like 20 minutes!!! If you go for a short drive to meet someone up your only option is to call them because it still doesn't work even after the Bluetooth is disconnected.Previous review:Finally they started listening to their customer's! Got rid of my iPhone 6 and couldn't be happier. I stopped calling, texting and emailing people because it was a major pain with that toy. This thing just works and is great for communicating with people. For those that like to game there is the Amazon App store. Gave it 4 stars because it's a pain to install google maps and what's up with the non-removable battery. 2 3
Bad batterie in it. Apple covers it, but said it typically would not. Apple saved the day. This could I have been a very bad deal. Phone would power off at 33% after I just got the phone. Apple stated "do to the fact this phone was a refer-be they were not going to warranty it but, the tech at the store did not note it so they will cover it"! 3 1
I got this iPhone right on time but there were many problems with that. Camera didn't work. All information from previous owner was their. Basically seller didn't clean up the phone and everything such as email contact numbers and etc we're there. I return the item and got my money back. 2 1
Next time I will get a better one 3 5
Its really a Excellent product but charger plug on cell phone side is super loose. Since its charger is not universal that creates dependency incase of loose plug otherwise its worth to give 5 stars. 2 3
The cell looked good, but it wasnt new, was refurbished . I had problems with keybord, had to change it. 2 3
This item was purchased for someone else. its used really battered! but for this price! what would one expect. this item came a day early! and with no damage 2 3
I brought this for my girlfriend and she loves the phone. I don't like Apple I prefer Samsung but she like this product! 4 5
I asked other people questions on Amazon about whether it would work with digi mobil (movistar). Everyone said it would. It required a sim adapter.So now on to my review.Anyone who gives this phone 5 stars has never owned a premium smartphone. For this review I am comparing to my Samsung Galaxy S5Touchscreen: With the factory provided screen protector on, sometimes its unresponsive, sometimes it freezes. I have to hold down on a touch screen button most of the time for the phone to realize its being touched and then less than half the time the button will respond. Take the screen protector off and it works marvelously, but then you risk damaging the screen.Network: Movistar DigiMobil (pay as you go plan) When I got my SIM I bought a Samsung Galaxy Young 2 to use it in. No major issues aside from phone size. In the young 2 my whatsapp worked fine and I could send texts and make phone calls in my whatsapp on only my mobile network no Wifi. Now that my SIM is in the Lenovo, it will not allow me to transmit in whatsapp at all unless connected to wifi.-In addition, there is no Internet or google play access without wifi.This is a s*** phone and is being returned 1 3
Very good service and phone working well. 4 5
When I recharge the battery is very hot hot hot 3 2
The iphone is good, the cable is not. Doesn't work, must not be an Apple cable. 4 3
My son loves his iPhone. Great product! 4 5
u sold me this phone and told me that charger is on the way and is been 3 month,when is the charger coming 3 1
This unit is the second unit that I got off line. The unit I got was supposed to be very good but this is the third I have gotten and this on like the others does not work correctly. This unit when slid open reset and it takes 2 to 3 minutes to reset. I do not believe there is a working Blackberry 9800 torch. A working Torch is great but The first one worked great for 1 year and the speaker blew out. The next one just did not work but it was reconditioned and returned. The next one was a very good unit that again did not work. This one locks the screen or resets the whole phone and very seldom rings. I just bought a new one but I am not holding my breath. 3 1
Works great. Bit clunky but can not complain 3 4
Received on time works just like new only minor ware but it's alright 5 4
I love my phone, the camera takes wonderfull photos. the battery whent dead after three months but I guess it's a BB's problem and not from the seller 4 5
Haven't gotten around to thinking about dislikes yet 4 2
I bought this blackberry bold 9780 hoping to arrive as stated in the specification. BUT unfortunately it was not. on the website says it is RCN72UV model but the model that comes to me is RBE41GW. is a model that does not work 3G in my country. IS A PITY THAT HAVE TO FEEL BUYING FROM AMAZON FRUSTRATION. The phone itself is fine, it's new (I think). Battery comes without any details or leave me the impression that it is fake?..............yo compre este blackberry bold 9780 con la esperanza de que llegara tal como dec√≠a en la especificaci√≥n. PERO lastimosamente no fue as√≠. en la p√°gina web dice que es modelo RCN72UV pero el modelo que me llega es RBE41GW. es un modelo que no funciona 3G en mi pa√≠s. ES UNA L√ÅSTIMA QUE TENGA QUE SENTIR FRUSTRACI√ìN COMPRANDO DE AMAZON. El tel√©fono en s√≠ esta bien, es nuevo (creo). la bater√≠a viene sin ning√∫n detalle o sea me deja la impresi√≥n que es falsificado? 3 4
creo que el producto segun los comentarios que lei antes de comprar decia que funcionaba bien para las bandas 3G de movistar y movilnet venezuela y por eso lo compre, pero el que me llego a mi trae las bandas 1, 4 , 8 que aqui en venezuela funciona para digitel 3 4
The battery hasn't got much life 4 2
great phone, good price, fast shipping, only problem was the extra charge by FedEx that I did not expect. 3 5
I REALLY LIKED THE IPHONE IT WAS A PLACE WHERE I COULD LISTEN TO ALL MY MUSIC. BUT TO DOWNLOAD APPS WAS HARD BECAUSE OF THE IOS 3 4
I have had some problems with this phone but, in general, it is in good conditions. I recommend every body to contact the seller first before buying to ensure the full functionality of your future device. The devices, they are selling, are used but they have to be able to do all their operations. With the money I expended to repair my device, I could have bought a new one. 3 2
The phone came with some scratches in the back that weren't mentioned in the description. Also came with some photos and one of a naked man. Totally inappropiate. The delivery in perfect time. 4 2
battery went to zero in a matter of minutes, took 3 days to shutoff completely so the buttons would work. battery is not swappable so you can't just pop the battery to get your phone rebooted fast. if no reset button, battery should be swappable by the customer. returned it. otherwise it was a slick phone. maybe bigger than I wanted, can't really carry it in your front jeans pocket or top shirt pocket. 5 inch max outer dimension is the perfect size and still big enough for smart phone use. 2 5
This phone was locked, although I ordered an unlocked phone. It also came with a verizon sim although I ordered an international unlocked phone. Would not recommend this to anyone. 2 1
My daughter is very happy with it 4 5
It did come faster than expected but it came with many complications. The functionality is great but it did have multiple cracks in the screen. Whoever had it before me didn't fulfill there AT&T contract so I have to pay to get the phone unkocked instead of having it f one through the carrier. Lastly, when I turn on the Photo Stream, pictures that aren't mine pop up... Most of them very explicit pictures. 2 5
Bad buy battery is problem and phone do what it want 2 1
Used this unlocked GSM Nokia Asha 302 in the Philippines just recently (Jan-Feb 2015). Excellent, no problem with functionality. Bought a P40 SIM card at the airport & presto! It worked. I passed it on to my brother the instant I came back to the US. He will be visiting the Philippines soon. It was very easy to use. Having been used to smart phones w/ touch screen, I surprised myself when I worked w/ it easily not having read the instructions to operate it. I'll buy another one like this & definitely an upgraded version of this Nokia unlocked GSM phone. 5 4
it didn't even have the SIM card and it was scratched from the corners 1 2
I have no problem taking the phone to straight talk.The phone came in about 3weeks. The only thing I didn't like was the camera its horrible when trying to get a take picture the pictures wasn't clear 4 3
I bought a refurbished phone it did not look right at all. The silver trim would easily peel away from the phone and the piece of plastic above the keyboard with the call/end keys did not line up correctly with the rest of the phone.It ran pretty slow, but I'm sure that can be attributed to the BlackBerry OS. 2 3
The phone I ordered was refurbished and I thought it was supposed to function like a somewhat new iphone 4 and it doesn't. My iphone 5 was stolen so I needed a quick fix and I thought this phone would be perfect, however it has very many flaws. The phone always freezes, it always says memory full (when it isn't), the charger it came with doesn't work, and the list goes on and on. The only reason why I didn't return it was because I really needed a phone in the meantime before I bought something better than the 4. The only positive was the price, and I mean it was pretty cheap so I guess I got what I paid for. 1 3
I got it for my uncle and I no he is going to enjoy his new phone 3 5
Nice phone, so far !!! 5 4
Arrived super quick & works perfectly fine 3 5
This phone was for ATT so I had to change from Verizon over to them. It says it's compatible with all companies. The phone has already stopped working. I went this direction to save me some money for now but ended up spending more buying a new phone and going back to Verizon whom I will stay with due to issues also with ATT. There was no receipt in the box in case you needed to return or contact the seller. The phone was okay, it looked good but didn't last long. 2 1
My brother had asked me to get him a BB within a affordable range of prices. I got him this one and he is simply thrilled!Not only it has more features than the previous versions, but it also has the option of being used both touch screen and key pad...I have not used it, but seing the way he's in love with it, I can only say that it met his expectation. Great product. 4 5
the power button went out five mins after haveing it was a nice phone if it had worked , just got a bad one i guess but they got my refund to me write away 2 3
Second phone I have purchased from Amazon..., This one worked two weeks before freezing up. I read all the reviews and chose to try again but was disappointed for a second time. Our phones make or break our business so not having usage for an hour can impact our lives. Amazon has always faired well with every other purchase we have made. 2 5
iphone is iCloud locked please send me email and password via email toaaronnation23@aol.com 5 1
I got it for less than 60 bucks. Have had it for like two weeks and I have no complains so far.The Camera could be better (specially the front facing) but is not that bad [I'm not a selfie fan anyway].The system is fluid. It works better than muy old BLU Avance 4 which was kind of slow.Speaker quality is also not the best, but to me not a big deal.I'm happy with it, considering what I paid.'''''''''''''''''''''UPDATE''''''''''''''''''''''''''Well, just after 5 months with this cellphone, it DIED. Not even a year it lasted.I was happy with it.Now it just will not turn on.I plug in the charger and the LED turns on but that's it. 1 4
Very disappointing, the back cover and a defect does not say, even the two - year contract contract, I want to complain!!!! 1 2
I've only just received this phone a day ago, so I am still fiddling with it. Some small issues so far, such as - I have been unable find an N7100 case that actually will fit properly, the mic and headphone jack openings do not match the device. The included stylus does not work properly with the screen and there is no way to re-calibrate it, screen seems to work better with my finger. And, while it is great to include the extra battery, there is no included external charger, so it is useless to swap them. Unless, of course, you manage to find a compatible charger sold separately. Last issue, even though my carrier offers 4g service, I have yet to get 3g reception (this phone is suppose to be capable of 3g) even in the heart of town near the carrier's tower.On the good side, the phone was not $500 - $800 as you would expect to pay for Samsung's Galaxy Note II. I love the quality and functionality of Samsung's Galaxy line, but simply cannot afford the prices. As such, I will learn to live with this knock-off's flaws. 3 5
The phone was in great conditions make sure to ask for the real descriptions of the phone and that the phone is ESN clean 3 5
this iphone was worth the money i paid, it was cheap therefore i was expecting some sort of minimum malfunction, happens that the home button was a bit warned out but still workedno complains 3 1
This model is not good for China Mobile. 2 3
Phone came to me clean and beautiful looked like it was never used before. Shipped to me super fast in only 2-3 days. Problem came with activation... Whoever had this phone HAS AN OUTSTANDING BALANCE and it will not allow me to unlock this phone for use. I am promptly returning it ASAP buyer beware... 1 5
I got this product and I thought that the phone was going to be working. Come to find out that the Sim card tray was no good and it couldn't ready any Sim card from any carrier. The exterior of the phone was in good condition though. 3 2
it fuctions. I ordered a 100-5 but got a 100-3 not a big deal. delivered on time. 4 3
The phone is good, but not perfect. The number of apps is enough, but it is not so fluent when using the apps. 4 3
the headphone does not work. 2 1
I just got a replacement of this device and it auto restarts like crazy......I wish I didn't have to have this phone anymore 1 2
So far I have had two of these. And so far both phones have lasted about a month to a month and a half before the touch screen stops working and ive had to order a replacement. Don't get me wrong the phone itself was fine and had no other problems it just isn't all that I was expecting even for an aneroid. 2 3
This phone is a good choice to change from an all digital system and analogical one. The size is a middle one, and you have a good support from Black Berry at the moment that your data is lost. 4 3
JOHN , I HAD BOUGHT THE PHONE AND HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM WITH THE FIRMWARE ,HOW DID U FLASH IT WITH THE INTERNATIONAL VERSION . PLS DO ASSIST .THANK U . 3 4
The phone looks like new but it's not 2 1
The condition of the phone exceeded my expectations! 5 4
I haven't been able to use the internet since I got ot turned on and my service has data with it. 2 3
I bought this phone as an unlocked phone but later found upon revving it found out that it was locked with Verizon . I felt cheated because I was not expecting this from Amazon , seller of the phones . 3 1
Great phone. I use it instead of iPod, b/c I need multiples in my office and iPods are $199.I just need Pandora and another app. to run music in my officeIt's a little slow and you can't get the latest software, otherwise for the price it's a good phone and I bought 3 of them. 4 5
I was told I was buying a new phone, not a refurbished one. Very upsetting, but it works mostly well. It goes a little crazy when I put the phone in silent mode and the head jack input was dirty (also works mostly well). But I afraid that this phone won't last. I guess if you want new you should buy straight from apple. 1 3
I found it difficult to get it working in Dominican Rep. I had to go to many different places before the " Unlocked fro any GSM carrier worldwide" would work worldwide! 3 4
The phone did not come with a manual so I went on line but was not able to download any info. about that model. I tried using it to get familiar with the functions. It kept dropping text messages and wifi would not work. Also the sound quality was not great. 2 3
I like the size of the screen but this phone is very slow especially when you are downloading a app it takes forever. when your going from one screen to back to home page it takes forever I don't know why....what doesn't it play videos it stops half way thru very very slow moving is there anything I can do to make it move faster and it freezes up 2 3
It's a good phone:). It's got a purple color in the middle of the screen but it's not that noticeable. And I have no scratches on it:) 5 3
It's nice and works just fine, 5 3
No problem with the cell. It works amazingly well 4 5
I recieved the phone and it only worked for about a month then it wouldnt ring on the phone text or alarm settings. 2 1
I've had no issues with this phone. This is my third iPhone. My original one from Apple had a button that stopped working while it was under warranty, so they replaced it with a refurbished one. That didn't last as long unfortunately. So we had to buy out of pocket. So far no complaints with this product. 5 4
Attractive phone but did not work upon arrival. I would not recommend. 1 2
arrived in time before my trip, thanks a bunch! Apparently the phone was still locked! costed me an extra $40 to unlocked the unit so it could be used in Mexico. No big deal but thought I mention...Phone was in great condition as per description. Thank you 5 4
this was the last blackberry I bought, the battery did not work well, really bad!The phone was wrong but the battery is terrible, do not know if it was just my case or something generic on these phones 2 3
The phone is okay. Keys are too small for my hands. The battery life is terrible, I have to keep switching back to my old phone to saty up & running. I wish I had b ought a slide-out keyboard type phone instead. For the money...disappointed! 3 2
Loved everything about the phone except the camera which totally sucked if you didn't have the perfect lighting situation. If having a good camera isn't important to you then it's a good phone. 2 3
This is my first time with my own smartphone and my experience is very limited. But for the price, I guess it could be expected that there seems to be something lacking in the phone. The manual is lacking in details about the phone, no explanations on how to open phone and installing SIM and microSD cards or that if you use a SD card that you can only use one SIM card. 3 4
We used the phone with AT&T with out a problem, but unfortunately when we switched to another carrier we learned that the phone was not unlocked as advertised and all attempts to unlock it have futile! (First Straightalk and then Metro PCS) 2 5
I use this phone for the apps and for wi-fi. I cannot use it as a phone because everyone I tried said they were not capatible the whole reason I picked a phone without a SIM card was so I could choose who I wanted as my carrier but after spending an entire day driving around I found out it wasn't capatible with Straight Talk, Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, Boost, or T- Mobile. So if you need a phone to use as a phone don't pick this one but if you are looking for something you can use for the apps and to get on line using wifi then the phone works great. 3 5
Phone in perfect condition other than tiny scratch near edge of screen. More than $100 less than phone store. Would like ability to purchase warranty, however. 4 5
Love the pink blackberry but the battery does not hold charge. Good price overall 4 3
This phone works good for text messages and calls, but the is about it. The camera, radio, TV functions all don't work. I kind of knew that going in, thats why my review is not less. 3 2
Still use it,came in locked,had to get a code to unlock it.It loses service and I have to keep doing a battery pull each time to reset it.Still using it but I would still recommend it as a good product. 4 5
I have had it for 2 months now. It definitely is a great phone, but does have some shortfalls. The phone is well built and although made of plastic, does feel like a very good solid build - almost as solid as an Iphone, without the weight. Screen is good, although I tend to keep my brightness at 60% to get a comparable display to my iphone. The colors are not as luch as my iphone - a tad washed out but after a while you dont even notice. the sound of the external speakers is amazing! I love it. the sound of the phone with headphones/earphones, both good quality and the ones it came with it, is good - but very low - no matter what app i use to watch videos/hear music, i find it to be a little low for my taste. The vanilla OS is awesome, but after installing just a few apps and 2 months use, the phone now feels very sluggish and and slow.. I find myself constantly having to clean my ram etc. For the price point, its OK.. I think it should cost a little lower considering other phones out there in the under $200 range which easily outperform this device. my true love and reason for buying this phone is the thickness and feel of it... besides that, didnt fine much special about it. Also, my phone appeard to be a 're-pack' as the box was not sealed, and my headphones were defective. I called Alcatel support for an exchange on the headphones and they were very nice and said they will simply send me out a new pair. That was two months ago, i never got anything. I still have to call them again. sux i have to chase them down for something I purchased (supposedly) brand new. the 3 stars however are for the phone, and have nothing to do with the headphone/used phone experience. 3 2
3G Would not work with T Moble carrier. You can 2G but we were expecting 3G.We returned the 2 phones and had to by new 9900 phones. 2 4
it's a good phone for taking pic, messaging and texting. Down side is have to log in to download every app. 4 3
I really wanted to like this device, but after opening it I noticed a bright spot near the bottom of the display. After a few days this spot grew into two and got much brighter. Tapping the screen, made that area flash almost as if it were under a lot of pressure.Performance of the phone was good, but in the end I returned it before the display issue really panned out. Does not matter how inexpensive a product is, it should arrive in 100% working condition. 3 2
the phone its good, really fast, came with a 2gb sd memory and only english, but the t-mobile doesnt work 3G movistar venezuela, should have known before the purchase. 4 2
not as good as vivo 5 or vivo 5r but a good phone none the less. 4 3
returned would not read sim card. 3 2
Recebi no tempo correto, o produto √© exatamente o que eu queria, e a negocia√ßao foi perfeita, a embalagem estava intacta.REcomendo o site e tambem o produto. 5 3
Received phone DOA. Such great specs, so bad QC. On searching noticed other are complaining about same where phone does not turn on and does not charge. Petty, I really like the specs of this phone. I will wait a little longer before giving another go. 2 1
Phones in great shape except the flash doesn't work wish they would have said that. 2 3
I like my phone it's really nice comparing to other ones. It works perfectly but the only concern I have is the battery doesn't last for long time don't know why. 5 3
Its an iPhone 4. Nothing too special about it. I got mine fairly fast for where I live (the middle of a cornfield). Ordered a Verizon phone and got a Verizon phone. There were a few small scratches on the back of the phone but I put a case on right away. The only thing wrong is there is a small spot on the screen that is more whited out than the rest of the screen. Not big and not a big issue. Ive been using it for a few months now. I have finally activated the phone and had no issues. Only reason for 4 stars is the whiter spot on the screen. Great seller. 4 5
The charger did not work, there was a huge scratch on the screen, and a even bigger crack by the charging port. Would have pasted with so many issue if they would have been explained in detail. Shipping was fast and timely so that's why I'm posting review 1 4
Product met expectations to the T 4 5
Have only had this phone for sub two weeks and have had nothing but issues out of the box. Constant freezing and crashing, i cant even use certain apps, my photos don't load and the phone straight up goes black screen and restarts at least once a day. Very unhappy customer at this point in time. 1 2
So far, so good . 4 5
Never been a huge fan of iPhones since I was able to escape the brainwashing after the 3GS. Only purchased this for my mother in law who, like all eastern Europeans, love anything apple because it's "premium". The truth is, the iPhone 5 is an outdated, small phone that's very overpriced on the market. 2 4
I was accused by my grandkids of buying a "dinosaur phone", but all I wanted was a phone that I could make calls and texts on, and was told that it could handle that no problem. Well it won't ! When I pull up in my drive it shuts down, and the guy at my carrier (T-Mobile) says it is because it isn't a T-Mobile phone. I haven't figured out what the problem is yet, but I am working on it. So far the phone has been a total disappointment. If I can get the problem solved I might learn to love the phone, but you can't be pleased with something that doesn't work. 1 3
i got a broken batery, it doesn't work. the screen has a pale spot, it looks like the surface is sticked to the inner scree 2 1
Even considering the low price I simply can not recommend this phone. GPS started failing after 6 months of heavy use (used daily as my GPS device). Apparently tech support does not exist. The Android GUI has been butchered, no app button, blurred wallpaper, lots of modifications that don't help at all making the phone run slow despite pretty decent specs (I really hated the PIN entry delay or the phone not even registering my touch). I was forced to root my device and remove a lot of BLU added modifications, installed NOVA launcher and was able to finally have a decent GUI with clear wallpaper that scrolls (for some odd reason this is not available with stock setup). This of course voids the warranty. It is running Android 4.2.1 that is affected by Stagefright vulnerability and you should expect no updates. Ever. No third party ROMs are available and there seems to be very little interest among developer community to do any work with this phone. This will be my first and last BLU phone (this seems to be fairly common among BLU users).For those of you still willing to try to make this phone usable this is what I did to gain root access and modify settingsGained root with framaroot (google it, very simple)Check for app updates in Google Play and install themInstalled NOVA launcher (you can use other launchers just make sure you install one BEFORE you do the next steps)Install Build Prop Tweaker Lite (free) and modify the followingro.gn.navil.lock.scrn=yes change it to noro.gn.navi.launcher.support=yes change it to noRebootPS Keep in mind this will void your warranty but considering you should expect no support from BLU it makes no difference. I have moved on and upgraded to Google Nexus 6 and could not be happier. 2 3
I bought this phone for my 91 year old aunt. It seems very easy for to use. Would certainly recommend it. Purchased another brand senior phone same price that didn't last 2 weeks due to quality of phone screen 5 4
I will be honest about this device i did not like it at first and i wanted to sell it in the next hr after opening it not because it was messed up or the packaging was destroyed because tbh the package and the device is and was flawless (for the device of course lol) but after i downloaded tons of apps (well not tons but a lot more then i had on my last phone) i love this phone. Its fast and its definitely slim. However when i go to go on Facebook i cant go live and on top of that i cant do the emojis like the heart button for the like etc Please bring back that !! 4 5
First iPhone. Have always used a Blackberry. Am happy with the iPhone 4S, works well and iOS easy to use. Have not used Siri. Don't like the fact that you have to have an account at Apple with a Credit card on file if you want to download any apps (even free ones). You cannot set up the account without entering a valid Credit card, but if you use a itunes card (min I've ever seen is $15) you don't need to enter a Credit card. Happy with the product. Find nice headphones and sound is OK. Found Cowon much better as Mp3 player though for music quality. 4 5
So far, so good . 4 5
the phone it self is small. the selfie side of the camera (front side) it terrible. it make it seem like your face/object is 10x its size. so if you like taking pictures I wouldn't recommend this phone 2 3
I'm very pleased with this phone.I haven't had any issues with it since I've had it.delivery was good it got here before the estimated date which is good.its alittle slow but that's all. Overall its a good phone at least for me. 5 4
Really nice phone... the one i received is just like a new handset.no issues so far. 4 5
My plan phone was ruined at a beach party and I wasn't due for an upgrade for many months. This was a great deal and a good phone! Amazon shipped it super fast and I couldn't be happier with the phone 4 5
the equipment is released please do not publish false information that is all I play it back, that waste of time do not recommend 3 1
Everything is outdated! You literally can't download any apps. Kik, sc, etc. The safari breaks down all the time too. Waste of money. Only thing that works is the camera with bad quality. 1 2
The battery died in less than 24/hours.... 1 2
This is coming from a BB lover since 2002My issues w/ this phone and the BB OS- No Uber app.- This new BB is too wide. 9900 was perfect.Otherwise, the phone is great with the return of the 4 BB hard buttons.Sidenote: I wish that BB didn't waste it's precious resources developing it's own new OS - as their are major glitches w/ Android apps from Amazon Store. A BB running native Android with a BB interface and keyboard would have been the best solution IMO 2 4
The phone seems to be ok but the battery had to be replaced after less than 6 months 2 3
Just as advertised. Arrived promptly. 4 5
GRACIAS ME LLEGO EL PROCTO QUE COMPRE Y LLEVO EN EL MOMENTO INDICADO Y EN UN BUEN ENVALAJE LO RECOMIENDO SASTIFACTORIAMENTE.. 5 4
So far, so good . 4 5
The device is awesome. But why i don't have Blackberry maps in my home folder? I have it when i search for it. When i use it, its not working. I downloaded Google maps as well and that is not working either. Its connectivity to WiFi networks is slow and the GPS is not properly working I use H2O wireless carrier whit n plan. U think that is it? I think if i get one of those T-mobile or AT&T monthly data plans it can work but still, this bugs me alot. 4 2
Battery was bad from the start. I would have returned but Apple has a free battery replacement on this model number. 4 3
works good for 3G and above. Simple to use. No frills. 5 4
So far, so good. Just wanted to comment that my order came in OVERNIGHT. I ordered it at 10 pm and it was there the next day by 10 am. Its pretty impressive. 4 5
I was not happy with the internet was very slow with t mobil service, the ringer volume was too low and the color was very dim 1 2
did not work correctly. Out of 20 times that we tried to swipe to unlock the screen, it only unlocked maybe 2 times. However, we contacted seller and were able to return it. 2 1
I lost a Blackberry and replaced it with an updated model.I did go the Verizon (before ordering it through Amazon) who sold me a touch screen phone along with a "free" tablet which was not the easiest phone to operate AND would not accept my returning the tablet without a $175 return fee.and charging me a $10+ monthly fee to have it sit in my office. 3 1
This phone drove me crazy. I returned it because it didn't work very well. It was OK most of the time on Wi-Fi. Using the cell tower was another thing entirely. I would be sitting in my recliner and it would go from 3 or 4 bars to no signal at all for no apparent reason. A minute later it would be back. Bluetooth would send but not receive. Data transmission would frequently stop. I had to turn off data and then turn it back on to get it to work again. Then I figured out I could just put it in airplane mode and then switch that off again, which was faster. If I laid it down on my leg it would block the signal. Once I missed about ten seconds of a call from doing that.Among good points to the phone would be a pretty good camera and a ridiculous number of ring tones to choose from, I'd guess at least 120. I'd advise against buying this phone, though some folks seem to like it. 2 3
¬†First let me begin with a specific piece of information that I think needs to be stated. I will test this phone with a SIM borrowed but I won't really be using it long term with cellular service at this time. I do want to offer an opinion on call and reception quality though so it will be tested in this way.Results... calls are clear on both ends without any issues and seems to be working fine in relation to both 3G and 4G.On to the rest of the phone done with the pro/con format:Pro:Big screen, bright and easy to see.MicroSD expansion option3000mAh batteryPretty good cameras (mostly the rear is what I care about)Lot of memoryNice colorDual SIM (not that I'm likely to use it though)Cons:Plastic (I'm used to aluminum phones)Fixed batteryLower clocked CPU @ 1.8Ghz (Quad core though)Button placement (biggest con for me)Speakers (I'm used to front facing Harman Kardon speakers)Additional thoughts:The interface is a love hate thing for most people. I really love the HTC Sense GUI and so I am used to that in my last three phones. The Asus Zen GUI is really nice and many useful Asus apps are included. The layout I was originally concerned about but turns out I could VERY easily live with it daily. I was very pleasantly shocked by how smooth and fast and intuitive things are with this phone. In the end it comes down to personal preference. (I really dislike the Samsung GUI for example but like their hardware).Price... I feel for the speed and overall look and feel and being unlocked it is a very good phone, feels a lot like a flagship model in operation also it doesn't offer all the bells and whistles some phones are currently sporting.Question:Since I am not using it like a normal cell phone why do I want it?Answer:I dislike killing my main phone's battery and want the portability of a phone but the functionality of a tablet. This phablet is the perfect compromise offering a great size and feature set.I have a drone that needs a phone to control it and portability is an important factor so this is a nice quick device that I am hoping works well to use with my drone as the remote control. Around WiFi I can surf the web and check emails and not use my main cell. Also nice to have a backup phone and I may even use this as a pay as you go option at some point so I didn't want to get into big money with a phone to find out I won't use it.So plenty of good and not so good but overall none of the cons are all that bad considering $250 beats $600+. If you can use this phone on your network then I don't think you can go wrong with it.Review sample provided free or at a discounted price for a fair, unbiased, and honest review. 4 5
A very cool design, awsome layout, and good quality for a really fair price. The only problem with the phone that I've had is with putting in the SD card and SIMs card in and phone will reboot itself sometimes but all is good for how much it is 5 4
I received this cell phone locked and I bought it unlocked, I am not satisfied. Dont sell products with features they do not have. 3 1
The telephone receipt a bit late but enough good works of I throw only lacking him the memory of 16 gb because of it do not give him the complete qualification one sees good to be reconstructed 4 3

Refurbished but not properly because there is not work microphone üé§ properly and must talk throw the speaker, at service center say OMG you must change more the one MIC 2 3
I still have this phone, I am determined to unlock it, it is super tied toVerizon, and it is not anyones fault except Verizon, they tell everyone who buysthese phones from them they are unlocked but they are not. On Blackberry wasabsolutely sealed on the back, so no sim card could be put in or another battery.The absolute nerve of these people. But, still the way to get it unlocked is tofind a teenager who knows cell phones, which ones don't? Or go to a geek I willgo to a geek. I love this phone, easy to carry and easy to use.It meets all my needs and was shipped right away. I will prevail as soon asI can get to the city and find a geek place to get this opened and running.Again Amazon has the best prices and fast shipping on such great cell phones,check them out first. 2 5
Covers a lot of LTE bands and I tested it and it works (LTE) with ATT and T-Mobile SIM cards. I have bought it because it covers the international LTE bands too - very few devices have this amount of bands, especially for this price.As opposed to other phones, both SIM's are capable of LTE (one at a time), so it's easy when you travel just to add a SIM and not deal with the "home" SIM at all.LCD screen quality is good. Not OLED good, but still good.I took one star out because the WiFi doesn't support 5GHz band. In today's crowded 2.4GHz WiFi spectrum, it is a must. 4 3
No update for kitkat and a poor 13 megapixel camera in the back. Turn off wifi , blue tooth and data while not using . Drains battery fast. Cheap phone . It works.....nice display 3 2
I've bought this Apple iPhone 5 in March this year. It worked in the beginning well, but it stop charging two months ago. This was supposed to be a certified iphone. That wasn't fair. 1 2
It was not Locked to Sprint it was locked to Verizon. 2 1
Arrived quickly. Bought this a while back, and my experience with this phone it okay, kind of weird didn't have a sim card slot even though it said it would, but whatever. A good small phone that'll do the job, and a good price. 4 5
This phone works great for a middle-of-the-line phone. It is functional and easy to use. Compact and holds a charge better than most smart phones on the market. 4 5
I came to this phone from using a Nexus 4 for the last two and a half years and my initial impressions were very mixed. Starting with the positive things, I love the LTE, the bigger and more color accurate screen, the battery life, the expandable storage, the dual front facing speakers, and how light it is and how thin it is. All big improvements! I also appreciate the very light touch Alcatel used with their skin on Android. It's almost stock.So many great things and yet it was almost all brought down by an Achilles heel. The thing that really bugged me was that moving in and out of apps was really sluggish and choppy and not smooth at all. All of these things are super smooth on the Nexus 4, which is a 2012 phone. Even swipe typing on Google Keyboard was not great. I came pretty close to sending it back and getting a new Moto G.(I have no proof of this, but my guess is that the phone sends almost all of its processes to the slower of the two chipsets in the Snapdragon 615, the one clocked at 1ghz. Unfortunately there's no "high performance" option anywhere that would make everything run on the 1.5ghz chipset. The Nexus 4 proves this is plenty to run Android smoothly.)I didn't want to get a Moto G, especially after seeing (and hearing, seriously those speakers are great) this phone. Thankfully, Android is a pretty flexible OS and I was able to take matters into my own hands and make things more palatable. First thing I did was turn all animations off in the developer options. Second thing I did was I installed Nova launcher and selected the options to make things run "faster than light." Everything is MUCH smoother after doing those two things. Still not quite as smooth as the Nexus 4, but probably 95% of the way there. Close enough where I can deal with it and I can enjoy the good things about the phone that I admittedly skimped on in the first paragraph.So I really like this phone now. It's everything I wanted. It just took some tinkering to get there. 4 3
i love it except the 0 key dont work when i hit it it shows up as a 6 instead 4 3
received the phone quickly, though this says black I received a white one which is just as good reguardless.. nothing wrong with the seller or anything just the phone itself has a few quirks I think is due to maybe the phone company. other then that it is in great condition 4 5
Had this phone for 6 months now with no issues. Works just as well and better than any $700 phone I have had. Seriously folks, it's a phone. We call, we text and we surf the web, why pay $700 for the newest Samsung. It's crazy. Will never buy another high priced phone again. 5 4
The phone is being returned because the battery would not charge properly. The phone appeared new and I never had the Apple store check it out, so it may or may not be a refurb, returned or used one. Remember that these 4S phones were all built at the same time. So that means that even if you get a new phone, it will have an ancient battery. The phone would take an inordinately long time to charge and would never get up to 100%. After three weeks it got so bad that I was trying to charge it almost all day long. and had to put it into airplane mode so that it could even get up to 40% charge.I would recommend that anyone buying an older phone be very careful to see that the phone charges normally right out of the gate. If it does not, send it back. 2 1
Great phone! I really thought there would a lot pf scratches on it but there was totally nothing it is like brand new the only complaint i have was that the charger was broken but is ok i bought one and it works perfectly fine thank you for the phone 5 4
good phone great price i am happy 4 5
Absolutely perfect, excellent battery life, and I truly abuse it in this respect, yet it lasts for the entire day and I still have 30-40% battery left in the evening. If I just use it for calls, when I am not working, it will easily last 4-5 days.... You can get BB and Amazon apps, so I dont understand why they dont simply allow for Google apps, since most will work with no issues, in fact I have not tried one that didnt work, but there is a special process to get them to install. And finally the BB OS which as far as I am concerned is the best out there in every respect, with functionality that no one else offers....Blackberry could easily be the market leader, the reason they are not I attribute to idiotic Executive Decisions. 4 3
Battery was dead (like in need of replacement) when I received it. 4 1
I bought three of these phones before,I got case and ear piece this time I did not get a case or an ear piece>The phone looks ok haven't used it Im giving my sister it as a gift 3 1
Because it have a fail in the screen, i have been here in the EE.UU for 8 days more, please i need an answer quickly 1 3
The phone packaging was great! However, when it came to the actual phone I was rather a but disappointed!Firstly, the phones home button is not properly in and wabbles around like it will pop out any second! Secondly, the battery life is not the greatest, especially for the price. And lastly, the phone is rather laggy and quite slow! 4 3
I bought the BlackBerry Bold 9000 in spite of what other users had written. Well, it wasn't my lucky day. The battery was not an official battery (appeared to be a knockoff), the screen would go white after 20 minutes of use (I attribute this to the battery as well) and the video camera would not function properly. I have sent my defective one back to Amazon and requested a replacement so hopefully it was just a fluke. 2 1
Buenos d√≠asEl producto llego en excelentes condiciones y el proceso de compra fue rapido y muy efectivo. muy buena compra les recomiendo este proveedor para sus futuras compras 4 3
The phone works great the plastic over the sceen looked old but when I removed it the phone look like new.... 4 3
Cheap quality touch screen broke on a 8 inch fall. The accessories that comes with the equipment are cheap also. 1 2
I would have liked to know more about ordering ipods so I could have helped my grandkids make thecorrect order. As it stands, the wrong items were ordered and only one of them has indicated arefund will be issued. 2 5
I returned this item because it would not charge. However, the credit back to my credit card was immediate. 1 3
I bought this iPhone for my husband his been using it for 3 days already , so far no problems I connect the phone with Metro PCs everything is ok so far. 4 5
Excelente producto lo que yo estaba esperando adquirir me sirvio aqui en Venezuela buen precio me gusta mucho lo rec 4 5
why you take from my credit carte yhe amente of 360 dollarsi send to you your apple phone because this ulockedand you telle me okwahts this 5 2
When I read the article description i thought that i would buy a nice iPhone in good conditions for a nice price.After using it a few times i got shocked and very anoyed because the cellphone has a displaydamage.There is a line in the display probably caused by letting the phone fell down.The description said nothing about it so i feel quiet engaged by the sellar!!! 1 3
this phone has poor talk quality and it is not a 3g phone itis a 2g phone i called at&t to have them send me a new sim they asked for a imei # when i gave it to them them told me that is was 2g and they do not used 2g phone anymore and the internet is slow that is because it is a edge network not 3g!!!! overall the phone is a 3 out of 10 2 3
This Device works fine on some days but then won't work at all on others. The speaker seems to go out a lot and more frequently now since it has been used for a month now? 3 2
is a good product and I is working very well, this provider met my expectations by giving me a good quality product, I am very pleased with this purchasethanks 3 5
after 1 year is having some issues 3 4
Great entry phone and it would be a good phone for average users too. Smooth performance for everyday tasks. Both cameras are fair, take shots quite fast. Sound quality is above average, nice and loud, and it comes with JBL in-ear earphones, which are quite good too. Also features an update to Android Marshmallow, available as soon as you turn on the phone. Battery isn't great but it lasts for the day. Overall quality is really good, it's as good as I expected for the money I spent. 5 3
I found this phone to be a good purchase. It arrived on time and as it was described. I have yet to find any fault with it. 4 5
Product arrived as advertised...had USB wall plug and connector. Phone did not have most recent update, but easily accepted it. Arrived charged which was nice. No case or instructions, but the screen was immaculate and only very minor wear was shown on the back of the phone.Fired up immediately after installing my TMobile sim card in the tray. Good deal and great price. 4 5
I would of gave it five stars. The phone looked great. The only issue was that it was still attached too the previous owners iTunes account. There for I was unable to activate this phone. 3 1
it was in good condition but it was taking too long to load and when pressing the apps it stays too long or i have to turn it side ways 3 2
IT IS A CDMA PHONE THAT DOES WORK HERE IN THE BAHAMAS, I AM SO PISSED AT THIS PURCHASE! NEVER AGAIN WILL I DO THIS EVER! SO THE PHONEIS WORTHLESS HERE! 2 1
Love my phone and the service I received from J&R they are great! 4 5
The BB9900 phone is not a new one.1.The USB port is dirty and with mark of scratch.2.Headset is not original.Quality is bad.3.The surface of phone have mark of scratch. 2 3
The phone That Was selected in the section of unlocked phones, so It was like I was looking, for When I Get My Hands I Noticed That the equipment is locked and in my country I can not unlock. I am not Satisfied with the purchase and request that I change it so we can make use of the phone you buy. Apple iPhone 4 Black Smartphone 32GB (AT&T) 1 4
So excited to get it but we have had our I phone 4 for 3 weeks and one speaker is out and the home button sticks. :( but you can't beat the price and the phone looks great. :) 3 2
Wasn't unlock had to ship it to the states to get apple to unlock it 1 3
Let's be clear, this phone is great if we still lived in 2006, you know the year before the iPhone. Let's face it, the year is 2015, and a phone with specs from 4 years ago does not cut it. Granted, this phone is designed for the "mobile professional", however they are not all boring, they might want to play a game or two - outside of the legendary Brick Breaker. The phone is one of the best built phones you can buy right now, no seriously you drop this, the phone will be fine. It's just not an impressive feature list. Ok, it runs Android apps - great! Not so great, they are slow, crash often and you need to run this in a special size mode that cuts that 3.5 inch display in half. The keyboard is phenomenal, you can't match a true dedicated keyboard to on-screen tapping. John Chen, BlackBerry's CEO said that he wants "younger" buyers to check out the Classic... Sorry John, anything with the name classic, should remain in the past. 2 3
This product arrived on time. I haven't had the phone activated. But this experience was a A+.No problems. 4 5
I love this phone. I had an ipod that died and my android phone broke. I bought this as a used phone but it was in new condition. I love the iphone because I can sync it with my ipad and use it in place of my ipod that died. I just hope the battery holds up well. 5 3
Ordered this iPhone as a replacement phone for samsung captivate. Although there were a few mistakes made I am enjoying my new phone (day 1). The seller was very helpful and very courteous and helped solve any issues I had! Good customer service! Completely recommend. 4 5
The Battery power is great! It usually lasts me 3 days when I use it only when needed. Only downside is that Windows doesn't carry most of the apps as Androids. The camera was decent but not great. Sound was again just decent. I like the size perfect for people with small hands like myself. Storage is poor but perfect with a MicroSD. In all I give it a 3 out of five. I still prefer Androids with Google Playstore 3 5
ok for the most part.. very durable, wish phone were still made as durable. I use it mostly for work.... 4 3
Apperantly the package got lost so I didn't get my item at all. I was really mad and waiter for 3 weeks. The only thing I got was my money back 1 3
The phone does not hold a charge for very long and shuts off when it at 50% charge. 3 1
So far, so good . 4 5
This phone was great for about the first week I had it. Now I have to restart it about 2x a day because it freezes so much. It has trouble connecting to the WIFI, and it runs really slow. It has about a gig of space left on it, and none of the apps I use are very heavy. Not to mention I close them all the time! Going to be looking for a new phone very soon. Will not buy again. 1 2
Is original product and works perfectly well 4 5
I've had this phone for just over 6 months now.First, my first one flat out died around Christmas. I woke up and it was just dead, not even a response to power.I sent it to ASUS and they sent me a replacement since it could not be repaired. Process took 3 weeks; kinda long to go without a new phone in hand.PROS- Phone is typically speedy- Plenty of storage with a 64GB microSD card- Phone looks great- Battery lasts over a day for my typical usage. Fast charger works great- First Android phone I haven't felt the need to root- Pictures are crisp and colorfulCONS- Sometimes it takes several minutes after booting for the phone to recognize the apps installed on the external SD card- Crashes are fairly frequent when navigating and streaming music at the same time- First phone died, support was slow for a device you need everyday- Cell reception can vary, usually decent, newer updates have been helping- Some apps fail to load or crash the system frequently, could be due to the Intel processor translating apps made for ARM?- Used to have a case with the cutout, but the ASUS Cover app used a lot of battery- Bloat apps can't be uninstalled, just disabled without root.OverallGreat phone for the price but has a few issues. ASUS trickles out updates slowly. Expected the marshmallow update by now.Case:¬†ASUS Cell Phone Case for Zenfone2 - Retail Packaging - Black/BlackScreen Protector:¬†ASUS ZenFone 2 Screen Protector, iVoler¬Æ [2 Pack] ASUS ZenFone 2 Tempered Glass Screen Protector, 0.2mm Slim 2.5D 9H Hardness Featuring Anti-Scratch, Anti-Fingerprint, Bubble Free, Lifetime Warranty 3 2
When I received this phone, which it took about a month. I got the phone I was excited for how big it is, but after waiting so long to get the phone I couldn't even use it without a sim card. Finally got the sim and found out that the internet doesn't work, which means the google play store doesn't work, which means I cant do anything with this phone but call and text. This sucks because im into apps and the internet. Am I the only one who had this problem????? 2 1
It is good for me 4 5
Great phone for the price. 4 5
This vendor sold us an 'as is' phone that didn't work. From day one there was a short in the charge terminal. We tried many different methods to charge the phone and it just wouldn't take a charge. You had to hold the wire 'just so' to get any action and then, it may or may not charge. This phone was a complete waste of money for us. 2 1
My son is using it w ATT and it is great 5 4
The phone was in good condition the only problem I had was that I could not open the slide were you put the sim card and it was very hard to open and closed, also the phone did not work with my AT & T sim card, however I did not had to much of a problem getting my money back, Amazon help me with my credit being put back to my account....thanks Amazon for your help. 2 3
Very inferior camera and came with a bubble in the screen. It had to be returned. 2 1
Shipping errorsInformation is Blackberry Q10 Black 16GB Factory Unlocked, International Version - 4G / LTE 3, 7, 8, 20 (1800/2600/900/800 MHz) (New), in fact, it is Verizon SQN100-2, LTE 13, 4 , CDMA 1xRTT / EVDO Rev A (800/1900 MHz), and, within the battery compartment, no blackberry security tags, printing fuzzy, suspected to be refurbished. 2 3
So it fell out of my pocket the screen broke and the phone couldnt turn on, i went to 2 differemt places who said they cant fix it i gotta buy a new phone. Great! Lasted a full 40 days.. If someone has an idea where i could fix it maybe please let me know 2 3
Freezes alot. But i bought primarily for playing back my music instead of my BB. Its a great phone for SMS and rings really loud. The body is strong and neat 4 3
I bought this used and it had few noticeable scratches that weren't mentioned. I enjoy this product, it works faster than the iPhone 4s and came with new fully functional charger, headphones and cord. I am very happy with my purchase. 4 5
These are the type of people who make you not want to buy anything on-line. I lost 500 dollars and will never trust buying on-line again. This is the type of seller who makes it difficult for other who are just starting out. I just can not express how much this seller should be in jail. 1 2
I did like the product and was all set too purchase another until I found out none of my callers could hear me and the phone kept losing my network connection to my Sim card and i missed countless calls. Other than that great phone i guess. Thanks for swift response for the refund. 1 5
When I first got this phone it was great I like screen size after having the blu music I though it was an upgrade. first the sound is terrible thers is one tiny speaker at the bottom I've tried every booster app nothing happens even if you have headphones 2nd internal memory is a joke I even have a SD card and I can't switch all apps to it the camera is excellent I'll say that but I'll be going back to the blue life play real soon its the only phone that made me happy 3 5
Arrived in record time! A few scratches by the charge port, but nothing real damaging.If your carrier is sprint or Verizon be aware that this is not a CDMA unlocked phone and you will need a SIM card. You can contact their support team over the phone and they will help setup a SIM card for you, but you won't be able to just walk in store and get your phone activated. Leaving you with a wait of a week or more for your new beauty. 4 5
The headphones connection doesn't work. I try with different headphones and it's all the same. Only work one side headphone. The problem is in the phone headphone plug in 3 1
it doesnt even cute on now 2 5
Just what I was expecting. thanks 4 5
Software issues within the first week, speaker issues immediately. Go buy a new one never refurbished from these guys, GREAT customer service when I emailed them about poor phone though 1 2
I actually bought this for my brother and the description said used - like new but when it came, it wasn't i expected and the packaging was even not that good. I wasn't satisfied. 3 5
The phone unlocked, good but nothing else 4 3
This phone is very sleek and solid in performance with 3GB RAM for good price. Battery efficiency is so good and will give standby backup of two days. Good phone for the one who looks for affordable price!! Android pay app will not be compatible with this device.. 4 5
Poor battery life.rest all is good. BB is designed for business use but if the battery dies in d middle of a meeting whats the use of having a phone.this is my last Blackberry handset.. henceforth no Blackberry for me. 2 3
is an acceptable product, the total description of the product is as advertised as such at the time of purchase ....very pleasedthanks 4 5
Comes ready to activate and simple instructions to activate it. It just didn't come with extra chargers or car charger 5 1
It is slow comparing to nowadays phones , it cant detect far wifi spots . 3 2
Despite claiming the product only has minor cosmetic defects possibly and has been tested by professional technicians, the front camera does not work. I am disappointed that this product was able to pass any seller or professional's quality standards as a properly refurbished product. Not only does this cause me a significant inconvenience in that I will have to find a way to return it, but I will also have to be without a working phone when I am waiting for calls regarding important personal commitments. 1 3
The Idol 3 has been provided an amazing experience for me at a third of the cost of some of the top-tier phones available on the market. At $250 this smartphone provides all of the functionality I would want from a daily driver and there are only a few nit-picky features (a better camera, ir blaster, wireless charging and dedicated shutter button) missing that I would need to have to "upgrade" away from this phone. The previous phones I have used in order are the Galaxy Note II, Moto X, and the Sharp Aquos Crystal and this phone blows them all out the water.Design and Size:Simply put, this phone feels great in the hand. The symmetrical design and lack of capacitive keys really make the phone seem much smaller than other phones of the same screen size. At 5.5" this phone is relatively easy to use one-handed (and I have average to small-sized hands for a guy). It is also as light or lighter than my previous phones. It does not have "premium build quality" with metals or glass, but personally that has never mattered to me. Besides the customization of designing my Moto X nothing really stood out as "me" when looking to purchase other phones. But besides all that, the phone looks great. The brushed metal look works for me, and since it is plastic it works for my wallet as well. I have never had an issue with dropping this phone or it feeling awkward to use.Screen:This screen is great. It is 1080p, videos play well, colors pop, and I can take it out in the middle of the day and actually see the screen in direct sunlight. The size of the screen also makes reading text easier and videos feel immersive. It doesn't quite live up to the borderless Aquos Crystal experience, but there is no light leakage on this screen and it does better at an angle. Also, the screen responds well to the touch, even with a tempered-glass protective covering over it. That is something that cannot be said with the Sharp Aquos Crystal.Sound:I never realized how much having the front-facing speakers would improve the quality of gaming and video experiences. Being able to lay down the phone and watch a video without the output sounding muffled or indistiguishable from gibberish is awesome. I find myself watching videos on my phone more than ever because of the audio features. Additionally, the included JBL earbuds are a nice touch and the JBL Mix audio app is one of the coolest I have ever used. I honestly find myself making playlists just to work on my mixing and transitions between tracks. Just check out some videos on youtube to see the app for itself because honestly a description here won't do justice to how fun the app is.Operating System and features:Comes out of the box with lollipop and just updated to version 5.0.2 today. As with any android phone customization is really limitless so I won't spend time on that here. The reversible feature is pretty neat, and merits me echoing other reviews. If it was not for the button placement or the design of my screen protector there would be times when I pull my phone out of my pocket and have no idea it was upside-down. The fluidity with how it works really stands out for functionality, and I am suprized this has not been a feature in phones prior to the Idol 3.Battery Life:There are phones that will get you longer battery life, but I have never been able to kill my phone in just one day of daily use. I am not implying that it will be at 30% when you wake up the next day, but it is definitely an upgrade over my first gen Moto X. Not having to find a charger immediately when I get home from work provides a little more freedom to the daily grind. I know that usage varies by person, but outside of gamers I don't think moderate to light users will have too many gripes about battery life.Conclusion:Buy this phone. If you want a great experience at a great price, buy this phone. One of my best decisions in a while to take the plunge. Being an unlocked phone carrying no carrier bloatware and built in apps like Mix, File Explorer and Wifi Display actually adding to the experience, Im starting to see less and less reason to ever sign up for a carrier contract again. If you need financing options, there is an Amazon store card for that. At $250 though, you won't find yourself in much of a financial bind if you decide to pick one up. 5 3
it is good. no problems so far, it isnt slow and i got it set up nice and easily. good stuff 4 5
This was a fairly beat up phone that worked well and had tons of features, I bought this 2 or 3 years ago and now its sitting in a drawer but the seller was very helpful in answering my questions and the phone was great for the money 4 5
I was forced away from Blackberry by my company and tried a few of the all touch screen phones and ultimately came back to this. I missed the keyboard so much. It is a shame developers won't make more apps for the Blackberry because it is a great product. I was able to sideload Good For Enterprise so I could still get my company email on the device. It isn't quite as good as native emails but good enough for that. It is nice they finally partnered with the amazon app store but I really wish developers would make more native Blackberry apps (I don't blame them for not doing it though as we Blackberry lovers are a dying breed) 4 3
Worked OK for awhile now every time I tap the back it shuts off 1 3
Got exactly what was asked for... so far no problems. 4 5
the sim I brought didn't fit the phone and I returned it on Wednesday the 14 3 2
Good product. But beware on pricing. I bought this in early December, and 5 days later Amazon reduced the price by $20! Unlike the better B&M stores, unless it is a TV Amazon will NOT provide any price adjustment or offer refunds based on their new price. I chatted, called and talked to several supervisors and their only solution was to mail the product back, then re-order the phone at the lower price. I kindly pointed out that shipping costs and my time would be more than the $20 and it seemed a better solution to offer a "store credit" to a long time Prime member. Long story short, no dice. Sine the phone is activated already I am not about to return it and start the activation process all over again either.So, just know that while Amazon is eager to take your money if the price goes UP, they will not offer any relief if within as little time as one week they reduce the price (in this case by 25%). So while the phone is a good investment, not sure about Amazon customer flexibility. 4 3
When I bought this a while ago, I was buying a 32GB phone. Then when I got the phone, the phone was reported stolen. The seller immediately responded to my claim and he sent me a new phone. Except the new one was only a 16 GB phone and it was hard to hear people when I was on a call. I also paid the amount for a 32 GB phone and ended up with a 16 GB phone that came with a bonus "box." Then the hearing part went completely out, so I just bought a new phone from Verizon. 1 2
Wasn't unlock had to ship it to the states to get apple to unlock it 1 3
this phone that i ordered from this CadamL was a piece of crap, the speaker was busted on it and it didnt work properly, after trying to fix it, not aware that there was a month i had to get it back to this sorry ass vendor, i wrote him when i finally gave up on it and it was to late to do anything with and he told me and i quote, "The speaker works perfect and you had the phone for a month! The phone was in perfect condition when I sent it. The phone had insurance from UPS take it up ith them! No refunds you had for over a month with insurance from UPS! It's no telling what conditions the phone is in now!!" ............ now tell me this, how do you figgure that you get insurance from ups????? ok A$$4013 1 5
Phone battery died after 4 months, I am disappointed, have to buy a new phone now. I was satisfied with the phone before that occurred. 3 2
I'm fairly disappointed with this purchase. First off, the home button doesn't work very well as you almost have to pound on the button to get it to work. Secondly, I specifically purchased this listing because it claimed to be unlocked which was not true. Overall I am quite disappointed with this purchase. 2 1
good afternoonI make a reference question to my phone iphone 5, which acquired through you .. do four months my phone just gets the iphone logo that is on the apple which does not allow me access to the device functions .. .what can I do 1 2
The software experienced some problems, I need to reset it very frequently. Very nice sreen and takes nice pictures but doesn't work so well. 2 3
My husband breaks his otter box belt clip about every 5 to 6 months, so it was great to get this pack of 3. It fit perfect with his otter box. 5 4
El producto llego bien y en buen estado, pero lo malo es que a pesar de que en las caracteristicas dice que tiene la frecuencia de 850Mhz para que funcione el 3G (HSDPA) el que me llego no la tiene, me siento decepcionado, Amazon deber√≠a hacer una revisi√≥n muy detallada de las caracteristicas de los productos que ofrece para que no pase este tipo de situaciones, me siento estafado y si poder hacer una devoluci√≥n pues vivo en Ecuador 2 4
Great cellphone, I received it in very good conditions 4 5
excellent value for the money. phones have worked well as starter phones for my 12 year old twins 4 5
Worked only for a month 2 1
The camera volume isn't work 4 2
I like price Vs performance. Its a good phone. 4 3
I was not impressed. There is no talk-to-text feature, which would be fine except that the keyboard had a hard time recognizing what I was typing. I honestly would recommend buying a different phone. 2 3
When I first received the phone, it was wonderful. Then about after a month the power button started to have issues. The screen would turn on, but would be red in color or only the back-light would turn on.I called support to get an RMA, based on what is posted out there I thought I could get an advance replacement. One support representative said yes, but the other said no.The repair is going to take about 5-7 days, but in the mean time I would have no phone. So I had to spend another $200 to get a Moto G4 as a replacement while this one is sent in.I have purchased unlocked phones on a regular basis, but this has not been one of the best purchases over time. I would stay away from this one, spend a little more money to get the Moto G4 or if you can afford it go with a OnePlus3. 3 1
The phone is pretty, takes good photos, has a nice display, good call quality, and is very lightweight. However mine three months in has begun to freeze multiple times a day (touching the screen does nothing and I often have to reboot). That is very frustrating and it makes the phone feel like a bad bargain instead of a good one. 3 2
perfect, practical, easy to handle, good resolution, well packed 4 5
Incredibly poor build quality, in my limited experience. The first phone I received had a failed LCD panel when I took it out of the box (box and packaging had no visible damage). The second one's LCD panel is seperating from the phone's casing and I've been very gentle with it for the few months I've had it. Given this 0/2 track record so far as the two I've received, I can't recommend this phone, especially since purchasing the international version (this version) via Amazon means you won't have a manufacturer warranty for any defects or repairs.The phone also performs more poorly than the Moto G 3rd Gen (same price range, but better build quality) on the original firmware, the newest official firmware, and several of the third party firmwares I've tried (CM, BlissPop, RR, and others). 1 3
Was sold as new, but was used. Box was beat up, parts loose. Phone didn't look new. It works fine but I should have got the used price. Other than that the phone is what it is-middle of the road. What would you expect when current phones sell for 700 and this was 90. Like I said it is what it is. Very good replacement for broken phone. 3 2
I received my phone on yesterday and must first say I appreciate all the previous reviews that guided me to this purchase. I did some research on this phone including YouTube videos that compared this phone to other budget phones and flagships. This phone has met all of my expectations and then some! I saw remarks about the double tap not being consistent. I actually figured that out. If you do a slower tap it usually works every time. Maybe a quick could "1,2" works just about every time. The battery seems good so far. The display is outstanding. I downloaded open camera after a reviewer suggested which is good. My 2 most recent phones were the LG g4 and galaxy s6. The s6 is certainly a great piece of equipment but I realized many of the features they offer I don't need and the price is just too much. I definitely recommend this device over any other android on the market. Even some iPhone users might like this as a temporary, secondary or converter back to the android platform. 5 4
Bought 2x @ $199.99 pre-order price, best deal for a flagship phone. Gave them as birthday gifts to my daughters. They love it!!! Screen is bright & sharp, dual front speakers are loud and clear, both front and rear cams take good/clear pictures. Phone works great on AT&T LTE network, connection is fast for data (Youtube streaming, FB, snapchat, browsing, etc) and battery lasts all day!!! Only cons are it doesn't come with pre-installed screen protector & soft clear case (like from BLU).Overall, still 5-star rating ... 5 3
Desde Venezuela confirmo que este producto es excelente. entregas eficaz. Muchas gracias.. espero volver a realizar compras a este vendedor. 5 4
This phone worked fantastic for about 6 months. Now it's constantly having issues functioning and seems to be progressively getting worse. Little to no updates from the company. Sorry but I definitely won't ever purchase another phone made my this company. 1 3
Nice phone overall, worth the money you pay but be aware latest firmware may ruin your battery life so do your research before you update your firmware. Would give 5 stars when Asus fixes battery drain problem via firmware update. OTG does not work the way it suppose to....not enough power in USB port. 3 4
Degraded very quickly. Unusable in a short time. Buy a casio gzone rock instead. Or better yet, a samsung galaxy S5 2 1
To future buyers: note that the charger and data cable are not by Apple, they are each a 3rd party made-in-China item. The protective film also does not fit the phone properly, so you will need to get a new one. The iPhone itself has a chip at the bottom, but overall in decent condition and works as expected. The seller is shrewd in the wording of the description - it sounds as if it's an excellent condition iPhone coming in Apple's original packaging with Apple's data cable and charger and a screen protector, but no, it's a good condition Apple iPhone coming in a random "industrial" box with a 3rd party made-in-China charger data cable and a screen protector that does not fit the phone, so you will indeed need to get a new one.Overall, 4 stars and I am satisfied with my purchase, but it is not exactly as I expected. 4 5
I was expecting the phone to be in better condition than I received it. One of the speakers doesn't work, AT ALL and there are 2 pretty big dents along the edges of the phone. 3 1
This phone so far has been a good mix between value, design and performance. I can only hope that Alcatel continues building a budget/ performance friendly phone for the Android OS. 4 5
The phone flash does not work and it's 6 GB instead of 8GB. Other than that, no complains. thank you 3 2
arrive not on time was expected,, was arrive in new year 2013...disapointedGooday & happy new year god bless peace. 3 5
