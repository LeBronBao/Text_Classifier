One thing you should take into consideration before going in...1.) This place is located across the street from the abandoned Festival Mall. 2.) Sit in the parking garage lot and watch the clientele that enters. Yeah. So, one the hostess was terrible and rude. Did not greet us. We walked the buffet line. Very odd dishes to say the least and disorganized in the way it was presented. I wish I could have taken pictures. Tacos next to soup next to crab legs. We sit down at a table and look up--spider webs, dust, table was terrible sticky. Think of the worst episode of kitchen nightmares and times that by 7. Food was the most store bought garbage. I've definitely had the same spring rolls in a sample station at Costco. At least those were warm. So unless your into taking risks and eating sketchy chinese/ taco/ store bought macaroons would not recommend. 2
I was hesitant to rent from this place based on the bad reviews. Literally every other rental company didn't have a van, so I was basically stuck from renting from them. Overall the customer service was very good and so was the prices. My issues was with the vans. They are all dodge caravans and in horrible condition. The first van I got the ac was broke and beat up. They gave me another van and this time I was heading to California. I couldn't go over 60mph and it would shake if you went over. 1
I wanted to find a good place to do some work on a sunny Sunday afternoon and I hadn't intended on coming here because there was no free wifi. But, there was space and the menu was student-budget friendly.I only ordered a regular cup of coffee and a cheese scone. The scone was big but not particularly cheesy. The coffee wasn't particularly aromatic but you get refills for $1. They also have a special discount for students.But if you're not the kind of person who can work in noisy places, I suggest you go somewhere else. I'd recommend this place if you want a place for brunch. It was 4:00PM  in the afternoon and the place was packed with people still ordering eggs and toast. Cheap and lively, I see this place as being dependable but it's not the best cafe for studying.Apparently their cakes are to die for but, as a miserly student, I didn't have the stomach to dish out $6 for cake. 3
First off, the parking here is HORRENDOUS!!  We came here to watch the UFC.  Our waiter was friendly and checked on us frequently.  I ordered boneless wings.  They were horrible.  They were mostly breading and barely any chicken.  They were so hard to chew.  We also had a pizza spring roll (I forget what it was called exactly) they were very tasty. Only thing is it cost like $6 and you only get two. They were good but not that good! Overall, I wouldn't come back for the food.  The only reason I would return is that it is the closest place for us to watch the fights. 2
We tripped upon this on the way to Rose and Crown...and thought we would stop here due to all the TV coverage we've seen.We walked in and we were greeted by a nice young man,  but then it went downhill from there.Bar area is super small - seats 6 at the bar and 4 other seats in the corners. . THE MALE BARTENDER DID NOT BOTHER TO ACKNOWLEDGE US....we couldn't figure that out. I had to make the long two step walk to the bar to order my drink because he didn't offer. I think we would have had better service to sit outside on the porch.Finally got an appetizer menu from the FRIENDLY greeter busboy. The cheese plate is misnamed as it had more raisins and almonds than cheese.....crostini was too hard and fell apart if you tried to spread the cheese on it.Overall, we do not recommend this establishment. 2
Decent place with nice deco but the noodle soup is too too too salty, even for Chinese visitors. My friend guesses that maybe the owner is Japanese and goes with Ramen style. 2
Nothing above average with the food. Had the pho and vermicelli one other time. Minimal care put into the dishes. Place is clean, I'll give it that.Did not appreciate the server hovering over as we were trying to settle the bill. 2
Stay Away...We waited 1  1/2 hrs for our food. Terrible service. I asked to speak to manager. She was no help. She was so busy, doing nothing. I asked for a spoon and was told they were in the dishwasher. REALLY? It was 11:30 am. They just opened. Very poor management. There are too many other places to eat. Will never return... 1
I'm no seafood aficionado, but this place seemed pretty good to me, and I hope it sticks around because fresh seafood like this (and at these prices) is fairly unusual here in the desert. Our table tried the fish and chips, swordfish, seafood kebab and catfish -- and all were satisfied. As noted in other reviews, the staff is jovial and the atmosphere is pleasant. Whew -- saves me a trip to Boston! 4
The location is great as it is right off the freeway and near the Chandler Fashionsquare mall. The smell of the woodfire grill is evident when you enter but not overpowering. The restaurant was nice and classy. Prices were slightly high but my chicken sandwich was good. The chicken was tender and the veggies were fresh. The bun was very light and almost flakey. The fries were stale and unimpressive. The server seemed new and nervous. Overall I was satisfied but not overly impressed. I would go back. 3
I was surprised that we were able to get a patio table on a Hot sunny Friday afternoon with no wait. Now I understand why. Slow service, bored staff, mediocre food and an over all unpleasant experience. It's burgers and salad...! How do you mess that up? Apparently you can. You're better off dining on street food. 1
Ray is hands down the best barber in Las Vegas. He is professional, reliable, knowledgeable, and never disappoints. I have switched up hair styles multiple times and the outcome is always what I hope it is! I refuse to go anywhere else in Las Vegas! I recommend Ray to any and everyone. 5
Pros-Always seated quicklyFood is great - 5 stars for food Price point is very good - you definitely get your money's worthCons -Depending on who you get the servers are often very slow, disorganized, nonchalant ~ such a shame! 4
Really hurts me to have update my review. I loved this place, food was always great, sure the service was sometimes slow, but it made up for it when we got the food to the table. I've been there number of times, but yesterday might have been my last. Go inside at opening and notice the food menu has shrank. The options now are the burger, the cevapi, and a veggie sandwich. Not overly bad because I usually either get the burger or the cevapi, even though I was thinking of actually trying something new this time.Mentioning that to our server, she stated the place is now under new management, so they redid things. That had me a bit concerned. We ordered our food, it came, no longer on the neat wood platters, just on a normal plate. Not a huge issue it was just a neat presentation. Looking at the burger it looked different. The meat patty just looked like a regular burger, unlike it's previous version which was 2 very thin patties that were cooked and then "glued" with cheese. Thinking the cheese was gone completely even though it was stated on the menu I kind of ripped into the patty to find it in there. So it looks like they just form the patty with the cheese and then cook. Either way not huge, just different. But then when I stared eating it just didn't have the same flavour. Kind of bland. The fries although similar were really salty.So since I don't live near by or really come to the area that often, I'll probably not be going back again, unless I hear things have improved. 2
Great concept, poor delivery.  This place is very confusing.  We went on a Wednesday around 7:00 p.m.  When we entered, we weren't sure if I needed to wait to be seated or find our own table.  There are very few tables, most seat 8 to 10 people and are very large picnic style.  There is no wait staff. We eventually found our way to the bar,  The bartender told us he could take our order, but it would be better to go to the "girl" standing by the trailer.  We ordered at the bar.  It took about 30 minutes to get our food, as advertised.  They call your name over a loud speaker to  pick up your food at the trailer.  There are no signs where to pick up.  The cook finally yelled to us to go to the back of the trailer.We had the Mac and Cheese muffins, chicken pot pie in the jar and maple ribs.  The mac and cheese muffins were very bland.  The chicken pot pie was just okay.  The ribs were covered in sauce which seemed to hide the real favor of the rib.This place is trying to be a trendy, hipster place, but got lost along the way. The boxing ring and clothing store are great concepts to help entertain.  Staff up, put in seating for smaller parties and revisit the menu. 2
The staffs here are all very kind n helpful, the dentists are also very professional n patient. If u need a care for ur teeth, this is a place to go! 5
If your looking for a great salon I definitely recommend  The Toni and Guy Academy. I've been to plenty of high end salons and spent a small fortune on my hair to be greatly disappointed.Kristin is spectacular, talented with an eye for fashion.  Kristin is my new "beauty secret weapon.  One can almost forget she is still a student.  I have seen her a few times for highlights, color, cut and even a updo.... Just amazing each time from edgy to chic, not only is Kristin pleasant to be around she worked hard to educate me on how to actually use products to keep achieving my look.I've meet a few of the instructors at the school and they have been extermly professional, nice and very knowledgable.  As educators go they appear to provide an environment to foster creativity with a guiding hand! 5
Just tired their churros today and they were pretty great! The caramel filling was an unexpected by pleasant surprise. 3
Stopped in for lunch. My wife had an iced Starbucks drink and the waitress greeted us with that was not "acceptable in here."  We gladly left because it didn't look that nice anyways. I think there are better choices around town 1
I used to order from Stephanos at least twice a week but not anymore! Last THREE times I ordered they messed up my order which is not very hard. Two gyro plates pita on the side. No salad. The nice guy that works the counter isn't there anymore and the new girl just doesn't get how to work the register or understand the menu. I'm on a search for a new Greek place! 2
Been here three times. My last time here!! Service was ok apart from the fact the server had no idea about the wine or how much it cost. Calamari was sent back we ordered several plates of this and all were sent back. Mussels came half open half closed , clams were like rubber. Our whole party had issues with their apps! Nachos had one shrimp and was so congealed it was unrecognizable ! If your going to offer Moscow mules on the menu please know how to make it and have the right cups ! 1
The tiny burrito bowl cost about $12. And all side ingredients except rice, beans cheese and salsa cost extra. A sprinkle of lettuce for 75 cents. Plus the staff is unfriendly at times. I an going to stop giving them a chance. No more for me!!! 1
Their baked and regular pancakes are great, we went there two weeks in a row which we never do. The service is also upscale. 4
On Easter morning we noticed our Senior dog acting very strange. After a while we realized that her stomach seemed to be expanding. I called EAC to ask their opinion. When they told us to come in, we lifted April into our car and headed there. When we brought our girl in they knew she was in critical condition and she was taken immediately back. Dr. Danielle Strohacker came to tell us our options. The first was exploratory surgery as there was a large mass of some sort in her stomach. She was able to relieve some of her pain and get the air out. Yet the mass was still present in the x rays. Considering the advanced age of our dog and the cost of surgery (4-5k) we knew what our other option was. It was devastating but my husband and I had discussed what to do on the way to the hospital. Only 1 of our 4 children was with us. When we made the decision, they brought April to us and waited until our sons got to the hospital. We were given the time we needed to say our goodbyes. Dr. Strohacker explained to us exactly what would happen. She was very caring and truly sorry. We are so thankful that this is where we brought our April. We felt respected and cared for by EACH and EVERY employee there. They made us a paw print that was very special to us. My husband and I returned the next day to bring in a card and, once again, we were greeted with respect. They remembered us. After 13 years with our April, we couldn't have asked for a better place for her body to leave us. Thank you to everyone at EAC! 5
Another 5 Star at Bellagio. Excellent sushi and the spicy miso is wonderful. Price is inline with Vegas 5 Star. $$$ 5
Beautiful cozy place to relax with a snack and cup of coffee. 4
Went on a Monday night and it was half full only, which was nice as I heard there are usually line ups. We sat at the bar where we saw all the food being made by a couple of guys who didn't look very happy lol. Everyone who reviewed the restaurant had the momofuku ramen and the pork buns, so I ordered those and the mushroom dan dan. Upon looking at the prices, I was actually a little shocked at how pricey they were. Coming from Van where I tried a lot of ramen, I thought this better be delicious!Pork buns - This dish came really fast and it was good, but not amazing. Brisket was very soft, and probably best tasting dish of the night.  4/5Momofuku ramen - Was only ok as I had way better broth and noodles before for less $. For the small portions and taste, not worth it. The 3 small slices of pork in it was pretty good though. 3/5Mushroom dan dan - I actually liked this dish quite a bit when I started eating it. The sauce was pretty good until you're half way through the noodles because all of the sauce was sinking to the bottom and it got REALLY salty. 3.5/5Everything plus tip came to $50 and both of us weren't exactly stuffed. It was a good experience, but will probably not come back. 3
Good store they have everything and anything you will need at a security, EMS, police and fire department job. A little pricy though. Everything in the store is good quality specially their shoes. 4
Pretty good Mexican sit down restaurant. More on the Americanized side but still flavorful and tasty. I like that authentic Mexican food better though. 3
Great service and food what more could I say. Our waitress Danielle was awesome she kept a smile on her face and made sure we was satisfied. 5
I've been searching for a new hairstylist, since I recently moved from Hawaii to Arizona. I couldn't find any good salons/stylist in Arizona, but thankfully I found Becca here in Las Vegas. She did an amazing job on my hair. I'm so in love with the outcome. I will be back for sure in july! 5
Sorry but this place is a clutter filled mess with a strange stench in the air.  I gave the Coffee Cove a try last year and it is one of the strangest businesses I have ever been in.   The tables and chairs are mish mashed and not in a good way.  There is junk all over the shop.  It looks like an episode of Hoarders!  There was a gross smell inside which other reviewers said was mold.  I'm not sure as I never smelled mold before but based on the dirtiness of this place mold would be a good guess.  My drink had way to much milk in it.  I won't be back.  It's sad because this area does not have many independent coffee shops and I HATE Starbucks.  I wanted to find another local coffee shop, but sadly this place missed on all levels. 1
These are not good people the manger Johnathan smokes weed. Most of the employees are on drugs. The service is slow because most people who work there are hight drunk an don't care. They had good work that they got rid of. This isn't a family friendly place. All they want is your money an tips. You will get bad service an not so good food don't waste your time. 1
The setting is spectacular. Brunch menu was interesting but a little limited.  The Eggs Benedict was average (very little sauce,eggs a bit too runny) but the (albino) carrot soup was excellent.  The chocolate dessert was a bit much for me, but my companion ate every mouthful.  The creme brulee with chambord and pomegranate was excellent.  Nice selection of teas.  The service was pretty slow, but the assistant manager came buy to let us know that dessert was complimentary because of our wait.  Now THAT is good business! 4
Yan and Luis are the best servers here! Everything was amazing! Will definitely be coming back in the near future! Make sure you ask for them when you come in! You won't be disappointed. 5
Ok, I have to admit that I didn't do -any- shopping here, so this review is strictly based on the artwork/decore/architecture throughout the mall. It's freakin awesome.My brother and I were walking through and he pointed to these colored columns standing in a pool of water and said he thought they were ice. I told him no way, how the heck would that work? Well, sure enough, we walked up to them and there was a metal pole running up through them keeping them frozen. Futher in, we walked by about 20 or so clear columns that had whirpools bobbing up and down, also very cool.Even the information center/guest services desk is very artistic, with a restaurant above that looks like a bird built it (sort of like a woven basket)...honestly, this review doesn't do it justice at all. Even if you don't plan on shopping, this place is worth stopping by just to walk through :) 4
Kate is amazing. She is organized and smart and she really cares about all her brides.  She genuinely wants you to have an amazing day and she never imposes her vision on you.  We had a very last minute change in both our venue and caterer. If I didn't have Kate I would have probably broken down, but I barely stressed it because I knew this was why we hired her and she would do what it took to make it right, and she did.  Our wedding was so beautiful and I even had my guests comment on how hard Kate was working that night. Every vendor she facilitated said she made their lives so easy.  She is phenomenal and you are in great hands with her! 5
Pretty hilarious that you have to watch your language in a bar for 21 and up only but whatever.  This bar isn't in the best location,  Boulder Highway has lots of transients and this location is no exception.  The food, bartenders,  and atmosphere is barely average.  Wouldn't suggest it to friends, family, or anyone else 2
I spent over $10,000 on new carpet, appliances fans and lighting at this Home Depot to renovate my home and the customer service was horrible, especially in flooring.  They were rude and not very helpful. 2
We have been to 4 different swim schools and this is by far the best. From the front desk to the swim instructors everyone is professional and courteous. The program actually teaches them to swim not just float! Highly recommended. We have a 6 year old and 2 year old here. 5
The waitress we had was a school teacher working during her vacation to supplement her school salary. She was the best part of the experience.. The cheese crisp was so so, the beef chimi's were not the best or worst we ever ate.The buss service was terrible, no setups on the table . We finished our cheese crisp and the buss person brought our chimi's, never took the empty plates. I asked for additional verde salsa it never came.. To be honest with usually go to Nando's on Mcdowell but they were closed for the holiday.Rosa'a can't hold a candle to Nando's. 2
We went to this restaurant yesterday, and I should have read the yelp reviews. I would have passed.We arrived relatively early because we were going to see a play at the Royal Alexandria.  Service was nice and friendly and for the most part prompt. The decor was warm, inviting and modern. I was really excited to try this place out. We ordered the deep fried calamari and shrimp. While it was cooked well and breaded tastily, it did not come with any dipping sauce. I've never not been served dipping sauce with this dish, so it was really quite boring after the 5th piece.My cousin ordered the $30 Buonanotte pizza. For $30, canned, squishy mushrooms is NOT acceptable. She loves mushrooms and has to leave them on the side. She did say the dough was cooked well.I ordered the seafood pasta. For $26 the portion was quite small. All my 7 mussels were out of their shells (but they still put the empty shells in the bowl?? I got 1 shrimp and 3 pieces of calamari. The sauce was SUPER oily and the pasta was ridiculously undercooked. I know al dente, and this was like al dente's frigid aunt forgotten outside after a night of partying (aka super dehydrated). Now, I am a pretty passive aggressive person (hence, writing a review in lieu of making a fuss in the restaurant), however, I really would have liked to bring this to the chef's attention if we weren't in a rush to make it to the play. I needed SOMETHING to eat and was seriously contemplating the street meat at the corner of John and King St.Anyway, will not be going back and will be telling all my friends to avoid this place. I don't know how they will make it with food lacking this much. 2
Not great. Been here twice and not impressed. The crust of the pizza is unusually chewy and I always find hard pieces hidden in the dough. The Margarita pizza is bland. There are 3 better pizza places in the area. 3
Same menu as the other 4 bars. If you know that you know what to expect. A little on the pricy side but some of it is worth it. 3
Love this place!  Great food and healthy too.  A great variety of choices on the menu. 4
Check your receipts. I bought an onion and a couple of jalapenos here and was wondering how it was $3.50, but after I got home I noticed the onion rang up as 2 pounds and the jalapenos as 1 pound. Their scale is definitely off, resulting in being overcharged by probably at least double. If you pay the proper price though, this place is very cheap and a good deal. 2
Mario's is a decent bar that doesn't charge a cover and has a TON of space.  This place fills with college students from wall to wall (and that says a lot since this takes up the space of two store fronts).  Reasonable drink specials (if you're down with domestics).  Not somewhere I would recommend if you're trying to talk with friends, but a great place to meet people.  Mario IS Pittsburgh's college bar. 3
I saw Dr. Kelsey and he was nice but I was not impressed with the overall test that were conducted. The test were not very thorough and the doctor actually told me he just "does this once and awhile as a hobby" that's something you don't really want to hear from a doctor. He also tried offering me some services from his side business of career coaching. Everyone was very nice and polite. I was overall disappointed with the quality of the work during the visit. 2
Usually this bar is fun and friendly.. however not on sunday nights apparently!!!! Liam our waiter was condescending and aloof to our group. The late night menu is terrible and the nachos were soggy with very little toppings. No one cared about our satisfaction, in fact no staff seemed interested in any patrons that night!!! Never going back. 1
Mixed Bag. Used the transit system on a Saturday as a tourist. Here's what I liked: The day pass was $10.75 for our family, pretty reasonable. The subway was clean. I didn't see any rats like I saw in NYC. The drivers/operators were helpful and friendly. The announcements of upcoming stops were clearly announced audibly and visually. The map (when we found one) w/ routes was clear and easy to follow. Here is what I didn't like: The TTC map was not available at the Spadina 7-11 store where we purchased the pass. We looked for maps at the Subway station and could not find a rack dispensing it. The attendant was not present. The day pass is not a card you swipe at the turnstiles and busses like the Metrocard in NYC. The pass is a flimsy ticket, by the end of the day it was pretty beat up. When we went to ride the subway at the first station, there was not an attendant to show the pass to, so we stood around with other tourists looking confused a minute and then my husband just tried the turnstile and we walked through. The subway is not as expansive as NYC. I think there are only two lines. You have to walk to an island in the middle of the street to catch some streetcars. Delays for streetcars. We had to wait a half hour for most. Then when one came, there was another close behind. They were clumped together. One was running late while we were on it, and had to abort it's route. 2
Dined here for Restaurant Week, Spring 2017.Gigli - fresh pasta, but nothing special. There isn't anything wrong with simple, but the flavors in this dish did not really stand out. This seemed like fresh pasta with canned sauce.Mushroom 'Pasta' - the flavors did not settle into the mushrooms. Overall, bland.Tiramisu - solid flavorsSangria was too plain, martini was very strong (which was of course, absolutely fine).Veal meatballs were juicy, but were not very flavorfulOut of the whole experience, I enjoyed the polenta and tiramisu the most.Two star food experience, Five star service experience. 3
I think I have been spoiled in that I have eaten in some amazing Mexican food eateries, so I had little to no expectations for Quesada. Upon entering the restaurant, I noticed that it looks like Mucho Burrito or Baja Fresh (in the States). A quick look over the menu board, I settled on a large burrito with grilled chicken filling. Choices are numerous, but not overwhelming in terms of combinations as some places can be. Unfortunately, there was no beef/steak offering as they were out - how this happens, I have no idea but it clearly disappointed a couple of guys in line ahead of me.The counter service was quick and friendly. Burrito was assembled with toppings as I requested from a good selection. There are a variety of sauces and salsas to choose from as well. Once wrapped, there is the option to have your selection toasted. I opted for that and took my order to go - I was in and out of Quesada, burrito in hand in about 15 minutes. The seating area, it should be noted, is bright and has a decent number of chairs and tables.So what about the burrito? Was it any good? I arrived at my home, a short drive away, and chowed down. Rice and chicken paired with a medium salsa was nice. I skipped the beans and guacamole, but added lettuce, tomato, and some cheese which tasted fresh. The large size is about all I needed, so I am glad I did not go one size up.Give it a try. It may not be my favourite place, but I definitely will go again. 3
LOVE this restaurant. My family has been going to the downtown location for a long long long time. We couldn't be happier when we knew they have a second location at Bayview Village, since it's our favourite mall and it's closer to our home. The food and the service are excellent. We go there almost every Sunday; sometimes for Dim Sum, sometimes for dinner. It's suprised to see they were temporarily closed due to some health issue few weeks ago. I checked their inspection history on DineSafe. They got a green on April 7, and about a month later, they got a red. How bad things would go in just a month? Since we shop around the mall quite often, we know the managers in all the restaurants quite well. Pearl's managers as well of course. They told me because the Public Health Department received a complaint from just one customer, saying she didn't feel well after eating at Pearl. There are a lot of reasons to cause one person felt sick. I hope the Health Department checked all the restaurants that she went to on those days. It seems to me maybe the inspector thought it's a slap in his face that he passed the restaurant not long ago, and then someone felt sick after eaten there. One of the owners of Aroma espresso bar said they got a yellow one month after their opening. That's quite funny to me. How unsanitized they can get for a month?I believe in Bayview Village and Pearl. As the upscale shopping mall in North York, Bayview Village won't allow any restaurant to put customers' health in risk. They must have their professional cleaning and pest control team to ensure the great health conditions. As for Pearl, they had been in the industry for so many years. I think they know about what sanitized environment means. They wouldn't risk customers' health like that. Just saying..... 4
No Stars, the worst car wash on the planet.   I'm convinced all they do is rummage through your car looking for things to steal.    Unfortunately I've been a glutton for punishment over the years and this place has NEVER improved.   Avoid at all cost. 1
Got my first tattoo here. They did a good job but judging by the other reviews and tattoo parlors around here, they are a bit pricey. Overall though they did a good job on the tattoo 3
It's a great a place to have a cup of coffee with a friend next to a fireplace..coffee is always fresh and the staff is very helpful and friendly. In summer they always have patio chairs outside and nice place to relax. 4
It is not big deal about this coffee shop, not comfortable seating, food just OK, very terrible service 2
I've been here twice now because sometimes you just want a burrito. However, I can do better myself (and in fact, every time I go by this place I think I should quit my job and open a near-campus taco stand). The chicken tinga burrito was quite good and pretty close to California style. The burrito portions are small enough to finish and not make you too fat, which is a plus I think.Nachos are likewise quite good. Good for sharing, disappear fast.However, this place serves the worst enchiladas I've had in long time. Decent tortillas and shredded chicken filling, but the sauce is canned and they top them with wilted lettuce and cheese that is dry and crumbly like parmesan in a can. Ick.Also, the stools are really uncomfortable, and they serve their sodas in styrofoam cups. 2
I have to start by saying I have been going to Southwest Contemporary Women's care for over 5 years now. I have had fantastic experiences with the Nurse Practitioners & MDs. My concerns are more for the triage nurse line. Throughout the week I have had to call multiple times due to various reasons. I have had amazing nurses that are compassionate & helpful. There was one bad experience where the nurse told me she would call me back after she spoke with the Doctor. After waiting 2 and a half hours, I decided to follow up. By the time I got a follow up call, she said to me "You just need to be patient". This nurse was not compassionate or empathetic to any of my concerns. This was my 3rd time calling this week due to various problems, and I understand the frustration. I was just as frustrated having to go through it. I just feel like there is a better way to go about customer service, especially in the health care field. 3
Yonge street store:Terrible, terrible  grooming job, and for 60$ + tax, even more terrible, after arguing with the manager and the groomer I finally got my money back as I have to get my dog groomed again, they ruined her hair and cut one side of her eyelashes off and tried to blame me.  Terrible customer service by a manager that can't be more than 20 years old. There's a Pet Value opening right next door, watch out super fetch.. Never, ever going back there again and will not recommend it to anyone. 1
I went for iPad screen repairs I had three  I was handed me two of them back and told I'm not even going to try to fix these  I knew they weren't  I said I appreciate you trying! But this one I can have back for you tomorrow I told him no he's not even getting the chance when about a mile down the road to Arizona's best iPad repairshe said no problem I can fix all three and be ready in three hours 1
Wonderful! Fun! Fabulous service! Food was delicious and the wine wall was delightful. Will definitely recommend to my Concierge Team to promote! 5
We don't go to Koi often. But we know the sushi is safe and usually good. My only complaint is that they automatically add gratuity to everyone's tab. I don't know how they can legally do that. The service is ok. Sometimes you get a decent personable sushi chef, sometimes you don't. Sometimes you get a friendly server, sometimes you don't. We love their sushi tho... Spicy tuna, spicy philly roll, spider roll and some of the State named rolls. 3
I took yelps advice and it didnt do me wrong . When i arrived i was greeted by some very friendly staff. I felt very welcomed. Means alot when your traveling alone. First thing i noticed about this place was the cute decor different but i liked it. Especially the use of different kind of chairs. They gave me time to figure out what i wanted and made great suggestions. I ordered food was good and i was full. Only thing that wasnt my favorite was the water but i think thats a city problem . I checked in with yelp to get a free mimosa. Mmmmm. Kinda strong but they dont play in Vegas. My bill was very affordable. The mananger was even nice enough to seat down and give me suggestions on what i can do here. Very nice and sweet of him. Go check them out. 5
Paid for an Escalade but got picked up by an old Yukon. Driver also talked on the phone while driving. 2
REALLY dry ribs, pulled pork tasted like watered down sauce was added after cooking. Mac and cheese was creamy and good not over cooked Slaw was good- just normal slaw I honestly could not believe how dry my ribs were.... It was pretty heart breaking as I had been looking forward to going there just for that for sooooo long ! Brisket was cooked well ... For most of the pieces I got because again part of it was dry. Tip***The sauces are good but they need to leave the ribs in for a longer cooking time seriously tho .... Please do.... Ribs are suppose to fall of the bone not be like jerky .... If I wanted jerky I wouldn't order ribs. Customer service was great! Very friendly and helpful. This place has a LOT of potential to go so far ... The major loss of stars for me was because when you are a bbq house that advertises ribs like that I expect them to know it is suppose to fall off the bone. 2
5 Stars: This place is fantastic!  I love it, think you'll love it, hope all my friends love it, wish I could eat here all the time and hope I'll own a place just like it in my retirement.or5 Stars:  As in, it meets the expectations it sets for itself perfectly well.This falls into the latter category.This is a place in my area I go when I'm craving Pad Thai now now NOW.It's cheap.  They give you lots.  It's pretty fast.Done.I've had shrimp pad thai--  found the amount of noodles soak up all the sauce-- I ask for extra.. sauce that is, not noodles- it's obscene, the lid barely shuts.  Hey, value for money.  Their green curry's also quite good.It seems like they did the interior decor recently.  However, although quite nice-- they did try to bring a bit of Thailand with the wooden furniture I suppose, I wouldn't describe the atmosphere to be all that wonderful.  Also a little fancy to drop in just for lunch imo- cloth napkins and all.  Tries too hard, you know? 5
There is really not much to say than a great atmosphere and the most courteous service. One of the most innovative things about it is that you get to order from a tablet other than using pen and paper. The food comes almost instantly. Pro-tip if you ever want to go there. Start of by eating anything that doesn't have any rice otherwise your belly would be already packed. My experience was indeed enjoyable and delectable... 4
Based on a lunch visit this week, I am not sure I would describe the food as Latin American. I had a fried chicken sandwich, which was dressed up with chipotle mayo and accompanied by excellent homemade fries. Service was very good. The decor is attractive -- high ceiling, lots of light. I'll gladly return. 4
A very trendy and cool place to come with friends or with a date. Pros: amazing selection of oysters. We love oysters and I'll honestly say these are extremely high quality and tasty. We tried all of the oysters that were available. I'll definitely try the crab claws and shrimp from the raw bar next visit. Coffee and pistachio gelato were great. Good selection of cocktails, wines, and bubbles. We have the Vouvrey brut and it was pretty good. Ambience is great - awesome decor and interior and lighting. I personally like the fact that it is very dark inside - gives it more of a mysterious and romantic vibe. Cons: the main dishes we tried were good but not great. We had the Brussels sprouts (pretty good with the goat cheese dip), the trout which was so-so, the crab cakes were ok (not worth the price), and the scallops were a little bit too charred so the burnt flavor took over. Inside is very loud, especially toward the bar, so you have to speak loudly to hear anyone in your group. I am not a fan of this, but what can you expect when the restaurant is packed?Overall a good place and we will definitely return for the raw bar items which were amazing. 4
The place is good and the hotel rooms are also great. What I did not like about the whole thing was they tricking us into a 'timeshare presentation'. They will just tell you that you need to fill a 'survey' and there is a free brunch and some gifts. Well, the gifts are not really 'free' gifts, its discounted show tickets in Vegas. So spending 3 hrs on this 'timeshare presentation' (they take you around the resort to sell their timeshare property) for a free brunch and tickets, don't make sense at all! All my friends and I were so irritated by the end of it. They do not tell how long the whole thing will take, and one would never guess a 'survey' taking 3 hrs to say no to it.So, just stay from this 'timeshare' scam and buy your tkts elsewhere if you can! 2
Very fresh!  In addition to the traditional dim sum dishes, they also have the dumplings that usually come in the wooden steamers which are loaded with juice.  Good atmosphere being inside the Rio Hotel.  Definitely recommend checking it out. 4
We are locals that often have friends visiting from out of state. This most recent batch asked to see a Cirque show.  I told them that Mystere might be a good start - none of us have seen one of your shows. They booked rooms at TI and we purchased tickets for tonight's show, Tuesday, October 10, 2017 at 9:30pm in the front row 105, seats 1,2&3.  We stood in line to get tickets, stood in line 35 minutes to get into the theater, stood in line to give the snack bar $20 for 2 bottles of water and a coke, and then sat in our, excellent, seats for another 30 minutes eagerly anticipating the show but was told, 35 minutes after showtime, to 'exit our seats and proceed to the exits' where those of us who bought tickets could get our money back.  As if ticket price should cover our investment?  Because you couldn't pull your sh** together enough to go on, you SQUANDERED OUR CASH (ticket price doesn't reflect wasted, over-priced concessions), WASTED OUR TIME, and most heinous of all you EXPLOITED OUR EXCITEMENT.   For you it might have been just another Tuesday night; for us it was special.  Never again, Cirque. 1
I wish I could of gave this place 0 or negative stars as I have never, ever witness customer service as worst as this place! Brought my car in for the first ever oil change for my 2013 Si and bought the pre-maintenance plan from Findlay Honda, the same place where I bought my car as well (way better than Honda west in every way possible). Asian dood, I think his name was Joseph or Khoi, he didn't introduce himself I had to go look at one of the counters for his name tag told me I had to pay for an oil change because they were supposedly independently owned but the service plan I got is good for anywhere in the USA you jerkoff. I called the 1800 number on my plan and they were suppose to verify my plan and get a check cut to them for my service but the operator said they were lazy to do paperwork even when it was accepted at any US Honda. The maintenance guy didn't apologize or say shit but to take my car to findlay which was way farther from where I was at. He pretty much didn't want do nothing to help the cause but turn me away and not answer any of my other questions. Totally agreed with all the negative reviews, these guys are lazy, they suck, scam artists etc. Will not be referring any business to this shit hole whatsoever! 1
I wasn't a bride shopping here, but my best friend was and I have DEFINITELY been to better places with other friends. My friend found her dress fairly quickly and was very excited about it. I went with her 2 or 3 times after she found her dress. Once, to see her in the dress. And the other times were for alterations. Holy rude service :-( My poor friend! She is one of the sweetest, patient people I know and I was sad to see Vera's consultants treating her so rudely. On my friends wedding day, the buttons for her bustle broke off within 20 minutes. When she told Vera's about it, they said there would be a charge to fix it! A charge to fix something that should have been more durable on Vera's end in the first place! Vera herself seems very sweet...but her consultants are lacking in charm and grace. I hope this improves for any other future brides that decide to buy from there. 2
Ordered takeout and was very disappointed.    The chicken in the butter chicken was dry and the basmati rice was over salted. I've had better butter chicken from the food court at square one. The samosa rolls are not worth the price. They are not very good at all. The only thing that was decent was the chow mein. Will not be going back here again. 2
Food was great, service was friendly, efficient, and added a warm touch to a lovely restaurant. Baklava was to die for!!! Definitely worth the drive it takes from our home. Keep up the fantastic business, Khoury's! 5
food was okay, but waaaaaay over priced!!!!!!! i like their fried chicken and pancakes, just wish they were a little bit cheaper! 3
If I could give this place no stars , I would be happier. This place is a waste of time not only because it's ridiculously overpriced but it's customer service is totally lacking. It was our first time going to a karaoke bar and no instruction on how to use the machine was given. No hook was provided to show song list. Everything was on a computer that was hard to navigate. Had to run out of the room to find someone to help us each time we got stuck because of the lack of instruction. It was just bad. Totally would not return. 1
Can get real backed up especially on Sunday nights. Small seating but that is typical of Starbucks everywhere I guess 3
Called in an order for delivery to my home, 2 miles from the shop.  Medium, 3-ingedient pizza and a small greek salad...$33 and change!  Add to that the five bucks I would give the delivery guy and I'm into it for just shy of $40.  Their pizza is o.k., but not even close to the quality that would command that price.  I know, delivery charge, taxes, blah blah blah...it's just a bottom line issue...waaay too much for an average pizza.  Sorry Rosati's, but we're done. 2
I lived all of life in the south until last year.  Good fried chicken is hard to find in Arizona.  It was good here.  I did not care for the salmon croquettes and the fried catfish was good but not great.  Sweet cornbread - oh so wrong.  We waited about 20 minutes to be seated.  Service was average, prices slightly high for what was being served. $14.00 for a veggie plate is overpriced, IMO.  Will I go back, yes.  Do I feel the need to drive an hour and a half to go back real soon, no.  Oh, if you are looking for sweet tea - they have it.  I ordered mine half & half (half sweet and half unsweetened and it was plenty sweet. 3
I went to this place once and NEVER going back! The most dirtiest place I ever been to.How the hell are you going to have your employee sweep the floor while people are eating. DUST is flying everywhere. Price is alright and pho is not the best. Please try giving your customer more than one meatball that is not cut into quarter. 1
Good food but misses the mark overall. Bathrooms are horrible, 2 single stall unisex ones that have long lines even at slow times. Service is slow. Seating for many people is awful , where we were lined up  in a picnic table like row of tables with half of the seats facing the butts of people at the bar.  Food is good but expensive . Rib Eye is $40, scallops are $9 ea.   One time was enough for me. 2
Haven't yet tried this Oyster Bar in Santa Fe....because unlike Texas Station, this one doesn't open until 4 or 5 pm.  Hey!!! F & B Manager....people love fish for LUNCH too!! 2
This place is terribly slow. There is never anything ready in their hot n ready zone. I come because it's supposed to be convenient but it's not convenient to wait 15 min for a cheese pizza. 2
I called Anthony on a Sunday afternoon needing  to get my TV mounted in my daughters room he was here within an hour and had a TV up in no time the job was done professionally and he beat  every other quote on CL I will definitely use them again and recommend them to others he was professional and friendly :) 5
Best new venue in the west!!!! Huge room.  Great sound.  Satisfying food.  Pleasant staff.   Can't wait to go back!  Well worthwhile the 4+ hour drive from LA. 5
Hit up the Monte Carlo to treat my mom and wife for there 1st time here. They were dressed in the all white of course . I've been to the other bar at Mandalay Bay so this is the same layout for me . Kind of small and quaint inside . My mom and wife really enjoyed  themselves and we stayed in ther for 30 min. Having 2 drinks and some good conversation about this experience . Nice bonding,  something unique and different that's for sure a  good time out , kind of pricey but well worth it for 1st timers ! 4
I ordered spicy chicken curry that comes with tom yum soup, grilled calamari appetizer and a glass of white wine. It was $26 and change with tax in.Service was ok. Attentive but not very well trained. Breaded calamari was tasty but I realized that most of it was breading and very thin strips inside the breading was calamari. Nice presentation though. On a bed of fresh lettuce in a dish in a shape of a boat. It also had a sauce that was half mayo and I found the mayo too western tasting addition. Soup was very good too. Very comforting on a chill night and just right amount spicy. Spicy chicken curry came in a very big portion and was very spicy. The waitress tried to explain me that albeit not very well. I have a friend who  finds Doritos spicy and I can take quite a bit of heat in my food and this was definitely at my limit if not a bit more. I could not taste the food very much and was sipping water after each bite. I took the leftovers home and warmed it up in coconut cream and that was definitely better. It was just past the dinner hour rush when I finished eating and the restaurant emptied out so I sat sipping my glass of wine watching the world go by outside on the street sans the usual ding of a busy restaurant in the background. My phone was also low on battery so I found an outlet and plugged my phone. Shortly after, the bus boy came and told me that his boss needs the electrical outlet and for me to unplug my phone. It was an odd request that I obliged. When I was on my way out, I passed by the little bench where the outlet was and saw that the owner plugged in 2 machines that were not cordless and battery powered but both had a cord (I would understand if she needed to charge them) so the whole point was that she (owner) did not want me to charge my phone there (and use their electricity). Judging by a comment from the woman with the baby in the review section, this is a good place to come for some cheap thai food but don't expect much from service and having a great experience. If you do, it will only result in a disappointment. 3
This repair shop had to move to a larger facility, I know why. When i came Jeremy told me they want to fix my car right and do what is needed only, so i don't sell my car and they can keep it running good, job security. They fixed my car quickly, and i am so happy to find a honest reputable shop, 5
What happened? We used to love this place. The same items we used to get now taste horrible. And the price seems to be way more. Should have kept the old owner on as a consultant. Will have to drive to coral or Osaka now. 1
I have been a customer for the past few years and love this place, unfortunately about 3 hours ago their rude staff got the best of me when I brought clients to discuss a brief over coffee (at their request).I brushed it off more than a few times in my years of being a patron thinking it might have just been a bad day for whoever was working. I've worked in similar situations and understand that you can't always be perfect but this was just unacceptable. I'm talking huffing and puffing, rolling their eyes & slamming cups! Not once, but TWICE when my clients ordered.I was absolutely mortified! I had to apologize to my clients for even suggesting the place.I won't be returning. 1
i loved the hazelnut coolatta, my son loved the doughnut holes. the quality of the product is what will be will be bringing me back to this location, the staff was a little mixed up but the coolatta and the doughnut holes made up for that. 5
Friday night they got a really bad JD, who plays the same music every time a few sons only and keep repeating it all night it gets boring. Some people call this a salsa club, but it is not, they don't play salsa. This place does not attract a lot of people; it is small and plays bad Latin music. Don't waste your night there! 2
Todd redirected our car with transmission problems to a disreputable place because he couldn't find out what was wrong with it. We spent thousands and months trying to get it to run only to find out in the end it was a sensor. Still went back to him. The last time that we went there he had our car for over week. We couldn't get a hold of him and when we did he said that they couldn't figure out what was wrong with the car. A few days later he said that they were still trying to figure it out. We called again and he said that they couldn't find our car keys. We were very upset and went to talk with them about it but no one was there. We looked under the rock where we had left them because we had left it there when they were closed, and the keys were still there and had not ever been moved. He had not ever looked at our car and lied about the whole thing, keeping our car from us that whole time. We took the car without ever talking to him about it and he never called to tell us that it was missing. We took it next door to A and B motors and it was a simple problem and had it back in one day. 1
Lovely little coffee shop :) It's cozy and you can get delicious coffee and simple eats. It's great! 5
Went here with a party of 8 for my birthday last year.  We ordered two of the Feast thingy's (All American Feast, I think it's called)...They serve them on a garbage can lid. Comes with ribs, chicken, and brisket or pulled pork, with 2 big sides and cornbread muffins.  Oh, and the fries, that are scattered all over the lid. My god, ALL of the food was good.  The ribs, were delicious fall off the bone, variety, the pulled pork was amazing (I had the pulled pork sandwich for lunch one time as well).  I love the different kinds of bbq sauce.  Their desserts are actually pretty friggin' good as well.  Their bread pudding is diabetic shock, but it's absolutely delicious.  The prices, really aren't that bad, either.  It's about $60 for one of the Feasts, and it really does serve about 5 people.   I've been here 3 times now, and will definitely come back again. 4
My husband and I love this place. Not only is the pizza delicious, the pasta bolognese is perfection. The mozzarella bar is something we order every time we frequent too. We haven't gone wrong with anything we've ordered yet. The staff is smiley and helpful. Since moving out of the neighborhood, we still make it here at least once a month. 5
It's pretty good for the burgers. The fries though weren't good. Seemed like they were frozen. The have a nice bar area. And even an outdoor area. Once the weather is better that will be great! 4
Allie, you're amazing! Had a perm for a few years and it was starting to grow out. Went in a few weeks ago to get rid of those frizzy curls left at the ends of my hair. Told Allie what I wanted, and she went straight to it! Best of all, it only took her less than 15 minutes! She gave me what I wanted and I couldn't be more happy with the results. The cut cost $16 without wash, which I thought was a reasonable price. I'm so glad I found this place because I don't have to ever go looking for another salon or stylist! 5
I am surprised to see great reviews for Entourage although four of them are quite old and one is for a "Linda" - not the owner, Glenda.  My experience was quite different.  I purchased a Groupon for two gel manicures.  When I called to book the two appointments I had to leave a voicemail but Glenda never returned my call.  So, a week later I texted her and finally got a response and "sorry" for not returning my call.  I booked both appointments - one before Thanksgiving and one exactly two weeks later.  When I arrived for my first appointment, Glenda was not there.  She called to let me know that she was running late. Although she is very slow and seems disorganized she was pleasant enough and I really had no complaints about the end result.  When I left I confirmed with her the next appointment in two weeks.However, when I arrived for the second appointment, another person was also waiting for the same time. Glenda seemed confused and told me that I had no appointment.  I showed her original text for the time and date she had confirmed and reminded her that I had reconfirmed when I was there the last time.  I had driven about 20 miles and I was leaving in two days for vacation so I definitely needed her to honor my scheduled appointment. The previous polish was already peeling off - only lasted about twelve days.  Again, the manicure took forever (about one and a half hours), she only put on two coats of gel which didn't look as good, and again it started peeling off in less than two weeks.  I have had many gel manicures with other manicurists over the past three years and this was the only one that took over an hour and also the only one that did not last two weeks (others usually last about three weeks.)  If I had paid full price it would have also been the most expensive.  I definitely would NOT recommend Entourage - there are many other places to get a better gel manicure for less money and with someone who is more organized and professional. 1
I've stumbled upon this restaurant on my vacation to Montreal. We were greeted by the host and seated to our table promptly. The restaurant was beautifully decorated inside and out. Now that is all positives I can give to this restaurant. We waited for over 30 minutes only to be served water. My husband told the waiter that we were ready to order. He nodded his head and disappeared for another 15 minutes. We weren't going to wait longer so we walked out. The waiter could have offered us a drink or something while we wait or even say that they are backed up and apologize for the wait... 1
We have had the company European Touch Landscaping taking care of our yard for years and finally decided to have them design our new landscaping. In 6 days our front and back yard was transformed to the "elegance" this company is known for. The crew was incredible and we couldn't be happier. We highly recommend this company if you want honesty and customer satisfaction. They went above and beyond to make our dreams come true. 5
I know live in Vegas and always wanted to try pinks. It's nothing special. I'd rather buy a better tasting & more robust hotdog & a drink @ Costco for just $1.50 than spend $6-$7 for something less appealing @ pinks. 2
My boyfriend & I went to Jozo yesterday after the gym and thought to check this place out since we've been seeing a lot of hype. The place is nice and quiet. Menu has a good variety of options from boba to coffee to smoothies. We ordered two drinks which was the Classic Taiwanese Milk Tea and the Signature Thai Tea. Milk tea was alright, it wasn't as sweet nor milky as most boba places. Thai tea was just like your regular Thai tea that you get at restaurants. And the boba was unusually smaller than your regular boba which was surprising coming from a boba place.What was really disappointing was the amount of ice that was in the drink! My boyfriend and I took two sips of the milk tea to try the flavor and noticed that the cup was pretty much ice! The 12oz cup (not even the bottle) was filled with 2/3 ice & 1/3 tea. I know it's being nit picky but I feel like I got gypped paying $4.50. Mind you, they were out of their cool bottles which comes standard with their drinks and still payed for the same price for a plain regular plastic cup - no name or anything. Overall, I think Jozo is jumping in with the trend of hipster branding but is lacking quality on the flavor. Wish I had a better experience! 2

I much prefer drinking here to eating here.  Sometimes it is the only place close and I decide to order food and I always regret it.  I'm a vegetarian so maybe I'm too limited and the burgers are awesome   So stick to traditional fare.  The salads my daughter and I had yesterday were pathetic 3
My husband and I frequent pizza places all around Las Vegas. We went to Novecento for the first time today and fell in love with it. The white pizza with our additions of pesto, ricotta and an Italian salami was so delicious. The staff was very helpful with guiding us to what we should put on our pizza. The ingredients were very fresh. The establishment was super clean. Our food came out promptly while we were just finishing paying. I would come back again and again!! The pizza was amazing. Dine in or take out soon because this pizza will blow your mind! 5
I choose to go here for my Birthday because I wanted to try out a couple of their Food Network featured items (the fontina burger and onion rings). I was SUPER disappointed to learn that they were all out of onion rings!!! I mean really??? One of your featured food items?? The burger was delicious however I don't think I will be back again as I fear they could be out again. Also we ate outside and there were a ridiculous amount of flies which also kind of ruined the experience. 2
I thought burger bar at manadaly was awesome! This place is just as good! The onion rings were really good too! I looked at yelp before I came in to see what people said and they all seemed to like it and I am no different. Check this place out! excellent burger cooked to perfection!! 5
ok do you guys know that fresh restaurant sells some items  GMO I was told that by a watier an i was very mad because I go there all the time.. and I really thought they celebrate more Farmers Market & local market knowing full well the studies done on genetically modified organism will never go back again tks 1
The service was great. I ordered the Works Scramble and while it was tasty it was a bit heavy on the salty feta. The portions are big. 4
Awesome food and great music. A must eat with authentic Mexican food. Not the Tex Mex fast food crap!!! The homemade wine is divine! The home chocolate ice cream is fabulous and so yummy!! 5
This was a pretty nice property. They did a great job with their interior landscaping and interior decorating.  rooms felt clean, sheets were crisp, white and clean.  Bed was fluffy with a pillow top.Did a late night check in at about 1am... the gal that checked us in looked like she was half asleep... very little conversation came out of her... so little that she never asked us if we wanted one king or two doubles!  checked into our room, and ended up with two doubles... we were so tired that we didn't even bother going back to the desk to change rooms... Valet parked the car, they allow you to call the valet desk to have your car pulled up to the front in 10-15min.  Pretty nice, no waiting needed. 3
I recently bought a queen size pillow top mattress and box springs.  I wasn't ready to have it delivered at that point.  They kept it for me until I was ready.  Chuck waited on me and was very patient when I was looking and made sure that I got what I wanted.  When the bed was delivered, Justin was very careful and very kind.  I would highly recommend them.  The prices are great and so is the service. 5
The place is overrated... It's a full service salon that is dramatically overpriced considering the quality of their service. 2
After calling just about every Westside mechanic and asking about programming my Vance and Hines fuelpak they all said , "nope, haven't done one of those". I finally called Synyster and telling him I had the instructions and settings, he told me to bring the bike by and he would look at it, like now, anytime today. I putted over and Jeremy looked over the instructions, talked with one of his techs and Bam, have a seat, I'll get right on it. Just over an hour later with a miniscule bill of $78 bucks I was cruising down the road with a well running 1200 Sportster. Now you can't do better than that. Give them a shot. I know I will be back 5
You can tell when a lot of thought has been put into a venture and after just one visit to Winestore it becomes apparent that the brains behind the thoughts had their synapses firing to great effect.Unlike some stores that tout "bazillions of bottles" or "bestellers" (I'm not naming names but pretend you're Robert Frost for a moment and think of some things that rhyme with Scrotal Vine and Paris Feeter), Winestore carries a limited stock, and they don't carry anything that they themselves haven't tasted and thought worthy of stockingThe look is modern, the lighting pleasing and the lion's share of the bottles are displayed vertically with labels out and within easy reach. Most of the wines are also sorted by color and density(Light Reds, Medium Reds, etc) while the rest are displayed in the rotating floor stands with labels like "Date Night", "Tax Refund" and "Girl's Night Out". All of the wines have cleverly written description cards next to them that are helpful in ascertaining the character of the wine.Two wall mounted kiosks also allow you to browse the store's stock and with the recently updated software they are running, track which wines you have purchased and rate them,which is great because I cant always remember what I thought of a particular wine that I may have had a year ago. They will also give you more information about the wine you just tasted (more on that in a sec) and allow you to add wines to your wish-list should a friend or relative happen by and want to know what to bring to that party your hosting. "Hey Mom, don't show up without a bottle of the Niepoort 20 year if you know whats good for ya!"Anyone who drinks wine knows the sad little moment when you take a taste of a wine not yet tried and think, "I don't like this nearly as much as root-canal." To combat this problem the slingers of grapes at Winestore have installed two machines imported from Italy called Enorounds, one for Whites and one for Reds that allow you to sample wines. You purchase a Winestore card, putting whatever amount of money you wish on it, insert the card into the Enoround, push a button and a sample will be poured for you by the machine. Not only does it allow you to try before you buy, it makes shopping for wine a lot more fun.What really makes the store stand out for me as my absolute favorite is that the owners, Matt and Keith, have taken the time to get to know me as a customer, are always willing to take the time to discuss particular wines with me and have become familiar with my tastes and will gladly recommend wines for me when asked.  For those of us that love wine, but aren't really educated on what grape is what and what region produces which to what effect, purchasing wine can be somewhat daunting. Not at Winestore. While there are a few good places to buy wine in Charlotte, Winestore is my absolute favorite. 5
Yuck! We went there tonight and first found the cutlery to be dirty, second it took a lot of time to be served. Third my food was tasteless. The bean paste was bland, not a speck of salt, i know I can salt my own but it should just be an adjustment.I ordered the beef fajitas, the beef was chewy, I just chewed it and discreetly spit it out.I told the server(nicely) and he did say sorry but did not take it off the bill.We will not be visiting again! 2
I have always had great experiences at Downtownfood and would highly recommend. I have been here for lunch, dinner and special events, and dtf has done all of these well. During the work week, they do a $25 3 course prix fixe menu, which is an excellent value. The service is always great, and a nice atmosphere as well.  Can't wait for Chef D-Mac to open his new restaurant in Mission! 4
Food was great. Service was pretty slow! Took about 15-20min to receive drink refills after asking for one! Maybe it was just an overwhelming busy night. Will go back! 3
I love this place! Having a pedicure here is soooo very relaxing. Cons are 1) Location: You'll have a difficult time finding parking. 2) It's pretty much impossible to get in without an appointment. 3) Their nail designs and polishes are limited. Pros 1) The atmosphere is very relaxing. 2) Fantasia gives the best foot rub! 3) The staff is very sweet! Fantasia doesn't talk a lot while you're trying to enjoy your service. Ruby the receptionist is very nice as well. I called her to say I would be about 10 minutes late because I was looking for parking and she was very chill about it. She's adorable and really bubbly but, in a genuine & not obnoxious kind of way. & she poured me a glass of this really good Chenin Blanc. I'm overall pleased & I won't be going anywhere else in Cleveland for my pedicures. I'm excited to try more of their services. 4
Disappointing - met a friend there for dinner; he had been there several times but this was our first visit. My friend and I had the quarter chicken natural, which was fine, but on the small side. It was tasty enough, but not particularly juicy ( the kind of moist chicken that I would expect for $11). My wife ordered the " famous" six small shrimp for $17. Seriously?We also ordered three sides - the corn, the beats and the succotash - all were fine but not unique in any way.Since we split the bill with our friend, my part was $45 and some change for the chicken, 6 shrimp and two rather small sides. We left feeling a bit hungry.There are many, many more excellent restaurants in the area where $45 + tip would have gotten us a more interesting and unique meal for that amount. Cafe Monte on Fairview, Upstream, and Village Tavern immediately come to mind.Bottom line: food didn't have any pizazz, the prices were way out of line and we'll not likely give Roosters our patronage in the future. Just too many other good places in the South Park area 2
Needed a lil pick-me-up at the end of our day and the Gingerbread latte was sooo good, too bad the guy behind the counter only made one drink for the two of us...I guess something got lost in translation. But other then that it was very yummy and pretty to look at 4
Perfect for a cheat day. Love going there and love taking my kids there! Always a friendly staff. Been there a lot of times and always had a positive experience 4
Love this place. Went there on Monday night and had a blast. Food's great and they always have new seasonal beers to keep things fresh - I love the daily food specials also. The best reverse happy hour in North Scottsdale and three friendliest bar staff to boot. 5
OK, so here's the deal, you're at PV Mall and it's lunchtime. You go to the food court and see that Paradise Bakery is the only decent choice but that's where you ate the last 47 times you were here. Easy solution, get in your car and drive across Tatum to Julio G's.The chips and salsa are free, plentiful, and delicious. The menu has all the standard Mexican menu items and are reasonably priced. Everything I've tried here was OK. Not, "OMG", but OK. Service has also been fine.Note, the portions are huge! I've never been able to finish my entree but maybe it's because I go through two baskets of chips. 3
I love this place!! Dr Herrera and her staff are the best! They are all gentle and caring, it really shows they care for their patients.  Prices are reasonable, but they also help with finance assistance which is great.  They all speak Spanish which is a plus! 5
The ambience at Tryst is great.  However, my husband and I have been to Tryst 4 or 5 times. The first time it was great but it has gone down hill since then.  Too much chatter between the staff when owners aren't there.  And today we waited at least 8 minutes before I flagged down the hostess for our waitress.  We eat out frequently and always give places a 2nd or 3rd try but we've had enough. 2
One of the most wonderful Thai massages I have received in Toronto. A beautiful space and my therapist was focused, attentive and very effective in relieving some back and neck pain I was having. A truly amazing experience.My *only* complaint is that is seems strange to tip an RMT -- I consider this a medical service, and it makes the price prohibitive for some when you include tax and tip on top of the base price. Otherwise, highly recommended. 4
While the wait staff were awesome at ensuring our meal was less than memorable. Chop burger was ordered with a gluten free bun that was as hard as a hockey puck and the chicken salad was drenched in dressing to the point the lettuce was swimming. Chances of returning are slim unless only drinking 3
I looked forward to visiting rock salt since its opening. Finally had the opportunity this past weekend and unfortunately, I was very disappointed. The restaurant was moderately full but certainly not jammed with patrons.  My wife and I were greeted quickly and offered either indoor or outdoor seating. We opted for outdoor due to my wife's previous experience with the noise level inside. After 10 minutes our waitress took drink order. She returned 15 minutes later to ask if we were ready to order dinner although we were still waiting for our drinks. She apologized that they only had one bartender. One bartender on a weekend dinner service running 25 minutes behind?We ordered oysters and smoked trout roe as appetizers. Oysters were arguably the smallest oysters I have ever seen, smaller than a typical cherry stone clam. The roe was good but served with a bag of potato chips, a bag of potatoes chips for $29!I had the fish of the day which was amberjack and my wife had the scallops. She enjoyed the scallops very much. The amberjack however was cold and raw in the middle. I typically enjoy fish medium but this was actually raw and drowning in salt. Served with Swiss chard that was also so heavily salted as to be inedible.  We finished quickly and moved on to dessert elsewhere, leaving the menus that the waitress had never bothered to pick up from our table behind. Great concept, very poor execution 2
Place was dead on a Friday night. Walked in around 7:30, grabbed a seat at the bar with a couple buddies.Bar tenders were friendly. Good beer selection. Had a Bells Two Hearted and a Voodoo HooDoo. Food just wasn't anything special. Ordered a Po' Boy. Nothing like you would expect if you're thinkin classic gulf coast. Was on Texas toast style bread. Shrimp were okay, too much breading though. Even with something called ghost pepper cheddar, it lacked flavor. Needed seasoning or something. Salt and pepper, or some old bay? I don't know. Came with a warm pickle and frozen fries.I'm not in Murrysville often, but I gotta think there's something better than this? Sorry. 2
Sweat is great. Great if you can afford outrageous prices for personalized training that isn't personal as it is done in groups.That isn't the main problem with that place. It's the owner himself. He is rude, arrogant and divides his attention amongst his favorites of the fittest women in there. If you're not his idea of fit, you're not even in the room. The place is small, stuffy and cramped. Josh, the owner, is not pleasant to be around. I am amazed that he's still in business. Keep your money, join any gym in the area and get a trainer that gives only you their attention. 1
Dined on July 3rd, 2012+ Delicious made-to-order food+ Dirt cheap, as compared to other Indian restaurants in the area+ Clean restrooms+ Spacious dining tables. You will be glad when you have ordered multiple items+ The host was fluent in English- Service is slow, probably because the food is cooked to order- The place is HOT! I do not know why the AC was not workingWe dined here on a sweltering Vegas evening. The place was hot but was offset with good quality food, easy on spices and oil. I found the food to be under-salted but that is any day better than being served over-salted food. We ordered the following:- Chicken Curry - Best of the lot. Enough for two people- Malai Kofta - Easy on the cream and very delicious. Enough for two people- Goat Biriyani - Low on oil, wish it had a little more salt to begin with- Naan - Soft and delicious- Rotis - Give it a miss...was almost as crunchy as a poppadomThey ran out of ice and we had to wait, while the owner had to rush out to get the ice. By the time he came back, we had paid and were about to leave. He explained the situation and apologized for the delay and thanked us for visiting Shalimar. Nice guy. 4
Man! I can't believe I gave this place another chance. Almost the exact same thing as my first post. I came to this place to price a tire because I have a steel shank stuck in my tire, and I have to get to work. They don't have the ire in stock but say they can have it brought over in 20 minutes. I agree and go wait. More than an hour goes by and still no tire. They never even followed up to see where the tire was. Once I ask what is going on, they call and tell me the tire is 9 minutes away. I end up waiting another 30 minutes before just leaving. They never bothered to apologize or offer any type of compensation. Now I am at another place where the wait is going to be about 45 minutes to have a new tire put on. At this point I  Will be about 2 hours late for work, when I should have been on time if the timeframe that I was quoted would have been accurate. I will NEVER even attempt to give this place another chance. 1
If you like beer you'll love Aces and Ales. Over 20 craft beers on tap and a Tuesday special where you can try 6 and a different food each week for $20 was worth it. I had fish and chips with a side of pretzels. The food was great and the presentation is not at all what you'd expect from a bar. The people around me were pleased with their sandwich and nachos too. Misty the bartender was helpful and very friendly. My one complaint would be the prices a little on the high side for me. 4
Went during happy hour and it was slow.  Had a lot of staff but they were all eating and talking with one another. The service was terrible.  Seemed like they had no management or even cared. The food was good and once were helped food came out fairly quickly.  Took so long to get service but they had so many help doing nothing and having a good time. We would have ordered more but no one would take an order.  I would not go again cause of the service. If you want an easy job and free food I would try and get a job there 2
This was the second time I've ever walked out of a restaurant. We had a party of 10 and they tried to cram us in a space made for 8 and we said no so they got us a bigger table in a moldy smelling back room. After changing servers on us a couple times we finally put in a drink order. After awhile of not getting the drinks for awhile the manager comes out and tells us the beer taps weren't working so they had no draft beer. That did it for us. Service was talking forever and was already terrible. We left and went to a much better restaurant a few doors down 1
Tried an americano today and I don't quite understand the hype with this place. My first sip tasted burnt but it faded away after a couple more sips. It just felt weak and didn't taste full bodied even though the aromas of shop were heavenly. Will try their drip coffee next time with hopes it being better than the americano. 2
After a recent SHITE trip to Streets of New York (which is the most accurate way of describing how their pizza tastes) I really need to vouch for this Domino's. As noted before, they are always fast and friendly. They have the nicest delivery drivers. Unlike Streets. Domino's has never made me sick either. 5
Myself and a friend were visiting the area from The United States.  We have a friend in Montreal who was able to get us a reservation at this restaurant.  We were very excited to be able to eat here during our trip.  We had an 830 reservation and we walked from our hotel not that far away.  We arrived about 20 minutes early and we were told we could sit and have a drink at the bar.  When we approached the bar to sit the bartender asked if we had "permission" to sit at the bar, which i thought was kind of strange.  After informing him that we did have "permission", he asked us what we would like to drink.  Two of us ordered a Pinot Noir and one ordered a mixed drink.  We sat chatting until our table was ready.  The waitress was very nice but must have been very busy that evening because she was slow coming to the table.  We ordered another round of drinks.  When she came back she poured a different wine and we told her we had the Pinot Noir.  She came back to the table and told us that they didn't have any Pinot Noir that evening and wasn't sure which wine the bartender had given us. They finally figured it out and it wasn't what we had even asked for originally.  We decided to just have the original wine and let it slide being we were so excited to be there.  We ordered the Lobster Poutin to start and also placed our dinner orders.  We were served bread thankfully because it took forever to get the Poutin which the three of us ate in no time because the portion (and we ordered the meal size) was quite small.  We had to cut the lobster pieces on top so that the three of us would at least get some lobster.  We sat talking and waiting for dinner for a very long time.  Finally the food came out and we started to eat.  The waitress then came over and kept trying to clear dishes while we were eating.  We finished up dinner and were waiting for the waitress to come back to give us the desert menu but that didn't happen.  A male came over and put a small piece of cheesecake down and said this is on the house and could we please hurry because they needed our table!!! Are they kidding me.  It was not our fault that they took so long serving us dinner but now they didn't offer us a desert menu or coffee and they throw our one small desert for 3 people and ask us to hurry so they can have the table.  We paid the overpriced bill and left and got our coffee elsewhere.  Not happy was an understatement.  Overpriced, small portions, slow service (until they need your table), never offered a dessert and coffee menu.... We ate at much better restaurants during our week long trip... 2
Really wanted to like this place.  But had a horrendous experience all around... Staff was woefully inept and over their heads.  Food came out 40 minutes later and was burnt & inedible.  We will not be back.  Very sad to see yet another restaurant fail so early...  good luck to them. 1
Stopped here for a quick dinner with a friend as we were both craving some Korean fried chicken reminiscent of our time spent in Korea. I have to say, I really wasn't expecting much walking in (mostly just picked this place because it's a really convenient location - just steps from Finch stn), but I left very pleasantly surprised/satisfied!The interior is pretty much your standard Korean restaurant/bar setting - dimmed lights, Korean music, K-pop videos showing on the TV screen. I was pretty happy that the music wasn't turned up overly loud as a lot of bars in the area tend to do so my friend and I could actually hold a conversation. It is not a big space at all but it didn't feel cramped even with another table sitting next to us.The server was very helpful with navigating the menu and we ended up ordering the cheesed corn, standard half+half chicken (fried and sauced) and the spicy grilled chicken(?). They brought out some complimentary popcorn with our drinks and the corn came out pretty quickly - served on a sizzling plate and definitely a nice app to start with! The chicken is of course the most important factor in judging a chicken restaurant and this place did not disappoint! Of all the Korean fried chicken places I've tried in Toronto, I think this place comes the closest to what I remember eating so regularly back in Korea. The fried half was very crispy, perfectly seasoned and made of smallish (but meaty) dark meat pieces. The sauce was the right mix of sweet/spicy and was not used excessively like some places do (on a side note, we did confirm with the server that the side radishes and the sauces for the chicken are both made in-house and not store bought).We barely tried the spicy grilled chicken as we were both so full from the fried chicken but from what little I did try, it was a little too spicy for my tastes but a great complement to the fried chicken, in that it somewhat eases that "greasy" feeling you get after eating a few pieces?All in all, will definitely be coming back here whenever I get a Korean friend chicken craving and would recommend to all looking for the same! 5
The girls in the leasing office have HORRRRRRIBLE attitudes.. Like it's uncomfortable how forwardly rude they are for no reason. 1
Not exactly worth the price. The burger was just ok. The fries weren't that good. There was stuff floating in the tea. The only good thing was probably the onion rings. Probably won't be going back. 2
Annie, the owner of the salon portion, is ABSOLUTELY...THE BEST! She really knows her stuff about hair and is a color correction specialist. Before I moved out to Arizona (originally grew up in NY), my hair was bleach blonde and I never liked it. My hair dresser back in NY LOVED blonde and so kept making my hair lighter with each visit. I did not have the heart to yell at her and say "stop coloring my hair the color YOU want it to be". When I met Annie, the experience was ENTIRELY different!!! The first thing she asked me was what I envisioned for my hair color, what I did not like about it, and how I thought it would be perfect. Another thing she said was that anytime I was bored with my hair to feel free to tell her and she would revolutionize it again. She stayed true to her promise in the now two years that I have been seeing her. I also LOVE that if I want something new done to my hair and it is not fashion forward, she will work with the idea until it is. It always comes out even better than the original thought!!! I keep telling her that she needs to start her own product line too so hopefully that is to come soon!!! :DAs far as the vintage portion...Miles runs that. It always has intriguing items that are not what you would expect to find just anywhere. I have personally not made a purchase yet, but my colleague and I went to 3rd Thursday and she bought a door for $5!!! There is not even where to have lunch for that price! Miles gave her helpful suggestions as to how to recreate the door into a unique piece of art with either using pictures and turning it into a giant frame or using it as a room divider. Pretty cool!!! I am excited to see what my first purchased item will be someday! Annie and Miles are an unstoppable team! Go visit! 5
I'm not sure why there are so many negative comments, I had a good experience here.  The main reason I tried this place is because of the location, only being about 5 minutes away from my house.  Christina did my nails, extremely helpful and nice.  She took her time to get me the the exact color I wanted, talked to me and offered me a drink.  I went in an hour before closing and the receptionist was afraid I wouldn't be able to squeeze in a pedicure, but Christina was fast and efficient to make sure I had enough time.  Another woman (I forgot her name :( ) did my pedicure when everyone was already packed up and ready to leave so I really appreciated that.  It seriously was the best pedicure I've ever had, all the tough skin I had on my feet gone.  A lot of people complain about the laziness of the owner, but I didn't see him fooling around.  A nail lady's phone was going off and he was attentive to put her ringer on silent, and sorting through the receipts with the receptionist. Only downside...the owner of the place was there today, and a bit standoffish.  I wouldn't say rude...but not friendly.  He interrupted my pedicure to have the lady check a yelp review (I'm assuming) because it was regarding a complaint and it was in a different language she could understand.  I didn't mind but it seemed unprofessional.  He kind of was staring at me, so I just said hello and he ignored me. :/ I would have given it five stars.  However, I work in an office, and a lot of ladies ask about my nails since I'm constantly working with my hands, and I will recommend this place and Christina! 4
David and all the people at Innovative Pool Systems are a pleasure to deal with. It is a family business so rest assured you will know everyone that is coming in and out of your property. The quality of their work is top notch. I got multiple quotes before selecting David and his team and I can honestly say that he was the only one I didn't feel was trying to take advantage of me during the process. (FYI this is not my first pool install or remodel) I read a lot of reviews on here about lack of communication but to those people I would suggest you educate yourself on the process of the job you are requesting someone perform for you. Be an engaged home owner and do your homework. David is easily accessible and returns a phone call or text shortly after receiving it. In short if you know what you are asking for and you want quality work with someone you can have a honest discussion with then Innovative is the way to go. 5
Beer is good. Food seemed appropriate. Service was a bit scatterbrained. Everyone was very nice. If you're in the area stop in. Otherwise seek out a brewpub near you for similar fare. 2
Oh Metro. It is the only grocery store near my house so I find myself coming here even though honestly its terrible. The produce is never fresh. It is always busy (due to great location). In general the staff are unfriendly - but it's hard to blame considering most of the customers I have seen hear are nastier than the rotting oranges up front. One positive of Metro is that are typically good deals if you check the flyer. Unfortunately if anything that is on sale will not be in stock. However, they are kind of okay about giving out rainchecks. If you can go somewhere else do it, but if you are in a pinch Metro is okay - I just wouldn't buy produce here. 1
This is the worst Apartment Complex EVER!  I've submitted 5 complaints due the noise from my upstairs neighbor, including the Las Vegas Metro Police.  The last one was for my neighbor hammering nails in the wall at 2 am!  It's impossible to even have people over because of the constant arguing and noise at all times of the night.  Management has not even responded to the last 2 emails sent.  They are worthless!  Overpriced!  Too Loud! 1
Always happy to support this local business. I refuse to pay $160 for a new battery. I can get a new one here for $65 with an 18 month warrenty. I could also buy a used one for $35 with a 6 month warranty. They always take care of myself and my family. 5
First off I am an nurse and ur optic nerve is the connection between the back of the eye and the brain. So the last review is a total joke. We bought a deal on groupon and were very very satisfied with Dr. Cramer. I would recommend him to my MOM. It really bothers me to see posts like that. Dr. Cramer was very friendly and down go earth.  I will definitely be going back 4
We love our leather loveseat and sofa that we purchased from sofa mart.The problem was the costomer service and the fact that it took 6 week longer than expected (we were quoted 2-3 weeks for delivery... it arrived 81/2 weeks later).  In this time of wait and waiting for our furniture there was no communication from sofa mart, I had to constantly call for updates, to which our salesman Micheal was no help what so ever.Would only get furniture from there if it was in stock or you can take it with you. 3
Nothing bad to say about this place at all.Doner sandwich is great, but Baba's famous dinner is the go-to. Solid portion for a great price, both beef and chicken are great. Generous amount of rice, not many potatoes but you honestly won't want more of them once you get halfway through the dish. I've Ritualed here more than a handful of times and I've never not enjoyed it.Always quick service and the dudes working there are always grateful that you have decided to eat their food. 4
Heard some great things about this place so the boyfriend and I decided to check it out since we had no idea what we wanted to eat for dinner.   One word: disappointed.The food selection was decent.  They even had prime rib and snow crab legs.  However, it was the food quality that was horrible.  Everything tasted either too salty or just bland.  By the looks of it, most of food seemed to be sitting out too long.  The service wasn't that great either.  Our server came by at the most two times.  We needed refills on drinks that we never got.  The buffet does unlimited beer.  We are not fans of Miller High-Life so we decided to pass on that. All in all, we will never go back again.  There are far too many buffets in Vegas to venture to if we ever are in the mood.  This place just doesn't have what it takes. 1
The horrible thing about all the time people make to write reviews to help steer patrons away from The Gypsy Bar, is that The Gypsy Bar DOES NOT CARE.  It's futile and they seem to have their own vision that doesn't really include quality service anyway.  Funny thing is the current owner got rid off all the staff that made it this way before and still currently has the same problem.  So to understand where the problem lies is a complete mystery.  We have been patrons for the majority of the time The Gypsy Bar has been open.  Coming in for the amazing happy hour menu and the soothing tunes of the live music on Friday nights.  Jessica our server was always wonderful.  She always remembered our faces and what we drank and was a bright spot that we looked for every Friday night.  However, around mid January the establishment took a turn in feel and service.  Consecutive times of coming in (in grid lock traffic from south Chandler) we were turned away due to "private parties" booking the entire area that supports the live music.  I have been in the fine Resort/Hotel industry since I was old enough to work (over half my life) so I understand catering to a client and still taking care of the regulars who keep you alive.  The way they handled this however seemed to be a lack of what to do for the normal patrons by the front line service staff.  We don't choose to go out that often, and when we do we are very specific.  To be turned away the first time then the next consecutive week when we had family in town specifically there to do two things...one, see us and two see the music the gypsy had on friday nights to be treated by the staff where we actually were insulted and scolded for where we were sitting(mind you with no one sitting in this area but us...with 15 minutes left to open it up to the public)...this server was an asian female with two toned hair like the girl on last season's The Voice....then the bartender...James I think ,barked at  my husband when he was only asking for happy hour menus...saying, "Im not the one you need to talk to"...Graham, the manager tried to smooth it over with buying a couple rounds of drinks, which was nice, however we feel no matter when we go in there from now on we will be treated second rate and have evidence that we will.  Staff, outside of a couple female servers was arrogant. The people who run things from the kitchen are exempt from this statement.  I was a concierge for almost a decade and I would steer clear of this atmosphere until the management does another complete overhaul and the guest is really seen as the guest. 1
Good location. Cramped but cute interior. Bland yet salty ramen. Toppings were eh (overcooked/bland). Service: only one person looked like they knew what they were doing. Their system of seating and taking orders could be improved upon. 2
We love this place! A great little bakery for us to walk to. Fresh food and friendly service. 5
This place was the cheapest available and I was not impressed. They charge a large deposit for small little crappy room. The bathroom floor was dangerously slippery and some of the bathroom hardware was loose. The room came with wifi but the connection was bad. Only stay if it's really cheap and don't expect much. On the plus side, it's really close to the MGM & the strip 2
This place reminds me of some of the locations in Miami called Pollo Tropical however if food was very refreshing cooked well and tasted great the only reason I gave it three stars is because the service was ferocious my wife's order was wrong twice I had to argue with cashier because they charged me for one meal and gave her a different one my only reason for the review is to let the owner know got to get the service together man and you'll have it all made 3
While the flood greatly impacted the zoo, it is amazing to hear how they dealt with the flood emergency. Talking to the employees there, you can see how much they care about the animals and how much they love what they do. The new penguin exhibit is lovely. The Africa exhibit is also great. I was lucky enough to be able to do the Behind the Scenes experience with the giraffes, where you get to get up close and personal. Would recommend visiting on a weekday or perhaps in winter, when it won't be quite as busy. On a nice summer weekend day, the crowds can be a little much to handle and take away from the experience. 4
We came here on a morning we were desperate for breakfast before our spring training game.  Everywhere in the near several miles was packed for breakfast and we were in a bit of a hurry.  Didn't want typical fast food.We wandered by this coffee shop.  Line was not terribly long but they were also quite efficient.  I was hoping for a breakfast burrito but the ones I wanted were not able to be done because they were out of sausage.  My wife and I rarely get the same thing but we went with what I think was a special.  It was a BBLLT, basically a BLT but with lox.  I wasn't so sure...but I was hungry.  It was a good choice.  The salty bacon with the tomato and the increased smokiness of the lox was fantastic.  The latte I had wasn't so bad either.Ambiance was nice and service was good to.  If we were in the neighborhood, I would hit it up again 4
Nice lounge areas, nice resort/casin however over priced. Glass of standard red wine is $15. It's a cool place but as everything in Vegas it is grossly over priced. It worked for us because we were tired of walking around and just wanted a place to sit down. 3
BBQ chicken pizza tasted like it had been made earlier today, found an ant scurrying next to our table. When I told the waiter this he jokingly said he didn't control the ants and told us about the bee problem they had over the summer. Great.Would not recommend, go to one of the many downtown locations instead. 1
Danny/Jeff are excellent at what they do & provide value, service , trust in an industry where at times it is lacking.Jeff knows BMW's inside out & Danny with his customer service skills have ensured that as long as I owe an BMW Babbitt is where I go. 5
I love what they do. But I just had my puppy there for their spay/neuter clinic. He came home, the next day he showed signs of a UTI, (bloody urine, straining to pee). So I took him to his veterinarian and they said they were even disappointed, and prescribed him antibiotic. Yes, you're getting money for it. But be a little bit easier on the little guys, no he wasn't dropped all the way but pulling and tugging and poking resulted in a bloody UTI. I'm very disappointed. Just because it's cheap doesn't mean it's worth it. Please reconsider their clinic, but continue to adopt and visit them as the staff was somewhat friendly... I'm almost afraid to know how they treated my dog when I left. On a better note, his incision isn't infected and seems to be alright. 2
One of my favorite restaurants hamds down. The martinis are amazing (jolly rancher), the salads and antipesto are so tasty. I always love the cozy feeling in tge winter and the hot patio with ferry lights in the summer. Great staff and amazing location. 5
I am in love with this place. Today was my first time and we need one in Tucson immediately! The parking lot was packed and just as I was about to get irritated I noticed there is complimentary valet service. Que  fancy! The inside is super casual and clean and the staff was awesome! We didn't get to sit outside in the crazy cool and dog friendly patio. I saw a dog sitting on the a table outside! I ordered from the $10 brunch menu. Food plus 10oz beer or mimosa. I had the breakfast wrap, the wife had the breakfast flat bread. I recommend both. My girls had chicken tenders which were actual chicken with a tasty fried covering. They loved their food too. If you have kids, a dog, and hankering for good food you owe it to yourself to come here. 5
Dishonest and liersBought a vehicle from them sight unseen, told them I had to rely on their honesty as I couldn't go see the vehicle and I had to get it shipped. Told them that my first criteria was to have a vehicle without any rust, they told me the vehicle didn't have any rust at all. When I got the vehicle it was so rusted that the rocker panels where nonexistent and the floor was also rusted through at some spots and there was hole big enough to fit my hand through the floor and grab the seat belt from underneath. The vehicle would have cost me the same price I had paid for it to get it fixed properly so that it could be put on the road in my province. I had to return the vehicle which cost me a total of 1300$ that I lost in shipping.And they are a member of AMVOC? 1
Oh Sage, where do I begin!? Been here twice now and each time, the experience has been spectacular! From the service, to the food and decor...one can expect nothing short of excellence in every regard. First time we came here, we had such a memorable meal, that the next time we were in Vegas, we just knew we had to go. We had the chef's tasting menu the first time around and did the signature tasting menu the second time around. Both were quite delicious.I cannot say enough good things about Sage but I'll definitely be coming back! 5
So far I have only had pho tai chin and it was fantastic. I am glad to have found a great pho joint so close to me! Looking forward to trying the rest of the menu!Edit: Awesome, absolutely great. I have gone many, many times for late breakfast or lunch and I am never disappointed. The waitstaff is very friendly and always on the spot for drink refills and advice on what to get! I cannot recommend enough! 5
We had lunch here today.  The Kobe burger was quite tasty, although I asked for it "medium well" and got "well". This begs the question, why ask how I want it cooked if it will not be made to order? Anyway, I have the time to write this review right now as they are TRULY UNDERSTAFFED and it beats twiddling my thumbs while waiting for the rest of my food to come. I like the ambiance, the wine flights are good, the ONE lone waitress deserves a medal for her INCREDIBLE work ethic. She was knowledgeable, friendly, and on her game... She was  just REALLY overworked because of the lack of wait staff.I recommend the flight (6-1oz tastings of wines you choose), but there was no way for us to rinse our glasses between tastes, unless you ask...I guess.Lastly, I would give the food a rating of 4, the service (due to lack of wait staff) a 2.5, and the ambiance a 3. The overall rating is 3, but could be higher if staffed appropriately. 3
My mom and I have been coming here for years and it's been the same every time. No matter what, you will wait and wait and wait for AT LEAST an hour, no matter when your appointment is or if you show up on the dot or early. They have no concept of time management.  None. For example, I had an appt today at 11A. I showed up 5 mins early. It is now 12 and they JUST called me in. Mind you that was only for my temp, BP, and weight. Im still sitting here waiting. That's 1 hour and counting! Im trying very very hard to not curse quite a bit right now because this is so unprofessional. It tells the patient that their time doesn't matter & that they aren't important. It is extremely rude. They are a good enough staff. Everyone is nice and friendly. Years ago the old PA caught a life threatening issue that saved my life. That's why Im not giving it 1star.UPDATE:  It's 12:35 PM now and the PA just walked in. So that's a 1hr & 35 minute wait. Did I get an apology for my wait? No. Obviously me telling her that I was upset because of their lack of professionalism made her angry because she was super short with me afterwards.  I said, "I am very frustrated right now because I have been waiting for way too long. That is unprofessional and extremely rude." Apparently that made me a jerk. Whatever,  I am never going back there again. I have been to many doctors and that is NOT how a professional office treats their patients.  And I won't even get started on how when I walked back into the room she was talking about my results with my mother who had come with me. Im in my 30's. Patient confidentiality? Seriously, no respect or professionalism from this PA. 2
Great dinner on Sunday night. Nice atmosphere as they had opened up access to the patio, so you felt like you were on a patio even though sitting inside. Food and service was good. Had a large chicken salad which was delicious. Worth a visit. 4
I've heard there are big plans for this place. But it is still in its early days. Nice community, well kept grounds, and quiet. Your drive to the Vineyards makes you wonder if you are in the right place because you mostly see small homes and trailers, some are not taken care of. Then as you arrive at the Vineyards, the surroundings change and you find perfect landscaping, new homes, and neighborhoods that seem family ready. I was only a visitor here, but I think this would be a great place to live in a few years. 3
Went there this past weekend with the wifey and we both loved it. The service was friendly and helpful, and the food was great. I've had better lobster in boston, but that's obviously an unfair comparison. By Toronto standards, it was really really good. Wife and I both got the set dinner, which includes: garlic rolls, house salad, lobster bisque (freakin delicious). , lobster (steamed or broiled) and a side (fries, baked potato, rice), and a soft drink. I came in famished and left stuffed. For the both of us, I paid $100 incl tax and tip.If you're looking for a classy, upptiy fine dining restaurant, this ain't it. It's a family owned gig with a friendly atmosphere there. But If you're looking for a casual, unpretentious seafood restaurant that serves good food at a reasonable price, Lobster Royale is the place for you. 4
My husband I and both have been seeing Alisha for four months and I cannot say enough great things about her as a stylist and colorist. She is meticulous and thorough. Every hair cut has been fantastic. And her skills at doing color are better than any I've ever had. She always checks the costs before you have any services done, and I feel the prices are very fair for what you get. I'm a Chicagoan so I've had many many extremely expensive hair services done in the past and Modern Salon is less expensive than what I've had before and offers better service as well. Everyone is very friendly, polite and goes out of their way to assist you. I would recommend Modern Salon to anyone but mostly I would say book with Alisha. She is such a great stylist and a wonderfully warm person as well. 5
Love their food..I went for their mac and bacon dish and it was yummy....the butter chicken that my husband had was so good too. Would be nice to have more chicken in it but other than that the food rocked. Waitress was great and she looked busy since it was packed house when we came in on Tuesday night since it was wing night. 4
I go to Fabulous Freddy's and when I moved on other side of town I found this Country Club car wash. The ultimate exterior wash was $11 which I purchased and man did they do a bad job. They don't wipe your rims down plus they don't shine your tires. When I go to Fabulous for the same price of $11 they wipe your rims with a towel and shine your tires for the same price as Country Club car wash. I will not be going back to this place at anytime. Find fabulous at your area. They do a fabulous job for your buck! 2
DELIZIOSO!!This place has got the closest thing to real Italian Pizza that I've found in Vegas. The Roman style is just that- crispy and perfect flavor. Their ingredients are quality which make the price a bit higher than your normal pizza place. BUT this is NOT a normal pizza place!The service is spot on- the most adorable Italian female server (forget her name) she is perfection! Ensuring your experience is pleasant with her Italian hospitality.Oh and did I mention the wine- get selection!Can't go wrong with this place!! 5
Overall: Asian fusion buns with a unique flavor profile twist that includes earl grey, matcha, Hong Kong style, Japanese,  Tawainese and French.Sample: there are  bread samples for you to taste before you buyCleaniness: unlike other Chinese bakeries that reuse the trays and tongs, they do clean it before reusingCost: range from about $ 2.90-5$ for buns- I didn't check the pastriesTaste:  bought the Earl grey twist, matcha red bean bun and it tasted great.Value and would I come back:  probably not - the price seems a bit inflated.  For a one time experience for breakfast or snack, it's not a bad idea. 3
Oh my gosh - Always H.  I had the same exact experience you did.  This is the worst company ever.  They have a lot of reviews on the better business bureau and they are ranked D- (yes, that's very bad).  That guy Greg Dawson smooth talks you and you think its going to be all better, but you end up getting screwed.   You're almost at the end of your contract, and if you don't feel like you will be hurt by them over the next couple of months, wait until November / Dec and send in your NOTICE TO TERMINATE.  Read the fine print, I think you need to do it by cerified mail.    I lost thousands of dollars using them as my property manager.  I now manage the properties myself and it is going MUCH better thank you. 1
The service was very good, and fast. But I did have a problem with the menu being dirty the pages where sticky and  had some dried peaces of food and so was the table. 3
Just like the previous reviewers, we arrived on time only to be told there would be a delay - about 30 minutes. The photographer insisted, even verbally fighting with me in front of my kids, that she wanted to take my son's pictures first. My son is shy and takes awhile to warm up so this was a terrible idea - but the photographer just wouldn't listen to reason and I decided it was easier to just let her take his pictures first since I had waited to the last minute to take holiday pictures. I asked for our toddler to be next, followed by group pics, and then my older two girls. The photographer again disregarded my wishes and wanted to do all of the individual pictures first, so by the time she was ready for the group shots - my toddler was in full meltdown and we left before we could finish. We made an appointment two days later to come back and take the group pictures - what a hassle with 4 kids during the busy holiday season. They didn't have time to review the pictures at that time so I'm still waiting for a call back to finally see if any of the pictures turned out! I was glad to have a Groupon, but still a waste of time and energy - probably better off using a different studio with better reviews next time. 2
Well.  Here's the thing:When it's good, it's good!  When it's bad, it's pretty bad.  I've had some pretty tasty dinners here, and the portions are such that I can get about three meals out of a dinner combo.  Awesome, considering it's costs like $8 or something.  But then I tried the Hunan Beef and it was awful.  No flavor and a strange texture.I give it 4 stars because I don't want to change their rating.  If you get the right things (which so far have been General Tsao's Chicken and Sesame Chicken), then it's good.  But some things are very mediocre to... not good.I will definitely go back.  Great price, generally good Chinese food, and pretty giant portions for the price! 4
My cup of fish chowder was weird. There were little bits of stuff that seemed like chopped bits of meat, no idea what kind of fish. It was a flop. My Margherita flatbread was excellent. My wife's beef Stroganoff was ok. I was put off by the high wine prices and the lack of prices for beer and mixed drinks. 3
Stayed here for 4 days and 3 nights with my boyfriend, another couple and my friend's brother! So 5 people in a 2 bedroom suite. Loved it! Plenty of space for everyone. My boyfriend and I stayed in the master bedroom, it was very spacious and had a very big  bathroom with a nice tub for baths. The kitchenette was so great, we cooked several meals and made lots of drinks! The one thing they didn't have was dishwasher soap. The front desk was very friendly and helpful. Whenever we needed our trash picked up or more towels they brought them within minutes. We drove to Vegas from California and got to the hotel early, I requested and early check in and they were able to get us in 2 hours before check in. Also they provide shuttle service to and from the strip which was GREAT! Only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because one of the days while I was taking a shower the water got cold and stayed cold - never a good thing! 4
Worst bank ever. The day I opened my account I deposited money and their machine was so sketchy it would keep telling me to insert my card. Finally got it to work and put my money in and left to work. Next day on my day off I sign up for mobile banking and I'm left with 30 dollars. I called the bank and they said my card was used at Walgreens for over 700 with my pin and they kept telling me that it's impossible for it to happen and they kept insisting that I did it myself. Customer service told me I was a liar and they needed to see my pay stubs to believe me. How are my pay stubs and how much I make even relevant to fraud activity. Worst service ever. As soon as I can get my issue resolved if I get it resolved because they're accusing me of lying, I'm closing this account. Do not open up anything with them!!! 1
I really used to like Coffee Culture.. The drinks are decent and some of the food items are pretty good. The staff were always nice and friendly. However, looks like recently they got all new staff including a new store manager and unfortunately, the service is AWFUL!! They are beyond slow, don't know the menu items and are just generally not welcoming or friendly.The other day I walked in and made eye contact with one of the workers, who was chatting with his co-worker as she attempted to complete a food order (she didn't know how to make it and the customer had clearly been waiting a long time), he didn't even acknowledge that I'd entered the cafe or say that he'd be with me in a minute because he was 'busy'.. I waited at the cash register for almost 5 minutes and was about to leave before anyone even took notice that I was trying to give them my money.I have several years of coffee shop work experience, so I know how service should be at these places and this type of service is just not on. I don't expect you to drop everything and roll out the red carpet when I arrive, but at least greet your customers and try not to make them wait a ridiculous amount of time to get in and out of your store. I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon.I gave it 2 stars rather than one just because it's a decent place to sit and do work on your laptop if you can tolerate the staff for long enough to get your order. 2
I just finished dinner with my wife and mother-in-law. We are all raving about the amazing meal. The staff was extremely helpful, and every dish we ordered was extremely fresh and delicious. I highly recommend this restaurant! 5
Michael is very knowledgeable and professional and was able to help me set up my new 4K tv. Thank you! 5
Last few deliveries the quality has been dropping :( our pouting last night had watery gravy with no taste. It was no thicker than a soup. Very disappointed this is the 3rd time the quality has not been great.  Please Nikas get your act together. 3
It's no Yue-Wah, but it IS conveniently located on Madison's northeast side. Their selection is more strictly Asian than Y-W, but decent, ranging from baby bok choy and fresh meats to fish and frozen crickets. And gigantic water beetles. I'm not kidding. Their produce section is good, and they seem to consistently stock Thai basil, an ingredient that I use frequently and sometimes have had trouble finding. I would not say that the staff are especially friendly, but it could just be a language barrier thing. So. Long story short: Hmoob fits the bill in a pinch. 3
Came on a recommendation from a friend. We had the chilli chicken dry, the chilli shrimp dry, the Manchurian mix fried rice and the chicken pakoras. My favourite dish was the Manchurian Mixed Fried Rice - it was just the right level of spice - it's definitely got some kick to it so if you aren't a big spicy food eater you might want to ask them to tone it down. Portion size was huge! We had enough for lunch and dinner the next day. Underwhelming was the chicken pakoras - they were not that great compared to others we have had from at other Hakka places. They were also quite pricy for what you were getting. They also came last which was a bit odd since usually they come as appetizers. We were halfway through our meal when they arrived and only had one each since our plates were full. I know people rave about the prices at this place but it was only reasonable - not a super great deal. Our go to Hakka place is about 20 dollars cheaper and it's good food too! I would still come again though 4
I think the product is good maybe not the best  but for the money it's very good. The website is very good for downloads for new and even really old products. If you ever have to deal with customer service live, they are the worst. Save yourself grief and use the website and do not call the company, they are really really bad when trying to deal live 3
Realistically, 2.5 stars...If you just need your standard shirts and slacks (no premium fabrics) cleaned quickly and cheaply, this is your place.  My husband has had several of these types of items cleaned here with no problem.However, if you're looking to get something more delicate cleaned, I wouldn't recommend this place.  I wanted to get a couple of dresses cleaned, but one has a little bit of beadwork and one is strapless and has that rubbery/plastic lining on the inside.  In both cases, the attendant said that I would need to sign off on a no-liability clause in the event that the beads broke off or the rubber/plastic melted.  Ummm... huh?  I've never had to do that to get these particular dresses cleaned at other cleaners.  No thanks!  I'm not taking any chances.  I'll go elsewhere to get them done properly and with no damage. 3
I am sad to report that this place has really gone downhill over the last few years.  I used to enjoy going there, and the food was completely acceptable.  I'm not sure if it is new ownership, or if they are short on money, but the food lately has been awful.  The egg and shrimp rolls are the only thing which is edible.  I had the curry chicken today.  It consisted of 99% onions and then some chunks of a white, watery, tasteless substance which was supposed to be the chicken.  Absolutely terrible.  I ate a few bites and gave up.  My wife had chicken with Chinese vegetables.  It was basically the same, 99% celery and then this mystery chicken.  My son had sweet and sour chicken, and he didn't finish his meal, which is very telling.  He said the chicken tasted funny and the breading as weird.  All in all, it was a waste of 19 dollars.  We just had some sandwiches to fill us up and the food went in the disposal.  Oh, did I mention that the fortune cookies were stale? 1
I stumbled upon this place with my brother and his fiancee after a lengthy time at a studio without dinner. My stomach was ready for some action. And like any other Canadian, I love me some poutine. I'm not from Quebec but I've had poutine in Montreal. And as such, I consider myself to be quite the expert on poutine. Alright, not really but I'm not just reviewing this based on a comparison between Smoke's Poutinerie. We walked in welcomed by blasting music. It was almost like I was a captive terrorist in for questioning. Anyway, I ordered. It took several times for the person to hear my order. I almost took out paper and a black marker (or went postal on their sound system). Nonetheless, the order was taken and I was that much closer to "The Works". I get weak in the knees for any menu item that has bacon.Sat down on one of their tree stumps (I love the look of the place). But I was slightly underwhelmed. The cheese was, as all the cheese curd aficionados say, "squeaky".  Fries were great. The bacon was... bacon (in other words: perfection. I mean, if a place messes up something like bacon I think they should seriously rethink living). The gravy is what made this poutine sub-par for me. Well, maybe "sub-par" is pushing it, but it certainly isn't fantastic. I've had better poutine gravy at Toronto Pearson International Airport. Please don't hit me. Anyway, bottom line: it was good. Not fantastic, but I'd go there again. 3
Stopped in for the lunch buffet the other day on account of the reviews here and their convenient location. Their pizzas weren't bad, but it wasn't good either. First, there wasn't much of a selection. Pepperoni, cheese, and some sort of ham and bacon. Second, the pizzas weren't hot.. just luke warm sitting on the little buffet hutch without a heating lamp. Pasta was lackluster (a light angel hair with chicken+olive oil and a rigatoni/penne-type noodle in marinara)- sitting in a heating tray and noodles seem to have gotten soft over time. They had some hoagie sandwich item which I didn't try as it seemed mostly bread and a tomato brushetta item which was ok- but again, not hot. Salad lettuce was fresh, but julienned carrots were completely dried out. The dessert was a fried dough with some powdered sugar on it or powdered sugar and chocolate syrup... this was pleasant as it just came out. Perhaps ordering off the menu would be better, but I wasn't willing to spend more than $10 on lunch. 2
2.5 StarsMaybe it was becuz I order take out? but not after reading similar reviewsThe sushi I order was okay, except "the I love sushi roll", it was chopped of tomatoes and salmon chunks mixed in sum tangy sauce, not glazed over the sushi, but more like dumped on.  Visually not pleasing.Rice with Beef Teriyaki was super dry. Same as the salmon teriyaki I got for my mother.  My brother order the Spicy Salmon Bowl, which was the same concept as "i love sushi roll" but the stuff was dumped over your lettuce. I eat a lot of sushi, I don't think this place will make it in my rotation. 2
Went last night around 6 for he first time.  Had a good cocktail.  Food was OK; service was terrible.  Jess never said boo to us, just put the menus down, took our order, and walked away.  Never smiled once. We split the cranberry & blue cheese salad and fish & chips; both were good and ample for both us; therefore, good value for money.  However, we were disappointed at how slim and uninteresting the menu was.  Shopping at Bass Pro Outdoor World made it a fun evening. 3
I've heard so many good things about this place I decided to check it out! I had a fun night out planned and scheduled an appt 1.5hrs before I was meeting up with my friends. What an amazing idea!!!! Never will I ever do my own hair again! Walked in with my makeup and outfit on and walked out with great hair! This place is seriously icing on the cake to complete your look! My stylist nailed the style I was looking for, everyone was super friendly as well.Side note.... I was really looking forward to an adult beverage while getting styled but was never offered anything?? Maybe I misunderstood other reviews on that?? Would have been a nice touch on my overall experience!I will definitely be back!!! 4
Nana is amazing! She will recreate whatever nail idea you have! :) I highly recommend her awesome skills! 5
We came here during spring break, so it was crowded and we waited about 1/2 an hour. We got seated and our orders were promptly taken. The staff is super nice! They were smiley and friendly. But our food was just okay.My dad ordered a dish that was supposed to come with peppers and onions and a bunch of stuff (maybe a burrito or something, I can't remember). What he got was fine, but later that night he realized it definitely didn't include all that the menu had described. I had a "special order", I asked for just tortillas on the side, and chicken and onions. When I got my food I had tomatoes mixed in with my chicken and onions... it wasn't a big deal, they were small pieces, but still... I thought it would be easy since I'd specified. Besides that though, my food was lukewarm and the foil-wrapped tortillas weren't even hot. My mom's food just didn't show up at first. Apparently they had some issue in the kitchen or something... the waitress acted quickly and the food came a few minutes later, so the issue was resolved. The best part of the meal, in my opinion, was the warm tortilla chips they serve. Chips and salsa, yum yum! Overall though, the food was okay, some of it was warm, some of it wasn't... nothing special about it though. Just a good dinner. Average. 3
Nice clean place with outside seating, strong selection overall. A perfect lunchtime spot. A bit pricey but that's to be expected. Will be back. 4
This nightclub has a great view, but that is all. If you're a guy, expect to pay $30 just to take the elevator trip to the top. And I thought gender-based pricing was illegal in America. I didn't have to pay, as it was a free-night and staying at the hotel, and thank God for that. I went around midnight, and many were already wasted on $20 drinks. The dancing was lame, at best. it was exceedingly crampt outside with drunk zombies walking or dancing around. Too many old guys lurking in the corners.Not my type crowd at all. Was gone in under 20mins. Was a horrible waste of time. 2
Best drugstore around. You don't have to wait long at all for your medicine ..the pharmacists are very helpful and will answer any questions you may have. You know you can count on them if you need medicine. 5
Lunch review...  i work near here so we occasionally eat lunches here.  The food is better than average compared to all the other itallian dives around here, but yhe service is pretty slow.  I've had their italian hogie and it's good, there are better salads around (johnny's wife's place too, D's best sandwiches), their pizza is average, and their pasta seems to be hit or miss depending on the day. In total I've been here 16 times and only once for dinner. 3
This place really sucks.  It is a necessary evil because it is the only place in town but it is a horrible business.  They won't accept phone calls so they can't give any information except over the web.  These guys needs some competition. 1
The only pizza place we order from in the south of Calgary! Sure delivery takes an hour in peak time but we only order on weekends so we expect it and plan for it. Busy is a good sign that they serve good food! Drivers are always polite, the food is great and exactly what you order is exactly what shows up. Oh yeah, and they don't skimp on FRESH toppings. Keep up the good work. 5
I've been going to see Sergio to get my hair cut for almost three years. My girlfriend took me to see him cut her hair when he was still at Coupe Bizarre, and since then, I can't imagine having anyone else giving me a cut. I have short hair, and I always get complements on my cut. Along with the rest of his regular clientele, I followed him to Parlour when the salon opened over a year ago. Sergio is absolutely amazing at figuring out just the kind of style that works well on my face, suites my look, and is easy for me to maintain daily. Before Sergio, I never used to arrive for a cut feeling confident that I would look absolutely fabulous afterwards. Sergio is relaxed and friendly, and wears probably the hippest mustache in the city. In addition to the usual student discount, I also didn't have to pay taxes on my latest visit on September 18th! 5
Best vegan or vegetarian food in this area hands down! The brunch is amazing, the quinoa fries are insane!!!! Most options are healthy, lots if gluten or dairy free meals, including dessert. The juice is also amazing. Everything is fairly expensive, but you get what you pay for. It's crowded in here and not kid friendly, so make a reservation. A quick cheaper option is the sandwiches they have in a cooler for lunches. 4
pork belly appetizer delish.steak tacos, delish.bread pudding delish. waitress a sweetie.whole experience the best. 5
I really like Tapacubo. It has a nice atmosphere with a large bar in the middle, comfortable booths around the walls, a nice patio on one side and pool on the other (part of the attached Graduate Tempe hotel). I have been twice now and had the guacamole and chips both times. The guac is delicious and they give an ample amount. The chips are fine, not great but who cares since the guacamole is so good. The chicken street tacos are amazingly good. In fact, they would be perfect were it not for the very average corn tortillas that seem like you could buy in a grocery store. There is a small yet decent beer selection, thankfully not just a bunch of Mexican beers. When you get a beer on tap, they are served in plastic cups - kind of weird but priced pretty well so who cares. If you don't want tacos, tortas or a few appetizer-like shared plates, this is not the place for you. The menu is quite limited, but that means the food they do offer is done well in this case. I'd recommend it - much better and unique than most hotel restaurants. 4
I will never return back to this place again. Horrible customer service and bad attitude. Walked in with the kids and was not greeted with a pleasant welcoming but instead a glaring moody look from one of the stylist standing by the register( made me want to hurry and run out the door which is what I should've done). Told the guy I think his name is John that I wanted to get my son a haircut he ask me if I have anyone in particular I said no. He turned to the blond lady standing next to him the one who looked moody and uninterested that we were there to cut his hair. She seems like she didn't want to do it and was not friendly at all, especially with the kids.  I then ask if she could cut my nephew's hair too, she said no and asked someone else to cut his hair. I asked the guy and he seem uninterested to cut my nephew hair too but at least he attempted to be friendly with him. I don't understand how people who work in a place like that could be so cold and unappreciative for any businesses that I seek, but I guess your establishment can afford to be picky. I asked my son how he like his haircut, he said it was fine but the lady was rough on him and that he was scared to go back. I told him he doesn't have to worry about being scared bc we will never go back there again. 1
Took clients and their wives for dinner.  The experience was over the top.  The service the minute we sat down to the very end was exceptional.  The food was outstanding and the portions were very good.  Everyone at the table had a great time.  We definitely plan on going back......if you want to make a positive impression on someone special in your life......bring them here. 4
Great service and the honey sweet toast is fantastic for our weekly sweet tooth cravings! Definitely a regular with the wifey and puppy 5
HATED HATED HATED it. Won't go back and here's why. TINY menu and 1/4 of that was breakfast. Some of our menus had TO GO stamped on them, not a big deal but wtf? There is a chicken in the logo but only one chicken item. Appetizers - needed the waiter to explain what they were. Only one vegetarian dish on entire menu. We had a party of 10, 3 of us ordered tacos, they were all served together even though we were at opposite ends of the table. It feels like this restaurant is just an experiment and if it doesn't work they'll replace it again. If you are going to do something, commit to it. Out of a party of 10 the BEST comment was the burger was good (followed by a shrug of the shoulders.)I sent the owner an e-mail letting him know about my experience. Got a snotty response saying things like "We serve it one way and one way only"BTW let's be very clear...the Clarendon and the restaurant are separately owned and different experiences. 1
Solid poutine, and the classic et cetera tasters is good for those looking to try different beers without having to commit to a full pint! 4
Order a Bacardi and coke...... Except don't expect to get Bacardi rum in your drink. You ask for high level liquor and they give u well liquor 1
In my last review I was not thrilled with the service. I guess someone noticed. We've been back several times in the last couple of months and now the service is very good. We have also tried several more of their food creations and they are all delicious and nicely presented. They have a special summer menu offering some terrific salads and beverages. Also, their filtered coffee is some of the best in the city, served with a small biscuit drizzled with chocolate on the side! 5
I love this place! I've never been to a TJ's before and was so impressed with the customer service, quality food, and great prices. Favorites from here are jalepeno hummus, carne asada, wine selection, and fresh produce. 5
Not sure why all the bad reviews are on here. Me and my wife went and had a great time. Got to the hotel at 1:00 and our room was ready. The lady who helped us was extremely helpful. The location and amenities were great. We relaxed by the pool and had a pleasant experience there too. The reason for four instead of five stars was the rude lady at the spa area. She could have been nicer about the gym situation. Basically she questioned whether we were guest but showed our guest keys. She looked us up in the system and we were guest but she questioned our resort fee? Finally she called someone and said it was a glitch in their system and let us in....without an apology. Overall it was a fun experience and are planning our next trip back to Vegas already. 4
They have friendly staff and a great selection, but never order a fabric through them.  It will not come.  I ordered something 5 months ago, they never returned my phone calls, and I still haven't heard from them.  Poor customer service. 2
Mac and Cheese is super as were the chicken philly and sourdough onion rings! Will come back for sure. 4
Terrible experience. I found a couch that I loved and told the sales man that I needed to have it delivered by the next weekend, when I had people coming into town. He told me no problem, the longest it would take to get in was 10 days. He GUARANTEED that it would arrive in time. After 10 days I called, and was told by the person on the phone that it was delayed, and would take another 10 days. I told them I was promised to get it in 10 days and they said that was impossible, all of the time frames they provide are estimates. I told her that the sales man did in fact promise, but that meant nothing to her. I waited the next 10 days, and guess what, I had to call again and was again told that it would be another 10 days to 2 weeks. I asked to speak to a manager and was told that there was not one available. They said that one would call me back which of course didn't happen. 2 weeks later the couch finally arrived, but I will absolutely never give this company business again. They have no problem with lying to people to get their business. 1
Service was a bit slow to start. It seemed as though the servers didn't even realize there was a new table in the room. The manager ended up coming over to take our order after 15 minutes and then we finally had a waitress looking after us. Food was really good though and the steak was cooked perfectly! I would definitely go back to give it a second try. 4
TAKE NOTE! I have sat with my daughters to get their nails done and it's always been $25 per set plus $5 extra for a gel top coat. The one time I couldn't accompany them, they were charged $70 for the same service. I never thought after years of being a client, they would charge my daughters extra for the same service! Not just that but for some reason, 2 people worked on them. One for acrylic and another to paint. That was also a first. Were you charging them extra for having 2 manicurists? Shotty work this time around! Shameful. Just shameful! CUSTOMER BEWARE! After leaving a negative review, CT Nails have called TWICE to harass me! 1
Food and drinks are really good but the servers are terrible and take forever, they don't check on you to see how everything is and if you need anything. The bussers and food runners do all the work. I don't even understand why they have servers they do nothing. I would rather tip the bussers and food runners. 3
Excellent place with good food, fast service and plenty of screens to watch the game. Prices are affordable and the service was prompt and courteous. 5
Pretty solid burgers for late night snacks,but also killer breakfast.Eggs benny is the way to go.Lil' pricey but once you start eating you have zero f**** to give. 3
I will start off by saying I did enjoy the food here although we were only there for their happy hour special for $3 sliders.The service was good as well, our server was friendly and helpful.  We tried the lamb, duck, chicken and soft shell crab sliders.  The duck wasn't my favorite but still good.  The buns used for the sliders is heavy and gets gummy after the second or third one.  Our cocktails were pretty good as well, mine was wrapped in a brown paper bag, would never ever pay full price for it though.Ok so sounds better than 2 stars right?  I would've given this place 4 stars however here's two things that really annoyed me.1. They charge for tap water...tap water, are you serious? Of course we weren't informed of this until the bill came.  2. It's an open kitchen, nothing wrong with this, however I could see everything.  The cooks were playing with their phones in between preparing the food and NOT washing their hands after.  Unless the phones have been sanitized before their shifts which I'm assuming they weren't, this is super nasty to see.  Also another cook started having a sneezing fit in the kitchen, yes she sneezed into her arm, however blew her nose in the tight kitchen area and again didn't wash her hands. 2
DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME....... its an hour and a half you will never get back.I had free tickets, but I still wanted a refund....the best part of the show was the 10 minute looped video of actual old burlesque dancers a half hour before the show decided to start...the show:I saw this show last night and it has moved to planet hollywood... this is the worst show I have ever seen here in Las Vegas, and that isn't saying much.  Apparently when it was at Aria it was a fabulous show and from the pictures on the website it looks like there is about 20 cast members, however last night there was the "Star" who was some REALLY high chick named Daisy from Brett Michaels Rock of Love on VH1 who was too tweaked out to remember the words to the 3 songs she "sang"..she sounded like a cat getting stepped on..it was so horrible the crowd, all 20 of us, actually groaned when she kept coming out...it was embarrassing.  Planet Hollywood is definitely not going to gain any positive word of mouth with that trash as their "star"...There was a total of 5 cast members, a man dancer, 3 female dancers, the trash "star" and a wonderful singer.. so I don't understand the video on the planet hollywood website that shows like 20 cast members with fire dances, acrobats, large production numbers, and men dancers..so not true...it is totally false advertising... it is a CHEAP knock off of the movie Burlesque and none of the dancers even had a burlesque type body and just danced like glorified strippers, they were incredibly skinny and out of sync.. The 1 star I gave this show was for the young lady billed as "my singer""...she was on America's Got Talent...She is an AMAZING singer, just as good as Christina Aquilera,  and is totally wasting her talent and time on this crap show.the venue: the venue was disgustingly dirty, it even smelled funny.  Before the show starts you are herded into a holding area, they call it a bar, where the tiny drinks start at $15!!  Then you watch the previous show exit down the steeeeeeeep 4 flights of stairs just waiting for someone to kill themselves on them.  You MUST enter the theater by walking up these 4 dangerous flights of stairs (I never saw an elevator, that is illegal isn't it?) and there are no assigned seat numbers, you are just placed in a row crammed next to each other, and then waitress rudely instructed me I was not allowed to put my drink in the drink holder, that was built into the arm of the chair, because it may spill. (WHAT?!?!)...my show had a total of 3 rows of patrons, maybe 20 people and now I know why..and when i picked up my tiockets the person asked me for my email and phone number and when i got home, that person had signed me up for an account which sent spam emails...I am so, so, so embarrassed for planet hollywood, not good business practices guys 1
Boy this place has gone seriously downhill the past few years. Last time I took my car in for service (Apr-2017), I got it back and one thing was broken. And I was "missing" a personal item as well. Yes I try not to leave anything valuable in the car when I drop off for service. And this item wasn't valuable. But it was mine, and somehow grew legs and walked.Service people giving me the runaround since April about replacing the item that mysteriously broke. And for a ridiculously minor part no less. Wasted more of my time than it's worth and will fix it myself at this point.So it's So-long to Solon BMW for me. Too bad too, they used to be much better. 2
This was my first time eating from this establishment. I ordered Combo Fried Rice & Chinese Chicken Salad.  Below is the content of the email I sent them after partially consuming the Combo Fried Rice, the remainder of which went in the garbage. I don't know about the salad because I was not able to eat after the rice.   Initially, I thought anyone could have a bad day and that I would not post a review, but contact them by email to state my dissatisfaction and follow up with a phone call so they could discontinue serving that rank pork.  However, when I called the gentleman who took my call blamed me because I ordered it at 11:30, but was calling 2 hours later.  I explained to him that the food was not delivered until 12:30 (as stated 40- 55 min for delivery) so he could just stop it because we know that it did not go bad in 1 hr. or 2 hrs. for that matter.  He then went on to tell me how fresh the food was etc...  I explained that I was not calling to get anything from them, but just asking that they do not give that meat to anyone else.  The guy wanted to continue the debate and I expressed to him that I had initially decided not to post the review, but since he did not think it was necessary to do anything about the bad meat that I felt obligated to post the review.  So here you have it:    The pork in the Combo Fried Rice was old and should have been thrown away.  I am sick and tired of restaurants that chance getting people sick just to save a nickel or dime, especially in delivery orders that are not likely to be returned.  Guess what?  You save nothing if people are afraid to eat there.  Not that it matters to you, but now I have to try and make it through the remainder of my work day with a stomachache.  In the future I'll stick to Panda Express.  People say it is not authentic, but I prefer that to ptomaine or botulism.  Throw the old stuff away.  It is not worth someone getting sick 1
Now this is goood stufff it better then any I've had in a long time time.... Good for groups n itss 5starrrrrr 5
The orginal  waffles were pretty good but it can be busy and yiu have to wait in line on the weekends. I like with ice cream but try it quickly since the ice cream melts and make the waffles soggy. 3
Drive through took 30 min, no exaggeration. It's a Friday at 11:30, but it's still fast food. Gave me the wrong order, which isn't a big deal. Luckily I checked before pulling completely away form the window. They took the bag back and relaxed the incorrect items..it was still wrong lol. Everyone makes mistakes but on top of service being blah and the wait being so long..yeah..not a happy customer. 2
Had the $9.95 meal deal. Picked a main dish and two sides. Generous portions of everything was given. I had the Pork, grilled zucchini and potatoes. Everything was seasoned well, the prok was juicy and flavorful. It was enough for two whole meals. The sandwiches looked good and the pastries looked devine. Am determined to make it back there soon. Great place for lunch, and near a great historic neighborhood to go walking around when finished to make up for all the tasty goodness in your belly. 4
The food is hit and miss, but service was so sub par! Our server forgot to get us forks and knives after which he forgot to give us our plates. The worst offence was that he assumed we wanted well done steaks so as he rolls in our burnt steaks we tell him that we prefer it medium rare. Upon which he proceeds to tell us how its normal to get the medium. However he finally agrees to get us a medium rare steak, which turned out delightful. 2
I had tried to come here a few years back but they were closed - the hours of operation are quite short and obviously didn't pay attention to it.My girlfriends and I took a quick trip to Vegas all I can say about this place is WOW!  The food and the service were both fantastic!  We ordered soup to start.  Based on the waiter's recommendation, I had the Tom Kha Kai with prawns which was perfectly balanced sour and hot. I like heat, a lot.  The 6 was plenty hot.  For the main dishes, we ordered the Panang Curry, Pad Ped, and Seafood Drunken Noodles to share.  Oh.  My.  God.  Beautiful presentation, so incredibly flavorful, perfect texture, just the right amount of heat (4), absolutely delicious!  My girlfriends and I couldn't stop talking about how enjoyable the meal was.  I will definitely visit again on my next trip! 4
we came here for my mom's birthday, and i was not really impressed. the music was shitty and the food was not worth the price.  the flatbread was on the tasteless side, the pasta was too spicy.  there are so many places in charlotte where you can eat so much better for so much less. i think you're supposed to be paying for the atmosphere, but the dim lighting + cheesy 'modern' look just wasn't doing anything for me. although to be fair,  i guess i'm not exactly part of the target audience.sorry mez, you are trying too hard and you are not that cool.  definitely not as cool as some of your rude staff thinks it is. 2
I will start off by saying that I have been to social house more than once and my first visit was excellent and couldn't wait to bring everyone i knew... that was 3 years ago. My second trip was medium to great and my last experience this past Saturday was absolutely horrible. The front desk reservation person was completely off the wall and gave the puppy eyes as if that was going to make the 45 minute late seating after our reservation worth it. Furthermore, she said it would be 5 min, not 45.  the bartender tried to remedy the situation by feeding me alcohol. ONTO THE FOODThe waiter was a super nice guy, understands the business and knows how to deal with people and the feed, sit in Nate's section if you can, he gets it. The manager came by, I tried to explain my disappointment with the host, and he gave me the I'm on top of it, but i could give two bits of crap. The fake smile and talking about how great his restaurant was and how great rolls were .... if you are proud of something and want people to try it... bring them a sample.   cucumber salad was excellent, sushi was medium to okay... kobi salad was great....  curry lobster roll ... that roll keeps them in business in addition to the explosions by treasure island. Michael, the sake sommelier, was very smart and knew his sake... talk to him if you want sake . hamachi with the tempura jalapenos...seemed like a knockoff from nobu ..nonetheless it was tasty.. i ordered a half lobster, it came out TWO TIMES UNDERCOOKED....    so no more social house for me... the manager did nothing to want to keep me there... i feel bad because nate and michael the waiter and sommelier knew their stuff....  impression from management..... we are social house... wait for our half bad food.... reservations are a joke... and we can get leftover tourists who want sushisad .. first time i was dreaming of eating there... its felt like it was a completely different restaurant 1
First time a new place. Service was excellent. Five of us had different selections. All were great. Do not go by the negative reviews. 5
This place is very quaint with a cozy and intimate feel. Though I can't speak to the tastiness of the food, they have several interesting cocktail choices that the bartender will 'perform' for you. While the drinks are good, I felt it was a little over-priced for the quality. 3
We just saw Marmalade Skies play here last night.  We showed up early to grab one of the last tables. Fans of the band showed up in full-force. It was SRO early in their set. They sounded great ! The service, however, was below par. It seemed as if the place wasn't  prepared for the crowd that the band would bring in, even though the band played there about a month ago! We ended up waiting for the server to check on us more than once while we sat with water & drinks completely drained. If we hadn't been there specifically for the band, it's very likely we would have gone some where else. No condiments brought out for the sliders. No small plates brought out with the nachos deluxe which were nothing special. The sides of ranch we ordered didn't arrive either. The fries that came with the Real Deal Philly Rib Eye were soggy. Their Wings are the reason for 3 stars. I had the Honey Hot  wings grilled and they were DELICIOUS! 3
Fun place to be...esp.during spring training time. If you're into getting autographs it's easy here during spring training. I'm not even that into sports but I'm originally from Ohio and my friend (ohio friend) comes here esp.for spring training (she loves the Cleveland Indians who train here along with the Cincinatti Reds).  The amount of signatures and pics of players we've gotten over the years is amazing.  The games are fun to watch...I just chill and drink a margarita. The whole ball park is so family friendly. They do events. My family enjoys the halloween event. 5
Ordered for delivery to work today with a group of folks. I can't speak on the topic of their pizzas, but as for my portion of the order...First, the price quoted for a personal pizza over the phone was higher than stated on the menu on the website. As well, my portion of the order was charged a separate delivery charge from the main order - though it was all delivered together. Second, the garlic bread was burnt, tough, and gross. Even if you were willing to handle the texture and crumbling bread, you could taste burnt garlic, not just burnt bread. We threw it away. Third, the personal pan pizza (cheese with pineapple). I've had better pizza at various fastfood chains that don't claim to be "authentic Chicago pizza". The sauce especially - yuck. As stated in other reviews, extremely greasy and messy. If you want good pizza in Madison, go to Ian's. 1
I've get lunch here on a regular basis...so why do I keep going back if I only gave 3 stars? The pizza!! There pizza is one of the best I've had, good toppings, thick chewy crust that is amazing. However, I've tried a few other things from their lunch line but the quality and flavor just isn't there. If you go for lunch, get the pizza! 3
The following is a cautionary tale about the PRICE OF CONVENIENCE:I've taken my car here 3 or 4 times, due to fact that they're within walking distance of my apartment. I wish now that I had gone to another place a bit farther off and waited or taken the bus back. Here are some things I noticed:1) They're "those kind" of mechanics who offer services you don't need. I'm not just talking about those kind of mechanics who offer obviously unneeded rack and pinion jobs. After the first visit, they said one of the things I needed was a new air filter. Since this is such an easy DIY thing, I declined it and went and bought an air filter. When I went to change the filter, I discovered the one in the car was white as a ghost and completely see-through. On subsequent visits, they have also recommended this.2) They don't adhere to their own policy of not working on your car without approval from you. On what will be my last visit, I was told that a single tire change (yeah, I know it's dumb to get one tire but my guy became flat and I'm po' okay?!) would cost around $80. Maybe it was dumb to think that meant the total with labor, but ON PAPER I authorized up to a $90 expense, with anything further having to be approved by me, first. This was not done. They put on the tire and then told me it was going to be $117. As for the tire ordeal, there was more insult to the injury; I took the car in on Friday afternoon. Of course I knew I wouldn't be able to have it serviced that day, but left it there and was assured that it would be dealt with first thing. I told them I had to work the next morning as close to 7 as possible, and they said they'd get the tire ordered and put on as quickly as they could. I know it was a Saturday, but the car wasn't ready till about 1. That means it took them almost 6 hours to have somebody drive and get a tire and put it on. Like I said, I know it was a Saturday, but is it really that hard to order a tire from their supplier and have someone go pick it up? Did they even attempt to order the tire on the Friday afternoon? Who knows? 3) Also on my last visit, my ignition key inexplicably got stuck in the trunk when I was showing the tech my busted tire. He said not to worry about it, that they would get it out. Well, their method of doing that was to break it off in the trunk. Probably an honest accident and maybe I have a trunk-opening latch in the car, but they didn't even offer me a measly 2 bucks off to make a copy of the key at a hardware store- just a kind of "yeah, eh, sorry."I guess all I can really say else is that I never felt completely comfortable around these guys. It just feels like one of those big-name shops where you know you're bending over and they're giving it to you good. I'll just recommend Mitch's Econo Lube down the street for those who live near PV, and Larry Harker's Auto Repair for those in the West. 2
Just OK. Definitely not Ramen. Noodles are fresh but nothing that makes this place outstanding in Chinatown. 3
Waited over an hour while car after car was completed before mine. Kept opening another lane and more cars were let in front of me. Manager did nothing to help, actually seemed they purposely took even longer after complaining. Avoid at all costs, they really don't give a rip. 1
This place is over priced and constantly crowded with rowdy college kids trying to get OMG SO DRUNK!!! during happy  hour.  The drink specials are okay, but I personally don't think they are that good.  The "big azz" margaritas aren't spectacular or really even that big - an average margarita is probably about 12-16oz, depending on the place.  I don't want to pay $10 for shitty tequila? The food is average and over priced.  Their burritos are so doughy and lack the taste you can get from even Chipotle. From all of the big  burrito restaurants, this one needs the most work.  The decor is clever but tacky.  The servers at EVERY Mad Mex I've ever been to are rude and are just trying to get some tips out of you (which is fair, I wait tables and do the same but you can still be nice to your tables if they juts want drinks?).  The drinks are meh and the food is blah. Comparing this place to Kaya puts it all in perspective - but Big Burrito probably won't change anything since it brings int he college kids spending their parents money. 2
I Really like this place because it's small, usually not too busy other than occasional weekends and it's so refreshing to have a small farm in the middle of the city. Well worth visiting. Across the street is the necropolis cemetery which is also an arboretum and very pleasant to walk around and look at the old gravestones. We saw a fox walking around on one occasion! 5
Yay! I'm glad I finally made it here.  I have been Facebook friends for a while, I really want to take comedy classes or join the improv group or both.  I was there last night. A three star rating is "a-ok" and that's ok. There is plenty of room for improvement, and I'm sure we'll get there eventually.  I remember when this joint was Anderson's 5th Estate! I only realized it was the same location when I parked. This information has nothing to do with review.  I just thought I'd throw some stupid detail in.  It was, actually, kinda cool because I knew where the restrooms were and the layout of the place hasn't changed much - so my anxious self knows where all the fire exits are.I liked the guy who greeted the incoming crowd. Very friendly and just straight up cool. The bar area was so crowded, I would've shut it down if I was a fire Marshall.  But this was all pre-show. We were free to loiter on the patio, roam the parking lot etc. no problem. I need elbow room and I will find it!!  The seating system made sense.  (I went to the 9:30 Lynne Koplitz show, btw, management)  I liked that.My poor little waitress should've had a little back up!  See, I'm not going to bitch about having to wait while she attended the party of 12+ seated next to me. She was overwhelmed and probably over worked. I just had the feeling that the club owners haven't exactly nailed down this detail yet.  What I would have done was assign one person to handle the large party, and another to take care of the overflow in her particular section.  I understand the purpose of a 2 item minimum, but really, by the time my server acknowledged me, I was going to contest it.  I am not that bitchy, but I was about to bitch off.  Yeah. That part could use a lil work.  The show was great. I will go again! I like the acts that they sign. It's a legit comedy scene. Great calendar, and I love open mic. So I will attend again, and I'm sure my rating will improve. The 3 star is my first impression. Xoxo 3
So I do check Yelp from time to time, and I made an account today for this place. Just wanted to respond to people saying the ice cream was fake/didn't melt/tasted like "whip" cream.. I had it today, enjoyed it, and yes it did melt and it is only February folks. Saw it was family owned, and the workers there were super nice and very friendly with my daughter, so I just wanted to throw a positive review to counteract the weirdly negative ones.Ice cream was good. There was nothing weird about it. Employees were great. Didn't try the food but I had the Old Fashioned Cherry Amaretto, daughter had a dipped cone, and wife had Butter Pecan (all for about $7). The place is not new (in fact, I remembered having been there when it was a DQ as a kid.. 20 years ago. The windows curve over the last row of tables and it jogged my memory), so I do think a little effort into the atmosphere could help. The best Ice Cream I have ever had was Greater's in KY, so no it wasn't that. But this place is a solid ice cream parlor to take the family. 4
At first it was a rocky go but once all the kinks worked out we LOVE the community! The property is nice. The apartments are spacious and luxury. The staff is friendly. The amminities are what we wanted. We couldn't ask for more. The maintance crew is awesome. The parking is a serious problem. They need to designate bike parking. There is also no parking for visitors and ppl who don't live her park in others spaces. I'm really upset that there are a very tenants that continue to park in the handicap parking or where ever they please and the office doesn't do anything. Been trying to get a garage and the staff still hasn't got back to us after months! 3
Great food and people running it.  I highly recommend the vermicelli bowls as they are like nothing I've found elsewhere. Unfortunately I've moved from the area but whenever I'm back I always try to stop back.  Again: get a Vermicelli bowl. 5
I really want to give a higher rating because the food is great, but I've had my Just Eat delivery order cancelled by them twice. It really sucks when you're starving and stuck at work and you find out the burrito you ordered isn't coming. Yesterday I was willing to pay over $18 (including delivery fee, HST, and tip) just for one burrito. I was that desperate for a meal at work that wasn't pizza. But alas, no burrito for me. Why be on Just Eat at all if you're just going to cancel the orders? 3
I've been to the Location on the strip at the former Imperial Palace now called the Linq, and was excited that new location opened up around my area. The food was amazing as per usual, BUT The service was terrible! It looked like they only had one server covering six tables which is tough and I get it but you gotta keep your cool. The waitress comes up to us and asks us if we are ready to order and we we told her no since we were waiting for our third person to show up and she yells THANK GOD, and walks away to oversee her other tables. I'm like I get you're all by yourself and busy but lady keep your feelings to yourself and check it at the door. The entire experience was annoying she later on rushed us to get our orders and our third person showed up and was rushing her to get her order. To the point she drops off our food and not even 10 minutes later she drops off the check! We open to check out our total and put the check book down to continue eating, it felt like a minute later she comes to our table and opens our checkbook to see if we put our form of payment like I'm like excuse me ? And she just walks away. In the end I love the food which is why I'm giving this place 3 stars, but management really needs to evaluate how their servers act and retrain them on how to offer customer service. 3
I just saw this deal on Deal Chicken and so I thought I would post my review so no one would buy this.  I find it hard to believe that the people from Deal Chicken wouldn't look at these reviews and see that there are over a dozen  reviews for this company at this point and all of them are 1 star.  Why in the world would Deal Chicken do business with these people.Anyway, when I saw this on Living Social it was the same day my wife went out of town.  I thought it would be nice if I got the house professionally cleaned while she was gone.  I called and immediately got someone (this was a Thursday).  I told the person that I need to know if they had anything available from that Thursday through the next Tuesday.  She told me they could get me in Tuesday at 2 pm.  I told her that would be great and that I would then buy the deal.  I asked her if she needed anything from me and she told me to give her the code so I gave her the voucher number and she marked it as redeemed.  When Tuesday morning came around I hadn't heard from them to confirm so I called and left a message to verify they were still coming.  They never called and they never showed.  By Thursday I had never heard anything (I had left one more message) but that was the last day to get my money back from Living Social so I called for my refund.  They said that because it had been marked as redeemed they couldn't do it.  I told the lady that they never showed and she said they had to get a hold of Maid by Design.  They emailed me every other day during that time letting me know they were still trying to get a hold of Maid by Design.  All during this time the deal was still available.  It seems crazy that they would even be offering a deal when they aren't even able to get a hold of the business.  Anyway, a week later they finally gave me my money back.  What a terrible experience! 1
Average food, especially for the higher prices. View was really nice, though. Wouldn't recommend to someone looking to eat on My. Washington though. 3
I know, I know a review for Subway, come on.  But I have to say that the service at this subway is top notch.  The staff is very friendly and always goes out of there way to say hello.  It is highly appreciated.  The food is pretty standard Subway fare.  Not too much to say there, but I will be be back again on my lunch breaks. 4
Came in at 9am place seemed ok, pedcure price was good $20.  Picked out my nail color...as I headed to the back I started to notice that the place was FILTHY!! Walked by a waxing room that looked like someone slept in it, goldfish crackers, computer on bed, messy blankets & pillow.  Went into the restroom and found dirty dishes from food in the only sink!!  I couldn't even wash my hands!  Thoughts of my toes swelling up with infection ran thru my mind.  Needless to say I left quickly!!  Gross place!  Wish I could give it negative stars! 1
I like the Herb Box but I don't find myself dying to go back. Their food is good, but the service isn't as friendly as their small space and atmosphere suggests. Their brunch is a definite highlight, besides the decor and cool location. 3
This is a true bar/grill and we liked it.  The zucchini appetizer and the fried dills were fabulous to start with.  I had the veggie wrap and it was really great also, fresh and tasty.  They have a lot of choices on burgers and sandwiches, which all seemed popular as we saw multiple different sandwiches being served adjacent to us.  Prices were average to slightly on the high side, but the food was good, service fast and friendly.  The 20 ounce very cold beers during happy hour really can't be beat!   It is supposed to be a sports bar, but it really does not have that feel, not many tvs, or loud groups. Great place, will be back. 4
I am NOT a restaurant snob.  In general I think Buca is great, with decent food, big portions, and a fun atmosphere to hang out with friends.But the service at this particular location was pretty bad.  We stopped by to get lunch before a Pirates game, but the place was packed and the line was really long.  We tried again for dinner after the game, and again the wait was very long.  We only got a table right away by being one of the few groups willing to sit on the patio after a very hot day out in the sun.Our pitcher of sangria came pretty quickly, but we had to spend a good ten minutes staring at it longingly before we got any glasses we could use to actually drink it.  We never got any bread, which I'm pretty sure they automatically serve to every table, right?  None of our drinks were ever refilled (not even the water, which sort of sucked; see above about spending the previous 4 hours in bleacher seats in direct sun).  Our food came after a pretty long wait, and was typical Buca food- tasty by my standards, anyway!  We ordered dessert, but our brownie sundae had no brownies.  That was a pretty big letdown, let me tell you.Mostly I felt bad for the servers.  It's not like they were just standing around while we waited for food, they were constantly running back and forth and looked really stressed.  There was a big group at the table next to us (a bachelorette party, I think) and they didn't get several of their dishes until well after everyone else at their table had finished eating.  Understandably they sent them back.  Between running to serve all of her tables and trying to apologize to this angry group about a problem that wasn't even her fault, their poor waitress was in tears by the time we left.From my experience and other reviews, it seems like they are chronically understaffed.  It is a very busy location in a very popular area, and it sounds like the management has not gotten that memo.  The end result is that the customers end up entertaining themselves while they wait for their food by chatting with the other tables about how bad the service is.  That WAS at least entertaining, but not exactly the reason I stopped by. 2
Eh, what can I say? I had the pesto chicken fettuccine and my company had gotten the lasagna. I did not get to try the lasagna because it had sausage in it and I don't eat pork. They said that they would give it 2 stars. However for my dish I would give the same, it was pretty bland. They had no salt and pepper at the table so I couldn't have fixed it. I took it to-go to fix it later. I also got the cannoli, I've had better. They added like cinnamon to their cream, not like what I'm used to in Little Italy in Boston, MA. 3
We just checked in and out of the Camelback Inn. We have stayed at this hotel in the past and have loved it. What an awful experience we have just had. When we checked in, they gave us a room that wasn't what we expected. It could not accommodate our family of five. They put us in another room, but it was not yet ready. We waited over three hours for them to clean the room. When we finally went in, we couldn't breathe because of the overwhelming smell of Lysol. Nauseating! The rooms in this hotel are bad. They are very gloomy, dirty and need renovating. The prices they charge are outrageous for what you get. My kids were so happy when we pulled up to the Scottsdale Princess and walked into a clean casita with a fireplace for $200 less than the stinky old room we had just left at the Camelbak Inn.  Time really does stand still there. We will never go back! 1
I love this place! Whenever I can convince someone to get up early and eat some awesome biscuits and gravy, it is the best day ever! Seriously, I recommend the biscuits and gravy... plus the atmosphere is pretty neat. Kinda reminds me of a Grandma who hordes country decor lol.... they have great food though. 5
Honestly was expecting so much more for an Asian place. I ordered noodles and my meal came with both rice and noodles... I don't like rice so there's that. On top of that, noodles were barely flavored and tasted just like regular noodles you'd use to make spaghetti. I was very disappointed. Overpriced too. $8+. Not worth it. 1
Our server was on top of it, the food was good, and I liked the old timey ambiance of 40's music and black and white movies.  However, we waited an hour for our food with a 9 month pregnant woman and a toddler in our group and battled fruit flies from start to finish.  This would have been 5 stars without the wait and the flies. 3
We came here for my mom's 80th bday  It was our first time there. Reservations were made for 10 and we were seated promptly at 7pm on a sunday night. The restaurant was somewhat quiet but we weren't complaining since most restaurants are usually too noisy.We ordered a lot of food. Everyone ordered a plate for themselves and also lots of rolls and sashimi to share. The rolls were amazing and also hugh. One of our guests has never eaten sashimi before and she loved it ( she couldn't believe raw fish can taste so good and not fishy at all). The price was not the cheap but the food and service were very good. Our 20 something kids enjoyed it so much that they went back there a week after for more and introduced a friend to this place.We will definitely come back. 5
very expensive for what you get. Dont expect to cook much. You will do part of part of the meal. pros- marni's plant-based meals are definitely healthy, whole food based and tastycons- you will hardly cook in these cooking classes. In the daylong classes you will not cook more than in the evening ones. if the price wasnt high enough she also has people come in and push their merchandise during your paid for time. sometimes they give a small sample, sometimes not even a discount. In addition when she gets off cooking into " food guru" mode she is not reliable at all. She seems to go off into " magical thinking" without any back up data. For example she says eggs are bad for you but somehow good if you eat the white and yolk separately. ( no explanation for this odd bit of advice)  In her book there is disinformation that is dangerous. She says that it is not necessary to take vit D in Canada, which is wrong if you look at all the hard data, She then says if your doctor insists then  take 400 IU daily , which is far too little to prevent osteoporosis or other conditions. Also there are 3 sinks in the kitchen but she wont let anyone wash their hands in any of them before or after handling food. Instead she sends you down two hallways to a little washroom which is not very clean. So enjoy the food but take the rest with a large grain of salt. She should spend more time letting people actually cook. 2
What is it about high-end restaurants these days-- they crank up the music so doggone loud that you cannot hear the person next to you talk, let alone hear yourself think!!!  I had looked forward to my meal here, but honestly, the very good food was overshadowed by the busy-ness of the restaurant and the too-loud rock music blasting away throughout the place.  Honestly-- I love music, I love rock music, and I enjoy ambiance with music-- but this was just insane.  Never again.  Where do you go these days to have a nice meal in peace and quiet, to have a little intimacy, to have just a conversation with the person next to you without shouting so much that you have a sore or froggy throat the next day? 2
I stayed at the Artisan for a conference and was excited by the photos online. The hotel is very eclectic with neat decor throughout. However, it is EXTREMELY dirty and unkempt. Dust was on the doors, walls, and lights. The lamps were old and hard to turn off. The bathroom was dirty. One of our attendees found a used condom and items left behind from previous visitors. There are no blankets just sheets. The staff was very polite but the hotel overall was a disappointment and unsanitary. 2
This place is really great if you've never eaten at an authentic taqueria.I should have walked out when the unenthused, high-school aged employee didn't know what pastor was and stated they didn't have any. Unfortunately for me, I referred him to the list of meats on the menu. The meat was pretty bland and not even texturally like you'd find in an authentic taqueria. The second sign that I should have just walked out was the price, $6.50 for two tacos. Taqueria tacos are supposed to be simple and cheap, $1.00-$2.50 /taco. The third sign was when the employee asked what kind of rice I wanted on my tacos.Taqueria tacos are traditionally served with only meat, onions, cilantro, and salsa. Despite these warnings, I went through with my purchase, and now I'm writing this review. So to make a long story short, if you want authentic taqueria style tacos, you'll have to look elsewhere. However, if you like subpar customer service with food to match, give this place a shot. 1
My favorite yogurt place. I like coming there on a warm day after a meal or just to grab something sweet and their variety is pretty great. If you are on a low fat diet, watching your sugar or none of that matters you will enjoy LULU's. 4
I love this place! I go here for breakfast 3 times a week and I'm never disappointed. Get their breakfast sandwhich with a latte to go ..yum!!! Cute family business with a friendly atmosphere. Even though they are always busy, their service is very fast.  I don't know about the review on 11/29 but the bagels are always fresh and out of the oven when i come. Their cream cheese is home made and delicious!! Definitely a 5 star restaurant. 5
We just keep coming back this cozy joint. Great food - love the quesadillas with pulled pork - and a good beer list. I love a restaurant that delivers consistently.I'd like to see some periodic menu change to give a little more selection on our return visits. If that happens it would be great to see a few smaller plates.Solid choice. 4
Until recently I thought I had found the best cheese curds in town--now that I've tried Tipsy Cow's, I know I have found them! Decent to above average beer selection and friendly staff make this a great place to check out on The Square. 4
Slowest drive thru in Charlotte. I've been here numerous times with the same results. The food is typically good if you have 15-20 minutes to get through the drive thru. 2
We are frequent visitors of the HT franchise. We were excited to try the new one here in Indian Trail. Sadly, this restaurant is not up to Hickory Tavern standards.  Restaurant is too small. Tables are on top of each other. There isn't a separation from bar to dining area. After waiting for 20 mins for a seat in the "dining room " we we jammed in up against the bar stools.  We were dining with a toddler, which can be challenging. After placing our order our waitress did not return. After waiting 45 minutes I did seek out a manager. Our food was brought out finally !  Portions seem smaller than a typical HT. Meal literally came with six fries. The server actually remarked that my burger was sadly lacking bleu cheese crumbles.   At this point with a screaming, tired, toddler we just wanted to leave. 2
ordered dry yellow noodles w/ BBQ pork and it turned out to be pretty good, just that the sauce was a bit on the salty side otherwise it would be perfect (came with a side of soup which was nice). noodles were perfectly cooked with a good amount of crunchiness and they also gave a handful of it so it really was worth the money!also decided to try the sour sop (some tropical fruit) milkshake and it was sooo good! the flavour of the fruit was a sweet/sour taste soo it was pretty interesting. they just needed to put less ice in it next time because i couldn't drink it through a straw and instead had to use a pho spoon to scoop it out of the cup haha. 3
Just okay. Fish and chips...fish was a big soggy.  Same as always happens for me: I ordered a beer (Guiness Blonde) from their very limited menu (to what I'm accustomed to at the Flying Saucer in Columbia, SC)...only to find that they were out of it.  Same thing happened in the TK Charlotte with regular Guiness.  Really?!?Nice, big TVs all over the place, but not a one in sight with the big CBS game-Georgia/Florida. Disappointing. Went back to my hotel room to watch football, instead. 3
Wow, that had to be one of the worst brunches I have ever had. My wife and I arrived shortly after they opened today and were seated at a 2 person table that was wobbly, you know the kind where you have to put a sugar packet underneath it? We proceeded to the food and at first was a little taken aback by how ordinary it was. No prime rib carving station, but instead a pre-carved pork loin slices. The "gourmet" meat station was just pepperoni (no other deli meats), single cheese cubes, and crackers. No omelet or egg stations... The grits were runny and cold. The scrambled eggs were either powered or carton eggs that were also cold. The assorted baked goods, were mainly little muffins that I swore were Lil Bites. The sausage links were shriveled. OMG, I'm not kidding, everything was cold.  I would question whether they are testing the food temperatures. Do yourself a favor and avoid this brunch, at $19 a person I expected a lot better and felt like I  was fleeced. I'll stick to the brunches at the Fish Market in Baxter Village or Waldhorn's Sunday brunch. 1
As someone who is debatably the most unathletic individual on the east side of Madison, I was thoroughly impressed with how much fun I had at Keva sports. They have a variety of courts, are a great place to check out if you are interested in joining some sort of sports league, and have beer specials almost everyday of the week. 5
It's an Europian coffee shop where u can sit outside and enjoy your drink.They make good machiato(my husband loves it),delicious and healthy smoothies.I love that ginger peach hot tea..We go there almost 3 times a week.But know that my hus is in vacation we will come often.We take his parents too,cause as Europian we like these kind of places.I forgot to mention it,you don't forget to try the gelato,especially the chocolate one... 5
We wanted to try a good crepe place in Arizona that was comparable to Crepevine in California, but I can't compare the two because the crepes here are totally different.Le chalet has a more french cafe atmosphere.  Service was a little slower pace compared to a chain restaurant, which was good.  We didn't feel rushed to quickly eat our food and get out.  We received a complimentary appetizer, which was very good.  We ordered a Croque Monsieur which could have been an entree for one of us that tasted a lot better than a regular ham and cheese sandwich.  The crepes had the right amount of cheese and meat none of which overwhelmed the whole crepe.  We ordered the Crepe Tatin which was a little heavy on the caramel, but still tasted good.  The apples were fresh, whipped cream was light, and the toasted almonds added a nice crunch. 4
Excellent food! The burgers are fresh and inventive. The beer offerings are substantial. The bartenders and wait staff and patient informative and generally up beat. 5
This place is great and has surprisingly great cookies, too. Big portions and good flavor. 5
I highly do no recommend this place. I am sure the doctor is great but the prices were out of control. I was quoted close to $500 for a new set of lenses on one pair of glasses. She made up some bogus remark that the mounting position made it more expensive. I went down the street to Las Vegas Optometry Care and paid $475 for the same lenses and a brand new pair of sunglasses with prescription. Erika definitely had a better selection but the price was ridiculous. 1
Bland bland bland! I was thoroughly unimpressed. Although the portions were huge, there was absolutely no flavor to the food- just bland chicken and cheese inside an overly fried shell. I will not be returning 2
I wasn't planning on posting a review for my visit to Heart Sushi cause I just wanted to chill out and not take pictures of every plate or pay close attention to everything. However, I'm posting entirely for the poor service we received from one particular waitress who waited on us during our entire visit. Extremely pushy and trying to get us to leave even though we were at least 45 minutes before closing time to prepare for dinner. Her attitude toward us was noticeable and unnecessary. When she brought our items out, she would place them on the table in front of her and slide them towards us. When it came time for dessert, we almost got thrown off of ordering anything because as we gave her our ice cream order, she would repeat them back in a rude tone and one of my friends asked for three scoops of mango ice cream and she said in a loud voice, "THREE?!?"  Finally, when she brought out our desserts she said something along the lines of, "that's everything you ordered, you don't have anything else on the iPad to order so you're all done."....lol I mean it was just rude. Sad to say I left very annoyed but what can ya do. Otherwise the food was fine, sushi quality was better than some but not as good as others so it was mediocre. 3
I'll give it a 3 of a 5 because they are always out of sizes and store is a mess , hard to find stuff, we love old navy but have to do most my shopping online to find stuff 3
The Salty Senorita is one of those places that's "not the worst, not the best." I've only eaten here when I've had family visiting, as the location is pretty convenient.This restaurant seems like it would be a lot better if they didn't have such a high volume of customers. I can never tell if they're going for piss drunk college kid-or fancy white pants Scottsdale. Maybe they're going for "I barfed up Jager on my $800 tuxedo." Who knows.Their menu is great, the concepts are great, but the execution is always sloppy, bland, and never quite hits the mark.And you can totally tell that they only hire based on looks because their staff is a joke. Literally some of the worst servers I've ever encountered. Like bloody hell get your act together people, this is your job not your spring break. 2
Brent has done work in my home on several occasions, and at my mother's home as well.  Brent is very professional, and friendly. He does exceptional work. 5
We ordered a carry out thin crust pizza which was ready on time and accurate.  The online ordering process is very efficient and great when you want to get a pizza quickly and take it home.  I like the thin crust and it was done correctly but they were very stingy on the ingredients.  The tomato sauce was not spread across the entire pizza making the outer pieces somewhat dry.  The amount of crumbled Italian sausage was minuscule and I could barely taste the onions or mushrooms.  They did get the half sausage and half anchovies correct and those were in appropriate amounts.  I like Domino's pizza but was disappointed in the overall taste. 2
Thanks to the brutal hangovers I experience several times a month, knowing where to get decent pho is absolutely critical.  It's the only thing that can ease my abused digestive and nervous systems into a state of complacency.  I did not get decent pho here.  In fact, it's the first pho I've ever eaten that made my hangover worse.  Maybe I just got a bad batch.  I don't know.  My bowl was awful.  The broth tasted of nothing but salt.  The subtle flavors of meat and spice that my body craved simply were not there.  I tried to enhance the flavor profile with the usual panel of hot sauces, to no avail.  The meat was alright, if a little tough.  The veggies were pitiful.  Half the leaves on the mint were grayish brown and wilted, and the bean sprouts were slimy.It all made for a bad brew.  I ate all the meat out of it, and that was about it.  I usually drink the broth like it's the elixir of life, but not this time.  I may as well have been sipping on hot brine.  I couldn't even eat the noodles, as they had been steeped in the brackish concoction.The pho left me excessively parched for hours, exacerbating my hangover, and did little to help my stomach ache.  I won't be back.  Which is a shame, because the bahn mi looked great.  At any rate, the food is cheap, and the service is lackadaisical, as is traditional for family-run Asian eateries.  I wouldn't go for the pho, but the bahn mi might be worth a try.One should note that they close somewhat early at 9pm. 1
Knocking off two stars right off the bat:minus 1 star for the cheesy Venetian gondola rides/gondoliers/canals, blue sky fresco (sprinkler heads and all), human statue, and other assorted eye-rolling faux Venetian touches. Sure, I know that's why it's called The Venetian and it's all part of the sugary syrup that draws the huddled masses to Vegas...it's just not for me...I tend to lean towards authenticity. minus 1 star for mall stores like Banana Republic, Kenneth Cole, Brookstone, and Ann Taylor. I'm surprised I didn't see a Spencer's Gifts selling black light posters of St. Marks. I guess The Bellagio nabbed all the good high-end designers (Gucci, Armani, Chanel, Hermes, etc). The 2 stars go to their choice of celeb chef restaurants - Batali's B&B and recently opened Enoteca San Marco (with truly impressive wine lists)...Keller's Bouchon (same killer steak frites, breads & pastries)...David Burke...Puck's Postrio...and um, Chef Buddha's TAO (like the one in NYC, tasty and forgettable). And the last star goes to Breathe, an oxygen bar that did wonders for my hangover. 3
The food is good here - but it's pricey.Service is good, but very leisurely, and the place is usually quiet and only moderately busy even at peak hours, so be prepared for a long relaxing meal as this is no place for a quick lunch (strange considering its proximity to the airport).As this used to be a pizza hut, I am very surprised how well they've managed to re-decorate the place and the overall visual ambiance is much better than a lot of sushi places I've been to. That being said, for some reason they usually decide to play annoying pop music from the radio (which means there are commercials all the time) at a volume that is too high, which definitely kills the mood.Also, the menu is a little on the pricey side and does not compete with downtown/Brampton prices. Because of this, it's hard to choose lots of different things without spending too much, and there aren't many good combos that have a bit of everything, which makes this place not so good for a first time sushi-goer.The food is actually really great. I can't vouch too much for the Korean side of things, but all of the Japanese dishes are top quality, and the sushi chef is extremely traditional with presentation (even when you get take-out). However, the staff were unwilling to make a simple substitution usually common in downtown sushi places, even though I offered to pay for this substitution. (I wanted yam tempura roll instead of California).In conclusion, this place is definitely not worth going out of your way for, but it's one of the only sushi places in the area and definitely is not the worst I've been to. For take-out, I'd definitely recommend Sushi-Ya across the street instead as they are faster and better quality, but if you want to sit down and have a meal (or care for some Korean food) Sushi Dragon is better. 3
Two of us went here at 9:30 pm on a Saturday night and it was really busy. We had the pork belly and the burger. The burger was delicious. At 11 pm, the main floor dining area shuts down and there's a party in the basement. We didn't stay for that, but there were a lot of people waiting prior to 11 to go to the party downstairs. Was a fun place with good ambiance - good for groups of 4 to 6 people. Most of the plates are meant for sharing. 4
The #22 Dinner Combo (String Bean in Black Bean Sauce w/ Shrimp) was the best black bean sauce I've had since leaving NY. Now, if they only had Cold Noodles with Sesame Sauce  ;-), Looking forward to going back and trying their Singapore Style Mei Fun and other specialities. 5
The 2-storey brick building was very nice, complete with chandeliers. I stopped here before heading to the Cuyahoga trail, which is just down the hill. The food was hot and good. Staff was very friendly and I didn't have to wait long for the food. My only complaint is that the pop machines are behind the counter so it's annoying to have to ask for a refill. I'm from out of state, so perhaps this is normal in Ohio McDonald's. 4
I agree with all the 1 and 2 star reviews. This particular location just does not care about customers. I have had more than one bad experience and will not be back to this location. 1
What a great show...music, dancing, special effects. My first cirque experience.  Will definitely go to more. 5
Since i moved in here near the boca park area, this is the closest pet store that i could get my dog's food. As a dog lover myself, it breaks my heart that everytime i go there, those poor puppies looks sad and sickly, they are stepping on their own poop and seems skin and bones hiding on their fur. I tried not to look and just grab the food/stuff i wanted (which is kinda overpriced!), pay at the counter and leave as soon as possible. The staffs there, which consists mostly bunch of teenagers who have no idea what their doing rather than to asked a generic question "what kind of dog do you have?". They handle the pups poorly and one of them almost dropped the yorkie. Its just so sad that theyre very much engaged in gossiping and chitchatting (and theyre not even shy to tone it down even just a bit). 2
My partner and I tried this place a few weeks ago, I believe it was shortly after they opened. The food was great, tasted fresh, and came out surprisingly fast considering only one chef was behind the counter preparing food for eight tables plus takeout. The server was super friendly, fast and accommodating.  If you are ordering off the main menu, the selection is awesome, had everything we are use to plus a few items we had never seen before. The AYCE menu is decent, but doesn't have the biggest selection, as well as having order limits on some of the items. In my opinion, if you are gonna put a limit on an item. Maybe it should just simply be left out of the AYCE menu, aside from that it's a nice little spot with great food and great service. It's worth a try. 4
Pretty good Mediterranean fare. I had beef shawarma atop hummus, and my tablemates all had other varieties of shawarma with the rice deal. It was fine, not too burnt like is often found at places that serve the stuff. The house-made pita was nice, and we had their take on samosas (beef filled mini-pies) which were called something else but same thing; pretty tasty.The atmosphere was nice and fitting, given the theme. Middle Eastern-style music, upholstery, et cetera. The only off-putting things that stop me from giving this place 4 stars are 1) the bathroom, which was composed of all very-old elements (toilet, sink) and was pretty gross. It's an old building, I understand, but y'know. Other thing was we were seated at a table which was directly next to an exit door. Pretty sure that's a fire hazard. My final gripe for this otherwise-okay place: They brought out my food by itself and thus my tablemates had to wait. This should be a cardinal sin in restaurants; if you had seen any of my other reviews, you'd know how annoying I find it as it's pretty unnecessary. I'll save you the rant, but just say if you start a restaurant please refrain from allowing that mess.Other than that, all was fine. I guess I wouldn't recommend going here if you want to avoid the Scottsdale (read: hoity toity) crowd, as they're all up in this place, but they were at least drowned out by the music. 3
After seeing this reviewed in so many other places I am surprised that it hasn't been written up on yelp yet.After reading so many of those great reviews I am thoroughly disappointed in the food and service that my family and I received at the Hartwood Restaurant. We ate lunch on a Saturday afternoon in October. The place was not that busy and we were promptly seated. I don't know if it was because of all the dust in the air and on the bookshelves around us but my husband immediately began having an allergic reaction to something. After a few minutes the worst of it subsided but his eyes remained quite red and watery for the remainder of the meal.We all ordered our meals and drinks at the same time. I ordered a Pepsi and as soon as I took a drink had to spit it out. The syrup in the machine must have been low and it tasted like bland carbonated water. I asked the waitress to get me a new one and she looked at me like I was crazy but went and got one anyways. She must have got it from the same machine though and the second one was just as bad. Figuring that since a decent glass of Pepsi was too much to ask I wasn't expecting much from the meal.I ordered an Angus Cheeseburger and fries. My husband ordered the Beer Battered Fish Sandwich and Chips. My burger was so greasy I couldn't stomach eating more than a few bites and my fries were both burnt and cold. My husband said he would trade me so he gave me his fish and it was flavorless and also too greasy to eat.Since I don't live in the area The Hartwood Restaurant is not someplace I will be frequenting and if I visit the area again it is definitely not on my short list of places to eat. Pittsburgh has so many other fine dining restaurants I am sure there are much better places out there. 2
Lousy food,caused food poisoning. .Very poorly managed and understaffed restaurant.The owner takes the cake as he was around but never greeted or interacted with the guests who were present there.I don't think this place will remain in business for long as overall experience was 2 out of 10. Owner thinks he is Rajnikant, just walks around with his phone on his ear.Recommend all to stay away from this trashy place.  The server was very helpful and pleasing and that is the only reason they are not getting a zero rating from me.I saw a few 5 star rating on Yelp and Google and decided to dine there but I am sure those ratings are put up by the owner or his friends and family. I spoke to a couple of people seated around us in the restaurant and they were also complaining about the food and the service.Will report them to the health department and hopefully they will shut them down for good for serving spoiled/old food or unhygienic condition due to which me and my family got sick. 1
With $1.00 Icees (cherry, coke or mixed) and .50 cent vanilla ice cream cones, this is a great place to treat children to something "special."  The indoor play area is clean and never crowded.  BK also offers veggie burgers but make sure to ask them to hold the mayo if you do not want your sandwich swimming in it. 3
I will never go back to this salon again.The salon is not clean.  I'm not sure the last time the desks and chairs have been cleaned.  I was asked by the nail technician if I was pregnant.  I am 2 weeks post pregnancy and last I checked it's not socially acceptable to ask if someone's pregnant especially when it's not obvious.  Then she proceeded to tell me that I can buy a wrap for my stomach. The last and final straw was when she cut my nails super short and actually cut the skin on one of my fingers.  She was very rough and seemed like she was in a rush.  I would have given this a salon no stars but I don't have that option. 1
I give it two stars for a few reasons. On the good note, the ice cream is really cool.  It is a really awesome concept and the ice cream is actually really good.However, on that day the boy behind the counter was eating all the toppings in the back not to mention we could not find anywhere to sit because all the booths were dirty from previous visitors who hadn't just left because they ice cream spills were hardened.  The employees hadn't come to clean the booths or chairs. It wasn't just one but almost all of the seating was dirty.  We sat at the cleanest table we could find only to be bothered by flies and gnats, one flew into my ice cream and I threw it away.  It was gross. There were a ton of flies and gnats.The ice cream was great, the cleanliness and service, not so great. 2
*amazing customer service, staff were very friendly and welcoming *huge portions, great flavors, affordable prices *order the beef rice bowl! *would definitely recommend :) 4
Made the mistake of eating breakfast out on a Saturday. Morning....quite a long wait in the heat. Quite a small table for 2, crammed in. OJ was fresh squeezed as promised, was 20 more minutes before our pancakes and eggs arrived, nothing out of the ordinary, coffees ok. Have had better elsewhere. 3
From the moment we got there, it was a disappointment one after another. We were a group of 15, but instead of being seated right away, they were debating whether to let us in or not. Finally, after waiting outside in the cold, they decided to split us up into smaller tables. Then, to our disappointment, they gave us a reduced menu, even though we saw a couple sitting next to our menu getting the full menu. I ordered a regular dark hot chocolate. It was not bad, but my expectations were a lot higher for the price I was paying. Overall, poor service, slightly pricey, and "meh" quality. 2
A group of us went to this dinner show last weekend.  While it is not a Cirque Du Soleil show, it was a lot of fun.  The food was okay - it is not a gourmet meal - but it is fine considering the price also includes the show.  We enjoyed it. 3
Worst service ever. Been to other BP and other establishments in the area, we've actually been to the Vaughan BP 4 or 5 time and the service has been bad every time! The last time we went we were seated quickly but no one came to our table for atleast  12 mins to take our drink orders, and man I was thirsty that night. Funny thing is the restaurant wasn't even busy. I won't go back and neither should you. 1
I arrived to the spa 30 minutes prior to my appointment as requested.  I was told I had missed my appointment.  I had called a week prior to have the appointment time moved; clearly a mistake had been made by the staff member I spoke with.  I was offered an appointment three hours later.  I felt as though I was being inconvenienced because of a mistake they had made.  I explained that the available appointment did not work for my schedule(or for my friend whose appointment HAD been set appropriately).  The staff member was not proactive with further suggestions(think ::awkward silence::), so I politely asked for a manager.  I provided a solution(allow me to use the spa amenities while my friend received her service, reschedule my service for another day).  Upon entry, I noticed the spa is quite small.  There is minimal seating(7 chairs throughout, we had to sit on the locker room benches part of the time).  The massage rooms are located off a hallway in the center of the spa(clearly a design flaw as the noise of flip-flops shuffling down the hall throughout your massage cannot be relaxing)...the same hallway that every visitor must walk through to get from point A(lockers, vanities, lounge) to point B(steam room, sauna, hot tub).  There are only two showers, both of which had clumps of hair and used razors in them on each of my visits.  Clearly, with only two, they need to be cleaned more frequently.  The staff, while hospitable overall, were too talkative for what is to be a relaxing environment.  As someone who frequents spas(of equal pricing), I have experienced much better.  I now understand why this spa was featured for a $60 for $120 Groupon offer.  While my facial itself was satisfactory(though the room light should not have remained on throughout it), this is really a "starter" spa. 2
Poor customer service by our waitress named "Natalie" ruined our first time here. We ordered a few glasses of wine and a couple of appetizers. None of which were worth the price we paid. (wings + lobster dip) Took forever to even get to order which I didn't quite understand seeing as it was not a busy night and there were only a few other tables occupied. Upon ordering an appetizer I went back less than 3 MINUTUES after asking if I could change the order due to allergies at which point Natalie bluntly said "no the order has already been put through to the kitchen". I should have requested to speak w/ a manager about her attitude but this yelp review will have to do instead.  Will definitely NOT be returning to this restaurant. 2
Although the pizza was good, the owner had terrible customer relation skills.  We grew up on Theresa's pizza and we were looking forward to enjoying it for a family get-to-gether.  We enjoyed 3 large pizzas.  As 1 family member finished her last piece, she pulled a long blond hair from between the sauce and cheese.  Since there was a large group, she did not want to make a big deal out of it. She simply stopped eating. I was sitting next to her and I told her we called the next day.  We spoke with a manager who said nothing but that she would have the owner call us.  When the owner called us, we explained and he gave no response.  I waited, still no response.  Finally I asked him if he heard me.  He said yes.  Finally, I asked him if he would remove the cost of the 1 pizza as it was obviously a bit gross. He said he didn't understand the whole situation. I explained again.  He was speechless.  We were expecting, "We are sorry for your experience, but we appreciate your business."  We thought we would hear, "Thank you for being loyal customers,"  He could have given us credit for 1 pizza or offered another pizza for another time or a 1/2 off coupon.....nothing.  We had even told him we enjoyed the pizza, however, I think most people would agree that pulling out a 12 inch strand of hair from between the sauce and cheese, is a bit disgusting.  The funny think is, we are reasonable people and understand things like a hair in food may happen, but no apology, no simple discount off a future order (I had told him my parents eat their almost weekly. Is unacceptable. 3
Really enjoyed this place, wasn't as busy as I was expecting it to be (which was great). I ordered the Mushroom Eggs Benny and it was delicious! The best part, however, were the 'hashbrowns'. The Beltliner has a very unique twist to traditional hashbrowns, and I love them! 4
If there is one consistent character about this particular coffee bean- it  is INCONSISTENCY in quality and service.  I use the drive thru a lot and it feels like my simple order is never right.. Creating an issue where I have to park and ask to have it remade correctly, or ask for the correct size I ordered and paid for.  I really want to like this place..  It's the closest coffee shop near my house as I'm on my way to work.  I just went through with my husband on our way to the other side of town..and once again the sub par quality is disappointing.  Both of our orders were wrong again.  Yuck. 2
I'm not really a fan of BMV.  The staff are not helpful AT ALL and I find it peculiar that they have all these books that are supposedly "used" but in fact look brand new.   Remember the guy who had all the bikes for super dirt cheap and they turned out to be stolen goods?  I'm just saying that when something is too good to be true, someone is paying for it.  Also, they only take cash which is inconvenient. 2
Definetely my favorite place to eat when I'm low on cash. This place is a wrestler dream. They make any pizza you desire and all you have to do is ask. For a 7 dollar buffet it's definetely your best bet for cheap! 4
Food: 4/5Service: 3/5Cleanliness: 3.5/5Price: $$I have a confession to make. I love cake. During my undergrad days, I ate a slice of cake a day. It was my food that allowed me to destress and its delicious taste in my mouth was so addicting. I can proudly admit that I was a regular at Future Bistro over the 5 years I was in Toronto because I was one of those who got their card stamped for every slice of cake that was ordered.My ultimate favourite cake is the Red velvet, but here at Future Bistro, I tend to gravitate towards cakes that I had never tried before. It's better if you go with a few friends or as a group, then you can try many different cakes at once. :P The service at the bistro seems like it can be a little improved; it does get quite busy during peak hours and many things are self serve (cutlery for example).The bistro offers over a dozen different kinds of cakes for you to choose from, not including its pies and other baked goods. I haven't heard one complain about how bad a cake tasted here so I think it's quite safe to go out of your comfort zone and try one that you had never tried before. I tend to gravitate towards cakes that have caramel in them while I'm here.The Super Caramel Crunch is my ultimate favourite at Future Bistro. It is layers of caramel and whipped cream which I absolutely love. Some might think it's a tad bit too sweet, but I beg to differ. It's the perfect amount of sweetness for me and I can (sometimes) finish this thing before you get to take a bite. It's quite light and fluffy compared to other denser cakes, so if you're a bit too full from that dinner you just had or want something less filling, this might be a good choice.If you go to U of T, chances are you have probably walked past this bistro many times. The bistro opens their windows for the summer and has a great patio outside for you to enjoy. Not only do they serve great desserts, the bistro has great tapas and drinks to share with your friends as well! It really is a great place to end your night whether you get something sweet or savoury (or both). I would highly recommend you to visit if you love cake like me or want to end your night at a nice bistro with lots of locals! 4
I am an Elite Plus Member.  I've spent a lot of money here (around $6K in the last 12 months), for a couple of reasons:1. Its convenient, and I like looking/touching/experiencing things before I buy.2. Its not right to use a brick and mortar store to test gear out, and then buy online.3. They would price match the items I found from licensed sellers online.4. Their rewards program incented me to continue to consider them as a viable option for a vendor to purchase all my technology.After today's call, I will no longer be spend money at Best Buy.Scenario:On July 11th, I used a $35 Reward Certificate (the money you get back from purchases you make) to buy a $38 cable.On July 27th, I returned that cable.  I noticed that my return receipt did not reflect the use of my Gift Certificate.  It appeared as though I was only receiving the amount over the $35 Reward Certificate back.I brought this to the attention of the Customer Service Person at the Returns Counter, and he told me that I would see that in my online account in 5 business days.The next day, I call in to the Rewards Support Line to be sure he was telling me the correct thing.  He was not.They tell me they fixed it, and I should see the certificate by August 4th. (that was a twenty minute call or so).I don't see it by August 4th and call back on August 7th.  The phone rep, Tracy, then tells me she has fixed it, and I'll see it by the 13th.  (that was another twenty minute call or so).I don't see it by August 13th, so I call back in today, and the phone rep Ada then tells me she has fixed it, and I should see it within 5 days.I've had enough, and I ask to speak to her supervisor.  Her supervisor, Lisa, reiterates that they can't  issue me the credit instantly (I tell her I get that), but ALSO notices that not all the proper steps were taken in order for me to get the credit back (so I would have waited another 5 days to find that I still didn't get the money back, if I had not asked to speak to her).  She then does some magic, and tells me I'll see the credit back today (even though she told me that was impossible).  That was a 56 minute call.This is where it all went wrong:1. The original sales rep who sold me the cable didn't apply the Rewards Certificate correctly.  2. The rep who accepted the merch return misled me, and told me the credit was going to automatically return to my online account. 3.  The first phone rep told me she fixed it - she did not.4.  The second phone rep, Tracy, told me she fixed it - she did not.5.  The third phone rep, Ada, told me she fixed it - she did not.6. When I told Lisa that I had already lost the value of the certificate by simply having to be on the phone with them for almost 2 HOURS TOTAL, with no credit issued back to me, was enough for me to stop using Best Buy - she said sorry, we hate to lose you - and that's about it.I still have not seen the credit (was she just trying to get a frustrated customer off the phone?).This, combined with the fact that the in store reps seem to always create new Rewards accounts for you, rather than adding purchases to a single account (thereby negating any benefit from the multiple purchases you make there), makes me think that my money is better spent somewhere else.If I'm an Elite Plus member, and they see I spend a relatively large sum of money there, and they treat me like this, how would they treat you, the casual customer?Amazon Same Day Shipping is available in our area when you're a Prime Member. 1
placed a take out order (2 gyro ''sandwiches'', chicken shwarma, hummus and some baklava)...got there to pick it up and it seemed like if there's more than 2 people eating there, the whole staff gets flustered and doesn't know what's going on.  Sat there waiting for 15 minutes (even though my order was done and waiting) until they took care of the eat-in diners.  Long story short: crappy service BUT awesome food.  The gyros were stuffed to the max, the chicken was cooked perfectly, the hummus was bomb, and the baklava was a great ending.  I'll definitely go back, but it will always be a take-out scenario, because again, the service seemed to suck. 3
Love this place .... Honestly best Burrito in Toronto  Halibut is tasty, simple, flaky .... Brilliant 5
Located right outside Villa-Maria metro station, Quartier-Perse is a persian restaurant with many available seating. I was there on a Saturday night with ten friends celebrating. I was told by the organizer that she could not get a reservation because no one had answered the phone. Thus, she had to get there early so that we got a big table. When I first looked at the menu, I noticed that we only had two major selections: kebabs and stews. I ordered the lamb shank stew myself. We were first served sliced up pita bread with butter. Next, our lentil soup came. It was chunky with lentils, beans, barley, and spices. Even with this many ingredients, the soup itself was bland, but a bit of salt and pepper fixed it. Next, my lamb shank came.  I was first surprised as they served me the shank whole still on the bone separate from my rice. The lamb itself was fall off the bone tasty. The rice was cooked perfectly. The sauce, however, was again, slightly bland. I think the stew would have been improved by adding some vegetables to enhance the flavour, but perhasp that would no longer be an authentic persian dish. According to my friends, the kebabs were alright. To finish off the meal, they served us tea.Overall, portion size were large, and many of my friends did not finish their meal. However, I thought it was slightly pricey. If the food was just slightly better, maybe it would have warranted the price. Service overall was friendly, and we were so comfortable around them. 3
Really dishonest and slow. They promise to do something, then ignore your messages and calls when you are trying to chase them up for it. 1
The food was pretty tasty but what makes this a five star for me is that the staff were also very personalable. The stuffed pepper was oh so good. We got our food to go and had a picnic at the beach (forgot utensils but had napkins) and it was simply a really good experience. 5
Go to Joe's Diner if you want good food because they've got it. Especially breakfast, which is excellent. Everything I've tried at this place (and their original 16th St. location) has been great. It's not cuisine, it's diner food and it's done right.On the other hand, if you also value good service with your delicious chow, forget this place. On previous visits, the service has often been spotty, but it's easy to cut them some slack because the food's good and, after all, it's a diner. This morning I spent an hour and ten minutes sitting at Joe's counter, with only about 20 minutes devoted to actual eating. And I never got a second cup of coffee.After the folks sitting next to me -- who came in after I did -- received their food, I flagged down another employee to inquire. Apparently, the server failed to give my order to the kitchen. Eventually, my breakfast bowl arrived, hot, delicious and, maybe even worth the wait. The server mumbled an apology for its lateness but had to be asked to provide me with utensils. About that coffee: The personable young woman who took my order was careful to explain that they were out of their special cups for decaf drinkers, so I should watch out in case someone tried to give me a refill with regular. Indeed, the VERY SAME SERVER came back to me later with regular coffee and tried to put it in my cup. As instructed, I stopped her and said I was drinking decaf. My cup remained empty and that was the last I saw of my server. And this was the last time I'll visit Joe's. Great eats just aren't worth the aggravation of being ignored. 1
starts and ends with terribly bad service; food is mediocre at best and not served hot; food tastes terrible and certainly not Indian in taste; would never visit again. 2
Probably the worst experience at a hotel in Vegas I've ever had.  All of the construction was completely annoying, but one of the dealers in particular was pretty much a racist, and decided to get in a racially-motivated political debate with me.  Completely inappropriate.  She also wouldn't stop complaining about how she's made minimum wage there for like 10 years, which says something about their judgement to employ someone like that for 10 years without firing them.  She also made me feel really guilty for dropping a few hundred dollars at the blackjack table instead of tipping her that money.  I wish I had someone to report her to, but they don't really seem to care.  I will never be staying at this hotel EVER again, and would never suggest that anyone else does either, especially with all of the competition on the strip.  You can do MUCH better. 1
We Used a coupon deal they had. They only gave us one garlic breadstick,which was just half of a hoagie bun and no marinate with it. The garlic white sauce was nonexistent on the pizza. The picture showed lots of tomatoes and broccoli on the pizza but each slice had one sliver of tomato and only broccoli stems. Won't eat here again 1
The best sushi experience ever!!! Very fresh & delicious, good - fast service. The all you can eat deal is great if you really want to enjoy!!! Homemade desserts were also delicious, perfect balance, not over sweetened. Highly recommended. 5
Pretty brutal place. Not sure where the positive reviews are coming from. My beef shawarma sandwich was awful. I saw someone mention how cold their sandwich was which was the same case for me. The meat was very gross did not taste good at all. It was cheap I will give it that but I would def not recommend. I guess my search for great shawarma in the annex continues... 2
There were so many people and the line was long so we decided to do take out. The food was good and very filling. The only downside is that it only accepts cash and if you don't have Canadian dollar and want to pay with US dollar, they do almost 1:1. The food was $28 Canadian dollar and the lady at the cashier asked me to pay $26 US dollar.(which is $32 Canadian dollar) 4
Just returned from a weekend getaway with the girlfriends and i must say i was impressed. the hotel is beautiful, rooms are clean and very large with a nice living room added and a bathroom full of mirrors for those selfie enthusiasts! :) but as a new mom who was trying to keep her milk supply, the most impressive part of this hotel had to be the staff. We were leaving sunday night at 11 PM so we had a full 12 hours from check out to leaving Las Vegas. My pump is pretty heavy and bulky so i had to leave it in the large baggage that they stored for us. When i had to pump in the middle of those 12 hours, i went to front desk and asked if they have a small deposit room where i could pump more privately. They've immediately got my old room ready and told me i can stay for as long as i need to do my motherly stuff. I was quite impressed with this as Vegas is a party town and i didn't think they would be so open and friendly about the entire situation. So grateful to those wonderful ladies at the front desk for helping me out! 5
I have been a member at LVAC for almost 5 years and have visited almost every location. But the North Decatur gym is by far the best. Friendly staff, state of the art equipment, and everything is always very clean. Unfortunately it is one of the higher volume locations, so parking is difficult at certain times. But all around, it is a spectacular gym! 4
Wicked spoon always has a great selection. Bone marrow with kimchi for dinner is a must. Also if you want a nice dessert bar this is the place to be for dinner. Get there early because there might be a long line. But it should not disappoint 5
Worst place I have ever stayed by far! The customer service was absolutely terrible! First of all The room was a dump, i payed more to stay here then I would have at MGM or the palms...the showers had no hot water, nothing to even keep the water inside the shower so it flooded every single time! We asked them to call a cab and there response was, wait outside for 10 mins if one doesn't pull up we will call!! Then we asked for 2 wake up calls for the morning apparently that isn't allowed they YELLED! Then the night before check out we asked for another one at 955 and they yelled again saying if we weren't out of tere by 10 am they were charging us for a late checkout! They were the rudest people I have ever met...they must not want returning customers! Whatever you don't book here..go to a much nicer hotel for cheaper!! 1
So a good friend and myself decided to eat out today while on break from class. I remember her telling me once that she had never eaten at a Panda before so I recommended we eat at the one near campus. She agreed. I had anticipated that there would be 1 or 2 people in front of us ordering their food.Was I right?NoThis restaurant was dead. Absolutely dead, no one except those working there was there. I gave it a 4 because of that. Overall, as always I love the food. But being today was a religious holiday I couldn't eat certain foods. that was the only down side but nothing that would bring me down or stop me from eating panda. 4
The Great Pho King. If their name alone doesn't make your stomach dance with the joy and excitement of needing a Pho King fix, then you may have a serious problem. These days it can be tough to find unique food that is delicious and mouth-watering, but The Great Pho King's combination of Vietnamese and French food does just that. The best part about this place is that it doesn't matter where in the east valley you are, because they are portable and make stops all over. If you're used to boring foods and want something that will awaken your taste buds, 'Like' this place on Facebook and follow them to their next food stop. You won't be disappointed!! I pho king love The Great Pho King, and you will too! 5
Super cool and chillax place if you are looking for something low key. We had some delicious tea and smoked some hookah and enjoyed the atmosphere. Not alot of main course items on the menus but it was still a good experience. 4
Unique food, great atmosphere, pricey but worth a trip for special occasions. 4
I meant to leave a review the last time I ate here this place is truly AWESOME!!! I had a great experience and the food I ate was tasty and there was a great variety. Best Buffett I have eaten at in a long time. Highly recommend!!! 4
Not only did Jennifer lee do an awesome job foiling my hair, the prices were extremely reasonable and cheaper than anywhere else I've found in Pittsburgh. I will definitely be back! 5
Great burgers, very friendly staff. Reasonable prices. 4
We went here for a friend's birthday dinner and did the restaurant week menu. I was severely disappointed. The amount of food and the quality of food is really not up to par. The steak that we were served was cold. I've had much better sushi on Ventura Blvd. Avoid this place. Overrated. 2
I was expecting more from the Sharp Edge. I wasn't pleased with the pomme frites at all because they were just regular french fries and weren't good ones at that. The Margherita pizza was subpar. I did like my beer sampler and the salad was ok. The server couldn't remember our order and which beers were which in the sampler rack, so we had to guess, and she wasn't new. I wouldn't recommend coming here to eat. 2
The owner is v.friendly. Taste of food average. We took chicken shawrma platter. Portion of chicken was too small in it & owner forgot to add pita. So the point is check your order if you want to take away. 3
Don't judge a book by its cover! So neat inside, great service, great beer and great vegan options!! 5
This place is too good.there was lots of buffet and different type of food .food is soo tasty.prepration is soo good specially chicken tikka ,saag and dal makhni was too good .if anyone try to eat indian food I suggested this place .service was good it's very good Resturant 5
I never order anything from brick and mortor store as it is always in the dirtest condition and product is always on floor. staff in this store are just beyond dreadful and their check out line drives me crazy as they never have more than one cashier ringing through. I order everything from this brand on line. it comes in perfect condition with very little wait time. Val S 1
Tacos were extremely small. I've experienced a lot better. Super disappointed. 2
Ok so I'd like to start out saying I've been to Top Golf a few times and have always had a good time hitting balls and hanging out with friends. The food is pretty good and I've always had good experiences with the host staff.....that was until my friend's 40th bday party on Dec 4th. There was a large group of us (4 bays worth plus some that did not hit any balls). My friend paid a pretty penny for this party with food and drinks included for everyone. The party was booked for 2 hours. 40 minutes before our time was up the staff started clearing away everything, including the drink tokens (again...prepaid) and food. We asked for to go boxes for the left over food and were told no, they don't give to go boxes (hello...already paid for food AND they do have to go boxes because I've taken my leftovers home from there before) due to "health codes". When asked to let us use the drink tokens, we were told that they called "last call". Along comes the "manager" gal who listens to the complaints and then promptly begins arguing with my friend stating that "her staff is VERY well trained and asked everyone if they wanted to use the tokens (last call)" This was a complete lie...not one person in our large party was told it was last call (again, 40 minutes before our time was up). I've never heard anyone argue with a customer the way she did. My friend was being very calm and asked her why they didn't come directly to her and inform her that there were tokens left so she could tell everyone. The manager just kept insisting that her staff asked everyone. Never offered a solution. So then along comes another manager, I believe his name was Shane, but I can't recall. Anyway, he was better at solving some of the problems and after learning we had planned to go to the bar there afterward (and spend more money I might add) he did offer to use the remaining tokens (I believe there were 9 in all...do the math on mixed drinks at say a minimum of $7) and did bring 2 buckets of beer to use at the bar. I can understand the "party rules", but I've never been to a place that starts cleaning up before the booked time is up and usually they ask the host if they would like the left over food wrapped up, after all it is paid for.Would I go back...sure because it is a fun place, however I will NEVER book a party there and would not recommend it to anyone else. (I'd be surprised if anyone who attended this party would book one here). The main reason...the complete lack of customer service by the 1st "manager", she was horrible and was borderline belligerent. Might want to send her back to training, just saying. 2
If you are looking for nice and clean pho house, this is the place.The taste is good as well as their service. My parents in law told me that their friends found this place very clean and nice as well. If you go other pho places, you will see the oily broth which makes you feel, ewwww..... but this place has very good quality pho. 4
The lunch "bento box" is an unbeatable value. For $10 you get miso soup, small salad, 6 pieces California roll, main dish with rice and ice cream for dessert. Sometimes they have sesame ice cream, very delicious. There are other lunch specials with sushi for a few dollars more.The restaurant has a modern feel, there's a large amount of seating, and it's clean. It's a little noisy, but I guess that helps with the vibrant atmosphere.It's sometimes hard to wave down the staff, but they are quite prompt once you catch their attention. 4
I've been to the jimmy Johns in IL. ...this is nothing like it.....Super slow!!  And then they screwed up our sandwiches   ...forgot the bacon!  If you want service from young stupid, slow kids this is your place. 1
Maui was super thorough when figuring out what the issue was with my Mac Book Pro. After two weeks of trying a few different solutions and waiting on parts, he discovered there was a bad connecting wire from the motherboard. Easy fix at that point and a lot less costly vs replacing other items. Didn't over charge me and spent more time than was expected. I highly recommend him to anyone looking to get their computer serviced. This is my second time here in three years and both times A+ service ! 5
OMG! SAVE YOUR MONEY! OR USE IT ON THE SLOTS INSTEAD OF THIS SHOW!!!I really wish i would have read reviews before purchasing the tickets. Trust me its not worth it to try to 'see it for yourself' just trust us! i loved his tv show magic tricks on the streets of vegas but this show was ridiculous!From the very beginning we were all looking at each other like "are you serious" it seemed like a joke the way it started, w/ him yelling at the audience about all of us being some drunk perverts and jumping around- how did he convince Vegas to give him a show??? maybe they were all drunk perverts when he pitched the idea....???this show cant possibly last - there was bunnies everywhere (small stuffed ones) ..being pulled by visible string or cords across the stage. $100+ for stuffed bunnies?? really??? the LITTLE magic he TRIED to pull off involved pulling some doves from her oversized cap they put on him and him reaching into different compartments to get the birds out - it was terrible from start to finish!! stick to TV - where you can go back and edit and make us BELIEVE ...not this crap. oh and on the souvenirs items, the word believe was all over them, if you see closely you can see beLIEve....the word lie is more bolded or stands out some how...HE LIED TO US ALRIGHT ...i want my money back!! if you wanna see a VEGAS show see LOVE - that is worth every pennyi feel bad for the people in the show that actually have talent, the dancers and that one singer gilr that sang some song - they cant possibly think its a good show...i feel bad for them....hard working vegas show people! even the guy selling pics afterwards said it sucked and most workers felt the same. 1
Don't reserve a U-Box at this location. They only have room for six boxes, so it is likely that the reservation will be moved to a different location.  And you won't find out about it until the night before you plan to load. 2
Was a regular, until today. Stood in line while they fumbled with the register for 10 minutes and then was promptly ignored while they went and prepped. Fine, don't take my money. I won't beg. 1
A nice addition to the hood. Food is flavorful. Ambiance and decor is lovely. Great service. Loved the lamb chop tandoori. 4
If you can handle a 1-2hr wait for a 'bay', then it's all worth it as long as you know what to expect.  We ended up waiting about 90 minutes on a Friday afternoon in the middle of spring training - had plenty of drinks and food at the bar.Basically Top Golf is golf's version of bowling.  You get a couch, a waitress and a TV.  Then you can play a variety of games with your friends ... there are computer chips in each ball so the system knows where your shot goes.  You can make it as serious or non-serious as you'd like.  The scoring itself is a bit gimmicky - if you make one shot, the next is worth double etc.  Sometimes the chips in the balls don't register your score even though the shots go in a net (happened at least 6 times in 2 hours for us)  - We had a bay on the 3rd floor, and from that high up, even if you shank a shot, it usually manages to roll in to some kind of net for points.  So, if you're a terrible golfer, go higher up!All in all, we had a good time.  If you are in a casual group and have inexperienced golfers, then this place is great.  If you are a hard-core golfer, then it's probably better to just go out an play one of the dozens of courses in the area. 4
The room feels slightly empty, but it's still a decent place to go for dinner. Not really a "date night" feel. The food is 3.5 star. Most of their dishes come with home made pasta. Their meats and cheeses are said to be aged and cured in house- which were delicious. Their desserts need some work. We ordered the tiramisu, which lacked the rum, so it was dry, a banana split that was made with gelato and the canolis. The cream in the canolis had too much citrus, it was overwhelming. The bar has several different types of wine, but they don't know how to make an old fashion. When I described it, they literally threw an orange slice and a cherry into a big glass of bourbon. The reason for the 4 star was because of Pasquale.  He makes this restaurant. His service is so personalized and so genuine. Although it wasn't busy, he made us feel like the only table in the restaurant. We will come back because of him. 4
I went there for the first and last time last night. The food was ok.The service was very bad. We were a group for a b-day dinner. We brought a cake with us and They cut the cake before singing happy birthday, if that's not bad enough, they tried to charge us 2$ for each piece of cake for cutting it!?!They tried to convince the birthday girl that her meal was the entree size rather then appetizer even after she told them about her doubts. It took the manager to convene to get her the right dish. When asked for an empty wine glass they brought a filled one and charged for it.There was also very few choices for the vegetarian guests.The manager was nice enough to try to fix everything by giving shots to everyone but it was far from smooth sailing all night! Good thing they have wine for Saq prices. 2
Beware !!!!! We purchased a truck camper from Brad only to find out the guy we trusted was not upfront about alot of things. People .......do your home work and research the safety side when purchasing a camper. Also....review the numbers when dealing with any company and don't become a victim of the smooth talking salesman. Their new location has gone to their head. The lack of building lasting relationships with their clients is not a priority to this company. 1
The food was homemade and fresh; however, was disappointed the Roast Leg of Lamb was well done and dry. Was also disappointed two of my orders were sold out, the Lamb Chops and Sausage appetizer. It was a Sunday night dinner for three birthday celebrations. Would think twice about returning again. 3
Excellent experience.  Stayed here for four nights.  Rooms are very clean with everything you need.  The staff here is above average, friendly and helpful.  Front desk staff are great - you definitely get service with a smile here.  Pool is great,  relaxing and comfy lounge chairs.  If you want a more lively scene just hop over to the Mandalay Bay pool.  This is a great option for anyone who wants to balance the  typical Vegas experience with some R&R.  The spa was also excellent.  Had a massage   with Katrina who is top notch. 4
I love this place, from food to coffee and to everything else's! Its very chill, laid back and most of all they are DOG FRIENDLY, its close to the park that after we did our walks and jogs, my dog and i have a spot to hang out and rest. They gave him delightful treats and water while am enjoying my green iced tea and pesto salad or my guilty pleasure the hot red velvet mocha and french macarons. The staffs were very friendly and courteous. They are open 24 hours, free WIFI and you can even order online... What else can you ask for, this is like as good as it gets, better check them out and you wont be dissapointed... :) 5
This place is super fun and well thought out. Just call ahead - it's very small and they only let you do 70 minute rotations. If you are looking for somewhere with a different vibe - complete with random thunder storms and good rum drinks- this spot's for you:) 4
- If you haven't eaten at The Lakeview, I'd suggest you do.It's quickly become one of my favorite places to go when I'm craving diner food, but want to stay away from the typical greasy spoon diner type-of-place. The Lakeview is open 24 hours-a-day, and that definitely contributes to one of the cool aspects of this place: it isn't that you can eat imaginative diner-esque food at 3 o'clock in the morning on a Tuesday, but also thatyou can eat it at 3 o'clock in the afternoon on aSunday and the experience is entirely different.That's because it's inconsistent, but not in a bad way. It's inconsistent because of the diverse group of peeps you can expect to see there when you go: Sunday afternoon is the brunch crowd, Saturday evening is the daters, Friday late-night is the Ossignton bar crowd. Whenever you go, it's a different sorta experience.It's not just diversity that makes this a kick-ass experience, the food is also spectacular and truly imaginative. The style of upscale-diner definitely comes through on their menu withitems like theCorriander Walnut Pesto Omelette, a Peameal Brie and Havarti Cristo-style sandwich, and the Lakeface Albacore Tuna Melt. It's a genuinely nice blend of the expected and the unexpected. As a side note, I need to mention the impressive veggie burger they've got that's made from black beans and served with a wild mushroom saute and caramelized onions. Spectacular. Whether it's their 24-hour menu or their brunch menu, vegetarian or carnivore items, this place cranks out some delicious food.I'd definitely recommend you check out The Lakeview. They're doing diner food right, 24 hours-a-day. 5
It was ok. The items were well organized. Thought it was expensive in relation to what they were offering.  Purchased 4 items for $67.Not sure how close the clothes are looked over before BUFFALO purchases them. While trying on clothes, I discovered set-in stains on two pieces of clothes & one  item had an unrepairable rip. Use caution before purchasing. 3
Always great food.great service top notch place everytime every plate!!! The bakery is the bomb  fresh super tasty and priced right 5
I was a big fan of Wet N Wild the two times I have previously been here until now!! My family of 6 drove 3 hours to this park over the weekend for my son's 6th birthday. We spent most of our time at Boogie Board Beach and all I can think about is how disgusting the water smelled!!! I wish the manger could get in the water to come out and smell the scent of mildew all over your body!!! At first when I got in the water with my son I smelled my shirt thinking it was just that, and suddenly my brother comes out of the water smelling the same !! The entire day there I was focused on how I smelled the entire time. I smelled like a dirty wet towel!!! I quickly told my son to get out of the water for fear of a possible contamination of some sort! The next day I got diarrhea and was worried it was that water especially after reading this past week's reviews about a crypto outbreak!!! They really need to dump out that water and fill it with new water before someone becomes extremely sick !! Not only this but the teens that work there are extremely irresponsible !! One of them even scolded my child for going down the water slide before the next kid got off completely so they ended up crashing !! That was completely the girl's fault that had told him to go down in the first place !!! Never coming back here again !! 1
I very rarely give 5 stars 4 is usually average tops for a great place I've only ordered from here once but I was not disatisfied with price or food all in all I'll order from hear again great place for early turn in food on a work week had philly was great wife had Cobb salad she wasn't bitching so like ice cube said today was a good day! 4
After reading all the horrible reviews on this place, I decided to give it the benefit of a doubt and try it out. Friend had bought me a Groupon for a massage for my birthday, so thought why not. Arrived 10 minutes early for my appointment thinking it would be good to be early and on time to fill out paperwork, all for nothing. Half an hour later after knocking, ringing the doorbell, emailing twice and also calling the phone and leaving voicemails, there was no answer. Waiting outside in the freezing cold I decided to leave and cancel my appointment as I wasn't about to wait any longer in the cold for a service that I no longer wanted. Bottom line is that this place is shit and I won't be attempting to reschedule. 1
Food was creative, flavored were good. Appetizer portions reasonable for the price and quality. Main courses however is where they fall short. Portions were far too small for the price, about $6-10 more than should be depending on what you order. Bread was a but dry for brioche but a nice light bread to have with the meal. Wine selection is very good and varied. Coming from a food town like Portland, this restaurant is nothing special but is a great addition to the chandler/sun lakes area. I would not return for dinner but would for apps and a glass of wine. They were not very busy for a Friday night either so I suspect many others feel it is overpriced for dinner, too. Would re-evaluate that for longevity.Nice atmosphere too despite odd strip mall style location. 3
It's a great concept, and a cute restaurant, but the food is really fast-food at sit-down prices.  I had a burger, and it was incredibly dry (and I never even tasted the cheese).  The fries, onion rings, and shakes were great, but given the cost, they better have been!We tried to sit outside, and the instant we brought our food out, we were absolutely swarmed by flies - so we gave up, and went inside. 3
Maha's mind blowing chicken sandwich is the signature. 2 hours wait is their signature too. If you have lots of free time it's worth trying the food but if your time is valuable 2 hours is gonna cost you at least 100 bucks interms of time. Need to upgrade the place to a bigger one. I won't go since I don't like the waiting time. 4
Great cheap sushi.Love the bloor street roll and the wakame salad.Edit: The Bloor Street Roll is sushi with very little rice. A big slab of salmon wraps around the outside with basil and salmon roe in the middle. Really wet. Really fishy. Such a good roll. 5
I was staying in town for a week. I wanted to try new places while i was here. I read reviews for Jet. Couldn't wait to bite into it. When i did i was very bummed out. Nothing like the reviews at all. Altho delivery was fast and food was hot. 2
Was torn between 2 and 3.  Caught the last of the breakfast buffet which was ok (nothing special, pretty limited variety) and the start of lunch - which was awful.  Not going again and I love me a breakfast buffet. 3
I just dined at Switch tonight with work associates. Overall the experience was exciting and fabulous. The only downer was our waiter who never seemed pleased with any request or order. Nothing seemed good enough. Huge bummer!Overall the food and wine was fabulous! 4
I won a free trip to Vegas and this is the place that was chosen for my hotel. The hotel itself is decent but outside of that you are in a great part of the strip, you dont have to walk far at all to go to the more popular casinos. There is also fun outside club right outside of the hotel that specializes in mixology, so it is fun watching them make drink. 3
This place is average at best. Came here since I work in the area kinda and read good things here on Yelp. I have to say it's just not that amazing. It was decent, I have nothing to complain about specifically but it certainly didn't impress me or blow my mind in any sort of way. I ordered the shrimp po boy sandwich and again, it was just very plain. Not much flavour and the breading was not tastey as well as the shrimp did not taste very fresh. 2
I was disappointed in the pot stickers that I had last evening.  Too much dough. Not much filling. 2
I never go any place else to get a battery for my car. Best prices in town, excellent service. Battery prices are a third of what you would pay at Auto Zone or any other automotive shop. Can't get better prices at Costco or Sam's Club either. 5
The best in Las Vegas! Always fresh! I recommend combo (#19), lamb chops are to die for. They have live music every evening! Once again, the best in the town 5
I went to here the other day. It had a lot of places to sit (most of which were occupied), free wifi, but no power outlets that I could find.The latte I had was beautiful, but not super exciting flavourwise. I've been spoiled entirely by the Sam James Espresso Bar. The one from here, was probably the second best one I've had in the city so far though.It seems like the perfect place for both hanging out (there are cozy spaces behind the coffee bar) and group work (they have giant tables by the windows) and it's a great location (close to Kensiginton Market.) They do charge extra for soy milk, and it was the second most expensive latte I've had, but I loved the space and would definitely go there again. Of the food items they had available, I saw a couple vegan cookies from Sweets From the Earth which was nice. 4
So my boyfriend and I came here for my birthday ; I have been wanted to try this place since it has opened big fan of Gordon watch him in Hell's Kitchen so I couldn't imagine so where better to celebrate my birthday. Daisy was my server she is so sweet knows the menu very well and suggested great items I didn't even really have to look at the menu I had some fruity cocktail it was very refreshing and her server asst. helped by cleaning items off table and refilling our waters. I got the ribeye medium it was so good ! I ate all it's served with potatoes and my boyfriend had the chicken pot pie chicken was very juicy and gravy was top notch! She suggested the sticky toffee to top it all off it's the best dessert I have ever had I still dream about it served with a vanilla ice cream. I will be back !!!! Thank you daisy for making my birthday special 5
Tons of picture dics.  Many records that you would find in dollar bins, priced like they were new.  But, I guess if your the only store in town...Thank G I dont live in Vegas. 2
Being a girl who loves red meat the Keg is my go to for quality and consistency. We went to have a nice celebratory dinner and all I can say is I'm very disappointed. I always get the same dish at the Keg the prime rib. I mean my grandma makes a crazy good prime rib but for eating out the keg never disappoints me with their prime rib. However this time I was not a fan of the meal at all. The prime rib I ordered was supposed to be a Medium it was far from that mostly over cooked. Lacked any sort of flavour and the size I asked for seemed much smaller than what I'm used to. I also ordered a skewer of jumbo prawns. I always eat my prawns first because they are my favourite and although they were cooked properly they were cold for something that was "hot" off the grill. I like my food hot simple as that.The layout of the dining room is really bizarre. You are seated next to people who are practically eating their dinner with you. Not the greatest setting to have a nice meal out and conversation. I would have rather we ate our meal in the lounge which had better seating and it was actually more intimate for a conversation and meal. (Had I known this at the time of course)The wine list is great however over priced for sure. I could bring my own bottle if I really wanted to fork out so much money for a basic generic wine. The service was really good though I always find the staff at any Keg really friendly and helpful. I'm over the Keg for the time being though. I will have to journey to new prime rib horizons. 2
This place is horrible! The vet is so careless and not good at all.It makes you feel that the doctor only cares about your money, not your pet.  A few weeks ago,  I brought my cat in, she recommended to go through all kinds of unnecessary expensive tests. When it really comes to some issues, she had no ideas what should be done. She did some physical check on my cat without finding out any wound or  real reason causing the problem. Then My mom went back home and found some wounds. (My mom has no medical knowledge at all) We went back and forth a couple times without actually fixing my cat's issues.  SO If you really care about your pet, DO NOT go to this hospital. 1
The ramen was not too bad and gyoza was pretty goodThe rest was a disappointmentWe ordered the Brussels sprout tempura and it smelled funkyCould be the oil or the batterThe jinya bun tasted ok, bun was not fluffy enough and saggy, and the braised pork didn't have enough fat in it would have been betterNobody came to ask how the meal was so I didn't provide any feedback right there and thenBut here it isMaybe they had just opened up only one week, possibly needs some time to iron out the kinks 3
I love this breakfast joint. Hands down the best breakfast place in all of Phoenix. I love the waffle, it's just perfect. Egg scrambled are delicious and the sourdough bread is just mouth watering. I would recommend this place to anyone who loves to eat breakfast items. The only drawback is the wait to be seated on weekends but the quick service and delicious food definitely makes up for it. 5
I'm HUGE on service, having said that, if your product/ food is delightful, but your service distasteful, it will without a doubt translate onto the plate you serve me.These are some of the most doleful looking waiters I've ever met. They genuinely look and act as though you are a telemarketer they want to brush off as quickly as possible. No, like I literally mean they MARATHON away from you as quickly as possible, as if to avoid communication and questions. (What the hell service is that?)Aside from the servers, this place is great (for the food). The kitchen seems to be trying to make up for the blues permeating in the dining room. Rich quality in the dishes, the freshness and flavours are satisfying by anyone's standards. The Caesar salad was scrumptious! There was not an unturned, underdressed piece of perfectly bite-sized piece of romaine lettuce in my bowl. Creamy as it gets, they are not sparse with that dressing. The pasta is so fresh, and so nice. Perfectly cooked each time. Perfectly seasoned too. MmMmmmMmmmm!Note: Their lasagna was not that great...don't order it. Do yourself a favor and order one of their special pasta dishes. 3
I've been coming here for over 10 years. I have introduced friends from all backgrounds to Baras doubles and have seen girls knees buckle when they took the first bite of doubles. It may not be the swankiest ambiance but their food will not disappoint. 5
This was the worst experience ever! I am so disgusted by what I saw the waiter do that I couldn't even eat my food. The waiter stuck his hand and arm in the horchata machine to fix something, and didn't even dump the horchata out. This place is so dirty! There is no customer service at all. I do not recommend this place to anyone. My husband and I will never return. very dissatisfied 1
Love it just moved to the area and I'm so happy i found this place! Thai is my go to guy for my pedi n gel manicures! But everyone here does a great job! 4
My mom and I decided to eat here in Sunday since she had been craving it for awhile. We ordered our food thru the drive thru and as we pulled away we realized that the burger we ordered was wrong. So we made a u turn, I parked, and went inside to tell them that we ordered this burger with only tomatoes and pickles which had only lettuce and onions. They gladly said they would fix it. The manager took the burger to the cook, fixed it and gave it back to me. As we got in the car we realized that all they did the was scrape the lettuce and onions off and added the pickles and tomato. I thought they were going to make a new one but they didn't and we know that they didn't because there was still two pieces of onions on the hamburger and the meat just smelled like onions. It is a good thing that my mother wasn't allergic because  if she was that could have been bad. Not to mention that the fries we were served were very old that we couldn't eat them... I would not recommended this place to anyone especially if you are allergic. If you want whataburger I would go to the one on Dobson and Broadway in Mesa.. BTW... We ended up throwing our whole order away and went somewhere else! 1
Beautiful ambiance.  The steak was cooked to perfection.  Servers were very professional, though we went at lunch on a weekday it was not full at all. There were literally 5 people in the restaurant.  I will definitely go again but probably for dinner on the weekend. 4
Interesting experience.  I was not offered a particular type of massage.  Swedish or deep tissue as advertised.  I believe I ended up getting a Swedish massage.  A significant amount of time  focused on my groin area.  ( No happy ending was offered)  I was unable to communicate with my masseuse and his English was very very poor.  When I left and paid what I thought was the HST I was denied a receipt.  When I asked I was told that my masseuses was not a licensed  registered  massage therapist and I would not be able to claim this expense through the extended health care plan. I feel that the Group misrepresented the massage I had bought.   I would not return to this place. 1
My 1 year old American Pit injured his rear left leg.  The swelling and pain was so bad that I had to take him to a vet.  The vet we went to was Deer Creek Animal Hospital.  I came there to get answers, solutions and remedy for my little pup. What I got was confusion, no answers, no solutions and a $350 vet bill for X-rays. So for $350, all I got a recommendation to another vet, whom did a phenomenal job and was able to properly diagnose, treat and provided a a solution.   Deer creek animal hospital did nothing for me and my pup. I am extremely disappointed and felt like I was robbed in plain sight.  I do not recommend this place to get any sort of treatment.  But if your looking to pay $350 for just a recommendation to another vet then this is the place. 1
The services good, the employees a joke. I had my one dog through UPC. Had a good experience. Then my card got shut off, moved houses and found out later that my membership cancelled when I tried to put my new dog on the insurance. The first employee was very rude and unprofessional. Demanding a 17 new applicant fee, a 20 decline card fee and 12.99 a month for both dogs. Fine, whatever. The part that got me was her raising her voice at me, not letting me talk, informing she was "working" with me. How are you WORKING with me if you are demanding more money and screaming at me. I said I wanted to do it, 24 a month for both dogs, fine. Clearly communication isn't a key here with this company. I get another person who told me I apparently "hung up" on her last time and should have called seeked her out and apologized. You work in a corporation, not your living room. Long story short, she told me she would have to "reconsider" my membership and she would call me back. Anndddd never heard back from her. 1
Food was fresh , all of it , but not the best in Phoenix Tried a crane asada and green chili pork I thought green was better If you are comparing it to Taco Bell then it's the bestWe didn't leave unhappy the service was great 3
I got bumped from my flight and the airline company sent me to a hotel with vouchers for the cab.  My ride to the hotel was fine, great even.  My return to the airport was not a pleasant experience.  The cab driver I got kept looking at the voucher like he'd never seen it before.  He then complained that it didn't include any tip or gratuity.  Um, I got stranded in Las Vegas with no cash and you want a tip?  So before he could pull out of the hotel parking lot, I left and took my voucher to use with a different driver.  The guy was a jerk.  The hotel got me a second Desert Cab, and this new driver was cool.  He understood my predicament, and when he dropped me off the only tip I could give him was a coupon book full of casino freebies and discounts, which he appreciated.  So bottom line is that you never know what kind of driver you will get.  If you don't like the driver you end up with, get the taxi ID #, driver name and anything else that you want and complain.  And if you get a good driver, let them know.  The driver I got that treated me right was Marvin.  That other guy?  Forget it, his name isn't worth the space. 3
this place is sooO lovely! stumbled across it a few months ago. such a cute little date spot and the pastries are morsels of heaven. although it is a bit pricey it's totally worth it and I never mind supporting a quality local business. Treat yo self to Coquette for sure! 5
I had been looking forward to eating here for a while so the first chance I got while visiting up in Vegas I took it.  Overall I felt this place was okay. I would have rated it a 3.5 star but that is not an option. Its a very nice restaurant and my waiter was pretty good. I had the chicken wings which were nothing special in the end but you can only do so much with a chicken wing. For my entree I had the fish n chips. This comes with two pieces of well battered Cod and steak cut fries. The fish was very good and met my expectations. The fries overall were just fries. They did have a unique horse radish ketchup which was pretty good. I would return for the fish but not much else. I felt there was something missing but overall it is a little pricey but worth a go. 4
Excellent customer service and very knowledgable and friendly as well. Brought in an 4s that needed a new screen and battery and my MacBook Pro that my daughter had previously decided needed a shower. Phone was fixed in under an hour and he had my computer back to me within 24hrs and running better than ever. All for around $140 (60/phone 80/computer)and I was ready to buy a new computer! Would highly recommend taking your broken/ sluggish apple toys here for a reboot. 5
Great food, great coffee. We had a grilled veggie panini and banana zucchini chocolate chip muffin with macchiato. 5
The water for the shower was not hot enough. The rooms are pretty old and our refrigerator was faulty. Not the best place to stay. 1
I used to think they had the best tonkotsu ramen in Arizona but lately something changed. It's not as good as before. The soup tastes weaker and the meat is harder and tastes different. Also, miso soup should never come out by its self for Japanese food. 3
I've been searching for an alterations place with hours that work with my busy schedule and was thrilled to find Linh's Fashion Alterations was no only just a mile or so away from me, but open until 7pm!  After reading mostly glowing reviews, I headed over with a dress that I needed to be taken in.  I must have drove past it twice, as It's a little tucked away in a small plaza, but once I  went inside, was immediately greeted by Linh, and had my fitting , I was already looking forward to seeing the finished product.  Both Linh and the lady who pinned my dress during the fitting knew exactly what I wanted even when I was unsure how it would be done given the dress has ruching along the sides.  I arrived back a week later and was encouraged to try the dress on to see the results.  It was perfect!  All the same ruching now in a  nice, form fitting silhouette.  I will absolutely be back! 4
Had a wonderful experience at Biff's Bistro lately. We went there for our first wedding anniversary to use some Oliver and Bonnacini vouchers, and we were surprised by how much food we got - we didn't even end up using anywhere near the total value of the voucher. The service was very good and the food delicious. They even had a little anniversary dessert and champagne for us - a nice touch. My only qualm was with the saltiness of the food. I actually tend to like saltier foods more than I should, but even for me this was on the saltier side. Nonetheless, a great experience. 4
Pretty patio - if you're a smoker.  I felt like I was in the Horseshoe back in the go-go 80s.  Blech.  Food - the salads are always overdressed.  They are soaked and wet with uninspired dressings. The steak was average.  The bright spot was the salmon on the salad - well seared and juicy.  Too bad it was "Atlantic," which invariably means "Farmed."Last word: COCKROACH.  After we'd moved inside because the smokers were literally lighting one cigarette off another like a leg kick sequence in a  Busby Berkeley chorus line, the COCKROACH ambled right up to my friend's elbow, perambulated along the bar, and then went in search of beer.UGH.  Also, COCKROACH. 1
If I could give it a half star more I would. The food was great! Just took a long time to come out. As we first walked in there was a pungent odor of either sulfur or sewage? Maybe they forgot to empty the grease trap I don't know. After a while it went away. We started with the artichoke, awesome! My wife had scallops which she said were very respectable. I had the Alfredo with shrimp, very tasty. This place isn't a two dollar sign place. Out bill was over 100 for two people. A lot of people might be enjoying the happy hour and lunch which are reasonable. Going to dinner here ordering entrees will bring your bill high but if you stick to cheese plates and bruschetta you will probably be happy 3
This place is incredible. Hands down most delicious  "fast food" Chinese restaurant in the East Valley. Wow! I ordered the 2 item combo and I got a heaping portion of Orange and General Tso's chicken, white rice, chow mien, and an egg roll for $5.95. I went here at 9:15pm on a Sunday also. I would recommend this place to anyone and am happy to say that I will be eating here much more often. 5
When I came here back in July for my birthday it's was fairly late maybe 8:30 at the latest we were sat n it literally took us 30 minutes before our waiter came to take our orders! We later found out that he was the bartender and the waiter.  Which is ridiculous the bar had about 5 people sitting there he had to serve n one lady was talking his ears off which took us forever to get our food. That wasn't his fault, it's red lobsters for being cheap and understaffed. That's the reason I took a star off other then that it was an okay visit the waiter was pleasant it just took forever. I also went here last night for the endless shrimp we got there at 9pm. We had an amazing waitress her name was Fabiola. She never let our glasses get empty , she was very nice, and she kept our shrimp coming at a steady pace. Even after 10 when the restaurant was closed she still let us order another dish. When I come back to red lobster I'm defiantly going to ask for her to be my waitress. 4
Standard moderately thin crust pizza. Several non-standard bottled soda choices. Comfortable atmosphere for adults or families. Not spectacular but has been a reliably good experience for me. 3
All I would like to say is the staff is great and helpful. I love the floor plans, and the location they definitely use the space the best way possible. Having to use a fob to get inside the building is so very annoying especially since you have to use it to get in the gate as well. But that really is their only way of security. But, the most irritating thing I've come across is that there is no parking. You are told that you can buy a covered space for $15 a month or even get a garage with an extra space for $150 a month. Humm I would totally pay the $15 a month so I know when I come home after 6 pm I can park inside the complex. Yeah, only if there was one available. There just isn't enough spaces covered or not to accommodate the residents and definitely not guests. I am a single female that works long hours and I have to park outside of the gate to the complex most nights. I have been lucky that I find the one open space there, shoot if that just didn't happen to be open then I'm not sure where I would park.. the mall or the hotel next door and have to walk over to the apartment complex. Honestly, I don't know what they can do about this problem because there just isn't anymore room to add parking. If I can not purchase a covered space before my lease is up I will definitely move. 3
I've now been to Kitchen 56 on two occasions and both times I was dissatisfied. I feel like this place could be so much more but just isn't. I agree with most reviews on here that the food wasn't bad but just nothing special at all, especially for the price. Unless you go during happy hour, which I do hear is good, things are very overpriced.  The staff is friendly enough but the service was terrible. On one occasion our entire table had nearly finished our entrees before one member of our group had received his food. Both times I have been the service from the wait staff and kitchen has been extremely slow, even when there is no one in the restaurant.  Unless you are going for happy hour, or just enjoy very mediocre restaurants, Skip it. 2
My full upper denture was in need of replacing.  I shopped around and met with a few denturists before choosing one.  Unfortunately the one I chose did a very bad job.  Even he knew he had failed and readily refunded all but a very small portion of the $1500 he was paid.  Dr. Szainwald was recommended to me by a friend.  He was gentle, kind, understanding and very, very nice and immediately helped to rectify the situation.  He and his team of excellent technicians quickly created a new denture that fit immediately with minimal adjustments (really, only five minutes, a little shave here and there) and looked very natural and attractive and for a more than reasonable fee.  I am so pleased I am searching out review sites so that I can give my unsolicited and heartfelt praise  and recommendation.  If you are looking for dentistry (I also got xrays, a cleaning, a filling and an extraction) or for dentures, please look no further.  His office staff are really nice too, really professional but very kind and helpful and his office is so close to the Bay subway don't even bother bringing your car.With a great big happy new smile,Coleen 5
DC Elite Fitness provides options for either one-on-one training or group Bootcamp training. Daniel the owner and head trainer is  very patient and knowledgable and a great motivator. I participate in the Bootcamp class between 4 to 5 days a week and it is a very motivational/fun environment with great people. I would highly recommend anyone to check DC Elite fitness out if you are looking for a fun place to workout while working toward your desired results. 5
Mallards games are pretty incredible for as small as they are. There are a lot of handouts as they try to advertise and there are plenty of food options. The between innings and seating sections are also pretty cool. This is a pretty good place to bring a date to if she is into baseball also. 3
I have ordered albos 3 times while visiting Las Vegas. The food is affordable and tasty. That said the people on the phone don't seem to understand what people expect out of a cashier at a delivery place. The person seemed more interested in making me laugh than making sure my order was right and they could deliver it. This time my delivery driver was kicked out of my hotel and I had to come to the entrance to get my food. If I wanted to walk through my hotel I wouldn't have ordered delivery, I would have gotten food from the food court.The previous time I ordered they had no problem getting into our room but we discovered on the receipt had my ENTIRE CREDIT CARD NUMBER, EXPIRATION DATE, CC2 CODE, AND ZIP WRITTEN ON THE RECEIPT. The driver kept a copy. This is completely unacceptable as it invites identity theft.The person answering the phone also seems very distracted and set the phone down twice (for 5 min or so each time) to take an order from a customer in the store rather than taking the minute or two to finish our transaction or placing me on hold to deal with the in store customer.In short fast, cheap, food with a very poor execution. 2
when i walk in , i was shock how big and nicely organized this place was!!!!!price was pretty great and stuff came to help me locate the item that i wanted quickly.and they have some of the wig that you can;t find anywhere else in town....this is like a wall mart of wigs and cosmetics ....LOVE IT... 5
Sports book customer service is inconsistent and arrogant. Decent food joints but nothin to write home about. 1
We came here with a party of 8 to celebrate my buddy's last day as a single man. We came here before we went "bowling". The decor was warm and has a lot of character. It gives you a very homey and comfortable feeling. Our server was very accommodating as we decided last minute to try the chef's tasting menu without making prior reservations for it. The server gave us no fuss and congratulated the groom to be. If I remember correctly, we had 7-8 courses and everything was delicious. The only reason I gave this review 4/5 stars is not because of the quality or tastiness of the food. It was during a couple of our courses we were served polarizing dishes.For example I was given a dish that was lighter in flavours while my friend was offered a more robust and heartier dish. I'm not certain if that was by design, or that they ran out of food to serve all 8 of us. It just makes you want to try the other dishes you weren't served.I found the price to be fair for the quality of food and portion size. The chef came out as each course was being brought to our table. He took the time to explain what we were eating and how it was prepared. It was very informative and a good way to pick the brain of this talented chef.  We all had a great dinning experience and I will definitely return.  I have no problem at all in recommending this place for a special occasion. 4
In the process of relocating to Madison from Indiana, my wife & I stopped in for lunch after a soul-draining day of house-hunting.  The brews on tap were perfect to take the edge off, and then I ate something I never expected to love so thoroughly -- a fried egg sandwich.This was the best fried-egg sandwich in the world.  And I've eaten and made quite a few.  The secret has got to be that chipotle mayo.  It's the new ketchup -- it just rocks everything it touches.And of course, the Weary Traveler is adorable with its beautiful dark woods, the mirrors up in the crown molding, and the delectable selection of local beers.  Saving the weary, one pint at a time... 4
Just an OK chain restaurant. I don't see the value for the cost. I've been to this location twice and both times items on the market buffet line were not well stocked and staff appears to do very little  maintenance on the area to keep it clean, wipe up the spills, etc. that are typical of self-service. There were at least 3 sauces that had run out and we had to ask someone to refill. They should have someone monitoring. We had a big appetizer platter on the previous visit that everyone really liked for the variety. Still, I think there are better local options in the area when it comes to value for the money. Even some chains like PF Chang's nearby I've had more enjoyable experiences. 2
In the words of the philosopher M.Jagger: you can't always get what you want. but if you try sometimes .. you get what you need. (after wasting a few hours)For new years 2012/13 we enjoyed our stay in a HRH Tower King Suite with the lovely "Tea for Two" Tub. Since our plans for this trip included Journey at the Hard Rock and Ka at MGM Grand we went back to the HRH Tower King Suite. I'm 6'8" so a big tub is a big plus in my book, in fact, it's exactly why we got this room again. Imagine my surprise when we checked in to the room and found a lousy 'standard' tub. Odd, since their web site explicitly states: Each 701 square foot king room includes .. with cast iron "Tea for Two" tub' .. nope. After spending far too long on hold we were promised the *right* room for our 2nd night. It was busy, I get it, you take what you can get. We followed up in person with the HRH Tower guest services people that we're not looking for an upgrade, just the 'tea for two' tub that was advertised. The next day we picked up the keys for our new room in the Casino Tower. A lovely room, although a bit loud since it's 'pool view' .. with a *terrible* 'shower / bathtub combo' deal.  Seriously ? Did you not *just* promise us the room we booked with the bath tub we *explicitly* asked for ?After more time on hold and dealing with a front desk manager who didn't know the difference between a standard King Suite and an ADA Accessible King Suite we finally got the keys to another room in the HRH Tower, with the advertised 'Tea for Two' tub. We probably wasted over an hour in the process but that's how you want to spend your precious weekend off, right ? Pro-Tip and Pet Peeve: you have *two* nice 40" Sony Bravia LCD TVs. Why can't you correctly set brightness/contrast and get HD content on them ?  Their 'commitment to excellence' was lacking in other areas as well I'm afraid. Exposed electronics in the mini-bar, poor service in the taxi line (there are two taxis waiting around the corner, could you maybe call them over?) and generally unacceptable wait times for simple room service orders. Coffee and some eggs shouldn't take over an hour. Rather than risk going through the same ordeal once more I think we'll just go with the MGM Grand Spa suite next time. 2
Great beer selection,  and fantastic pizza.  I keep getting the Carnivore pizza.  It's a little salty with the cured meats but I keep coming back to it...  Can't explain it. 5
I want to like this place, I really do, but it always disappoints me. It's just not a reasonable facsimile of a Philly Cheesesteak. I ordered a "whiz wit" (cheese whiz and onions in the Philly parlance) not thinking I wasn't at Geno's or Pat's in South Philly and was met with a blank stare by the cashier who had to go ask what that was. I'm not going to fault him for asking that, but even after a co-worker's explanation and me repeating I wanted onions, I did not get onions on my sandwich. I ordered takeout and realized this back at work, so I wasn't able to get this corrected, and the rest of the sandwich didn't do anything to make up for the lack of onions. I will say that the bread, alleged to be the venerable Amoroso's from Philly, is fantastic. But, the rest of the sandwich falls way short.I've noticed on every visit that the cheese sauce is very, very, very watery and flavorless. On this visit, however, it occurred to me that the meat was the most disappointing part. It was spongy and quite frankly tasted extremely processed. I've had Steak-Umms that tasted more authentic. Maybe I'm in the minority, but I just expect better steaks from a place called Southside Steaks. If you're in the area, Campus Deli in Oakland serves up a much more authentic "whiz wit." The bread itself earns this joint an extra star. 2
Went there with two of my lady friends. Most of their drinks are featuring Old City Soda which is made by the same owner. I tried a few gin cocktails and just didn't hit my fancy. Not really a sweet drink kinda guy. However the charcuterie board was just the ticket home! The atmosphere is a bit strange. Very bright with a lot of wasted space. Kinda reminiscent of an art gallery. Not very cozy and warm like that of luxe across the street. We live right down the street so I'm sure we'll be back but most likely not regulars. Sorry nothing personal. 3
Food was okay. I had the virgin pasta and it was good. My friend's Pasta What was a bit too salty. Atmosphere was cozy. Service was quick. Good spot for a late night meal. 4
This is the 2nd wknd I come to this McDonald's and they still don't have the breakfast burritos, they claimed that they ran out of tortillas. I only come here on the wknds bcuz it's close to home. This place needs better management. 1
I came in on Saturday to have new tires. Cost $1, 000.00. By Sunday one was flat. Of course, the store is not open on Sunday. Poor service, expensive. Naturally it was my fault when I drove in on monday. Do yourself a favor and get tires someplace else. 1
I joined this gym after leaving Fitness 1. This gym isn't perfect but is as close to perfect as I could ask for. I like the long hours the gym provides for daycare. And daycare will change dirty diapers!!! And for the most part I really do like the gym daycare employees (except I had an experience where the daycare manager was extremely rude, but I forgave that one instance because I figured she was having a bad day).I also enjoy the towel service. & The equipment is great. The classes seem great though I have yet to attend a class. But I wish the gym would add free wifi for members to use while working out (so that I can watch netflix while working out), add some more channels to the equipment's tvs (I wish they would add e, bravo, mtv) and add a laundry shoot for towels inside the locker rooms. I even put in a request for the laundry shoot but Mountainside obviously just ignored my request. I also wish this location & all other locations would have a water service that they provide in their Scottsdale location. It seems like the west valley is constantly getting the short end of the stick and this is another example of that isn't it? & might be wrong but I think the Scottsdale location also has better tv channels than the Surprise gym does.But despite those gripes I'm still a fan. This is the best gym in Surprise. 4
Our first visit was so great that we brought friends and family for our 2nd visit. Unfortunately, the 2nd time around was not as pleasant. The owner was not friendly at all, he was very condescending and he wasn't happy to talk about his beers. In my opinion, he did not do a good job of selling his product or showing customer appreciation.I would give some of his beers 3.5 stars and some of them 4 stars. He makes good beer but who want's to buy and support people like him. My advise would be to let your wife work the taps (since she made our first visit great) and you should stay in the back and brew.I was embarrassed that I talked it up so much and it turned out to be such an unpleasant experience for my friends and family. There are plenty of other local brewing around to support, so none of us will be coming back here again. 2
We are never going back to this location again. Several times we have ordered and waited 20 minutes for two drinks, fountain drinks! And they always get the order wrong. Bad service. 1
I would never go back to this restaurant. when its about brar one thinks of good food, good ambience, and variety. i have been to all three brar restaurants in the gta. this one in mississauga is way below average. the food was average, very little variety, pathetic lay out, disgusting ambience, and poor poor service. i will never go back to this brar location again. the best brar restaurant is  the one in brampton.. 1
I am picking up scripts all the time and this pharmacy is decent. Not the best but not as bad as some that I have been to. The people are nice. The only thing I would say negative about this location is that they tend to be under staffed. 3
We were just traveling through town for the night and Yelped pizza reviews... And picked Barros.We ordered delivery to our hotel and they arrived very quickly and our Meaty pizza was great. My only suggestion is order small. Our pizza was very doughy and filling-we couldn't finish it all! 4
Hot stone massages are great. Definitely warranted after dealing with such helpful (read: incompetent) front desk staff!Also...it's really not hard to spell my name. Paul. PAUL. Not, Pall. Seriously. 3
Amenities and trendiness factor with everything top notch with amazing pool, full access gym across the way, and great blue hound bar/restaurant right on bottom floor should make this an easy 4.5 or 5.However...I'm giving this 3.5 stars. It gets a full point deducted for the lack of comfort. They sacrificed comfort for trendiness which is annoying. The king sized bed is the worst I've ever slept in and their pillows are awful. We have a room with suite attached that you can easily sleep on the chaise lounge/couch. but the couch/chaise lounge has like a vinyl covering with one pillow so their is no functionality to the thing whatsoever. Uncomfortable to sit on to watch tv. Uncomfortable to sleep on.Moreover, we asked for trundle bed and just the same discomfort. You are first a hotel where people sleep THEN you have trendy, modern amenities. Poor form on the hotel aspect. But kudos on Lustre pool bar and area. another kudos to Blue Hound. Coffee in morning is delicious (they just need to put cold water out with it like they do rest of day because everyone needs some water in morning with their coffee). :) 3
The piercer was professional and courteous and  I was helped very quickly.  The only reason I didn't leave five stars is because in addition to what I had done I wanted my tongue pierced and they were out of barbells for that piercing (which I'd think they'd have because tongue piercings are fairly popular as far as I know) . I will be back when I heal to get that tongue pierced 4
I have mixed feelings about this dental office. I am a full-time traveler and was in need of a basic cleaning and check-up while staying in Mesa.  Based on the reviews here, I made an appointment and was pleased to hear that they have a new patient special for $69. I thought that would be perfect.  They took extensive x-rays and pictures of my teeth and checked the pocket depth of my gums. The hygienist  seemed very competent.  Based on my gum health, she recommended a serious "deep cleaning" that would cost about $400.  Then she fell back to saying a full mouth debridement should be enough, so I went with that.  What I got was pretty much a standard plaque removal and cleaning using an ultrasound tool, no different in time and effort than previous standard cleanings I've had.  So I feel that I was somewhat "bait-and-switched" into paying more for a standard cleaning and exam (about $200) than was presented. I don't doubt that they do good work in this office but I don't feel that their new patient special is totally aboveboard.  Oh, and I left the appointment with a $3,000 treatment plan to replace three crowns that do appear to be starting to have issues, but I made it clear to the office from the beginning that I did not live in the area and would not be able to come back for any work. They are a bit aggressive in generating business, so go in with your eyes open. 3
It was my first time coming to this salon. It was very clean and nicely decorated. Good spa feel. I was greeted right away. Nicky did my nails. I got an acrylic refill with shellac. She was very friendly and understanding, listening to exactly what I wanted done. My nails and cuticles are very sensitive so she ensured she took extra care not to hurt me. I'm very happy with the result and will definitely return! 5
After living in Germany for three years sometimes I'm in the mood for a beer garden. This place is pretty close. Good biergarten food and great beer! Check hours before you go because they're not open every day! 5
For many years, all Wanda's pies were heaven, our favorites were the pecan, the apple, the banana cream and coconut cream. We used to but them from a small shop on Yorkville, near Yonge.Somewhere along the line, since moving to Kensington Market, I have found a slow and stead decline in the quality, and most important freshness of her pies. I don't know if upscaling for greater distribution or loss of hands on quality control is the reason, but her pies are certainly not near what they used to be. I have had stale blueberry pies, as well as others, that seemed past their due date, I can't even eat her banana or coconut cream pies anymore, I am not a baker, but it's like the have made some substitutions for the fresh cream they used to use in the cream pies (coconut as well). I guess as they they say, things change, but for a time I considered her pies not only the best in the city, but the best I ever ate, alas, no longer. 2
The food was good but I think they are a little short staffed. Our order, food, and bill took longer than I would've liked. I don't blame our waitress though as she was slammed. I had the yogurt parfait and it was delicious. The Greek yogurt was very smooth and creamy. 4
Bad time today. Dirty windows, table sticky, handy payment/menu gadget yucky. Used my fork to enter info.Food was burned and dry.Only dark chocolate desserts.Adios. 2
We went into this cupcake shop as recommended by a friend. We are very impressed with the cupcake and cake decoration this place does. We decided to try triple chocolate cupcake and red velvet cupcake as recommended by a friendly staff. My husband decided to try on cronut. He did love the cronut (we've never had the original one so we cannot compare on that). He loved the cronut especially the cream filled in the middle. My cupcakes were ok in texture. However, I love the frosting. It is the first cupcake store that I've ever been to and offered a "not overly sweet" frosting. I'd say I'd go back just to try other flavors. They have friendly staff and made our experience pleasurable. 3
The Shipwreck Burger is the second best burger I've had in the United States, without question.  Believe the hype.I came to this location because the Market Square shop was undergoing major renovations and was closed for several weeks.  I'm glad I did; I absolutely love the neighborhood, which Winghart's blends right in to.  The seedy interior was complementary to the food, which came from the kitchen perfectly cooked- medium rare, of course!I stopped by during lunch, and while the place was disconcertingly empty, the waitstaff was pleasant and attentive, and took the time to chat with myself and my coworker.They have a pretty well-stocked bar, and next time I'm in the area I'll make sure to take advantage of it. 5
I like this place. Prior to my East Coast Foodies event there, I had never been to Pita Jungle. Everyone has said how amazing they are. So, when I found out that they have happy hour, I set up an event and off us foodies went.My fellow foodies enjoyed $2.00 beers, and $4.00 glasses of wine ( I believe) and the happy hour food menu was great! I really enjoyed my falafel, side of lentils/brown rice, and carmelized cauliflower! What a filling and healthy meal.I will go back very soon for happy hour.Love,The East Coast Foodie 3
I really don't understand all the bad reviews- if you don't want to wait in line or have to say no to a sales pitch take a taxi. I rented a car from here last week for my vacation. We were helped by a woman who I believe was named Murna. She was very helpful and we even chatted about all the bad reviews on here. You get what you pay for- this place has the cheapest cars so expect to wait in line. There was no high pressure sales pitch- they outlined the offers and I responded with a firm no and that was that. 5
Food was great. Service, not so much.Went with a living social deal and had the Beef Tartare (amazing), Tuna Tataki (also good, but preferred the Beef) for appetizers. Mains were the lobster roll and pork ribs; the prices are a bit high for what you get, but since we had the deal we weren't too fussed. I wouldn't pay full price for those items. The dessert was called "After Eight Cheesecake" but it's banana cheese cake with Scor bar on top...a bit deceiving.Overall our waiter was VERY slow. Took almost 15 minutes before anyone even brought us water. Half an hour before we had drinks on the table and didn't get our appetizers until over an hour after we sat down. Everyone was running around like chickens with their heads cut off, but it wasn't event that busy, and there were tons of staff.Overall I wouldn't go back, the price vs. the portions and service just don't cut it. 3
Super quick. The Lady who helped me was really nice and accommodating to my child. I love the use of computers instead of traditional ink. No messy fingers for me afterwards! 5
Staff is very nice. Food is waaaay over priced. My wife got wings and they may have been the worst chicken wings I've ever tasted at a restaurant. Frozen Tyson wings taste the same. We got the filet mignon nachos and I'd love to see the "filet mignon" they used. Food gets 1 star. Staff gets five. Edited this review. Staff is nice but it's taking forever to get the check. Legitimately 15-20 mins after we were done eating. 2
Can you say BED BUGS?! My boyfriends uncle stayed there for two weeks and came back with bed bug bites all over him!! . I understand it's a weekly  but damn clean your shit!!! 1
The food and craft cocktails are worth a visit.  However, I don't recommend this place for parties or if you have a large group of people.  We tried to hold a birthday party at H & R last night and were told beforehand by the owner that it would be no problem.  Unfortunately there were plenty of problems including really bad service and the staff not being alerted that we were coming.  Our waitress seemed far more interested in hiding in the back than taking our drink orders.  Everyone left hungry, thirsty and frustrated.  I will go back but never to do anything but sit at the bar with no more than one or two other people. 2
I have been using their services for over 7 years. Changed owners a few years ago but the new staff and owner (Helen) is much nicer. It's clean, friendly, good service. However I have a problem with their opening, If you book an appt for opening time let's say 10am for a saturday make sure you have time to wait because no one will be there until 10-15min later. as well I wish they would have more, better collections of nail polish. 4
I love the food at House of Leng.  it's a great bargain at lunch... quck service and huge portions.  The dinner menu is more pricey and the portions are slightly bigger, but lunch is the strong point here.I've tried almost everything on teh menu and I love it all! 4
This is one of my favourite eating spots if my mom or grandmother did not cook on the weekend.  I like the cozy small feel of this restaurant.  A very authentic greek cuisine here.   I usually order the lamb special which is my favourite dish here.  The food is served fairly quickly for this type of restaurant.   It gets very busy on the weekends so I would suggest bringing a friend or family to kill the time while you wait for the food or bring a good book or magazine.  My only pet peeve is sometimes they are out of something on the menu that I want. Otherwise a great place to eat authentic greek food. 4
If I still had young kids wanting me to take them to McDonald's I probably would appreciate this Penguin-wannabe as an alternative.  But, I don't, and I don't.The original Penguin fit its setting.  It was a rundown dive in a rundown neighborhood with a good vibe and good "low brow" food.  The effort to re-create this in an upscale Huntersville shopping center seems like something in a theme park.  It lacks any authenticity.I was there on a Monday night, and it was full of families with young kids.  The bar has only three beers on tap.  I ordered a burger, a "Maddy Patty Melt."  I cannot remember when I last saw a place that sold burgers without fries or some other side, and that is okay, but might the waitress not have tried a little simple upselling, like, would you like fries with that?  The burger comes out wrapped in paper, and that is the last I saw of my waitress.  The burger is supposed to be on Texas Toast, and I suppose that allows them to call whatever they want Texas Toast, but it sure looked and tasted like ordinary white bread to me.To pay and end my meal I had to flag down the hostess/cashier.  The place, again, was full, and perhaps for families with young children, it is a good choice.  There are better burgers at the Five Guys in the same shopping center, and several other restaurants there better than this one. 2
Massive burgers but average quality. You have to put on hospital gowns when you go in. There are  a few othe gimmicks such as wine being served on an IV drip. You cant buy drinks as a mixer. You need to buy a whole bottle of spirt and mix yourself.The food is all served with disposable cutlery and plates.Lastly you get spanked if you dont eat all your food. It would be good for a group of lads or girls on a night out byt not really for familys or couples. Will have to try the english looking pub accross the road next time. 3
I liked the price for a mani/pedi $30.  I did not like a man doing a mani/pedi, I like a little conversation.  He almost clipped my cuticle too far. Also,  I do not think the place used sanitized tools.  I should have left.  That is big for me.  I have gotten toenail fungus from a different shop that did not sterilize. I asked if  he used sterilized tools & he acted like he didn't understand what I asked. He did a good job of applying the polish. 2
I eat here many times. I am that single guy people look at and feel sorry for cause I am reading something and ignoring them, unless she is hot ;)You cannot go wrong with any of the food here. Really.Now that its winter, its PHO and more PHO.As custom men will serve you and the women will take your money, haha.Check it out. 5
Everything about this place is AMAZING! The drinks, pizzas, and appetizers tasted great. Service was friendly and quick. The atmosphere and style of the restaurant was well designed and very comfy. Great happy hour specials too. Definitely worth eating there! 5
Had a difficult experience. The rooms were far from the lobby. Th design was shaped like a maze which required a map just to get to the lobby. It rained and there were one inch puddles in the walkway outside my door.  The staff was pleasant and tried to serve but often promised service that was not timely or never happened. Shuttles promised for transportation were often very late or full.  The bar offered food that was tasty. Two of the bellmen were excellent and sheltered us from the rain with umbrellas and a golf cart. Others tried but were exceedingly busy to offer promo service. Overall it was an effort just to survive this experience. Had I known I would have rented a car just to get to the lobby and to get to nearby areas without waiting. 1
Amazing carpet cleaning company!!!! I called HydroCare Services based on the amazing reviews and they are wonderful! I had two bedrooms that needed carpet cleaning. They hadn't been cleaned in 2 years since I moved in. Very soiled with pet against, dirt, you name it. They look brand new!! They were so nice on the phone, scheduled at my convenience and were within the time frame of arrival. They said between 8-10am and were there around 8:45am. Definitely highly recommend them!! 5
Very delicious food. The atmosphere was cozy. And service was very quick. This was my first time trying Ethiopian food and I have to say it won't be my last. 5
what I love about Costco is their great price, even on gas. This particular Costco is more toward business rather than the normal Costco, they do not have a photo center but do have printing/copying center. One other thing I keep forgetting whenever I come to Costco is that they don't not accept any other credit card beside amex. great place for wholesale and gas. 4
Not worth for $26.95/ppl all you can eat sushi! Very bad service,  food taste horrible and nasty, food is not fresh at all, oysters have weird smell. Sushi come with huge rice but little sashimi, they gave us food which is not we ordered. and not allow us to order what we want. seems like they are trying to save money and trick the customer. Never come ever again. Such a bad restaurant!! 1
Talk about getting ripped off. They charged us $420 for a shut off valve that costs $15. Once he realized that wasn't the problem he then found the line is clogged up and wanted to replace the whole line for over 7,000. So they first try to find small problems, charge you almost 500 then tell you its going to be 7000 dollars. No thank you. We called a family friend that took a look at it, he told us the exact problem areas and what had to be done. If you know people who do plumbing work, consider them first... Unless you want to get f@*#ed in the @$$ by rescue rooters. Seriously. Oh yeah i forgot to mention we called last night and set up an appointment and told us it would be sometime between 8am to 12 pm. They call us the next day asking the same questions and tell us we have to make an appointment. Once we told her we did, the night before with some one named Bryan, she then tells us no one named Bryan works there. Hmmm.. so I made him up and you magically got my number? She then called us back and said they are really busy and I will have to wait. So after all that I'm 420 dollars short and still have no water... Thank you rescue rooters. Don't waist your time...**just read other review and mentioned the worker smoking on the job, so was the guy who came to work on our place... Can we say unprofessional. They should train them to resist their cravings.****twitch r. Reviews complimented rescue rooters but bashed others for not having ROC licenses, only someone who works for ars would look for that. I sense a fake review. Goettl also tries making fake reviews to change potential customers minds to choose them. Nice try ARS workers. Your review doesn't even make sense.** 1
I only tried the original flavor which was the one of the best even the texture was perfect. Also,  good that it opens late. 4
The trampolines are fine overall the thing that sucked were the nachos , they were stale as *** the cheese wasn't even fully melted . & the icee machine wasn't even working . I paid almost 4 dollars for a couple stale chips and cold cheese , doesn't seem like a lot but I mean how can you possibly mess up nachos ? If they're going to be serving food this crappy might as well let us bring in our own food. 2
Tried it after reading all the raving reviews. There's no doubt, it's the cheapest Chinese I've come across in the East Valley. As far as flavor, far from the best. 2
This past week was only my third time playing in a tournament, so I have few points of reference (only the MGM if you must know). Right now the price is $125 for $8,000 in chips. As I said in my quick tip: comfy chairs. They also lean back quiet a ways too, that caught me by surprise.All of dealers were nice. All of them! They were professional and made small talk sometimes and happily greeted the regulars. I thought it was a good poker crowd. It seemed like everyone was there to enjoy themselves.My only con was I was at table 7, which was in the corner and we were constantly neglected by the cocktail waitress. I only wanted a water every now and then, but some people at our table were getting really irritated by the fact that she wouldn't come by. Our dealer had to yell at her at one point. Four hours later and with 18 out of 80 players left, another player and I went all in...I lost on the river, teehee. Good times though.Also, some well known players were there. That guy won 1.6 million last week? The big guy with the beard. He was one of them. IDK who he is, but a lot of the people at my table were excited to see him. That's all. 4
Pizza was okay,  I've had it cooked there, and I've taken it home to cook myself, I do appreciate the high quality ingredients.  However, the service is very slow, and the people who I've encountered working there are very young and unprofessional.  It's the little things like having very personal conversations within earshot of the customers, and wearing shorts so short you can see their bottoms hanging out, hair is not tied back, long fake nails...  Not really the people who I want to prepare my food.  I won't personally go back again, but I wouldn't stop a friend from trying it. 3
Warm atmosphere, smiling faces and cold beer!  Oh and a great menu with excellent food. Try the meatballs and the mignulata. Very delicious. Pizza choices include tasty standards like sausage (from local favorite DeFalco's) and more trendy tastes like fig and goat cheese. I wish it was closer to home. We would have our own permanent table! 5
You wouldn't think it looking at this place from the outside...or the inside, but it makes it's a pretty good Mexican restaurant.  I've tried a number of different Mexican restaurants in the city over the years and I'm usually a little disappointed.  Not in this case, Mi Tierra exceeded my expectations.I ordered the Tortilla Soup and the beef chimichanga.  Both were excellent choices.  Bottom line, Mi Tierra has friendly staff, generous portions, and quality food.  I'll definitely go back.  Oh, and did anyone catch the 'art' in the entry?  Painted old ATM.  Weird. 4
Went there for lunch and had all you can eat soup and salad.  My salads were not very tasteful and the soup was okay.  My friend ordered a pizza and that too was just okay.  The place is absolutely quaint and cozy but I like tasteful quality meals for a good value no matter how cute the place is.  They have wine and beer tastings that might be worth trying. 2
We had to wait an hour for mediocre food. The manager comped our drinks, but should've comped our whole meal. Won't be coming back here anytime soon. It's too bad because this was not our first time here. 2
I ordered my fiance a small, fall arrangement. It was supposed to be full of gerber daisies, with each one costing around $3. Therefore, I was told that for 7 gerber daisies, along with some other berries and filler flowers, the total would come to around $23. The arrangement showed up with TWO gerber daisies, pathetic looking fillers, and they charged me $35. I won't call here again. 1
Worst warranty company imaginable, simply out for your money.  Their "supervisor" Barney is in every way a crook and theft. Unlike legit warranty companies that will refund your money and pro rate the refund this comapny will take your money with a smile. 1
Very cool place..and concept.  I loved that I could play digital Connect Four at the bar while eating and drinking!It's not cheap by any means, but considering how big the rolls and sashimi is..it's well worth it.  What we ate there would have cost $200 in NYC so I considerate it a deal.Downside:  very packed and some of the staff were snobby.Upside:  The food outweighed the snobby staff..haha 4
Just food for when you get hungry. Don't expect much. In keeping with Mandalay bays high prices, you will be overpaying for everything you get. 2
Me and my two friends decided to try out this place because there were lots of good reviews about it. When we enter the resto at about 5pm, there were nobody in there except for a table of highschool girls almost done with their food. We decided to help ourselves and chose a table for the three of us. The server (some middle aged chinese guy) gave us the menu without saying anything. SERIOUSLY? Menu book looks good but the food is a little bit pricey like a deep fried chicken wings (5 wings only) for $6. So we ordered then it took them 30 mins to serve our food knowing that there's nobody in there except us. why sooo slow? I could've understand if there's other customers like us but really?? So both of my 2 friends got their order, finish eating them yet there I was waiting for my bbq ribs for an hour. I decided to ask the server for the follow up and he said he'll check it. Okay.After 15 mins, my friend told the other lady server about my food and she said it's coming.After 30 mins, still there was no sign of bbq ribs.After 45 mins, me and my friends decided to cancel the order and pay the bill.It took us 2 hours and a half staying in that place. Two hours waiting for the food, in total.I know the bbt is good but the wings and skewers? mehh. we've had the worst experience there. we even thought that they don't really care wasting their energy serving us with moderate customer service because they thought we were just some cheap college students. UGGHH, i was so furious. 1
I went to Bingo Monday's and had a great time with friends. The lamb sliders are AMAZING! Love the outdoor seating. I would definitely recommend this place if you need something fun to do on a Monday night. 4
I went to Rita to have my dress altered and it was an absolute nightmare.  Initially I was told that she would be able to fix the rouching on my dress and that "everything would be fine".  I went back into my next fitting and started to sob once I got my gown on.  Nothing fit right and everything that I asked to be done was done the opposite.  Were I needed it taken in, it was taken out and vice versa.  My perfect dress was ruined.  I brought up my concerns and was told to "just lose some weight and it'll fit fine".  Rude, illogical and poor business etiquette.  After bringing it home, I noticed that there were beading missing with over 5 that were critical to the design dress.  When I brought it back I was told that they were never there and she wouldn't have the beads, but she'll fix it.  I am confident that every bead was on that dress and not only me, but my bridesmaid, mother and individual that sold me my dress looked over the dress.  The only saving grace was that my grandmother flew in a few days early and is a seamstress.  She was appalled that I spent the money I did, only to have it ruined.  Don't waste your time with the run around! 1
I think Mundo is a great stop for Mexican food if you are in the area.  I've been there a number of times, the food, drinks and service are fine.  No complaints.  Would I make a special trip downtown to eat there?  Probably not.  If you are seeing a show at the Smith Center it is very convenient. 4
Had dinner here during.my stay. The waiters and waitstaff were a little everywhere. But the seafood platter was amazing. So delicious and good.selection. I also had the curry cauliflower soup and it was so flavorful. The shitios peppers were also delicious. I was disappointed with the beef wellington, for something they are.known for it lacked.flavor and was just ok. During my stay I also are at Craft Steak and it was so much better than Gordon's. 3
In the middle of the around-the-clock college party atmosphere in Oakland, this lounge is inside of a towering old church. It is very hard to miss with its unique style in the middle of Oakland. Once you walk in, you wait to be seated in the normal seating area, usually on cushions on the floor, or you wait to be seated in the indoor balcony above you. This balcony is known as the "VIP Lounge" and there's an extra $1 surcharge per person up there. It is very similar to the first floor, but there are 2-3 couches to sit on. The menu selection here is pretty great, but it is is actually very hard to sort through. The obscurity of the menu makes it hard to pick out what you'd like at you'll end up asking a lot of questions to your half-awake half-attentive waiter/waitress. You will also end up paying a lot more than you'd like. A 10oz milkshake will cost you $5 and a bottle of water is $2.50. This is to be expected, but I wan't thrilled that I paid $5 for three sips of an orange milkshake. The hookah is also very pricey. They make sure to charge you for everything they can. They divide their hookah flavors into three divisions- excellent, premium, and superior. Reading other reviews on here, I've heard they use a very good brand of hookah, but I believe this quirk on the menu is just to make people splurge and go the extra few bucks for the superior quality, even though the actual quality difference is debatable. They will also not hesitate to charge you for how many people you have, how many hoses you want (even though you already paid for smoking it), the juice to put in the bottom, and extra for ice. The service leaves much to be desired. I've been there on different days of the week and of course it's always busy on weekends. The service is OK at best during the week, but I feel trapped in there waiting for my check for 30 minutes every time I go there on a Friday or Saturday. I'm empathetic that it's probably not the employee's fault, but I would like to get about my night. My waiter usually ends up being an asshole, too. In conclusion, you're paying for the sweet building. The ambiance created by the old church, color-changing lights, cool african paintings and fabrics strewn about makes the place a cool hangout. However, the service, price, and quality of what you order leaves something to be desired. Definitely a place to check out once or twice, but don't make this a regular stop. 3
This is the best repair shop we have ever used. They are honest and do fantastic work. Jesus is very helpful and always great at communicating. They are a top notch shop. We will continue to have our vehicles serviced here. We have and will continue to recommend them to our friends and family. 5
We had the Chicken Bacon Avocado wrap that was stuffed full of chunks of chicken, crunchy bacon bits, some avocado and lots of lettuce and skin-on cucumbers chunks.  Next time I'll tell them to leave those off.  Kind of dry so needed more mayo that they supplied in packets.  The pesto chicken Cavatappi was delicious but small portion.  It  should include a side or at least a piece of bread. 4
This was the worst nail experience I have ever had.  I took off from work early to get a el manicure.  I arrived at 4:20 pm.   I was taken care of in very small increments of time- about 5 minutes each by different personnel.   Finally, at 5:20, I started to remove my previous gel manicure myself.   A lady had started to do so about 25 minutes prior, while filing and destroying my existing nails.   at about 5:35 pm, a gentleman came to finish my nails.   When we discussed the French option I had brought to the attention of his other colleagues earlier, he said he could not accommodate.   I decided to choose a solid color.   He brought me the color selection and left to attend to another customer.   15 minutes later, I was still sitting there.  I decided to leave, as I had another commitment at 6:00 pm.   I received no apologies-   You have other choices in regards to where you can go to get your nails done.   Please do not visit this establishment.  Your business is not appreciated .   The service was non existing and the whole experience was very unprofessional. You can spend your money better elsewhere. 1
Actually real Chinese food is far more delicious than those in Panda Express, those food in Panda is extremely oily. It tastes okay but remember its not real Chinese food. 3
Shattered iPad 2 fixed same day by Josh. Apple wanted to charge me $390 ship it and fix it and 3 to 5 days  of no iPad 2. Josh did it within 3 hours that day all for $151.  $390 or $151 the choice is yours.  Josh was very professional in his work and I am EXTREMELY pleased with the results. Before doing his work he specifically goes over with you any existing dents or scratches along the case edge that may cause problems with display replacement. I already had a couple of slight dents from previous falls.  He is upfront and honest in how the result will look.  Yes his store is sparse but I would use him again anytime. 5
Salty! I am not a person who puts a lot of salt on my food, but I do enjoy just the right amount, and a few of the tapas that I tried were a little too salty for me.  Despite the saltiness the tapas were good and the staff was friendly and attentive.  The restaurant itself was fun to hang out in, and the wine list did not disappoint. 4
The service was good, but we ordered strawberry margaritas and they didn't taste like they had any alcohol in them. 1
Ate the Jerk chicken for lunch. Good food at a great price. The beef patty appetizer was awesome. 4
Despite the fact this place is a 5 minute walk from our home I've probably only been inside once or twice.  It just never looked very clean to me.  Recently, my partner and I went for brunch on a Sunday.  I will admit the pancakes are delicious and that's exactly what I ordered.  Unfortunately, the young man who brought our plates to the table carried a plate of eggs on top of my blueberry pancakes - YUCK.  When I asked him to please take back my pancakes and explained why he assured me the bottom of plate had not touched my food, however, he was unable to explain how blueberry sauce managed to get all over the bottom of the plate of eggs.  He took the dish back to the kitchen and I watched as he told the "cook" what happened.  The cook appeared to laugh and share the story with several others behind the counter (apparently oblivious to the fact that the "kitchen" is open and in plain view of the diners.)  The cook then put a glove on and used his hand to scrape off the blueberries and put new new blueberries on the same pancakes.  The server brought my "new" pancakes back and I promptly sent them back.  In all fairness, our original server did not know anything about this and she apologized and offered to bring me another meal.  Needless to say, we both had lost our appetites. I knew there was a reason I didn't eat here... 2
HOTEL FRAUD! TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! STAY AWAY!I had my hotel booked for me by another person; when it was booked my name was misspelled. (Spelled Darin with a B). I called the hotel to confirm that I had a reservation, while driving to Vegas, and I was told that they couldn't find it. I quickly booked another room so I had a place to stay. When I arrived we figured out the missed spelling and my original reservation was found... When I tried to cancel the duplicate night and very unfriendly lady informed me that it couldn't be done because I should have known about the original reservation... I explained the mistake with my misspelled name and I was told it was my fault because I should have known about the reservation.... They double billed me for one night... My mind was blown! I have never experienced something like this in my life..STAY AWAY!!!!! 1
Came here with a Groupon and I dunno if the food quality is different.  Was given a special menu to pose from 8 different teas.  The teas were good.  But was never offered additional water to top up my teapot. Food was substandard even with Groupon price.  I found the food to be creative  the taste and quality is seriously lacking.  2 star for food 1 star for the service. 3
A waste of an 1.5 hours. Jeff set an appointment with me, and said 11 percent down is required. 5 minutes later Ryan called me and said he was taking over the sale. From the moment I sat down games were being played "behind the scenes". After over an hour a manager came out and said 30-40% down. Really? For that much I could go buy a year older model with a few more miles on it outright and no one would know the difference.  They are only concerned with milking hard workers and whoever is associated with the games should be fired or restructured 1
A bit overpriced and the customer service isn't the greatest - a little on the detached, frosty-side.  But, the enchiladas are amazing - the main reason we keep going back. 3
Well, their shuttle driver crashed into my car (Toyota Prius) while stopped at a red light and caused $6K in damage. I am giving them 2 stars because they fixed the damages and gave me a rental to use. But it took 2 weeks to fix..meanwhile I wasted so much money on the Chevy that just guzzled down on gas. They were shady and didn't want to go through insurance. The paint job they did is already fading off (2 months later) and they never fixed the alignment, simple things that should be checked and taken care of when they deal with cars for a living. I would never buy a car from here just because they sell Chevys and I don't waste my money on those... 2
Meh. I've never met a stone crab I didn't like...until tonight everything on the menu tasted half-frozen even though we are in stone crab season. Best dish of the night was the crispy brussel sprouts. Now when you're at Joe's this should be considered a problem. Staff was nice enough but i came here to get my seasonal stone crab on, not to discuss why Vegas doesn't sell powerball tickets. Anyhow. I've finally solved the mystery. The reason why this is not up to par with Joe's is this is NOT Joe's. They license the name and use the same vendors. Think Donald Trump and how his name was licensed up the yazoo a decade ago...when he was bankrupt. Not during the current Presidential campaign. Yup. 3 stars is generous for this evening's meal. 3
My friend and I went to the show and absolutely loved it. I was not familiar with Matt Franco before the show and never thought of myself as a person who enjoys magic shows. Matt shares his story which is inspiring and reminds us that dreams do come true. His tricks were very entertaining and we laughed a lot. Thanks Matt for a great night out! 5
Went at 4:00 on a Friday afternoon. We had two little girls with us and the bartender was great, got them lemonade and cookies and popcorn.  I had a great ale, while my compadres had a flight of red wine and a flight of white wine. Prices are ok, with a special of buy a flight get a flight for half off. $22 for a flight with some pretty tasty wine from Macedonia (although not all were great). Excellent atmosphere and a good crowd. Even thought the prices are a bit high compared to other happy hours we will go back.  This would be a great place for later in the evening.  Just beer and wine and a very limited food menu. 4
Great hotel, even if you are not staying there. I loved the drink service that we got. We were able to sit next to the pool. The roof was not open, which was the main reason we went but just haning out there was great! 4
There was a hair in my shawarma wrap.  Black and about an inch (I have long blond hair).   I showed the owner (man in his late 50s or early 60s with glasses) and he took it over the counter and pulled it off and wiped it on his apron and put the sandwich back and denied there was a hair.  I said he wiped it off and he started yelling saying eat your sandwich and you're not getting your money back.  Only after me waiting for 2 min as I had only ate two bites he basically threw it in my hands and yelled at me to get out.  What a horrible person.  I do NOT recommend this place.  It was cheap but the two bites I had weren't very good and the owner is horrible. 1
Nice office, a good place if you're looking for fast food style service. It's fast and efficient, except for when you have a problem with billing.  I am still waiting for them to fix an issue from six months ago with billing codes so I don't have to pay $300 for preventative services covered by my insurance. Now I have to submit a claim with my insurance which is going to take even more of my time and energy. I feel like a number going in and out of this place. Women's issues are sensitive and should be handled as such but apparently they're more concerned with the business aspect. An example, I just had a visit where they basically gave me information I could have learned from a website or over the phone. They just wanted to get me in office so they could bill for a simple 5 minute consultation. They costed me about $60 in hours missed at work plus my $20 copay and the cost of insurance. I'm quitting this place. 1
While this location occasionally has its issues, they're overall pretty fast. They do my typical chai latte order without messing up, and I enjoy the plentiful seating space for meeting people over coffee. 4
The only reason I rated this place one star at all because the waitress was so sweet. She was very nice. But the food... was greasy and gross. I am very dissatisified. I have the grilled cheese which appears to have been made with wonderbread and kraft chese, with grease coated fries. Everything is fried and hard to swallow. No sodas (which did not bother me because I do not like soda, but it is unusual) , and no milk/lemonade, and you are served in plastic cups... I come for good food and a nice resturaunt experience. Only plus is the waitresses are darlings... Do. Not. Eat. Here. If. You. Love. Your. Body. 1
I food was okay and so was the price. I guess you just have to deal with certain people that go there to eat. I had to listen to a psychotic teenage with an "amazing personality" drone on and on about the many people that had crushes on her LOL. So it got pretty annoying really fast. I would say it's a safe place to eat ramen. I would prefer going right upstairs to ichiza, but that's just me. 3
Nearly everything about this place is perfect - I love the high quality of the produce, the uniqueness of their health & beauty area, THE BULK BINS, the constant introduction of new items and willingness to order former ones... I could go on all day. They are out of my budget for full grocery shopping, but a fun regular stop for special treats and items I can't buy (vegan choc chip cookies) or won't buy (cilantro, green onions) at Woodmans (srsly woodman's cilantro is practically composted, gross). However, and what I'm docking a star for, is the inconsistent level of service from the staff. Some people are terrific and so willing to stop and see if you need help, or are just generally pleasant - especially the folks working the front desk, bulk, deli/juice bar areas. Others - almost always cashiers - seem so bothered to be there! Sorry I'm buying stuff, sorry I said Hi and asked how your day was going, sorry I said sure I'll CHIP and yes I'd like a receipt, sorry I forgot and left the unused fork and napkin on top of my box of hot food when I put it on the belt and you had to ask me to remove it. SORRY, ok??? Stop glaring at me, stop wrinkling your nose at what I'm buying, stop rolling your eyes when everything doesn't fit into my cloth bag and I have to ask for a paper one. I still love the stores, I will continue to shop there forever, but I do hope that they'll either hire friendlier cashiers or add in some self-check lanes. 4
Service was super quick and food was so delicious and healthy. What more can you ask for? I'd come back any day. 5
Bought a house that this company had flipped. I'm leaving this review because we purchased a home in which Mitco Remodeling and Renovation was in charge of remodeling. Upon first look things look good, but when you get in to the detail, you realize the issues. The biggest issues we've faced since the purchase of our home was the fact that they brought in unlicensed contractors to do our electrical and plumbing. This left us with a mess. After some back and forth, an electrician came in to fix our electrical the RIGHT way. I've also had to go back in and reinstall our toilets as all 3 have leaked. Cole was supposed to come back out to fix our walls and ceilings. While he came out to start, he then vanished, leaving our walls and ceilings unfinished. He states that he's been around the trade his entire life, but he had stated to me that his father was in the science field. It was also his father that was taking vent blower units that were meant to be plugged in and cutting the plug head off of them and hard-wiring them in, which is not at all up to electrical code. 1
I love how this spray tan looks in person, and how it photographs! Beautiful and natural finish every time. Chelsea is super sweet, quick, and professional! She always makes sure that I am happy with my tan before I leave. When the tan eventually fades and comes off, I never have problems with weird patches or pigmentation. I love how I turn into a bronzed babe in 15-20 mins and feel good knowing that it is all organic. 5
So, my husband and I earned a free meal at this restaurant after playing the slot machine and decided to try it out. Initally when we first entered the place, there was no hostess and no one acknowledged that we were there, we waited about 5 minutes. Once we were seated, it took the waiter about 10 minutes to come to our table. We ordered an appetizer and our food at the same time, it took about 20 minutes for the appetizer to come out and our food took an additional 20 minutes to come out. When we first arrived it was close to 3pm and it was not busy. The waiter never refilled our drinks or checked if we needed anything. After asking for the dessert menu, it took 10 minutes for us to receive that and once we asked for the bill, it took an additional 10-15 minutes. People that came in after us received their food and service faster than we did. This may have to do with us having a free meal or some other reason. The food we actually did enjoy but don't think we will be returning to this restaurant. 3
I'm a regular at TJ The tasting table is the best I baked like a pastry chef from one of their recommendations this evening. Get the crescent rolls roll them out add 4-8  of there semi sweet chocolate chips roll them and bake for 13 mins. Top with their amazing  peanut butter cream cheese and call 911 cause you can't eat just one!The staff is truly amazing and always goes out of their way to help .The pre made food is really good,Chicken Lasagna ,Turkey Meat Balls,and Panko breaded Tilapia  are always in my freezer.Don't forget the sweet tooth JoJos Ice Cream and these wicked peanut butter goodies will pick ya right upDollar for Dollar you can't go wrong and if anything I save more money shopping there then any place elseGreen Valley location is the best of them all! 5
I asked to get the sleeves of my nice wool coat taken out.  I paid $30, which is not that cheap for this kind of work. The work was so sloppy that the hemming started falling apart as soon as I got home and I also noticed a hole in the pocket that wasn't there when I had dropped my coat off. Honestly, the work was a hack-job. If you have any really nice/expensive items of clothing, do NOT take it here or you risk having to get the work re-done elsewhere. Really disappointed with the services after having read such positive reviews. 1
i love lush but had a bad experience with an employee. she was not helpful and seemed to be spacing out when i would talk to her. thankfully everyone else was great and helped me find some gifts. the mandalay bay location has a more informed staff and much larger location. 3
It's not real hawaii poke. Totally different! It's just salad like Hawaii poke stlyle. Just Good salad. 3
Bad cheessteak. Dry bread. The meat looked funny and dry too. Tasted below average. Won't be rushing back anytime soon. 2
Sat upstairs for a business lunch meeting. Staff were friendly and attentive however they over do the 'is everything going ok' pitch. Staffers, please take notice to your patrons and lunch meeting dynamics. Meal was reasonably ok. My Salmon was alright but the veggies were soggy and seemed to have been sitting in a heat tray for quite some time -definitely not fresh.   Other than that, an ok place to visit. 3
What a joke. The nurse that checks everyone in had the personality of a door nob and a real stick up her ass. Had an appt and still had to wait over an hour. The other southwest medical clinics are a lot nicer and the staff much more professional, I would recommend a farther drive than to come to this ghetto Walmart location. 1
It's definitely a small little hidden spot in Mississauga to take pictures and explore. I find that it needs a little more maintenance as the upkeep has been lacking over the years. If you're in the area then sure, but I would make more of an effort to go to lakeshore area or high park.Hope this helps!-jT 2
This place is fantastic.  I came in today to send my Christmas gifts and Samantha was so helpful.  This time of year can be very stressful.  Samantha made it so easy and was able to send all my gifts in one box.  I really appreciate the wonderful service! 5
I've been here on several occasions. The food is always so yummy. I like to get The Over Easy. So flavorful. The french toast is amazing (both versions), and to top it all off, they have FRESH SQUEEZED OJ!! Omg. I love fresh juice (This also makes for excellent mimosas). The ambiance is nice and casual. They play great music and if you can avoid their busy hour, the wait is never long. I've felt unsure about the service in the past, but had a great experience the last time. Wish I could remember the servers name, but he was very attentive. Overall, definitely recommend for breakfast/brunch 4
The setup looks good but the food was okayish , actually a little over priced. 2
Love frozen yogurt but the ac is never on inside the shop so my yogurt melts before I finish...turn the ac on! Anyways besides the ac that they don't want to turn on the yogurt is okay, seems like the toppings are more sweet candies or sweet everything. They do have some fruit but not fresh! 3
Terrible store. Had a ridiculously bad customer service and food experience, they never bothered to even respond to my complaint. Will never be back. 1
Favourite place!!! no bullshit, all the cakes and sandwiches are amazing, and their whole whey bread is the best i ever had, now have to eat them every single morning.The girls work in day shit are kinds of bitch... love the ppl who works in the night, always give me half price off if I go there before they close. 4
Their nachos are my favourite and possibly one of the best in town! I've even requested BBQ sauce in the side as an extra dip. The price for the huge plate is a great value :):) But this is probably the only thing I like there, with an iceberg beer.The poutines were awful (I had it a year ago and never ordered it again) Hope this helps!-jT 2
This place is A-Ok...hence the 3 stars.  Not my favorite but not something to avoid either.  The sliders were tasty when ordered with everything on it.  They were larger then I expected.  The chili dog was decent.  The chili was a bit sweeter then I would have liked.  The fries were also decent.  One of the let downs- no Chicago dog...that's right no Chicago dog on the menu of a Chicago hamburger joint with floor to ceiling Chicago memorabilia.  They had a whole list of other hot dogs so it was bit of a let down.  The place felt a little dusty but I think they meant for it to feel like an old diner.  The customer service was excellent and I think I would be open to trying a few other items on the menu.  I would return just not too often. 3
Stopped in here for the fight after a brief trip to see a friend living in the area and the first person I see when I walk in is the beautiful and sweet Monica, she's our favorite. Only alright place for food. The classic nachos were okay, I wasn't a fan. The service was subpar. We had to wave down our server a couple of times. Girls are too focused on flirting with the men at the bar then actually doing their job. I'll be back! 3
The waffle was thick but not crispy - I wish I asked him to leave it on there for another minute. There are other flavours (cinnamon, maple, strawberry) but I don't see myself returning anytime soon...especially since Marbleslab's dark chocolate ice cream is just across the street. 1
I wish I could write a 5 star review as I see the potential in Christa's business. I came across her through facebook where she was running a special on eyelash extensions. I texted her and she booked me an appointment within 24 hours. Now most people can certainly appreciate a next day appointment, however you may become less excited if you are seen almost 45 minutes after your set time. I would not have minded being scheduled for another day as long as I would be seen at the time I was given. I was not offered an apology or anything of the like. I'm not big on first impressions but I do expect a certain level of professionalism or at least common courtesy as a new client. I was not informed in any manner that she was running late and I had another appointment right after her. When I was taken into the room she took about 10 minutes to set up (not bad at all) but then the lack of professionalism again became an issue. She was having a full on conversation about her boyfriend with her co-worker. This while her co-worker was working on a client of her own as well. Now this is is a small area where you are seen. The size of the room is a bit smaller than a doctor's exam room. There are two massage tables in there and one is for clients getting their eyebrows done and the other is for Christa's eyelash clients. I did not experience any pain whatsoever, was very relieved at how swiftly she worked and was pleased with my results. I was just uncomfortable that she would refer about other clients in a tasteless manner. For example, telling her co-worker how she was "annoyed" and how "some clients don't get it" when asking for certain results. Then the comments made about how she needed to be satisfied sexually or she would not be wasting her time. So that went on for about 40 minutes or so. I paid $65 for the service and gave her a $12 tip. Needless to say I had to cancel my appointment after her on short notice. Even with that incident, I decided to schedule with her again to have my eyelashes filled. I was yet again given an appointment within 24 hours of contacting her. However. . . I show up and to my surprise was not seen on time yet AGAIN! I waited in the lobby for 45 minutes hoping that she may text me to let me know she was late, on her way or still working on a client. Anything! I mean any reason at all, I would not have minded waiting the full hour if I was guaranteed to be seen. I texted her that I had left right outside of the parking lot hoping she may offer another time to return to make up the wait. Nope, not at all. I found her work ethic to be dubious. She is good at what she does, but needs to work on her customer service skills. Just awful! If she thinks she's to good to respond or contact her clients for resolution on such matters imagine if her business were to grow to an actual salon. Whew!! I mean don't double book if you can't keep up, maintain your private conversations for your lunch break and sweet baby jeebus keep your clients informed of any changes that will directly affect them. Our time is just as valuable too you know, thanks! 3 stars overall, 0 for customer service. 3
Great Mexican place in downtown Madison just off State Street. This place strikes you as very authentic (perhaps it was something about the luchador fights on TV in the restaurant with the Spanish commentary).Food was awesome. Had tostadas and gorditas which were both fantastic (chorizo, steak, pastor (pork) - can't go wrong!). You can buy individual tostadas or gorditas for $3.50/$3 each though there are lots more options. Also had this amazing drink that was like milk with cinnamon toast crunch flavoring. Definitely check that out. 5
Overly aggressive sales pitch to buy detailing package. Mediocre car wash. My bad for ignoring the two-star review. 2
As a pizza enthusiast, I was really looking forward to trying the trendy flavors this restaurant offers. Unfortunately, the pizza fell somewhat short in comparison to other pizza venues around town. Not only was the pizza a little pricy, but I felt as though it lacked the unique flavors described on the menu. On a different note, the service was absolutely wonderful. Our waiter was constantly checking up on us and even gave us free drinks when someone from outside accidentally threw a cigarette butt into my water glass. 3
This shop is prime for college students looking for cheep costumes or themed party attire! The owner and employees are very sweet and helpful. I found designers bags and clothes for super cheap and in good condition. I would recommend anyone that is in need of a quick costume idea to check out this store. It is a bit small but since it just opened there are a lot of good things to pick from, you just have to look! 4
I used to get delivery from here all the time when I lived in the dorm rooms at UNCC without a car. It was basically my only Chinese option since not a lot of places in that area have delivery. The rice here is REALLY dry and always tastes more than a day old. Besides the rice, the food is alright. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's average. The chicken wings are prob the best thing I've had from this place. Or any place actually. Sesame tofu and sesame chicken is ok but the sesame tofu tastes better. The lo mein is extra greasy but very tasty. If you call to order your food, the lady might sound rude and have a hard time understanding you. But after meeting her in person, she's really sweet and understands me very well. She's just not a phone person so don't be put off when you first talk to her on the phone. 3
excellent offbeat sandwiches and original home made soup.i never thought cream cheese could be used in so many different ways, with so many different accompanying flavors. i was VERY skeptical when i first saw the menu, but have been more than satisfied with everything i've ever ordered here.there is a great backyard patio which is open during the summers. best of all, this place is a stone's through from the mountain, and we all know that nature + tasty sandwich = best thing ever. 5
Good concept, way over priced for a very limited small menu. I was hoping we'd find a new it place to go but this place is just mehhhhh. We'd still drive all way to Easy Life or Sp Mtn. 2
I  like this store, I am not much of a thrift store person but I like the vintage stuff in this store, some stuff is overpriced, some is under.. but I like it. 4
Summary: ok pizza, may not get deliveryWe have used this place twice. The pizza deserves 3 stars. It is ok. Not bad, not that great. The delivery service the first time was ok as well. However, the second time they didn't have anyone to deliver my pizza for 3 hours, so I had to go pick it up. 3
Literally the slowest place I've ever been...the service was slow and horrible...won't be back 1
We have been going here since we moved to Gilbert in 2004 and while they aren't as good as they were then, and they have lots more competition than they used to, Teaks still does pretty darn good.  We have even used them for catering a couple times and it was awesome!They have some interesting items like the Alamo Chipotle Burger, Open the Hatch and Candlestick Carver as well as great wings and new food specials daily.  Prices are similar to all the others but more original food than the chains.Don't forget the free peanuts whose shells are simply dumped on the floor.Did I mention GREAT service and a lot of choices for your favorite beverage. Ans lots of TVs for your sports viewing pleasure.  You get a big mix in the crowd from old time Gilbert cowboys, families, couples and sports teams. 3
Decided to give this new restaurant a try since this was just a few of the restaurants that were actually open for the grand openining of Downtown Summerlin. Sorry to say that my boyfriend and I were not impressed. The quality of food was something I would expect from Applebee's but with a 75% mark up in their prices. We started off with the Aloha roll and the Pork Belly Sliders. The roll it wasn't anything special but for $15 I was expecting more and the sliders came on some hawaiian roll bread, it was just ok. My boyfriend ordered a their signature Crave burger, the meat patty was a bit dry and the fries were soggy. I ordered turkey BLT and I got somewhat of a flat bread sandwich, kind of threw me off. The smell of the bread was too dough-y, wasn't very pleasant.In conclusion, we left dissapointed and unsatisfied. Probably won't be coming back. 2
Came here specifically so the bf can eat the dry aged NY sirloin. We first heard about dry aged beef on food network, and were intrigued by the aging process. Last summer, while strolling by NY NY on the last day of our vegas trip, we walked by Gallagher's. Unfortunately at that time, we didn't have time to try their steak and the bf left vegas disappointed. For the holidays, we trekked back to vegas...and a part of me thinks we went back to vegas to satisfy my bf's intrigue of the dry aged NY sirloin. So to appease the bf, we went here. He of course had the NY sirloin, and I had the filet mignon.  And to give Gallagher's credit...the NY sirloin was yummy, but it didn't taste that much different than a wet aged piece-o-meat. The filet was small but cooked to perfection. Overall, very enjoyable. However 4
I was a walk in for an eyebrow waxing.  Place was clean.  I didn't have to wait, but the lady who did the waxing stopped in the middle of doing a manicure? with another lady.  I think this made her do a rush job.  If not, then she is just not very good at eyebrow waxing.  When I got home, I still had wax on me.  My right eyebrow is thinner with a high arch.  My left is thicker with no arch.   I have never had an uneven job like this before.  Had to fix it myself.  I am not a happy camper right now.  Ugh. 2
I  am neither a family friend or a relative of any of the employees. I have used this company several times and have always had excellent service. Jesse was our tech today and he could not of been any more helpful. All the times I have used this company I have never felt as if they were pushing something on me to buy or repair that didn't need it. Also, my parents who are elderly had an issue with their furnace last winter. As always you  got to worry about people taking advantage of seniors on stuff like this. . I did not have this concern when I suggested they used this company. They treated them very well and did not take advantage of them one bit. They were extremely happy as was I. 5
I've been to this location so often over the years they should name a seat after me. The food used to be good, now is just "okay". Same with the waitress staff.. at least as of 6 months ago. I got tired of the "old-bag" routine from a couple of them and haven't been back. (they sure showed me) I think there should be an age, or at least attitude limit.. seriously. Like the Beachwood location, they need to cut the old grumpy wood.Also, it'd be nice to see "healthier" breakfast alternatives. And no I don't mean Tofu and bean curd. Like organic eggs, real butter, decent fruit, avocado, etc.Place used to be "fun". Friendly (and kinda HOT) waitresses, decent (and HOT) food, nice location. Anymore it's just "blah". They need to go back to basics.And open the freaking blinds already! Egads let some light in that place. It's like they're vampires in there. Heck, maybe they ARE! 3
worst place I ever stayed at. the hot tub was dirty. while i tried running the water and turning on the wirl pool, somthing was wrong with it. after turning it off and on a few times, it finally work but hair came out shooting from the pipes. I called front desk and ask if we could move to a different room but they rejected our request and instead suggested to have someone come up and clean it. idk about you but I don't really don't like people coming to the room after I settled in. I denied their request but they still had a  nice lady came up and ask to clean it but I said it was fine and not to worrie since my 3 year old was napping at the time. Not only was the hot tub disgusting but the toilet seat were also. looks clean but after lifting the seat up to help my son use the bathroom was more disgusting. I'm not even go to say what I saw but you can only imagine!!! never coming here again!! 1
Surely no one ever wants to have to put their pet down, but when that inevitable time comes, it's supremely comforting to know that there are veterinarians like Dr. Carrie who provide compassionate and thorough care.  My cat has been on a slow decline for about a year now.  I always felt I'd know when he would be ready to pass on, but it didn't make the decision easy by any means.  From the moment we walked through the door, Dr. Carrie and her assistant made me feel calm and helped assuage the guilt associated with putting down your beloved pet.  Her calm, pleasant and extremely caring nature helped make the whole process much easier to deal with.  It's clear that she cares as much about the human clients as she does the animals.I hope it's a long time before we meet again, but in the meantime I hope this review helps others to find a peaceful and caring way to end their pet's suffering.  Thank you so much. 5
Buyer Beware!  I purchased a used vehicle from Moore a couple years back and paid for an extended warranty.  I have had only a couple minor problems with the vehicle but every time it goes in to the shop they slap a band aid on in and send me on my way. Then I am inconvenienced into coming back again to have it corrected. One time I even had to pay the 100 copay that is supposed to be waved if I bring it to their dealership because they claimed their was nothing wrong with the vehicle.  To top it off when my car was returned the change that I keep in my cup holder was missing. Maybe a couple bucks but its the point. These people are shady. Anytime I speak with anyone they are extremely short and convey an attitude that they just don't care.  It's very frustrating and terrible customer service is a deal breaker for me! 1
I went 2 weeks ago on a Saturday; I've been to Sushi 168 'pre' and 'post' renovation, and over time the quality has substantially diminished. They've become busier, and as a result, they've stopped making (or giving off the appearance that their food is made) to order. I believe that's the biggest mistake a restaurant can make - feed more customers at the expense of quality and freshness.The food came out quickly...a little too quickly, suggesting that the restaurant simply wants to turn tables as quickly as possible. The hot foods came out cold, and did not look or taste fresh. They should hire more sushi chefs to do things right, and make food to order, rather than churn out a lot of rolls at once, that are left sitting there until they're ordered. It's backwards management and a symptom of greed in my opinion.You can find better elsewhere, unfortunately Mississauga doesn't have much, so this restaurant has succeeded in attracting customers for the time being. Go elsewhere...the service and quality will be a lot better. It's worth the drive to Toronto or further east for better quality AYCE. 2
Went there for Valentine's Day, they just had the Valentine's Day menu which was $60 per person, but there was no mention of a fixed price menu on their website or when we made the reservation. My dad is from the Middle East so I grew up eating this type of food; the food at the restaurant was not good at all. On top of that, the receptionist was very rude, we overheard several people complaining about having a fixed price menu and not having been told about it when making a reservation. The receptionist just told them (very rudely) that they were supposed to know because it's Valentine's Day. I would not recommend this restaurant at all, the food wasn't good, it was expensive, and the service was horrible. 1
This review isn't about the food, which is mostly excellent based on the two times that I've been previously. I tried to go tonight for takeout and was told that I would have to wait in the long line for people actually sitting at the restaurant to order my food because I hadn't called ahead. It's beyond preposterous to make people wait all that time simply to order takeout. I've never heard of this happening at other restaurants. On top of that the employee was brusque and even a little bit rude. I understand that places like this restaurant are really popular and as a result the staff often get overworked, but this policy doesn't make any sense. If you're going to prevent walk up customers from ordering takeout at the restaurant itself in a timely manner, then you shouldn't offer takeout any longer. And if your staff are overworked and having to stay late every night (as other posters have mentioned), maybe you should adjust the closing time accordingly. 1
I get take out fried chicken from here all the time. The chicken is delicious and comes in a cute take out box which include pickled radishes and a drink 4
I couldn't be happier with the service from AZ Handiman! Tom and his team are amazing! We are selling our home and we needed electrical service done. We were afraid of what the cost would be, but it turned out to be under what we thought. Everything was fixed in a timely matter and totally to our satisfaction. I would definitely recommend AZ Handiman to my family and friends without a doubt. 5
This wasn't my favorite place, but it might be better for someone else. I guess give it a try... 3
Staff was nice, it was packed, and there was good music, but our actual hookah was supposed to be margarita flavored, and it came with no taste, I was with two friends, so we ordered three hoses, mine didn't work, so I asked a staff member to fix it, and they tried but it still continued to not work. Finally right before we left, the people who were cramped up next to us fixed my hose, and I still had to pay full price, which was kind of expensive. This place isn't too bad, it has potential, I'll be back. 3
Normal diner setting.  Prepare for a long wait if you come around normal busy hours.  Long island iced tea was great!  Nice cheap meal compared to everything else you'll find in Mandalay Bay. 4
First of all great guys. Nathan always does a great job and is very personable and friendly. I'm a little disappointed this go around with my RV sealing. Quality is great but somehow the pricing went up from $15 to $20 per foot. This is the third time I've used them and they do nice work. Taking my price from $450 to $600 however may cause me to shop around next time. 3
Great teachers, amazing staff and a very clean studio! Aimee was incredibly helpful with getting me started and am looking forward to practicing with them in the future. I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking to develop a consistent yoga practice based around strength and community. 5
Stumbled across this spot while out in AZ on vacation.  Went on a Saturday night and they had a live band that was off the chain.  The lounge was nice and the service was great.  We danced until the spot closed at 2. We also met the manager and he  gave us access to a back room lounge.  (Good looking out)  Next time I'm in Scottsdale I will definitely be stopping through.  Not just for the music and atmosphere but during my 5 days in Scottsdale it was the first time I actually saw a bunch of people that looked like me  (Finally)  Go check it out you'll have a great time! 5
I've worked for several vet clinics over the years in 3 different states so when I go into a clinic with my own dogs now that I no longer work for a vet I have a list of criteria Im always "hoping" is achieved.1. Cleanliness - my first impression is that they actually look the time and effort to fully decorate the facility and have managed to maintain the aesthetics dispite urine and feces daily, im sure. I noticed clever and cool details like paw prints in the ceiling tiles as well as the decals for the exam rooms and candy for the owners.Professionalism - from my initial phone call to reception to the vet and checkout, you guys rocked it.Knowledge - dr. Zimmerman is awesome, she knows her stuff and I appreciated the fact that she didn't insult my medical intelligence. She also followed thru with calling me with test results, something I have found rare in Vegas.I really appreciated that no one was afraid of my dogs breed or that we were treated like thugs because of it.The prices are competitive and I have found my new vet clinic, thank god!Keep up the great work!Thanks so much,Love Glass, Glynis, Starla and Zero Roades 5
There is a God after all. A butter God, or a pastry God perhaps.The name does not lie. It is no exaggeration, nor a coincidence. I couldn't think of a more appropriate and deserving name for this bakery. They live up to their moniker. Crazy desserts indeed.I thankfully don't live in the same city, let alone the same province as this patisserie. I'd without a doubt be morbidly obese and broke. I won't even try to cover up the stories portraying the depth of my fatassness and affinity for baked goods, ESPECIALLY ALMOND CROISSANTS. I have, on more than one occasion traveled 7 hours ( between work shifts), JUST to get their croissants. Pitiful and hopeless, trust me, I know. But if you too tried their croissant-aux-amandes-et-chocolat, you'd more than just understand, you'd be committing the same abhorrent actions as I. You can't but capitulate to the yearnings of your stomach sometimes, and it cries shamelessly for fous desserts and Mamie clafoutis. The only two I approve of, out of the tens and thousands I've entertained in Montreal. They offer THE FATTEST CROISSANTS I've ever had, TRUST ME when I say: I've eaten more croissants than the breaths I took in my lifetime. They're not the largest, just the fattest. They sprinkle a GENEROUS helping of almond slices on the croissants, and load it with their almond filling, which resembles a custard more than a paste, and they use untempered milk chocolate opposed to the typical tempered dark/semi-sweet chocolates....so it's not only sweeter and milkier, but it is smoother and malleable. Like buttta!They also have a chocolatier in the back teasing the patrons with his bucket of couverture chocolate. I sat there gobbling down my third treat staring him down like his hands might've been fourth.If you love almond croissants, this is a must! It's more of a dessert as it is much sweeter, but it's a twist on the classic you neeeeeed to try. 5
Was craving Molcajete and decided to try this place. It was alright I guess. The beef was overcooked and tough. The salsa it was in was mediocre. Service was less than satisfactory also. 3
Stayed here for two nights while in Toronto and it wasn't the best. No free wifi for the price we were paying. The beds were so small (two bedroom). The location is nice and the staff were kind, but the rooms themselves were eh. The bathrooms felt gross to me. Lighting was bad. There was no mini fridge nor microwave in our room also. I would be back for the location, but not the price and quality of rooms. 3
Let me first say that my last review happened about a year ago and I wrote a review but accidentally never posted it. As soon as I realized this I posted. Dave Gordon called me and emailed within the next few days to apologize about my experience.  I had explained to him about the post and that this actually occurred almost a year ago. He said regardless it was still an experience I had and he wanted to make it right and he did! I really appreciate that. I really respect a manager who truly cares about his customers. I would definitely return do to the fact that they care about their customer satisfaction. He asked me to give him a call the next time I go back so he can make sure our next experience is an amazing one. I will definitely take him up on that! 4
I got the lunchtime soup/salad combo. It was pretty good, especially the soup, and there was lots of filling stuff in there, but it wasn't quite enough food for me. If I go back I'll get something a bit bigger. 4
Not a fan.  I am a huge breakfast fan and the food here is so so, at best.   Don't waste your money. 2
I was looking to try out someplace new for a Saturday night dinner and Banana Blossom was excellent. The menu has a vegetarian section and you have the ability to substitute tofu into any dish. Food was delicious and quite spicy - which is what I want from a Thai restaurant. Dishes were also garnished with carrots folded into butterflies which always makes me happy. The service was very attentive even on a busy Saturday night. I liked the bright decor and cozy size. Be sure and get reservations as the dining room is small. I'll be returning for sure. 4
Now let me start off by saying my family and I are very open to different foods. But I can honestly say we are all in agreement in that this was the WORST food we had ever had!!! I cannot remember having a meal as bad at this from the food to service. We came to find ourselves at this restaurant during a trip to Montreal. After a long day of biking and sightseeing we were looking forward to a nice ethnic dinner and after seeing the reviews we assumed this would be the place. We were sorely mistaken. First the service was horrible we waited ten minutes for water. Water that was room temperature, no ice at all. Then we had to wait another ten minutes for our order to be taken an order that was completely wrong. The owner did say his waitress was on vacation but quite honestly it was his waitress, cook and his manners and hospitality. The first thing we ordered Baba Ghanouj came out as the salad mix an error he made from not writing it down. This salad mix was horrible the vegetables were so vinegary they were inedible and spit out immediately. The baba ghanouj and tahini that came with it were equally as bad. The pita that came with it was straight from a bag not even heated. And it tasted like paper. At this point we should have left.Then the entrees appeared and not at once. First the koshary. The chickpeas were undercooked and hard  and overall flavors were not there at all I barely ate 5 bites. Our other entrees include Molokhya which was dry and tasted like it was cooked in a microwave. And two orders of fetat Shawarma which there is nothing to say about but that it was awful. When he came back to clear our plates and saw our food was hardly touched. We told him we did not like it. Yet unlike at any other restraurant with courteous service he did not offer to comp us or ask if we want something else but instead made us pay the way overpriced total for the horrible food. Now I'm not the type to ask for free things but I honestly feel cheated. This was the worse food of my life.SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE ANYWHERE ELSE. I signed up for Yelp just to post this review. I feel that passionately about this place. If it was possible to give 0 stars I would 1
we have been here 3 times and it has progressively gone downhill. the service sucks. if you want to be ignored in an empty bar, this is your place! the bartender was downright surly and rude and was as ungracious as he could be when he served a beer. the first time we came here we really enjoyed the whole experience. the second time things were getting a tad shaky. this last time IS the last time. we had to get up twice to ask (it is 5:10 pm, by the way, on a Thursday with 4 servers standing around) for beer and food. the food was barely acceptable and the burger I took home and ate later on actually made me seriously sick. the tuna salad is listed as 6 ounces, but in reality was only 2 ounces. the bathroom was like a walk-in freezer, and is dingy, like the rest of the place. low lights everywhere except in the "kitchen", if you drop something, kiss it goodbye, unless you have a flashlight. employees have a "chain-gang" ambience which really makes it a tempting place to be in the historical cleveland heights cavalcade of restaurants. we left 15 per cent because we respect working people but this is one bunch that really did not deserve a penny. our advice glance once and keep on driving! 1
Pros: Buger, side of fries, take out staff, free wi-fiCons: None this timeIs it a good restaurant for kids? YesIs the parking lot enough to accommodate the customers? MaybeOn Wednesday around 7:30pm, I went to the restaurant to get my food to go and have my dinner on another place. The cashier was very quick and nice to take my order and at this time there were no line to place my order there.After paid, there is a place that you can sit to wait for your food to be ready. I waited more or less 15/20 minutes for everything to be done. While I was waiting, I was using the free Wi-Fi to check my e-mails and read the news.Overall, the fries were dry but tasteful. They were not greased or unseasoned and the burger at a first sight seemed dry what is a bad sign most of the times. But I was wrong, even not juicy inside the burger was delicious. They found the right balance between juicy and dry. I liked this restaurant a lot and I'm looking forward to go back there again. 4
What a great spa! The entire experience was pleasant - I booked the $99 massage and facial combo online and Rob called me within 20 minutes to confirm the date and time, and he made sure to give me proper directions. When I arrived at 9am, Rob greeted me, and I was quickly whisked away by Karina, who performed my facial. She was excellent. I agree with other Yelpers, who note that while the mask is setting, Karina gives you a wonderful scalp massage instead of leaving the room for 20 minutes. It's special attention to detail that makes this place special. After my facial, I got to stay in the same room and enjoy my one hour massage. Everything was great!I will definitely return when I am back in the Phoenix area. You won't be able to find a deal like this, along with great service, in most places. Great job Mozaik! 5
So we decided to try this place out since we had a friend visiting from out of town who was already around Kensington.   The service wasn't too bad, but the food took over an hour to come out to us since the place was heaving.  Pretty understandable given the size of the kitchen. I had the El Especial and the scrambled eggs were quite nice, cheesy and creamy like described.   The salsa and sausages were a little bland, but wasn't too bad.   The wife and our friend both had the fish fry and were kinda left asking where the rest of the fish was, but what do you expect for the price?  All in the all, not great.. but not too bad.  Ended up picking up pork rolls from chinatown because wife and friend weren't entirely satisfied. 3
Had the Rock House Wagyu Burger at Mimosa Grill w/ fries lightly seasoned with herbs, parmasean cheese and a hint of truffle oilPretty good, ordered it medium but came out well done, got a free dessert out of the monstrosity. Service was good. Had the bread pudding, lacked the flavor I expect from a good bread pudding but the presentation was nice. Ill have to give this place another shot. Also the decor is nice great place to take your next ex-wife. 3
Don't come here. Unprofessional. They don't know what they are doing. Dentist was yelling at his assistant in front of me. Find another dentist 1
The only reason this place gets 2 stars, the decor, for no other reason!! There are far better options than this place, once was more than enough for me. This is the same feedback I am getting from everyone I know that has tried this place. Great decor, u have to give the designer of this place kudos for the great concept. Accolades stop there. Staff, they avert any direct eye contact out of fear of being asked to do their job. Service is slow with zero communication. Wait for food a little long, but not too. Presentation, a joke, seriously, no effort whatsoever. Portions are a real joke, a serious joke. Drinks are mainly ice, expensive to boot, with only a hint of alcohol. Food carried no taste, bland no excitement whatsoever. Thoroughly disappointed. 2
Cafe Posada is one of Gilbert's best kept little secrets.  Its a great little restaurant you've probably driven by many times on the corner of Gilbert and Ray rd.   You've got to try the Carne Asada or the Pollo a la Parilla.  The never compromise on the fresh ingredients and you won't be disappointed.  Pleasantly Surprised! 4
Great experience. My stylist was Tracy and she rocked - making the whole experience great. Excellent price to get my extensions clipped in and styled for a night on the town with my friend.  Thanks Tracy. I will be back! 5
this is the place i've been wanting to back in years! i remember coming here when i was a wee kid but never got the chance to go back. i have somewhat a vague memory of this place serving the BEST dry yellow/rice noodles with oyster sauce (i think in vietnamese it's called Mi/Hu Tieu Kho) excuse my bad spelling. So just the other day, i decided to head back and try it again and what i found out was that this is the ONLY place that serves up dry yellow AND rice noodles in the same bowl! Other vietnamese restaurants only give you the option of choosing one or the other. I ordered my noodles and when they arrived, i was very excited! Digging into the bowl was like digging into my childhood memory and it tasted great! Surprisingly, it was soo good that i was the first to finish eating. The soup on the other hand i wasn't able to finsh cause it was too saltly for my taste (as you can tell i'm not a big fan of salty foods 1. it can cause high blood pressure, 2. high sodium intake is not good for your health, 3. too much salt often covers up the taste of food)But going back to the point, i thought the food was delish! and i would have ordered another bowl but i was already full so i didnt. Probably nex time i'll order only the yellow noodles cause the rice noodles were a bit soft and soggy but the sauce was just right which i really enjoyed. atmosphere i would say is a bit dingy and may require some renovations but aside from that i thought it was great. 3
I have tried this place 4 times now, since I live close. Service has always been poor, we never receive our food together.Today I stopped in by myself to grab a quick burger, place was empty. Ordered a cheese burger, $ 4.72 I think, gave my card. Woman says can only use card for 5 dollars, would not budge...No more business from my family and I. 1
Even though this bar is located next to the street and right off the casino you still felt like you were in a different and intimate space when you entered the bar area. I would've enjoyed spending more time here but my group was ready to call it a night. In the short time we did spend at the bar, we enjoyed the music and dancing girls that arrive and depart on a wire from the ceiling. The next time I go to Vegas I will definitely be heading back here. 4
I've been going to Presto for about two months now. The guys do a great job with gel nails. Great pedicures! 4
Ordered a large sausage pepperoni for pick up, ready in 25, pretty good, nothing to write to grandma about, but no complaints. 5/5 will be back 4
Not sure why I continue to stop at this KFC. First visit food was great. Second visit we got home and bit into the biscuits and they were all raw dough. 3rd visit the forgot a couple items. 4th visit tonight I sat in the drive thru 4ever and then decided to go in. I witnessed the female manager arguing with a male employee who was using f-bombs!! Very unprofessional. The male employee clocked out and left!! I stood for awhile and I think they forgot my order. I was the only one standing and waiting. Place was empty. The service is slow, employees are unprofessional... I'm taking my business back to Canes. It's worth the drive!!! 1
This is our second visit to Mexico Lindo. We came when it first opened years back.We ordered the calamari, but they don't have it today? So we are going with the shrimp at the suggestion of our server. The shrimp is our appetizer, I am having Chimichanga and hubby having the tacos for our main course.The shrimps are delicious! They come with bread that is basically garlic bread, I think plain bread would be better. Big jumbo shrimps in a little bit spicy sauce, very good!Our main courses were good also. 3
Wish there was negative stars.  Volunteered to take the next flight.  The manager Shureen forgot to book my ticket or get my luggage off the plane.  She walked away and while she was gone. Someone sold the last seat.Her solution was phoenix to Portland to Burbank or to Long Beach with a cab or a flight tomorrow.Why am I forced to suffer cause she messed up.  Should have gotten me on another airline.  Never really apologized.No one could give me her managers name. 1
Great food at reasonable prices, good service and great classy atmosphere. Simply delicious choices with special seasonal options. There soup was delicious and the flat bread was great. There scallops were cooked perfect  and risotto was cooked perfect. Will look forward to next visit. Every thing I have tasted at this restaurant was absolutely phenomenal. 4
This dog park is heavily used. The water feature for water dogs is really cool but it does not seem like people pick up after their dogs much. Boo, lots of poo! 3
I am giving Vine two stars because the atmosphere was great and the food, once we received it was good. We had a reservation for Mother's Day so we expected it to be busy and a little slower. What we experienced was terrible service and a restaurant that was completely unprepared. We started out good and ordered drinks and an appetizer for the table. Some drinks arrived but we were told they were out of the appetizer. We then ordered our food and noticed my parents never received their water. We asked for their water and then after a reasonable amount a time a server came out and put a plate in front of my mother. It was what she ordered. Another server then came a took it away giving it to the table next to us because that is where it was supposed to go. 30 minutes after we ordered our food had not yet arrived. The manager came over and apologized and suggested we order some desserts on the house. The server and manager must not have communicated well because he then came and told us lunch was on them. He was wrong. Our food finally arrived and it was good. We had to ask for several missing items that were never brought out. My husbands water glass was never refilled so he started drinking mine. We waited a long time for them to finally bring us dessert menus. We ordered three desserts for our group of 7 and asked for the check since we were tired of waiting. The server finally noticed my husband needed water and said he would bring it. He never did. Twenty minutes later our server reappeared to tell us they were out of one of the desserts. We said we didn't need any dessert and just wanted the check. It arrived with desserts on the bill as well as three extra beverages that we did not order. The check was finally fixed and we were given two desserts to go for our trouble. I hardly think it was compensation. Lunch took us over two hours. Management should have been more proactive and apologetic. 2
Went back 2nd time very good again my date had the Salmon I had a meatball  Calzone great sauce  will be back 5
came here for dinner and ordered the Famous 'Pork Bone Soup'. This place was just as I expect from a simple Korean restaurant - tasty but not excellent. Overall it was decently priced and service was good. alot of variety to choose from and i will definetly come back to try the other stuff such as the BiBimBap (which i heard was good) and the other stone pot soups which have kimchi flavoured broths. yum! 3
Justine has an amazing eye and is a very talented photographer...I will admit that! Unfortunately, I think my experience with her may not be the norm for all of her clients but I was very disappointed with the lack of service through the ordering process. I received my proofs, placed my order and made payment within 24 hours....very excited to receive my photos and then came the wait....longer than expected, received no responses to my emails and I finally had to place a hold on my payment to get her attention.Not what I call a good experience and unfortunately won't use her again because of it. However, the photos she did take that I did end up eventually getting are beautiful. I think she had bit off more than she could chew with the Groupon deal she participated in.It's too bad...I was really looking for a new photographer! 3
I've read some very negative reviews of this location regarding how young the management staffs are. I personally have no problem with age except when they have no clue how to take care of problem. Apparently they only care about themselves, not customers. My wife & I have never been disrespected & insulted as much as we were yesterday by an employee of this Target. Yes, at this location. I'll call the employee 'Miss B', a young Afro-American female at early 20's or maybe late teens. I'm just trying to give as much description as possible cuz she took her name tag off to hide her identity as this is happening. The supervisor (young male) comes over & hides Miss B in a room by Customer Service after Miss B asked him to get me out of the store? Really? She's asking her supervisor to move customers out of the store? All the supervisor did was trying to lie to me when the store manager showed up. Now the supervisor runs away cuz I caught him lying thru his teeth. As I'm talking to the manager named Kyle, another customer who heard what/how Miss B talked to us passed by and said "she (Miss B) was pretty nasty to these people". Of course Kyle doesn't give shit about this witness. Now This so called store manager (Kyle) refuses to give me her name when I told them I wanted to file official complaint. Everyone is wearing nametags!! After I talked to Kyle, I still hear Miss B talking shit with another woman about me ? Wow, Kyle, who claimed to be the store manager simply gave me a number to call to file a complaint. This store is a Perfect example of how incompetent manager produces incompetent employee. One after the other just lying thru their teeth to cover their own shits. How do I give negative stars? Damm !!! No one deserves to be treated this way when they come here to spend their money. Now, let's see what HQ has to say when I contact them. 1
Great food and very attentive service.  The mushroom ravioli was to die for and the Talapia was very tasty.  Highly recommend this restaurant. 4
I don't understand why this restaurant has such bad reviews. I live next door so I pick up food fairly often. Everything I've tried has been really tasty. (General Tao, shrimp in lobster sauce, noodles, sushi...) 4
The vibe in this place is unwelcoming. The service was bad because most of the workers acted like they didn't want to be there. They don't portion it right and they give you attitude when you ask for anything different. The food was alright. 3
Came into Abby dental and was greeted as soon as I walked in. Dentist was great and Stacy explained everything and answered all questions. Then she walked us to the other building. Then we were created by Sanet she was super awesome gave my husband and myself manicures as we waiting. They had snacks and coffee which was nice. 5
They do an excellent job here and I was very satisfied with the end result of my nails. However, they definitely find every way to make an extra buck. Which is okay, as long as they let the customer know. I came in asking for all matte black nails and one silver nail. I knew the matte would cost a few extra bucks but I didn't care. But what I didn't know is that she was going to use a gel polish for my silver nail without asking me first, when I know they have regular polish in silver, therefore charging me an extra $25 or so for one nail per hand. 3
Went here after playing golf with some friends.  A friend used to go there with his dad.  I was pleasantly surprised and will be back again.   The beer mugs were super ice cold!!!   I would describe it as a traditional Mariscos place that I would frequent on special occasions growing up in Mexico.   By no means is it fancy but it is clean and service is good.   I had the ceviche and mixed tostadas were very good!  With an ice cold beer... does not get any better.   Will be the new place after golf. 4
honestly chef? I was expecting so much better!!! ok it's not a bad place of course, sitting in the famous Paris hotel and with Ramsay's hand motions made into a light... interesting idea. i ordered (of course) the famous beef wellington and husband ordered striplion steak, it was a big piece, he said it tasted pretty good.so the beef wellington, after watching and hearing it over and over on his shows, i was imagining someting that will blow me off the chair, but after the first bite, i thought "oh so this is what is like", and... that's it. well, the fillet migon was very nice, melts in my mouth, can you imagine a chunk of beef that melts? but the crust becomes soggy so fast so i didn't really enjoy the combination of some wet soft pastry and a piece of perfect steak.. we also ordered two appertizers, fried pork belly (1 piece) and yellowfin sashimi (2 pieces) and two drinks. bill came to $230 overall.would i go again? maybe when they bring scallop risotto to the main menu. ps. i think our server needs more training, he doesn't know how to make suggestions, maybe cuz everyone asks for beef wellington? 3
stopped in during the early evening hours the madness was starting to quiet down, I wasn't buying anything just comparing prices and for the most part it compares to Walmart or lower.  Reminds me of the old Mega Foods stores only on a higher scale.I will definately be back.I did see quite a few of the trailer park crowd there last night and that makes me nervous with all the bulk bins and the offspring running around 4
The service at this establishment does not warrant me wasting any more time typing than this. 1
Went with my son during a rainy Super Bowl afternoon.  Due to the inclement weather it was pretty dead.The best part were the chips and salsa and margaritas.  Ordered table side home made guacamole which was very tasty.  Disappointed with the tacos.  Tacos??? Really, lol.Fajitas were just, "ok".In my opinion, a great place to go to for margaritas and chips and salsa and that's it. 3
While in the end we did not purchase an Audi, we had a great experience at this dealership. Our sales associate Ben was knowledgeable, friendly, and enthusiastic about the product. I didn't feel pressured during the process and he was more than willing to answer any and all questions/concerns via email and phone. If you're in the market for an Audi definitely check out Audi of Mississauga. 4
Go for lunch once or twice a month and will continue to do so.  Food is great as is the service.  Thanks Feathers!! 5
I have always found this store clean,friendly and well stocked. The only complainet I have is they are understaffed but thats trure of most places however the folks where are there go out of their way to help.I have been shopping this store since it opened and they are GREAT. 5
This is the worst Chinese food I've ever had. Not to mention the place is very strange inside and poorly run. I ordered takeout last week and when I went in to get it there were no employees to be found and there was a couple making out in one of the booths. After 10min I literally had to walk back into the kitchen and yell for someone to come help me. They were playing Indiana Jones on the TV very loud and there are stacks of papers, receipts, invoices everywhere. Very unorganized.The food itself was soggy, bland and saucy. Sweet and sour chicken balls were the only decent item but how hard is it to fry pre cooked/frozen chicken balls.It terrifies me that this place offers sushi as well. Just don't go here - you'd be better off at pizza pizza a few doors down (and I strongly dislike Pizza Pizza). 1
Holly the owner lies to your face l won't be back. Plato's closet is ridiculous!!! I wish I could post negative stars. 1
The 0lace is located I  the palazzo hotel. Dim lighting and very romance atomsphere. The service is good. The steaks are not that good. Very dry and rough. I was shocked. The prices are I sane and for no reason. 3
We were really disappointed here.  It took 70 minutes from checking in to getting our entree - 10 minutes of that was waiting in the bar.  The salad (organic greens) took forever to be served.  My husband's filet was tasteless - we've had better from Costco.  My scallops were very good, but were served cold.  When we left, no one said thank you or goodbye  Save your $$ and go elsewhere. 2
Really nice atmosphere; Busy but great service.I ordered the tuna salad as recommended on yelp. But I don't really into that, but it's a healthy choice and the new source is amazing 4
Fun for kids to see the ducks, turtles and fish but this place is a trainwreck. Had fond memories, but the last time I was there was 16 years ago. I remember it being yummy and a fun place to go. Unfortunately, it is now old and dirty, very dirty. They should close for a few weeks just to clean and maybe paint.  Had the fish taco special, was supposed to be mahi, it was a formed fish stick with fillers. Really bad. Tomatillo salsa had no tomatillo flavor. Actually nothing had much flavor. Two stars only because the pond makes it interesting, though it was gross and green. 2
Aladdin's, as the name would imply, is a middle eastern restaurant. It's a nice, comfortable, restaurant where you can find many unusual dishes. I've been there several times and I have never been disappointed. The food is excellent and well prepared. The service is good although keep in mind this really isn't that big of a place so it can be somewhat crowded at times. Having said that, the wait has never been excessively long. Whenever I am looking for a nearby restaurant with good non american food, served hot,  reasonably priced and with a casual atmosphere Aladdin's is a go to place. 4
Didn't love my pedi. The massage was nice on the legs but my polish was rushed and I had to go home and clean up the edges with polish remover. I won't likely go back. 2
Been here twice, and I must say, the service has improved. Food is good. Had pizza, wings and cheese sticks. The manager came up to me and asked for suggestions on how to make my experience better. I let him know my suggestions and he took them into consideration. Will return soon. 3
1 star is too much for this place. No flavor, lack of seasoning, & low quality ingredients are the reoccurring theme at this overpriced Resturant .  First off , They charge you for chips n salsa which is free at virtually every Mexican Resturant . The salsa is bland & no flavor.  The ceviche trio was NOT fresh n we had to send back. The Chef try's to get too creative with his ceviche recipes as one is more disgusting n lacking flavor or seasoning as the next.  Way overpriced fajitas , which once again had zero flavor , no seasoning and very low quality meat (steak). They basically give u about 7-8 pieces of very fatty meat and load up on the vegetables and get u for $18. The chicken quesadilla literally smelled like that stuff u find between ur toes. We basically ate almost nothing and they credited us for most of the food. When the waitress agrees that the quality had gone done hill fast , it's never a good sign. Would never go back even if they comped the entire meal . I'm embarrassed for this place and the Mgr. seems so aloof to the problems . There are way better places to eat in Las Vegas for the same $$ , don't waste ur time n money at this place. 1
We were there last Friday night with business clients. The service was very good, and the food was delicious. I'm giving them only 3 stars because they had a band playing inside the restaurant, and it was so noisy and loud that we had to yell to our guests in order to be heard. I asked  the waiter to see if he could have the volume be turned down, but I don't think they turned it down.  We were seated indoors by the patio,  because it was hot to sit outside.  After 2 hours, we moved to an outdoor table where we could hear other talk. 3
I go here every morning to get coffee. I order one thing and I order it the exact same way every morning. The same girl takes my order most of the time. She messes it up every single morning. I have to correct her. Sometimes she hurrys and puts it in the screen and before I can confirm the order is correct, she commits it. She tells me that she will change it, but inevitably, she fails to correct it and I end up with the wrong order. I order one thing!!!! If your only job it to take my order and you mess it up every single time, 100% of the time, you need help. I have complained, I have done their surveys on the receipt, nothing changes. It's so frustrating. Maybe the owner will see this and fix the problem. 1
They took to long... Bad customer service.  They charge alot to have such bad customer service. I'm going somewhere else from here on out. My boyfriend was going to pay what ever to get my car taken care of. He begged me to let them go ahead an take care of my care. I'm 9 months pregnant an they mad me so stress I took my chances else where. Never go back there again. I didn't like there attitude an customer service. They are there for the money not to reply cater to the customer.  Do they not know the better they treat people they more they trust you an will spend more money. 1
the co workers are super sweet! the nail work kinda sucks and we had to wait 3 hours that's why I'm giveing it a 3 stars 3
Burns and Scalo is one of the best contractors that I have ever worked with. They started the job when they said they would, kept me informed EVERY day about the progress of the job, and cleaned up at the end of every day. Bill (foreman) and Javier were the main roofers on my job and they were unfailingly courteous and pleasant. I have a complicated roof, with many peaks and valleys, and Bill kept me in the loop about their approach to any challenging areas. The other thing that impressed me ( and that I've never experienced before in many projects) is that the supervisor, Dave, also stopped by daily to make sure that that there were no problems. All in all, a top-notch job by a top notch outfit. 5
Went on a Wednesday for Ladies Night.  Free entry if you have a boarding pass (player's club card) otherwise it's $1 for girls and $5 for guys.  Girls enjoy $1 drinks while dudes pay too much.Line dancing lessons start at 8:15 and run for 45-60 minutes.  Lots of boot stomping after that.  Sometime after 11:00 they pretty much play club music.Ladies night was off to a slow start but by midnight it was pretty crowded, LOTS of girls, I was surprised at the ratio.  Cocktail girls are good looking.There's nothing really unique about Revolver except for the mirror armadillo over the dance floor.  I only drove all the way up here (half way to Tonapah!) for the free Nascar tickets, but after the experience, I just might make it back! 3
My friend was getting married in Las Vegas over the Memorial Day holiday and instead of having everyone spend a fortune at the fancy strip hotels, she picked the Tuscany, so everyone was able to get a good rate.I was traveling with another one of my friend's and her husband and we got to the hotel around 2 p.m.  We waited in line to check in and asked if we could check in early.  We were told that the room that they held for us were given to people that stayed longer and that our rooms were not guaranteed, even though we booked them about a year in advance.  That makes no sense whatsoever.  We told her we were part of a wedding party that had blocked a bunch of rooms, but they still didn't care.  When they said they had 2 rooms available, the rooms were in 2 separate buildings away from where the bride had wanted us to stay.  We told the lady where we wanted to stay and she said come back in a hour and they should be ready.We came back exactly an hour later, only to be told they weren't ready yet.  The lady had us sit and wait 20 more minutes while she waited on a call back to make sure the rooms were clean.  They also had one room with a King bed and one room with 2 doubles, even though my friend and I had both booked rooms with King beds.  I let her have the King room, but once again, what's the point of reserving a room, if you aren't going to get what you asked for.My room was okay.  I didn't have problems like my friend had with the sink and safe.  I did not like that you could hear people above you walking or running.  That was really loud.  Also, even though there are shades to keep the light out, it was still bright once the sun started to rise and that made me wake up way earlier than I wanted to.After the first day, my room was not cleaned by 3:00 p.m.  When I was getting ready to meet my friends, the cleaning lady came back around 3:30 p.m. and I told her I will be leaving soon and to come back.  On the day I was leaving, she knocked on my door at 9:00 a.m. to see when she could clean my room and I told her I was leaving today.  Shouldn't she know that?The food at the Mexican restaurant and Marilyn's Cafe was just so-so.  We only ate there b/c there was noting else, but it wasn't that great.  I would have gone somewhere else, if there was something else close by.The bar in the lobby would have been okay if it wasn't for the jazz music.  I'm not a fan of jazz and did not want to hear it.  Also, the prices for drinks in that bar are ridiculous!!!  My friend and I ordered Shirley Temple's, which consist of Sprite and cherry flavor and they cost $4 each!!!!!!!!  What the heck!?  Also, a small bottle of water, about half the size of a regular bottle, was $4!!!  That is so ridiculous!The pool was probably the only thing that wasn't that bad.  We were able to get lounge chairs both times we went to the pool.  I know people I was with were annoyed with the one waitress that was going around getting drink and food orders.  She was taking forever on some things and even gave food to the wrong people.  On my last day, I had checked out and wanted to spend a few hours at the pool.  I went into the bathroom to change and I came out and put my stuff on the counter.  The cleaning lady was in there staring at me with an annoyed look, so I asked her if I was in her way.  She rudely said yes and I asked her if I should move to one side or something and she huffed out saying, something about coming back.  So uncalled for!!When it was time to leave, we asked the bellman to get us a cab and he waited about 10-15 mins until he called for one, which of course made us late to get to the airport.I definitely won't be staying at this hotel again.  I appreciate that my friend picked a  place to help all the wedding guests save money, but it was an awful experience. 2
My experience with the Red Door Spa at 2502 East Camelback was a big disappointment!My daughters had gone together to buy a package including a massage, a pedicure, and a manicure for Mother's Day.  The massage person was very nice but the massage was superficial.  There was no attention to my body's needs. It was just done without thinking.The pedicure and manicure by Raisa were the worst I have ever had! In fact, the very next day I went and had both redone in order to fix the problems she created! She was so worried about telling me about extra charges that she didn't focus on what she was doing!The two women at the front desk were very nice as was the manager, Michelle, who called me after I filled out an emailed survey showing my unhappiness.Michelle said that the Red Door teaches "protocols" and in my opinion that is their downfall!  They need to trust their employees to offer individual customer service to meet individual needs!I was offered $56 towards my next services (if I go back it will be to a different location) and that was appreciated! However, the package cost in excess of $250. 1
Love this place! Sometimes it is so hard to find a fun, comfortable, friendly and clean restaurant that can accommodate my kids (who eat meat) and my husband and I (who are vegan). This place is perfection! And since we are skipping the meat the husband and I we can get a roll for $3.95? Get the heck out of here!  Edamame and a cucumber salad for less then $2 each. We went wild on rolls and sides and still spent way less then we would have at someplace less healthy or interesting. If you are shy of ordering then check out the menu online and walk in with it written down what you wants.. also the website has a great feature that allows you to build your roll and check the nutritional value of it. I can't even tell you how much I appreciate that! The people were friendly, helpful and nice. The place was spotless. I think we are going to make it Sushi Sunday and go every week. Can't wait now for the weekend. 4
I have been going to this place for years since high school and always go to Stanley. I've had a bunch of different hair cuts through the years from short bob to straight perm to mid length to dyed caramel... I've always trusted Stanley to do a good job and if I go home and don't love the cut, I can always come in the next day for him to fix it free of charge. They have a great selection of recent Japanese magazines to flip through to get inspired as well! 4
WORST MCDONALDS EVER! I just don't get why they always have 1 cash register open and lines out the door,slow employees who can't even work a register it also seems as most of the front cashiers weren't properly trained as they can't even work the pos system Many times I have ordered and they always forget something in my order that's why I always check before I leave or else I waste my time coming back in for a mistake THEY made oh and keep the receipt in case you drive half way home and realize they missed something in your orderThe manager here is rude the Indian brown guy a customer was angry about his order and the manager said stop complaining  or I'll kick you out! Even the other manager with the tats she's rude seems like all the full timers here are uneducated mor**sThis location is the worst especially since it's near some schools so DO NOT even bother going there during lunch 11-12pm as it's packed with these school rats and the high school kids that go here are annoying after they order they just crowd around the front counter expecting the food to come,kids...GTFO!Seriously this location just sucks *** 1
I recommend this store to everyone, staff is super nice and very prompt, they attend customers very quickly and explain everything in details, I always deal with Matthew, all I can say he is excellent.Thank you Rita D. 5
Terrible.  My wife went there during her lunch on aThursday. By Friday all her nail Polish fell off.  My wife went back on Saturday to complain the owner Nancy told my wife to speak with the guy that did her nails.  Really?  She said it was out her control.  Needless to say my wife will not return EVER 1
When our recently purchased used Buick started having problems, I was really bummed. It's so hard to find a trustworthy mechanic. A previous trusted mechanic told me to look for a official Napa Auto Repair Center. He said that usually means they are good. He sure was right this time.Benn at Discount Emissions (Glendale location) couldn't have been better. His bedside manner was outstanding and the work they did on the car was solid. He did everything he could to a) save us money, b) save us hassle, c) arrange for other transportation, and d) clearly communicate what he thought the problems were and how best to fix them. The car was even ready ahead of schedule!Now we are actually looking forward to getting our oil changed since we'll get to see Benn again. 5
The food was good; interesting and tasty flavours but the reason I will never be going back is that the services was horrible. I went with 2 other friends and we had a coupon from groupon. I don't know if it was because we had a coupon but the waitress was seriously rude, slow and very condescending. We still ended up paying extra because we ordered wine ect but the service was just disgusting.Never going back. 2
Looking for lunch in the Beach? Here's your place. Quality, comforting food. Good menu options, labelled for gluten-sensitive and vegetarian diners; friendly service; a  cheerful but calm dine-in environment. The Montreal-style bagels did not disappoint. 4
I am very upset with this company. Wasted $$, promising cancellation no problem within certain timeframe, without warning us there is no money refund, and they took 25% cancellation fee!! I called to use our remaining credit, they were not friendly at all and I'm now not even sure if we are able to use the remaining credit! Do not do bussiness with them. 1
My wife and I came here trying to diversify our restaurant portfolio.  Food across the board was okay.  Lettuce a little brown, rolls very out of bag from store feeling.  Many things lacked flavor when the creative names and combos made me expect something bold.  I'm not sure what some of the yelpers liked so much ?  The snickers pie was blah.  My salad was plain.  My wifes quiche was like a frozen pot pie. I liked my app, but not so much I'd order it twice.  The only thing we like was our butter finger shake, but madison has a few thousand places to get custard.  Our server was nice and helpful, but lacked courage in guiding our selection.  Not a awful experience, but not very good.  Would not give 2nd try. 2
would give negative stars.towed my car here from another incompetent mechanic. took them 2 months to even touch my car. parts were missing/broken. car still not running in fact is in worse condition than it was before. BEWARE OF THIS PLACE. BUNCH OF LIARS.  this situation started at Daves Automotive. check out my review of them for the entire story. 1
After my bad review, I got a personal email from the owner acknowledging my comments and sincerely apologizing.  Wow, that was the first time this has happened to me.  I didn't respond, but instead just made my way back in, anonymously.  So, I still love the crab cakes and Mary and Nikki are even better than before and this time the whole place seemed to have a better vibe.  Was it my review?  NO!!! LOL.  Maybe I just spoke too soon on a new place in town.Being an older crowd in Fountain Hills (I am 15 years younger than almost all of my neighbors) it is an odd thing to have a DJ spinning on a weekend - but as fuddy duddy as I am for my age, doesn't mean it isn't just what the doctor ordered for some.John - thanks for reaching out to me.  I wish you the best with Fountini's and just know that you haven't lost my business. 4
Excellent Hawaiian plate lunch! Mac salad always my favorite! Been to Hawaii several times and this place gives me the opportunity to revisit cheaper than a flight. 5
Great establishment Fast food Authentic Wonderful service. Damien was my server wonderful service, funny dude will return. 5
One of the best Taco Bells I've been to. I came in around 1230 on a weekday, and it wasn't busy at all. I placed my order and went to wash my hands..by the time I came my food was ready. So you know how you'll take a bite of your food and the contents fall out of the opposite end? Well that's what happened with my beef chalupa (that's a good thing). The food was fresh and they weren't skimpy with the meat or anything lol. Customer service was good as well. No complaints! 5
This is the place for breakfast and brunch slash comfort food. Every week they have a unique flavor of potted bread which is offered as a side to most entrees.  I like the omelette selection.  The wait staff is attentive and very nice. At peak hours there's usually a short 15-30min wait for a table. I like to burn time at Dead Poets Used Bookstore also located in the same strip mall. 5
Great spot for beers and food, too. They have a vast selection of tall boys (obviously), and a really nice selection of draft beer  too.  The tacos are delicious.  I really like the warm, casual atmosphere and the super friendly staff.   They have both vegetarian and meat options, which is always nice if you are coming with a group.  Perfect place for a casual evening out. 4
I F*CKING LOVE BJ'S!  No pun intended. The restaurant is great too. The service is fantastic, but then again, who can say no to BJ's? The food is pretty damn good and the beer selection is awesome. Really though, I always feel treated right, the staff is awesome. The bar tenders are actually pretty cool and personable even when they're busy. Anyone who's read my reviews knows by now, that if it's a good review it's gonna be short and sweet, but my bad reviews are gonna be LONG and very descriptive. This place got the formula right. Great food, great atmosphere, great people, great beer, great desserts, terrible parking lot. The best places always have the worst parking lots. 5
Forget Dunkin' Donuts, where the donuts are the only thing not worth eating, this is the real deal.  A neighborhood donut shop, for reals.  Do the time warp.  Seriously, do it!  Because this place will take you back in time to when donuts were made by...people!First, peruse the nicely varied selection of donuts and other pastries. Then, sidle up to the counter and give your order to the somewhat surly, but efficient server.  Finally, your heaping box of doughy goodness home or take a seat amongst the chatting oldsters.  If you're prone to Homer Simpson style drooling, check yourself.  What are you waiting for?  Get yourself a donut, or three. 5
The fish tacos were.... gross.  Other items on the menu may be fine, but I am not going back because the fish tacos were so disappointing (and relatively expensive).  That is all. 2
Hotel motel holiday inn if ya girl starts acting up bring her friend! Lol.  Its a freemont hotel on the strip...... I enjoyed the bed, other then the luke warm shower thats all i used there. Big flat screen that we never turned on..... Check in was fast on a thursday friday line was going out the door though. Friendly older staff. Wife won around $100 on the slots. Would stay again. Cant beat the price. 4
I like this fry's but hate the starbucks in this store. normally do not write reviews but I am surprised by how HORRIBLE the customer service is here. I used to work at starbucks and know a thing or two about the drinks but am not too picky since everything is fairly good. I have ordered at this location probably 4 times since it is convenient in the frys I shop at. I've received a couple wrong drinks but I've never said anything because it was small things like passion tea instead of passion tea lemonade and I like almost all starbucks drinks so nothing to make a fuss about. They are pretty slow but again, not worth the confrontation. But today, the service was appauling. My husband and I wanted some breakfast to hold us over while grocery shopping. I ordered a pepperoni and tomato foldover. After waiting I received a breakfast sandwich. I politely asked if I could get the foldover instead. Being pregnant now, my cravings and food aversions are pretty specific so while I would normally just take the hit and eat what I got, I wanted what I ordered today. The girl took my sandwich back and said she would give me the foldover.  I started shopping and left my husband to grab it for me. I waited a little bit to open my bag as I was busy shopping and also know the pastries can be super hot out of the starbucks oven. When I did get to my bag, I realized they had now given me a spinach foldover. Being almost done with my shopping at this point, I went to just get my money back. The gentleman that I spoke to asked the previous girl about how I had been given the wrong thing, to which she responded that they just don't have the pepperoni and tomato foldover. The man responded by saying what I thought was common sense..THAT IF YOU DONT HAVE THE THING I ORDERED, TO ASK IF I WANT SOMETHING ELSE INSTEAD OF JUST GIVING ME SOME RANDOM THING. The gentleman then said that they have a chorizo sandwich. I explained that I wanted the pepperoni foldover before, not a chorizo sandwich. he responded by saying, well we've never had that...like I should've known this somehow. I explained I was just ordering off the sign in the display case! He then reluctantly gave me cash back. Never NEVER again. After working in many customer service jobs including starbucks,  I have to say this is one of the worst experiences I have had. 3
I have both eaten in and taken out with a positive experience. From walking by, it doesn't look like the greatest place, but they have an interesting menu with different asian/asian fusion dishes so there's a little bit for everyone from the exotic to the simple.The Malaysian Sate, which I had with beef, was delicious and came in a more than adequately sized portion. The Pad Thai is also a delicious meal. All of the appetizers and other dishes I tried were more than satisfactory. For a student on a budget, this place is both delicious and relatively inexpensive. I would recommend it to anyone who likes interesting tastes of Asia. 4
The room was ok. Very basic, but we were only using it to spend one night and we got a deal for $22 through Trivago.I don't really have any complaints about the room. Was small but clean. There was a shuttle to the strip. We got off at the Flamingo. What I have a problem with is the staff and how they handled (or didn't handle) a barking dog. I called the ask if they could get the person in the room next to me to please have their dog quiet down. They sent down security, by the time they got there the go's had stopped barking. Fast forward 2:30 in the morning. Dog STILL barking. I call back down there, get told it's a pet friendly hotel and there's nothing they can do. Not acceptable. This darn dog barked ALL. NIGHT. 2
Brio is always a happy dining experience.  For this specific location, I've only been for happy hour, but I don't see how their regular menu would differ from their location at Town Square.  Their happy hour must be one of the best!  They have a list of items for $2.95.  Don't let the price fool you though.  Their portions are decent sized.  We always order one of everything, and maybe even two of some other things.  (Don't judge us!!)  How could you not though?  Cheap, good food is so hard to pass up!Their service is always amazing.  They check several times to make sure everything is okay and refill drinks before it is necessary. 5
The food is okay, though pricey. They know they are one of few choices for a resort, and the service reflects it. They wait staff could really care less. 2
I have been coming here for the past four years or so, and it has been hit-or-miss most of the time.As far as nail techs, Dani is the best, hands-down. She's booked up pretty often, but well worth it. She has the most amazing attention to detail and can do a French manicure by hand like no one else! I just love her manicures/pedicures and her friendly personality. However, I have also gone to another tech a few times for pedicures and manicures, and won't be able to recommend her. She has left my polish streaky and the sides of my nails bare on more than one occasion. Her specialty might be acrylics and gels, but that doesn't excuse the fact that she can't give a decent mani/pedi. Not worth the price if it ain't done right.I have visited one of the estheticians there quite a few times, and she can also be iffy. When I go in for a brow wax, she doesn't always ask me what I want - just goes right to it, and sometimes goes way too thin. I had to learn to speak up about what I wanted. Don't get me wrong, she's incredibly sweet and mostly professional, but some aspects of her work don't sit well with me.Another esthetician I had a year or two ago gave me a terrible facial - the worst ever. She was careless and the facial was bland and basic. And, get this - she was TEXTING!! While I was in the room, trying to relax during my facial! Thank goodness she is no longer at the spa... I wonder why.Overall, the staff is friendly and much less snobby than most spas, but the quality of the treatments is not on par with the price. The facility is cute and recently expanded, but the rooms are still a little small. I've watched with disappointment as their prices have risen over the years, and it's caused me to seek out other places, despite the fact that I live down the street a short distance.To summarize - go see Dani for your nails, and you won't regret it. I'd comment on their hair department, but every stylist I've seen is no longer with the salon. Hmm. The esthetics department is decent, but I won't go out of my way to get services there. I have yet to try any medspa or laser services, but I'm considering checking out their laser technician in the future. If Total Bliss would make some improvements to the quality of their technicians and services, I would probably change my mind about them. 3
I am so glad this place is going out of business. Every since they bought it from Albertsons they have run this store into the ground. They closed the pharmacy permanently today at 5pm. When I came at 4pm to pick up my prescriptions they had already pulled from the shelves and now I don't have my meds.They are over priced, under stocked and just generally poorly managed. Hopefully they will sell this location to a compent grocery store company. 1
The Oyster Po Boy is the Bomb!! My husband and I were down in NC and had lunch here. The restaurant lives up to its great reputation. 4
This restaurant is way, way, way too casual and  unprofessional. I ordered a several items which were fine but then sushi roll, and a bug literally walked casually off my plate onto my napkin. I showed it to the bartender and the bartender said  "that is just a fruit fly. It goes after sweet food". Really?!   This time I got a whole new order sushi, and I took it to go. She said she was gonna tell a manager And the bartender said to me we went ahead and took it off of your bill As if they were doing me a favor. Never apologized. Then waited over 20 minutes for my replacement. Too long. I have visited over a dozen P F Chang's  around the country. This one is too reliant on traffic and people could literally fall from the casino into the restaurant. So I don't think they care about service or professionalism given they have so much easy traffic. May need to retrain some staff. 2
I ate lunch here on Friday and was pleased as usual.  I truly love the fact that this restaurant labels each dish as vegetarian or vegan, not simply vegetarian.  I always get the hummus and veggie side platter.  The veggie side platter is huge and inexpensive.  I don't know of another restaurant (perhaps Pitaland) where you can buy a big, beautiful plate of fresh, unadulterated veggies.  I noticed that they have wine and beer.  I will definitely add this restaurant to my list of favorite dinner places as well.  Great job! 5
OK not great.  Nothing that significant to say that was bad about the experience, but comparatively not as great as other orchards (e.g. Door Creek). 2
I'm in Pittsburgh at least twice a month and The Proper is my go-to place.  The pizza is very, very good and the bacon candy should be illegal  (in a good way).  The really large draft beer selection is worth the trip by itself. 5
I have to say, despite all the glowing reviews I found this place to be totally mediocre. I love love love Thai food, so I was very excited to give it a shot. I had a fish Tom Yum Kha soup to start ($4.95), which was tiny and not very flavourful, except for being too sweet. For me the whole point of ordering that soup is the rich coconutty base, but alas, I couldn't taste the coconut at all.Next up was vegetable Pad Prik Khing ($12.95) which is is a kind of spicy (not really) thin red curry sauce. It was ok, but nothing special. The vegetables (only broccoli and cauliflower... really?) were a bit over cooked as well. The sticky rice was sticky rice, what can I say?That said, I'm hoping I just tried the wrong dishes this time and will try it again. The floor seating area looked too cozy to not check out another time! 3
Absolutely love this place. It was my first time in. They open at 1030 on Sundays and  it was 1015. The lady let my son and I sit inside and wait. She was super friendly and talked to us while opening the salon. So that right there was wonderful. Second, I had gotten my nails done previously from a different salon and they did AWFUL. A man named, Tom took them off free of charge (20$ value) and fixed them with a beautiful pink and white acrylic set. He did such a BEAUTIFUL job I tipped him very well!! This is the first I have met someone who I will be requesting every time. He was super gentle with my fingers and just overall a nice man. I will be asking for him every time. 5
Pros: Cost, breakfast, front desk staff, internet, dog friendly, fast internetCons: Housekeep, garage passage to the hotel, not so many good options to eat near aroundIs the private parking lot enough to accommodate all the guests? NoOn April 2012, I reserved a room for 2 nights because I had some appointments to attend on Toronto. The room that I got was small but not bad. Even not having some good options to eat near around, the localization of it stills good. Because I the only time that I needed to use my car again, was only to leave the hotel. It was very accessible to get the public transportation from there to anywhere that I wanted to go.The front desk service was friendly and nice and the breakfast offered much more options to eat that I am used to have from other hotels that I stayed on Toronto. Unfortunately, when we said to the housekeeper that we don't want our room cleaned she started to question us when we were planning to leave and that we need to notify the front desk for that. (Note: we were on the middle of our 2 nights stay) This point upset me a little.Overall, with the exclusion of the housekeeper moment, I liked so much the hotel and I am planning to stay there again next time I visit Toronto. And if you are planning to go there too, my recommendation to you is: leave all the luggage on the hotel lobby. Because if you try to use the corridor that connects the garage to the hotel it is not an easy thing to do because the doors are heavy and maybe you need to go back to the garage sometimes to get everything. 4
This was by far the worst dining experience I've ever had. The 45 minute wait to be seated to eat didnt bother me until I understood why. We (a group or five people-average) saw our waiter maybe two times while we were seated. The waiter was so unorganized he skipped taking my wife's order and she had to wait until the food that was previously ordered was all gone to place her order (with the missing waiter). After my wife received her order and she finished eating, we then had to wait well over 20 minutes for the check. We all walked out assuming the check was paid, but to my surprise it wasn't, they chased me down in the parking lot and the first thing that was said out of the servers mouth was, "I'm going to call the police if you dont give me your ID", what happened to "Sir, I'm sorry but the check was not paid". I spoke to the manager about the lack there of attention of his server, and his response was, "oh".For a restaurant with so many positive reviews, I find it hard to believe that we were the lucky or unlucky people to enjoy the wonderful food and experience (based on other reviews on yelp) the Las Vegas Firefly.As far as the food, I was sick shortly after leaving this location; but next time if I want to wait in line and be sick after eating I'll venture to the the Mc Donald's at the local Walmart for fried food. 1
4 stars for service; 2 for food on the day of that gets slightly better as leftovers.  I was really hoping that I was going to love this place because it's very clean, the owners/servers are very nice, and the overall feel of the place is better than many of the other Chinese restaurants in the area.  But I found the broccoli chicken and Mongolian beef to be very bland; the flavors only slightly perked up the next day when I ate the leftovers. 3
Antionette Morgan is an artist alright! A con artist! Alley kat sucks! I went in for one of their fake specials,And i paid the nominal fee . When I brought up a question about my design,the owner Antoinette Morgan blew up calling me a dumb bitch and then told me to leave. I said gladly, and that I wanted my refund. She called me an ugly bitch and told me to read the sign, which said no refunds! I didn't even recieve the tattoo! That place is evil and gives tattoo shops in that area a bad imag!                                                                          Katie b 1
My husband and I were so looking forward to eating at this restaurant.  The service was excellent and the ambiance was very nice.   I ordered the risotto with scallops.  The  two scallops were delicious, however, the risotto was crunchy and undercooked.  In addition, the dinner portions were tiny!  They were more like appetizer sizes.  I was overall very disappointed with the meal and will not be returning. 3
Beware prices on menu are less than those in computer. They are charging more than advertised. Mangers are aware an if you complain they will tell you to come back tomorrow?  Easy thing would be to fix issue then but no the manager tells me to bring my receipt back tomorrow to get the over charges refunded.  Why even have a manager?  So price for all American on menu is $5.79 for the 1/3 pound the computer rings up $6.39. Be sure to check your receipt then be prepared for an argument if you want it corrected.  They are aware of it because its now happen to me twice.  Tonight I just asked for my money back and left discussed with the ignorance of the manager.  06/26/15. 9:30 pm.  Should be zero stars cause its simple to treat people kindly.  They failed again............sad cause it seems they fail a lot at this location.........just go someplace else......not worth having to teach the manager how to do math...... 1
The food is very good and I really like the ambience.  Lots of choices for trying to eat vegetarian and they're willing to improvise the menu if there's something you want. I'm still not sure about it's location in Tivoli, which appears to be a shopping center with only restaurants (?). 4
This place really grossed me out. I had ordered a fresh coconut drink but never even took a sip when it came after seeing the waitress grab the ice cubes with her bare hands and tossing them into my drink. A waitress who handles money, cleans tables and takes away dirty dishes should NOT directly touch your food and drinks with her bare hands. This is how disease spreads.I was a good sport and decided not to complain because I'm not one to complain before my food arrives, if you know what I mean. A minute into my bun cuon, I pulled out a thick black hair. The food was mediocre. The place was comfortable because the air conditioner gave the place a nice breeze. The staff were generally pretty nice, despite the nasty surprises, which is why I'm not giving them a 1 star. But they really need to be more hygienic. 2
Boyfriend and I wanted something special, so when we saw that Hakkasan was located in the hotel we were staying at, we decided to try it out. Based on reviews, we tried their famous Duck salad with pomegranate, pine nuts, and sprouts The braised duck was super tender, but overly salty because of the sauce, but the pomegranate and pine nuts was a nice touch to the salad. The next option was the deep fried scallops with chili mango sauce which ended up being the only star dish of the night. You get a slight crispy outside with perfectly cooked scallops and the sauce was sweet and spicy. Boyfriend ordered the signature Hakkasan cocktail and that ended up being very delicious, so I would recommend it. Third dish was the pea sprouts and crab sauce which was very bland and didn't live up to it's hype. The crab sauce lacked flavor, so imagine a bland sauce on top of bland vegetables, it wasn't worth the price. The 4th dish received mixed reviews, we loved the tender and juicy fillet tenderloin, but we weren't impressed with how extremely salty it was. Supposedly their intent was to create an edible fried funnel cake like garnish under the tenderloin, but the batter was bland, hard, and inedible. When we told our server, he didn't even do anything about it or apologize! For the price we were paying, I expected better quality and service. To us, these dishes are described in an exotic way; however, if you really think about it, these are just typical Asian dishes that you can make at home. Overall, we were very disappointed with our food adventure and will only return for the scallops and drinks. 3
Love this place! It's just so good and fresh. Not too salty or heavy on the sauces. Have gotten take out each time, never have eaten in there. But, the bartender is awesome. My faves are the Butternut Squash Ravioli and the Spinach and Ricotta Cheese Ravioli. My bestie loves their linguini and clams. They load those clams on there! 4
Delicious! Seriously never had a better breakfast. The only reason it isn't 5 stars is because the female server was rude and abrupt. I noticed the other staff members were extremely friendly, but she was not. 4
I was contacted by a rep from the dealership She said that they thought I was happy with the deal on the alarm system.She asked what they could do to make me happy. I was told someone would contact me on 4-27 and I heard nothing from anyone.I placed a review on another website today and received a nasty call from a man. He was the one that give me a 1/3 of the money back. He said I bought the alarm system and initialed for it and no other dealer would of give any money back. I wonder if any other dealer would of sold me one knowing I already had one???.He then lied and said that they give me a set of running boards for the makeup of the cost of the alarm system also. I told him they did not that the running boards came in the deal with the truck and I have the paperwork to prove it. I have a work order dated the same day the truck was purchased to put the running boards on. It would of been hard to give them to me 3 days later when he give me the 1/3 of the money back.                                                                                       I told him I wanted to bring the paperwork down to show him and he said if I came down there today with it he would have me escorted off the property. He said he was busy today. He was not to busy to call me and yell at me for writing a bad review. I believe this gentleman's name was Jan and he said he was head manager today. 1
Very tranquil place to eat with a beautiful patio. The menu has a variety so no problem finding something that you'd like. Just right portions and can't beat the complimentary Champagne with brunch. 4
This is the closest Thai place to my home-convenient and acceptable but not the greatest. The atmosphere is brightly colored and cheerful (they remodeled a few years ago) and they can accomodate a group if you call ahead. They are efficient and accurate with carryout. The food is a little hit and miss (I think I got spoiled living on the West coast for years) and you might have to try a few different dishes until you find one they do well here. 3
My husband and I hired Up N Smoke for our wedding reception. They had catered my husbands work and before he even proposed he said that we should have Up N Smoke cater our wedding when that time came. SO when we were planning I made sure to hire them. I personally never tried it but I trusted my husbands tastes buds and I couldn't have been happier that we went with them. Rich was so fast to respond and to answer my questions. He was even willing to work with us around the timing of our ceremony and setting up the buffet, so we wouldn't be hearing clinging and clattering while we were saying our vows. Once everyone was served, Rich and his crew put all the left overs in tin pans and had everything cleaned up in a blink of an eye! All night I was hearing about how good the food was from all our guest, and I myself have been loving having the left overs to eat and enjoy for the last few days! I almost want to find another event soon to have to order different food from them so I can try out their whole menu!!! If you want great BBQ food, and have an amazing costumer service experience go with Rich and Up N Smoke!! 5
The place was fully booked and we didn't make reservations, so we sat at the full service bar. The bar tender Annahita, took wonderful care of us! Drinks were creative and paired well with the food, and holy crap the food! I recommend the tuna tataki as a small plate and the 49th state roll. By far some of the most creative and tasty sushi we've had in a while! 5
I went here for lunch one day, and it is excellent! I had a chicken bowl, and the chicken was sooo wonderful and flavorful. The service was good over the noon hour, and the decor and vibe was nice. I would go back for sure! 5
Underwhelming. I had a chocolate cupcake with peanut butter frosting. The cake tasted like a boxed mix and the frosting was runny and greasy. Half of it melted off my cupcake before I could eat it. They are definitely big but I'd rather pay the same for a cupcake half the size that actually tasted good, like one from Cookie and a Cupcake. 2
I stood at the FlamingHO in April with a group of guys, we got a Go Room Strip View- The room was ok, nice beds nice flat screen TV. The bathroom was weird, the door was like a shadow box thing, it was kinda weird since there was nothing but dudes in the room.The best part of the room was the Bose Stereo, you can connect your IPOD to this thing and it cranks! We had music blasting all night, never had security or neighbors knock on our door. The beds were comfy, I think I would pass out by the end of the night i think I would have been just as comfortable in the shower.THe Flamingo was ok, I hate their Casino.. HET table game suck, way tooo many 6:5 payouts total BS. Right next door was Oseahs, we played beer pong there, good drink specials and th vibe was prtty awesome met a lot of cool chicks there.  Once again the table games sucked ass. Nothing but 6:5 Tables.The only thing we ate at the Flamingo was Margaritaville, or however you spell it, drinks were pricey but it's vegas and the nacho chips were really good. If you go get the balcony view, you can drink each the nachos and talk shit about people as you watch them walk the strip. Good Times.We saw George Wallace while we were there, he is there Star Comedian Act. he sucked cock and balls not worth 90 Bucks.. If you're going to see a show see Vinnie FavoritoThe pool is great though, that's the best thing about the FlamingHO. Awesome pool scene.A lot of hookers who bother you in the late hours, that's a minus or a plus depending what you're looking for.Overall, Ok hotel would not stay there again because the Table Games at all HET properties suck ass. 3
We stumbled upon Udipi while traveling across Pennsylvania on a holiday. We couldn't have been more happy to have found an Indian restaurant not far from our path. We were concerned as we neared the location that the map might have been off as the building is set in a very unsuspecting location. The food was absolutely delicious! Both of our dishes were surprisingly spicy since they didn't ask about spice level when we ordered ahead by phone. We both like spicy food so it was perfect for us, but those who are sensitive to spicy foods might ask for their food to be mild. What a gem! 4
I love this place. I eat here anytime I go downtown for anything. Always get the Gyro with extra meat and sauce. So amazing. YUM! 5
I've been going here for years simply because of Heidi, she is amazing and super friendly. The reason I'm taking away two stars is because of how rude the front desk staff is. I've considered leaving just so I don't have to deal with their attitudes. The only reason I'm staying is due to the knowledge and care of Heidi. She goes above and beyond and I highly recommend her... if you can manage to look past how you are treated by the other employees. 3
Was in the neighborhood, so I decided to drop by again to try their  burgerStill had difficulty finishing the meal due to the sheer size of it, but can't really complain about the freshness of both the burgers and the salad.Customer service was ok 3
I like this tanning salon but THIS LOCATION is awful.  The "manager" older lady that is always orange/tan is way too pushy.  I have been there of a total of 3 different times trying to have her recover and each time she pushes and pushes for me a buy something else like a $50 lotion or higher level tanning package.  She acts like she is helping me out when i'm telling her that's not what I want at all.  I literally said you are not understanding me and she kept trying to push on the up sale.  NOT OK. so I walked out for the third time. 1
This is a neat hangout for craft beer people and slightly alternative people. I like the architecture, the decor, and the pool table (although I did not play). The beer list is impressive if you're into that. There does seem to be a significant emphasis on beer lifestyle. My husband and I went for Birthday Suit Burlesque on Friday, Sept. 21. The reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because the bartenders could have been a lot friendlier, and customer service is a big deal to me. We also found it tough to find a decent place to sit/stand to see the stage, unobscured. We watched most of the performances on the monitor behind the bar. I really liked that the monitor was there, but it seemed to cheapen the experience, it was like watching the girls on a security camera. Although I originally felt that I was among like-minded individuals, my husband and I got a lot of prolonged stares and then I felt like the place was really clique-y and probably not very hospitable to "outsiders." The drink specials made it relatively painless for us to drink there. We stayed for about an hour (even after paying the $6 cover) and left, feeling underwhelmed by the show. 3
I actually made a yelp account just so I can leave this comment this is how bad she was she came to my room drunk and high my room smells like weed my husband walked in our room  and went wtf this room smells like weed and she said oh my God you guys caught me I have a leftover joint in my pocket you guys want some. It was literally a freaking joke She didn't even do Me and my Sister-in-law's make up and hair all she did was put eyeliner on me all I gave her was $25 we were late for our concert to Celine Dion She ruined our night And I would never think it from her with all her reviews on here. for her to do something so stupid to be high and drunk to do somebody's make up and hair? And she also wanted my room key so she can go in the pool I was so scared I told her no 1
I was excited to try this place, but super non plussed by the food. Extremely pricey for a tiny, tiny bland tasteless burger. The fries were obviously from a frozen brand. The food was so tiny and bad that we actually went out AFTER eating there. We never went back. 1
After gown shopping in Los Angeles and Orange County for 3 months and not having the "this is the one moment" I made an appointment at Destiny's Bride.  My mom, my sisters and I were having a girls weekend in Scottsdale and wanted to gown shop for fun.  Residing in southern CA, we weren't planning on purchasing a dress out of state.  The boutique absolutely blew us away and the service was even better! Lisa, the owner, was amazing and it was by far the best customer service and experience out of all the high end shops I visited in CA. Lisa is extremely knowledgeable and was able to quickly pick out gowns for my body shape and taste.  She was honest with her opinion and took her time with me.  Photos of me in the gowns were allowed which I loved because this was not an option in Los Angeles.  I found "the one" with Lisa and because we paid that day in full, she offered us a 10% discount!The shop, selection and customer service were all A+ and I can't wait to return the shop for my fitting and to see Lisa! 5
Great drinks, prime location, and fantastic patio area. The bartenders are always incredibly friendly, and the drinks are usually pretty strong. I've tried the "Group Therapy," and it lives up to it's name--you need AT LEAST one other person for the drink. Not a place for dancing, but a great bar to hand out with a group of people. 4
I am kind of sad I am just now discovering Napoli, because wow! We ordered a pepperoni and cheese pizza, mozzarella sticks, BBQ wings and fries. Every single thing we ordered was delicious. I cannot give 5 stars however because some of the food took a really long time to come out, but the customer service was still fabulous. I will definitely dine again here. 4
the guys @ this location could not be more amazing!!  my daughter had a flat and needed to get to a performance and the guys at Metro opened the door shortly after they were supposed to close and put tires on the car for us immediately.  they gave us information regarding the safety of the type of wheels on her vehicle and made an extremely stressful situation sooo much easier.  I would absolutely recommend to any of you in the Phoenix Metro area that you choose this discount tire when in need : )these guys really went above and beyond for my daughter and I, personable, friendly and helpful even at closing time on a Saturday! 5
It was pretty good ! The carne asada plate was bomb... The meat could have been a little bit more tender but not bad at all.. I are everything lol.. And it's open all might I'll come back sometime when I'm near by 4
I just scrolled through previous reviews and read not so good reviews. I had the total opposite experience here.I got married on August 22, 2015 and decided to have our rehearsal dinner the day prior on August 21, 2015. We had been searching and "tasting" different restaurants on the strip being that many of wedding party were coming from out of state and we wanted to keep the dinner near their hotels. Our wedding reception was pretty formal, so after many taste testing ventures, we decided we wanted to hold our rehearsal dinner at a venue where everyone could mingle with eachother in a fun comfortable atmosphere.I remembered that we had taken my son to Senor Frogs for his 21st birthday. I contacted them by email inquiring about special events and I was immediately contacted by Denny. I requested to come into the restaurant after 5:00 PM to view the area of where we could hold our rehearsal dinner and he stated he would make himself available at any time. My husband and I visited that same night and knew the restaurant would be a perfect place for the atmosphere we were wanting! We held our rehearsal dinner for 30 people on August 21, 2015 and everything was set up as planned with food, tables, chairs, and was even accommodated when I had to add 6 extra people with the very little notice.  We chose to have dinner buffet style non-stop for 2 hours. Denny continuously checked on us to make sure everything was ok and our waitress Veronica (I think that as her name) was very patient with our large group! Thanks a bunch to these 2! :) The only complaint I have is the heat! lol We sat outside facing the strip, which was a beautiful view but hot, and although they provided misters and fans, we were sweating! August is a very hot month in Vegas, so I had I been a little bit smarter, I would've requested to be seated inside! I'm a local, so I should've known better! lol Overall, we all had a great time! :) 4
I love getting the bean and cheese burrito. Honestly that's all I get from here. The two times I've been to this location however, it's taken over 15 min to gets through the drive thru. Don't go through unless you have extra time. 2
2.5Tried a couple of item including the beef rice bowl, curry chicken, udon.The beef rice was dry, not much onion or sauce, the curry chicken was nothing special, have ate much better ones, the udon is average.  For the portion and quality, I would say the price is a bit high. The place is nice and clean. 2
Actually probably more like a 3.5/5The pizza is ridiculously cheap, however you're definitely going to want to get some toppings... I'm normally totally down with plain pizza, but their cheese and sauce are just kinda humdrum, and not quite good by themselves.Besides the pizza, I've only ever tried a calzone, and it was a bit undercooked. It looks like they have a lot of variety on the menu however. 3
This is a solid restraunt for a very nice lunch or a good dinner.  Great atmosphere and everything is a little better there. 4
The employees here are really nice, and the food always tastes great. They've always had the items I wanted (usually chocolate frosted doughnuts and vanilla iced coffee). I also come in with coupons (usually from their surveys) quite a lot, and they've never had a problem putting in the discounts or anything.I'm taking away 1 star for their track-record with messing up my orders. I've only had a problem once or twice with my order when I'm in-person at the counter, and it was fixed really quickly (they forgot to give me my doughnuts once, and forgot the coffee another time). But almost every time I got through the drive-through (about once a week), they seem to have a really hard time getting my order right. For example, the last time I went through, the guy was 100% stoned, and he not only a) forgot the doughnuts, but also b) forgot the flavor pump *and* cream in my coffee. I caught the doughnut issue, but didn't realize how badly he had messed up my coffee until I had already driven away.I'm taking away the other star because the wait is sometimes quite long; even when I'm the only one in the store, I've had to start eating my doughnuts while waiting to pay  because they're looking for coffee ingredients or helping people in the drive-through. There's sometimes only one person working even in the mornings, which can make things go quite slow!Overall, the food here is good, but you have to be patient with the wait and prepared to tell them to fix your order. 3
Really like this place and became one of my favorite's after my first time, I really like that they don't charge for gauc and sour cream. Like the family business service. 4
Been here 3x and no beef #45, will stop coming; what's the point if it's always out. Take it off the menu since it's never available. Portions getting smaller, prices going up. And the table that came after us got to order first. 2
Can I do zero stars and it still count as a review? Maybe it's not fair to rate this store, since I was there for 30 minutes and never got any help. How can a business have only 1 employee working a Saturday morning, a major home improvement day for the general working public?! It took the employee 15 minutes to acknowledge my presence only to say I'll be with you in a minutes, 15 minutes later with still no help I had enough. 1
Tried the benedict with tofu bacon replacement. Was tasty -and I am picky about benedicts-.  Potatoe latkes were good. The caramel/pretzel was tasty as well.The mango cold rolls were good. Meat muffins were not and a bit messy to eat.Nice decor. Loved the service. They tend to try new things or change some items in certain dishes from time to time which is refreshing. 4
Yes: clean, comfortable and quiet room, great view, friendly and competent staff, fast and tasty room serviceNo: parking expensive and terrible signage makes getting to and from garage confusing, pool out of order for Presidents' Day weekendI booked here because of the location near the university and the lake views. The Edgewater has a spa, but was hosting a youth hockey group event, which kinda killed the relaxing vibe I was hoping for. Since the spa was pretty much booked, I hoped to enjoy the pool, but that was closed. (To be fair, they removed the resort fee from my bill when I pointed this out).And that resort fee?  I really hate it when a hotel quotes you a price and then tacks on resort fee and other miscellaneous fees, in this case adding $28 dollars to the cost. Add $18 for parking, and the $140 room becomes $186. Just tell me what is the total cost up front, and I won't feel manipulated. 3
We were very intrigued by the  restaurant name & the dishes (named after politicians) & we decided to go. We were among the first few customers & locating the restaurant was very confusing. We did not see anyone & called out & then were given a table. It is very dimly lit & with the small space feels very dark. We ordered & very soon the place was full of people. The music was very loud & gave us bad headaches. We had Nikita, Das & Hirohito. One Burger & 2 Poutine  dishes. Food was pretty good & we enjoyed it. The desert we ordered Banana Split Ice creme . 3
I was introduced to Sunrise Coffee by a friend of mine. We'll just call him Shmorey Smurratt.  The most hipstering, skinny jean wearin, never heard of his music havin, indie book readin, fingerless glove using, riding a bike to school, taking close up pictures in weird angles, film school student being, messy hair and beard having, thrift store shoppin and super elitist i know.Well, he told me this place was good. I tried it. He was right. 5
This place is eggcellent (sorry had to do it)    seriously though, check this place out. Great food and good breakfast atmosphere. There are a ton of good choices, and the owner cares and is personally involved. 5
First let me start by saying that I have NEVER in my life written a bad review, but was shocked by how incredibly rude and borderline abusive the female groomer Dana was!!!! I made an appointment a week ahead of schedule only to receive a call from Dana a few hours prior to my appt asking me to reschedule because she had overbooked herself. I let her know that I would not be able to do so, and she openly, and loudly, sighed over the phone about my not being able to change to another date and time. When my fiancee went to drop off the dog, and was 10 mins late so refused to take the dog at all! I was confused and called to ask why she wouldn't take my dog and she said it was because my fiancee was 15 mins late and that "she can't help other people's mistakes". If you do not have a 15 min window as a groomer then obviously you are doing a shoddy job and rushing. I explained to her that I was a little taken back by her attitude to which she hung up on me! DO NOT take your dog here, she is a nasty person with a nasty attitude! 1
Sorry folks      they officially closed their door the weekwnd.    So you have to go to the Danforth for Thier amazing  gyros.   Most of the friendly staff  will also move there 3
Family owned.  Inexpensive. I call my order in and its ready in ten minutes.      Internet jukebox..  nice employees.   Ten times better than competition 5
Love this place! The boy and I came here for brunch this past Monday, and were pleasantly surprised. The omelet bar offers made to order omelets and eggs with a variety of filling choices, which we both opted for bacon and cheese and were cooked perfectly. There are a lot of different choices, which is great if your with a group or a picky eater, everything from pizza, Mexican to Asian cuisine and sushi. I only wish we more hungry when we came here. 4
Okay. So vegetarian doesn't mean anything here. Me and my wife have been vegetarian for 32 years (read all life) and our pick up order of Veg. Fried Rice had chicken pieces in it. In case you are wondering I repeated my order at least 7 times.Disgusted for life.... 1
Imagine those hardware stores you see on tv / movies where the you can go and know that you will get reliable help, well Rolliers is that place. The concept of customer service and expertise is not something of a past era. I have been here more than a dozen times for reasons and I have never left disappointed. I walked in with door knob pieces for a 100 year old door - not only did they know exactly what I was looking for, they had dozens to choose from to make sure that I had the exact ones I needed. I could only imagine the look of bewilderment that I would get if I walked into that big orange or blue "home centers" with the same questions. I have gone back since and will continue to go back over and over again because I trust what I am told when I ask questions - something that is hard to find these days. Yeah, some of the items might be a little more costly (not much from my experience) but that extra pays for customer service that you don't get from someplace that is concerned with shareholder profits. I would rather pay a little more and know that I am getting what I need for the job the first time rather than wasting my time over and over again. 5
I have to respectfully disagree with the first reviewer.  I had dinner at Asian Monsoon tonight and the food was really not good at all.I was with my daughter so I wanted something not spicy to share with her. It was clear in my questioning of the server that their sauces come in cans/bottles/vats because there was no chance of adjusting spiciness.  Her advice was to stick to something with no "chili pepper" symbol next to it.  Fair enough.  So I ordered ginger chicken.  The saving grace was that the chicken appeared to be white meat and the veggies were fresh, but it was exceptionally bland.  No hint of ginger, not even any salt.  Just a corn-starch thickened sauce (sauce being a generous word for the gelatanous film covering my food).One of my fellow diners has a bad reaction to MSG, and without recapping the whole conversation it was clear there could be no guarantees about the omission of MSG from any meal.  No report back from my companion on her post-meal MSG status, but she commented that her dish was quite dry and bland.  That explains all the dipping in soy sauce.Thai cooking is known for its balance of flavors--a mix of savory, sweet, sour, salty.  The mango salad, which is typically sweet and sour with some vinegar, was pretty much just sweet.  It wasn't awful, just not good.The service was good and accommodating.  My toddler made the usual mess, and I did the usual hands-and-knees routine to make sure toddlers remain welcome in restaurants, and the server was super nice in insisting she would take care of it.  It's definitely the kind of place that has a cook, not a chef, in the kitchen.  If you're really, really hungry and it's the only place open you may find something passable.  One of my other companions was happy with his meal, though I can't recall what he ordered. 1
Very good service,  good food. My only complaint is the loud echo of the room.  Seemed very noisy. Next time we'll bring our dog and sit outside. 4
Such a cool spot. Awesome atmosphere. Brunch is amazing. Great staff. They really go out of their way to make sure your experience at Heist is fantastic. The decor is really on point. They have a cozy upstairs lounge with couches and two open rooms for dining. An absolute highlight of Charlotte and a most go to if you are in the Noda area. Try the lobster Mac and cheese. So good! 5
Came here for brunch. I thought it was super overpriced at $35. Good selection, but the food was pretty average overall. 2
The staff was very rude - one guy in between, a non native English sppeaking man. I asked him a few uqestiosna dn he asked "what my point was". Not very friendship or helpful 1
Amber the bartender is awesome. Very nice and happy!  Plus the wings were super HOT unlike the other native I go to. I'll be back! 5
One thing Phoenix has in abundance is good Mexican food.  I mean REALLY good. So it's beyond me why anyone would settle for mediocre. Which this was.It was bland.  It was greasy.  The shrimp dish we ordered had no spice or flavor at all.  My chips were fresh, which judging by the rest of the reviews here was a lucky thing. A side of soft corn tortillas came pre-slathered in grease, for some ridiculous reason. And for what it was, it was terribly overpriced.  That's not to say it was expensive at all, but Filibertos is consistently better than this was.  Somehow the two green corn tamales I got to go were $10?  Give me a break.Yes, my butt shared the same space as Bush Junior's did (according to the plaque at our table), but that didn't enhance the experience. 2
Okay, for starters I myself am Mexican and I cannot stress this enough. This is NOT Mexican food. It was so bad. The food was overpriced, everything was bombarded with onions and bell peppers. The service was super bad, took my mom 15 minutes to get a margarita and that was because she called a waitress and asked about it. There were about 4 other parties there, so I do not know what could take so long. The band that played tonight was BAD. I'm all for giving local bands a chance but this band just seemed like a bunch of 30 year old hipsters that needed to prove they could still be in a band. I don't like trashing places but this place was just not a good experience. their water was probably the best thing there. oh, and parking is expensive too, so good luck if you decide to come here. 1
mediocre food, asshole servers (but thats the charm?) personally i dislike being treated badly, especially after 2 days in vegas, hungover, tired, and hungry... entertaining, but hope to NEVER go backhad very well priced special menu for sunday football some fat guy with a tattoo that said "TACO" on his beer belly was quite vulgar and unappetizing...he was also wearing a black thong which he proceeded to pull out of his pants so everyone could see the straps.... you looked better with your shirt ON buddy... yuk 2
I've been going to James for years and he does a really good haircut for a really good price. He delivers the sometimes odd descriptions of the type of haircuts I ask for - and I've worn it at all lengths and styles. I am a men's image consultant and I have sent my clients to James with good conscience, knowing that they'll get a great haircut for a great price.James rocks! 4
My son who is 11 just tried the gluten free pizza and said it was the best that he has had.  I have had the regular pizza md it was really good.  The customer service was awesome here.  We can't wait to try the sandwhiched next time.  I highly suggest Zella's. 5
Offers a good spectrum of specialty, artistic and cultural shops that carry a vast array of good quality gifts and accessories.  There are also some great restaurants in the array.  A little trendy but makes for an enjoyable outing. 4
I love Salad King!  It was my go-to when I was at Ryerson and I will still go out of my way to go there now.  I don't care if it's not exactly 'real Thai', it is delicious!  I always get the spicy tofu or the golden tofu and I have never been dissapointed.  Staff are really friendly too. 4
I hope management reads this... and our rating of the service is NOT about our waitress, Ms C - she was AWESOME!!! our complaint and it just set the tone - a bad vibe for sure was arriving 7:20 for 7:30 reservations... Very very long line at front check in, but hey it was a Saturday night... we get to the hostess stand and are told that they do not have a reservation for us and that it will be an hour wait... I told "Biotch #1" that I had a confirmation and she said that there was no reservation... then she said oh, our reservation is for 9:30 and that it would be an hour... I showed her the confirmation on my iphone... no matter, what was in the computer was what it was... I was furious!"Biotch #2" before she became a biotch 2 tells  biotch #1 to just change the reservation in the computer... wow problem solved yes - uh er no... in the meantime we see and hear other guests coming in with 7:45 reservations who get seated before us... WTF... really? I'm going postal now... Biotch #2 (who is now truly a biotch) says, they had earlier resi's than us... uh uh... I was standing right next to them and heard them check in... I would like to speak with the manager who I plead my case to, only to hear biotch #2 tell him that they have been trying to seat us and calling us but we didn't answer... FML really??? UGH set the night off to crappollazville...We get seated next and go to the back of the restaurant only to see 3 empty tables for two... that 2 of the 3 sat empty the rest of the night... OMG hello Management are you there??? What was the issue people?Ok, enough with the ranting... our server, Ms C was awesome... smart, funny, whitty... Food was perfect! We finally settled in and put the horrendous hostess f;up behind us and enjoyed a great meal... Notice we're not spending a lot of time talking about the food... Why, cuz it was Lawry's perfect! Somebody should have seen me eating off the bone, cuz it was not very gentlemanly... it was carnivorous.. Very reasonable prices when as it is off strip... Reasonable compared to hotel prices btw...Note to Management... training 101... "Oh, we're terribly sorry for the simple mistake Mr. F... here, we will have a table in just a few moments... thank you so much for your patience... "Note to Upper Management... fire lower management and the hostesses... 1
Felafel Friday! We used to eat here every Friday when we lived in the neighborhood and now make the trip across the city every few months to enjoy the excellent "Felafel Plate" dish. I've eaten felafel in many countries around the world, and this is definitely my favourite - crispy felafel balls and creamy textured tahini along with really fresh tabbouleh and lettuce/cabbage salad. I like a little hot sauce on top also. MmmmmmThey don't always have it available, but they used to serve a bread called "Manoush" (sp?) which was a round bread with Olive Oil, Za'atar (I think that this is an African or Middle Eastern type of Thyme and possibly Sumac (can't quite recall). Excellent and very unique flavour so if they have it....try it. 5
Decent prices for street food. The seating area is somewhat limited during peak dining times. It really irks me when groups of people come in and snag a table before ordering despite the long line. The seating issue would probably be better if they had a rule to order before sitting. Pork bowl was really good. Coffin toast is cute, but I was expecting a more robust flavor. Squid balls are a nice side. 4
If there is one thing I know... it's Mexican food.  I love me some Mexican.  But I was not real impressed with this place.  I didn't feel like I got my money's worth.  I had the chicken tacos.  They were OK.  I liked the salsa bar.  Overall, it was an "OK" experience. 3
I had a root canal done at another dentist office less than a year ago and had continuing problems with them so I called and spike with vickie the office manager she was very nice and empathetic and got me in the same day with Dr. Wandershafer they did a full exam and I had to have the tooth pulled.The staff was amazing very friendly and understanding my fears. The Dr. Was very gentle and has a very calming presence. I have finally found a dentist I like and trust. I would highly recommend  this office to everyone.. 5 star treatment 5
One of many race shops to visit. Have their own museum on premise with lots to see (and buy of course). The shops themselves don't have particularly great access to see what goes on, but can see some. It was one of the better places to visit overall. 4
I really wanted to like this place since I live in the area. Unfortunately, I've been there three times and each time the ice cream has been bland and forgettable. The salted caramel today actually had ice chips all through it and the "best" chocolate tastes different every time. Rather than the best, the adjective they should use is inconsistent. I'd rather go to a sporting event and pay 5 dollars for a lackluster soft serve cone. 2
Service was outstanding.  I ordered pasta arrabiata and it was quite good.  The coffee is very good here too along with the pizza crust. 4
Review solely on their English's cream tea ($20 pp from 1030a-6p).Located near Blue Martini in the alleyway where Capriotti is, came in on a Sunday afternoon with a party of 3. Read prior reviews and wasn't expecting it to be as busy but it was. We were asked if he had reservations and because we didn't, we had to wait about 15-20 minutes. So just in case, I'd recommend making reservations especially on weekends. Crowd dies down around 3/330 so if you go in then, you should be alright. I opted for the green tea tropical which was served immediately with a side of honey, sugar, and cream. Our tiers came in not too long after with the 1st tier filled with sandwiches, second with a plain scone and chocolate chip scone, then third with chocolate cream puffs, banana bread, and lemon macarons. 2nd and 3rd tiers are unlimited and you'll be given a side of whipped cream and house made jam.As far as the tea sandwiches, the smoked salmon and cucumber sandwiches were pretty good but the egg, and what seemed to be an apple sandwich were meh. I'm not sure what was going on in that apple sandwich but it tasted like a weird combo and the egg sandwich tasted a lot like mayo. Scones were actually good. Not too dense. The whipped cream was perfect with the chocolate chip scone and the jam was perfect with the plain scone. Top tier of desserts were okay but nothing to really rave about. They'll provide a box for any leftovers you have if you'd like to take them home.As far as service goes, it was actually good! We were expecting it to not be so great from what others have said but our server did his job well. He came in every now and then to make sure we were okay without being overwhelming, filled out waters, and refilled our teas. Plus, everything came out in a timely manner. Overall, my first high tea experience in Vegas was not bad at all. And for $20, I think it's pretty worth it. Place is cute and it's very fitting for some time with your girlfriends. 3
Food was Great. I order Lamb CousCous and my friend ordered Duck. It was rally good. Well cooked and delicious. The waiter was awesome. so friendly and kind 5
I parked somewhere I shouldn't have parked, and got towed. Ugh, my bad. But the experience actually was way better than I expected. Howard and his apprentice offered to pick me up and take me to their shop, since they were in the neighborhood, which saved me quite a hassle. He was professional and friendly (we had some time to kill as we went thru rush hour traffic) and I couldn't ask for anything more. 4
Swing and a miss! I am a 'cue person, but this poor pork was so dry it was almost jerkey. I had to swig liquid just to get it down. 'Nuff said. 1
Fabulous!!  Expensive, yes, but sooo worth it!  My friends and I make sure to schedule at least half a day here whenever we go to Vegas.  The Swedish massage is just heavenly.  I love the personal attention we receive when we go.  They have roman baths, hot, warm and cold ones.  There is also a huge hot tub, a sauna, steamroom, and my favorite - the arctic room.  i call it the snow globe room because its shaped like an igloo and has moisturizer bubbles "snowing" from the ceiling. 4
I've been coming here for a long time as it's the closest one. I must say that it's dirty and gross. The pool always something if it's a bandaid or just a fluff of dirt, it's always gross. There is nothing interesting in the pool. Very boring. Though it's a good time if you have good peopleThey do have a gym and workout room. It's always crowded in the workout room and you can never find a treadmill. The gym is full ALSO but there are some pretty chill people there. They added a piano upstairs which is nice. And I adore the jugo juice too. Though the library has outdated book but still good reads. Overall it's not the best place as it's also pretty expensive and boring but if you are looking for a place to just chill, Vivo is your place 2
I can honestly say Yay! I'm a fan.  The food is various and tasty.  The portions are correct, and priced accordingly.  I do find the 59 Cents for the soup mix-ins is a little pricy, but the soup doesn't need anything.  I think I may be cheating on my husband with the Thai Lobster Curry soup.If I could change anything, it would be for the staff to just chill out.  When I go, I have someone open the door for me, ask me if I need a menu, then the salad person is all chipper, etc.  Really.  Please chill.  You're freaking me out, man. 4
Looking from outside to in, I wouldn't have expected what I saw. Was brought to this place for the patio which you go up about 4 flights of steps and most of it is covered with sheet metal hence the name The Pilot Tavern...I honestly had felt like I was lining up at a Wonderland ride! Very interesting..they do continue the theme on the patio with great big fans and splashes of grey and wooden floor boards which move slightly when groups walk by. The atmosphere is really chill and it's about time Yorkville had a more casual place. Service was okay. But be weary on a hot day, the bathrooms are an actual sauna you don't wanna be in there for long! 3
I thought the pho here was ok. I came on a recommendation but didn't find the broth a standout. I did notice that it was empty at dinner time on a weeknight but filled up when we finished around 9pm. 3
ProsPrompt and friendly staff.Great Menu SelectionColeslaw is goodConsI had the special (2pc Halibut). It was terrible. Dry and Rubbery.Far too overpriced for the quality of food ($20)Sides were unimpressive. 1
Only been here once, but the food was excellent. I tried their pizza and salad, and my taste buds were on fire! Original taste, fresh and homemade Italian food. The staff were awesome too. Love the quaint location and atmosphere. Definitely coming back again! 4
My receipt shows a time stamp of 5:07PM when my order was taken. I pulled off into the parking lot so that I could figure out how to contact someone, because it was now 5:23PM. I cannot believe the level of complete disregard for me as a customer who has made MANY trips to this location in the past with friends and family. The person I initially spoke to was a girl (no name tag, did not get her name on the receipt, unless it it Dean F which is what it states) She got irritated with me when I did not look up long enough to watch her flip a blizzard upside down. I understand this is something they have to do, so I let that slide. TEN FULL minutes and a line of cars behind me, not a single person came back to give me the rest of my order. People looked at me as they walked by but no one ever questioned as to why I was still sitting there. Finally a very sweet girl (different from the first one) came and asked if I was still waiting for something. I said yes and requested to speak to a manager. He had a complete lack of interest in a customer requesting to speak to him (I watched him walk by three separate times). They were not busy beside the line that was accumulating behind me. Instead of even letting me tell him what my issue was, he said, "Receipt?" And waited with an open hand. I was flabbergasted. As someone in management for years, I worked my way through the toughest of guest situations with an empathetic and caring ear, regardless of how small it may have seemed to me. I stopped him and told him I needed to understand what the delay was. He sighed and asked "Can I just refund whatever your order is? We have a line." I couldn't help but laugh at him, thinking how if I had spoken to guest the way he spoke to me, my job would be on the line. You represent your team more so than anyone else there, and this is how you choose to speak/react? I recommended to him that he find himself a way to be re-trained because the customer always should come first, especially the one that has been waiting for upwards of TWENTY MINUTES when this was all said and done! He then CHOSE TO ROLL HIS EYES and said, "Alright, uh-huh. Thanks for the feedback," and laughed as he closed the window.FYI, I refused a refund and planned to just contact someone at the corporate level. Wether this location is a franchise or normal chain, it is absolutely ludicrous to me why he would have acted the way he did. This manager's name was Jeremy and if I had anything to say about it, he would be fired immediately. The entire rest of the staff would be better off with someone who understands the concept of real leadership. They could do with further training in how to properly handle any type of guest situation as well. 1
It seems we had a one time bad experience this past sunday. The Tuscan Salad was good but the Nonna's Margherita pizza was very soggy and tasteless. We could see the basil but there was no taste. We told our server ?Brent? but he didn't really seem to care. He brought us our check instead. Having lived around the US including Brooklyn and having italian pizza in Italy, we won't be returning here. I'm glad others haven't had this experience. The prices like most things in Vegas are inflated. 2
Had the Hoover Dam tour.  The tour of inside the facility were done by the local guides who are not affiliated with Pink Jeep.  We basically got dropped off with the new guides, picked up when we were done, and walked around on the outside of the Dam.Pros: Friendly tour guide - accommodating, eager to answer questionsCons: Uncomfortable suspension on the car; at $86 per person, it lacked some value, especially since most of the tour was done by the local guides ($30 per person and $7 parking if you go there yourself), got separated from the group because the guide wasn't part of the inside tour to help keep everyone together. 3
Over all I like it, but its not going to be my main grocery run. I like having all the organic options, especially for the produce, beans and grains. I hate the parking situation, and their prices are significantly higher than I expect, even for organic. 3
My two friends and I got free passes to The Bank and were super stoked.  Then we each got 3 free drink tickets which we were also stoked about.The environment seemed nice, dark and fun.However, after being there for awhile, we noticed the ambiance wasn't quite right. It had a really strange mix of people in the club and the music was just not upbeat enough. I was not feeling it.My heels were hurting my feet from dancing and walking all over Vegas, I took them off. Then, I got yelled at from some security guy working there to put my shoes back on. That was nice...After we each got a free drink (limited to simple drinks), we went up for round two. However, the free drink tickets ended at midnight. Soo... after already ordering a drink I said, oh well, I'll pay for it anyway. I ordered a red bull and vodka, ran my card through and went to sign the bill which was $19!!!! FOR ONE DRINK?!?! I mean I know Las Vegas is over priced but REALLY? I then refused to pay for the drink, especially since I originally thought it was going to be free. The barmaid told me i would have to leave or else they were going to call security.........I said, "Well we were planning on leaving anyway!"So we left.I would not recommend this place to anyone. Yeah its free to get in and you get free drinks till midnight, but who isn't drinking after midnight? It sounds like a ploy to get you drunk and then get you to spend way too much on drinks at a crappy club. 1
First and foremost, get the seasoned potatoes! They are the business.Kalila and I came here on Valentine's day morning and the place was packed.Kalila really enjoyed The Green Scrambler. I don't remember if that's the right title, but it was the last item on the SCRAMBLERS section of the menu. It had spinach, broccoli, and other vegetables in it. She was so happy with her choice!I had the big bad wolf. It is the equivalent of a meat lover's pizza, but for an omelet. There's bacon, ham, sausage....Everyone has to try to coffee cake side at least once (served as an option next to buttered toast)This place is always busy and plenty of times there will be a wait. The time you lose in the wait, you make up for in how quickly your food comes out.All of my servers have always been very nice and friendly. 4
Classic Tempe location should not be confused with quality food. Bad chips, chicken cheese crisp was mostly salt, guacamole tasteless, and did I mention too much salt. Service however was great! 2
(I was a tourist to Vegas and came with about 10 guys) Don't expect to get served if you come in at 4am.  We left because they didn't want to serve us.  Didn't take any order for drinks or food.  Didn't even bother to properly seat us.  Just grabbed the menus and placed it on the table without telling us to follow.  When we asked if we were suppose to be seated, he gave a light nod so it was hard to tell what he wanted us to do.  His communication skills was lacking as if he didn't want us there.   After 15 minutes of being ignored, we left.  I don't know what their problem was but if you're going to open a restaurant until 5:30 am in the morning, you should treat all guest like they are wanted there.  Don't be surprised if any of the other 10 guys from my group rates your restaurant with a 1 star. 1
On time and reasonable service fees.  Seems to listen to what customer wants and knows what he's doing.  Quite friendly but professional.  Also seems thorough but takes his time; for the work he did for me, could've taken about 20 minutes at the most, since he basically fixed the drip by exchanging parts in the faucet but ended up spending an hour.  Just a note; he charges a separate visit fee in addition to his hourly rate. I didn't complain since when I called him I thought it was for a bigger problem and turned out it was nothing.  Overall, it wasn't a bad experience. 3
Review for Large Groups (15-20)If you make a reservation for a large group here, be prepared to wait a very long time in order for them to put tables together. Also be prepared to be very hungry since they will take their time to prepare all the steaks and serve them together.Food: The steak was fine. After waiting so long though, I could have probably eaten shoe leather dipped in au jus and would have been happy. For the price I paid, I wish I could tell you that it was the best steak I ever had, but it wasn't. Service: Man, these guys are great, except when they have to serve a large group. There will be miscommunications that will lead to overcharges. Should you be so brave as to go in a large group, I recommend placing one person in charge of communicating with one waiter, after everybody orders initially. Ambiance & Decor: It was dark and I was way too hungry to take note of it and to care.Summary:Food: Steak. Service: Get it together, people. Ambiance & Decor: Hungry people don't care. I would not recommend the experience of eating here in a large group, but if you do, please make sure you have effective communication with the wait staff. 3
I called to inquire about Valet Parking and was told that they most certainly offered Valet parking services.  Needless to say they do not.  I was told by the hotel across the street that they tell people that all the time so it won't keep people from coming.  Also, the food is average. 2
This place doesn't seem to know what it is and has taken on too many things, all of which are done poorly. The food is bland and tasteless and overpriced. $6 for a mediocre latte? The market carries a random assortment of useless iyems. Avoid. I hope it closes and a better restaurant takes the good location. 1
Great place, great people, great food, great wine. I thought these kind of places, where people really enjoy their meal and are happy about being here, existed only in Europe. Wrong. There's at least one in Toronto. A little expensive for me, otherwise I'd be there every nights. 4
Excellent food and very nice extended menu for veggies. I tried majority of pasties here and liked lot of them. Chicken tikka pasty is my favorite. Pesto and rosemary chickens are also my favorite. Cream of Tomato with croutons is by far one of the best soup I had. Chocolate Bread and Butter Pudding formerly known as Temple pudding  is heavenly and must  try. 4
Excellent care and grooming. I live in CA but my parents and animals live in Vegas and this is the animal hospital for people who love their pets as if they are family. 5
Don't be fooled by getting cheaper tickets, you will pay more for your luggage anyways, either check in or carry on.Not to mention the worst possible customer service I've ever experienced in all 3 airports I went to. Not only were the people at the check in rude and unwilling to answer any questions I had, but when I simply asked a girl at the gate when my flight would leave (my flight was delayed 4 hours because of issues with a door not shutting properly, not anyone's fault) she rolled her eyes at me and mumbled "Don't know...". I understand some people might not like their job, but being rude to a customer is not acceptable, especially if I'm being nice and understanding about the situation.I would rather pay more money on US Airways and have a more enjoyable experience than ever fly with spirit again. 1
Great service! My gel manicure lasted weeks longer than any other place. I'll definitely be going back. 5
I had to have my rental property rekeyed. The office people on the phone were very nice  and very professional. They were able to take care of business really fast. 5
Let me start by saying I love the food here! However, I came at 2:30 in the afternoon, the restaurant was practically empty, yet it took over 10 minutes to order and pay for my food. I go to find a table and literally, every table needed to be cleaned! I get my drink and utensils, and there are no forks stocked. Then after I was done with my meal, the garbage cans were overflowing and I couldn't throw my trash away! The cleanliness and customer service and terrible. 3
Best thai food I've had in Toronto (and yes, I've been to Sukho Thai, Pai, Khao San Road, etc.)  I will definitely come back! 5
Had the curry bowl today with saag paneer and beef madras, plus naan. The whole wheat naan was not bad for whole wheat and was lightly toasted to warm up. Saag paneer was delicious, but wish there was more cheese pieces in there. beef was tender with nice spice. 3
I would have given this a five stars because the food is beyond very good. The only drawback is the noise level inside if not too hot sit outside in the shade. We split the Eggs Benedict and the cinnamon biscuit strawberry capote, both great taste and flavor. I'm not a big fan of breakfast potatoes but these were great my wife didn't want the iced tea because it was flavored. I like it really well.Paid parking on the street. Don't let this part of town scare you away from a great breakfast. 4
I'm from Cincinnati but working in Cleveland and was searching for a "sushi" buffet.  Regrettably this was the 5th entry and shame on me for not looking closely enough at the description.  Needless to say, upon arriving I was terribly disappointed to find no sushi.  Just an average chinese buffet.  The hot and sour soup was good.  The eggrolls, not so much.  The selection of entrees was good and everything was reasonably well presented but nothing really stirred my imagination.  So, I had stir fry prepared on the mongolian grille, which - despite having only 5 sauces and a very limited selection of veggies - wasn't too bad.  All-in-all, if chinese is how your pleasure tends, then you probably won't be disappointed.  However, if it's sushi you seek: look elsewhere. 2
Very small family run restaurant... with not much uniqueness of dishes. Ordered many "different" foods just to find out that they were all the same as in they used the same sauce in every dish and stir fried everything. The only significant difference i could see was they they used different vegetables... other than that... they all tasted the same. A LOT of MSG was also used in their foods which made my mother sick. I will definetly not be going back. Worst Vegetarian Experience. 2
The food was disgusting , I haven't eaten anywhere so terrible in a long time.  Sadly the burger was the worst part of the meal.  It not only looked disgusting but tasted that way too. 1
Good kulcha...chat is good but not as good as the regular thali dishes. Friendly staff. 4
We went here for the oysters and were impressed. We ordered Shucker's Best Mixed Plate (12 oysters) and ended up getting 6 more because they were so good. We had a 1 year old and 9 year old and they both got mac and cheese (with bacon), which was delicious (lots of flavour). Our server was great too! Her beer recommendations were solid and she suggested a Shirley Temple for our son, which he loved! We will definitely be back, especially when we want oysters. 4
I can't even put into words how bad they messed the super bowl up today. My own story and the stories of others that were also picking up... insane. NEVER going here again and making sure everyone i know NEVER goes here again. What a shame and embarrassing establishment. 1
My work has used this company in the past but recently, we had rented from them for a large event and the rep who I spoke with first was fine, BUT the other one who I spoke with a couple days later for questions, and who called to confirm was very rude and had a very condescending tone. So much so, when I decided I needed extra linens we rented from another company. I have to say, the rentals from Party People did come on time, the set up crew was fine, BUT the rudeness of the customer service rep from the store is definitely the reason why we will use another company next time. 1
My favorite place to go! I like my nail long and am super picky! Cindy and Steven never fail to amaze me! I also love their pedicure selections 5
Must echo Brian O. about the lack of circulation in the booth area. Not good when the temp is 113 degrees, no matter how many times the server refills your water. By the way, our service was good and efficient, and we liked the guacamole prepared tableside. Also, we liked the many vegetarian options and the way the shrimp tacos were prepared. I hardly ever venture out to Glendale, but at least now I know of a decent Mexican restaurant there. 3
I just went to get my nail done. I did gal nails with designs on my ring finger and it only cost me $22 because they give you student discount if u go to UNLV  It's amazing!!! Everyone should go there 5
I wish I had read the reviews before booking Drink & Dial...  I requested a quote 2 days before a wedding.  They quoted me at $102.00.  They told me to MAKE SURE I had my phone on me between 11:30pm and midnight (when they were supposed to pick me up), which I did.  No one called me.  At 12:30am I called to find out where my driver was and they put me on hold.  They said their "system crashed" and they'd have to take my info again.  The man on the phone was condescending, arrogant, and spoke to me like I was a child.  Instead of apologizing profusely for their error, he continued to argue with me. If I had been alone this scenario would have also been a serious safety concern.  Finally, 2.5 hours late, someone showed up.  Though the driver was nice enough, he charged me $144.00 when we got to my home (no heavy traffic or detour or anything that may have caused this increase), how did it jump from $102 to $144!?  This was in no way "comparable to taxi rates", as they claim on their website.  I paid the fair to avoid further aggravation, but I will NEVER use this service again.  In addition, I will be telling ALL OF MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY to NEVER use this service.  UPDATE:  This company threatened legal action if I didn't remove my Google review and then charged my credit card anyway.  I have now paid this company $265 for a 33km trip.   I also called them to see if they had plans to return the money they stole from me (I had to leave a voicemail because no one picked-up), and no one returned my call. 1
Use another company. There are too many companies out there that will appreciate your business, keep you posted about your belongings and care about providing good customer service.So many issues, no consistency, poor communication and no solutions. Told belongings would be stored in a warehouse in same state we were moving to(even went as far to give us an address, name and number to manager of storage place) but belongings ended being stored in the state we moved from. At least we thought; the driver of the truck stated that he picked the items up in a completely different state. Changed delivery date on us three times. Which made it very difficult to schedule other moving help. Their mentality is, "We've got your stuff so not our problem". Multiple items broken. Riding lawn mower stored upside down and broken. Rocking recliner broken, multiple plates, chair backs completely snapped in half. Boxes of another persons home were mixed in with ours and movers almost gave us their boxes. So no telling if we got all our belongings. Choose another company. 1
I've had a plain pizza and a lamb gyro, both good. As they market the coffee too, I thought I'd stop in for a cup. I ordered a small iced coffee and waited for over 10 minutes for it. Not sure how it would have gone had I ordered a more complicated espresso drink. Stick to ordering food here. 3
Their turkey club croissant is amazing. Such a good lunch stop! 4
This place had horrible customer service . The manager / owner had me on wait for 10 plus minutes with out even apologizing and was overly rude ... they messed up my last order as well with being 30min late and food was cold....! Places like this need new manager/ better owner-ship because if that was the manager on the phone then contact better Business Bureau ASAP people 1
Thumbs Up is a good place to enjoy some Korean cuisine if you're not looking for fancy surroundings. It's sparse where the kitchen takes about  1/4 of the restaurant, so overall the place can hold about 20 people.I ordered the Pork Bone from here and found it to be okay but definitely not the best as people have stated before me (beef was tender but I thought the broth could have been more flavoured). I assume what's good about this place that keeps people coming back for more are the huge portions, low prices and super friendly staff. Dishes are about $5 - $7 each and a side of kimchi and pickled daikons are always refillable.Yup, A great place for a cheap fixed meal. 3
Very cool place, they've decorated well. It's the type of ambiance you'd expect from a plateau restaurant. Good diversity of foods and cocktails, service has always been good for me (been there 4 times). Great for brunch ! 3
Playa Cabana Cantina was packed when we went for dinner. The food was good, even borderline great because it's difficult to find authentic Mexican food in Toronto. I recommend the chicken tinga which is a chipotle and tomato based pulled chicken dish served in tacos, enchiladas or a burrito. The tortillas used for the tacos had been fried so they were a little bit crispy which was nice. The service was passable but we certainly didn't feel like they were happy to have us in their restaurant. Normally I would expect recommendations of which dishes are popular and daily specials. Our server made us feel like she was doing us a favour by serving us as she didn't think to come and ask us how our food was until we were almost done, then we had to flag her down to order more food. We were not offered hot sauce and figured they probably didn't have any until we saw some on other tables as we were leaving. Granted, they were quite busy. Prices were a bit high for what they serve and the portion sizes however I think they're mostly justified given the quality and taste of the food - except for the dessert. We paid $10 for a pastel tres leches which was little more than a small slice of glorified pound cake with a scoop of ice cream. I lived in Mexico City for five years and am familiar with what a good pastel tres leches should be. This was not it. Perhaps we should have tried the churros poutine which looked great. I would definitely go back to Playa Cabana Cantina, perhaps for lunch instead of dinner to enjoy a less hectic atmosphere. The food was enjoyable and I'd like to try more of their menu. With better service I would feel more comfortable paying these prices for tacos. 3
Outrageous prices. Bagels are ok. The "extras" like cream cheese are obnoxiously priced.  1 croissant and 1 cinnamon roll costs over $5.50. These are the same croissants that sell for about $5 a dozen at Costco. Basically, expect to pay airport or amusement park prices for mediocre fare. Even though they are less than 1/2 mile from me, I will drive 10 minutes elsewhere to get a bagel. 2
The other location has seemed to close, (noticed while walking to pizza place next door) saw that coming! Don't waste your time over paying for this food. Not very good customer service either! 1
Great place to watch a game.  On Sundays they have a make-your-own Bloody Mary bar which is outstanding.  They are also cheap-- $4 (I think) and also have a Mimosa special.  I have not eaten a meal here.  I have had the pimento cheese dip (which was an awful consistency-- think not-all-the-way melted Velveeta), I have seen the wings, and had a various assortment of fried bar food.  It was all fine.  My friends thought the burger was delicious-- both were suffering from the liquor flu so I am not trusting their judgment 100%.The service here has never been good.  The location works.  The back patio is fun (has its own bar) and the Bloody Mary bar is fun.  This is a place to go and drink, not go to eat.  And don't be surprised if you have to get your own drink from the bar because your server is no where to be found.Maybe I am just disgruntled.  I miss the Press box being here... 3
What does an IB do when are owed more on a partial casino/hotel than they can sell it for.... they run it themselves. Good luck DB AG! 4
777 is all you need to know when visiting Mr. Lucky's.I had heard from a friend about this off the menu deal that gave me a steak, 3 shrimp skewers, and some mashed potatoes, BOMB.com for the $7.77 price tag.  AND there's nothing a little A1 and ketchup couldn't fix. For what it is, I can't complain.  You get a whole lotta bang for not a lotta bucks.   I say you pocket the savings and go help support the local dance bars, win win for all. 4
Very atmospheric coaching inn in the centre of Whitby. Food is erratic in quality: can be very good or very average. Best stick to the tried and trusted favourites such as fish pie and fish and chips. 3
We enjoyed our Red Rock Canyon tour with Casino Travel & Tours.  Our tour guide was Jerry- he made sure we were all comfortable, and he told us lots of fun facts during the six-hour tour.  I personally think that going on a guided tour was better than renting a car and driving out.  Since it was our first time in Vegas, our guide also gave us a lot of good advice about how to get around in Vegas and some good spots to check out.  I would recommend this company! 4
Sumits is the best hot yoga studio around!  The instructors are all amazing. The class times are great for those who are busy & need lots of choices. The studio is very clean & a great environment. 5
I really liked it, they don't have as many teas as Davids tea but the atmosphere is better. Its really cozy and they have more of a selection of tea pots then Then davids tea which I like, because I have a thing for tea pots for some odd reason. They re not as friendly but that dosent even bug me, because I find the people at davids tea to be WAY to perky, and talk waay to much. I proably sound weird complaing about that but when I have my headphones on please dont bug me, I can read lables ( learned that in grade 2!), and I can speak when I want something so I will perk up Im interested in a tea. I'll be back forsure, 3
Terrible. Ordered a cab to get to the airport. We were told 10 minutes. 15 minutes later I called to get an update, two blocks away they said. Another 5 minute passes, nothing, call back. Oh oops "something" happened they had to dispatch another cab. I ended up cancelling all together. This is exactly why other cities welcome uber! 1
????sushi all-you-can-eat, fountain soda included 3
This is review #1 in my Summer of 2011 Search for the Best Burger. It's Saturday and at 12:01 PM, we are already lined up at the Priest. It's cozy, nuff said. The smell is great, just enough to start the salivation process. The fresh meat is nicely formed into balls up, as each serving awaits it's transformation. I chat with some other patrons, it must be my good looks, because others are asking me what this is and what that is. I reply quickly, I am a Burger Priest virgin. I order a double-double for my significant other and 'The Priest" for myself. Somehow this seems wrong, given my strict catholic upbringing and years as an alter boy. Then my world is shattered. The mushroom fryer is broken. OH THE HUMANITY. So I opt for the double-double and an order of fries. I go for tomatoe, onion and mayo. Let the burger sing it's own song people. It's juicy, the meat flavour is there. Nice crisp on the patty and a minimal bun. It's good, but where are the angels, the path to the white light? Still waiting. Could you and I make these burgers at home? Of course. Is this the holy trinity of meat, bun and add ons, as others have stated? Not in my opnion, or at least not yet. Are they good, absolutely. Eating out is not just about convenience, we are after all, social creatures. It's partially the experience and the thought that an individual at the stove will take our taste buds and our spirit to another level. I will be back at "The Priest" someday and am looking forward to giving them 5 stars. God willing. Namaste. 3
Go here now.Sit at the bar.Don't look at the menu.Order the fish tacos.Enough said, great quality, reasonable price, for an airport, one of the best I've had anywhere in NA. 4
Busy place, but they took me rather quickly and the lady did a great job on my pedicure 4
I had family over and my husband suggested Seafood City. To my surprise, there was now a food court area. The BBQ pork and chicken was absolutely delicious. I would recommend to try this. It reminded me when I was back home on Guam. That is how good it was. I also tried  a side dish with coconut milk and bamboo shoots.(I honestly forgot the name) but it was a dish that I haven't had in years. That was delicious too. 4
Let me preface this by saying that over the years I have wanted to sign-up for yelp but have not for one reason or another. I would never want to publicly say something mean about a place of business; however my experience at Garage Boutique left me no choice but to sign-up and post a review. I have never, in all my life, been treated the way I was treated in this store. Picture Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman on Rodeo Drive; however a. I am not a hooker and b. Garage Boutique is not a shop on rodeo drive. The only similarity is the snotty, arrogant, rude manager/owner-whatever she might be.  I was not looking to simply browse that day.  I  was on a mission for a few gifts and found them in this store. Never-mind making a purchase, the sour customer care made it impossible for me to actually give this boutique anything more then a look of shock at their nightmarish treatment of potential customers. Simply put, do yourself a favor and shop somewhere else. All their designer merchandise can be found online or in stores that actually represent the kind people of Arizona and not the vapid management from the Garage.  I am returning to Arizona with a group of girls who are pregnant/have children. We will not be going to this store; which is a shame because they did have some cute things. On principle, I refuse to give them any business. There are better stores in Arizona that do not operate under the premise that you should feel honored to be able to shop in their store. Business must be good to treat people the way they do. 1
Tried this place for the first time on Friday night. NoWait app is the way to go. We were seated right away. I immediately noticed how loud the music was. Luckily it was just my boyfriend and I but I could barely hear him across the table. Wasn't a fan of two beers I ordered and one Mindful brew I really wanted wasn't available. Next time I'll do the samples. Nachos (with turkey chili) were not good at all. Buff chicken pizza was tasty and the only thing I enjoyed. Too loud, felt too jammed, and wanted us in and out. I won't be returning for a while. 3
Horrible. The smart ones have closed their account. Tellers don't know how to read a day drop envelope that clearly reads MORTGAGE PAYMENT in front and back with the full loan number on it. Money was sitting in the account and in the meantime my mortgage was late. This has happened 4 times. 4 TIMES. Manager doesn't take accountability for the lack of attention to detail of his staff or their errors.  Tried to blame me because they didnt believe I put anything on the envelope. Account numbers and account holder names sitting all over Christopher the teller's desk. People wonder why your accounts are compromised? Manager saw it and did nothing. Be smart take you money out and run. 1
We had lunch today in hopes of an improvement from our last experience. Unfortunately it was even worse. The chicken was really off! We're convinced it was at least a day old and microwaved to a point of dusty and powder dry in my mouth. We told the server and she just gave us a blank look. The place was totally full with 6 people. They should just bow out gracefully and shut it down. The question is, what is really going on? Two words sums up this place, don't go! 1
The worst meal I have ever had....suffered with food poisoning for two days. Suggest a new Chef!  No rating deserved! 1
Food was great and beer selection was alright. Great place to watch the Panthers game. 4
I had been here before it's an ok buffet for dinner in Vegas. It's a good place for when you just get off the plane and are ready to eat.  Atmosphere is not really a good thing for Vegas was hoping for  a little more atmosphere for the price. 2
This place is an absolute gem of the bar scene in toronto. Incredibly hip and minimalist, with an almost claustrophobic atmosphere when full. That tight feeling however makes it feel warm and cozy, and with the dim lighting and walls adorned with signs and knick knacks this places charm has fully won me over. It takes some time to get your pint refilled, but the wait is worth it, with a sincerely eclectic lineup of both microbrews and classics. Hit up the atm, squeeze through the crowd, and sip down some tasty suds....this place cannot be missed 4
This was the first shop I decided to try wedding dresses at I had no idea what I wanted and i guess that if your a bride who doesn't know what you want or what your looking for this is not the best place to start the ladies were really helpful but having to pull dresses on your own is so overwhelming there we're so many dresses and they all looked the same I tried on about 5 dresses and sometimes found myself needing help to either put them on or take them off so that's another thing if you are going don't go alone and go with someone your comfortable with that can help you get in and out of the dresses overall I left there feeling overwhelmed and with the thought that I was not going to ever find a dress because I hated how I looked in each one of the ones I tried on I would say go here after you have gone to other places to look and know exactly what your looking for 3
Came here yesterday, Sunday for the first time w/friends. Ordering of food was easy & food was good overall. Potatoes came out cold & waitress thought our friend was kidding about getting new hot batch. She did oblige. My husband & I each ordered a meal & water; came to $27 which was quite pricey. May go back but no gua 3
I've eaten at Bad Daddy's a couple times. Always a great atmosphere, great burgers and salads, and good service. Gotta try their Ghirardelli chocolate and peanut butter milkshakes!! 5
I used to love this place but then I had some 2 bad experiences.  The first time I got a take out and when I got home I (about 15 min later) I opened the food box and my bread was wet.  When I say wet I mean wet like soaked- ughhh.Since I had great experience in the past, I went again and this time I got  food poisoning and spend the whole day in the bathroom-double ughh. I must say one great thing about them is their juices and coffees I would stay away from their food though. 1
I had no complaints. They were prompt, friendly & did a great job on my hair. Reasonably priced. I will definitely be back. 5
Awful! She spent 5 minutes with me!  She rushed through visit and showed no compassion whatsoever. Never listened to me and claimed I've tried "everything" and didn't think she could help.  She is one of the worse providers I have been to, hands down. Also she refused to do MRI even though I have PA for years. she ordered X-Rays of parts of body that I have no pain. Very weird.  My Physical therapist was surprised by her lack of care. rude and unprofessional. Of all things she rigorously shook my hand-- knowing I have terrible hand/ joint pain. Really??   Just goes to show, her level of ignorance. 1
This is one of the few times where Yelp mislead me. The food overall was meh. I ordered the mixed platter but the beef was overcooked. The chicken was better but still a bit too tough. At least the rice, white sauce, salad and bread were excellent and very fresh.The beef was so overcooked that I had to toss those pieces out. Also, the lady that worked there hardly made any eye contact with me. It was hard to tell if she was speaking to me or the chef as she would look down when speaking.I give this place a 2.5/5 but rounding up to 3. 3
This store is so awesome! I can't believe I had never been in until now! I never realized it was there but after finding it on yelp and reading all of the excellent reviews, I had to stop by. They definitely do deserve their 5 star rating! You could spend hours looking through their walls of beads and charms! Helen was so very helpful and friendly. She pointed me in the right direction of everything I was looking for and spent time telling me all about their products and the quality way in which some of their beads and charms are made. They also offer a discount once you spend a certain dollar amount and the discount increases the more you spend. This will definitely be my go to bead store! 5
Buy a mop, hire a janitor, please do something.  I love the food, drinks, location and vibe but I'm giving up after being a regular customer for 3 months!  It's gross.  Tables are sticky, railings and fixtures are covered in a thick layer of dust, the floors and stairs look like they have never been swept much less mopped.  Swarms of fruit flies around the dish return and trash cans.  Today the flies drove me to the competition and I won't be back. 1
Was at the Cafe Monarch last May and it was a wonderful experience so decided to go back since we were in town again. This time was not so good. When I had reserved I stated a preference for inside but when we got there I was asked if I wanted inside or out. That would lead me to believe they did not bother to read the booking preferences. The soup was overly salty as was the salad dressing. The main courses were fine but I had to remind the waiter to bring me a glass of wine I had ordered. Dessert was fine but not a knock-out. These might be overlooked in a less costly place, but at these prices one does expect a higher standard. 3
Absolutely awful experience! If I could give no stars I would! This used to be my favorite nail salon, but since the new owners took over it has gone downhill. The customer service is horrible, and their services are shoddy at best. It took a total of 7 minutes for my pedicure from start to finish....i was cut twice on my cuticles, no callus treatment, and no massage. Apparently a pedicure now consists of soaking feet and painting nails only. I will be on the hunt for a new salon. Never coming back to this one! 1
I've been here dozens of times over the past few years. This place is good, but it has a few annoying qualities.Pros:The food is delicious. The prices are reasonable. The staff is friendly and efficient.  Also, the free peanuts are a plus.Cons:The buns at this location taste weird. I've eaten at other Five Guys locations and the buns at this one just plain taste weird. I don't know why.The tables are dirty. I don't like sitting down to a table smeared with someone else's cheeseburger-grease. This, plus the loud crappy music being blasted, means I'm not taking anyone here for a date, or on any kind of business lunch.It's dumb that they serve all hamburgers in a brown paper bag. I know it's probably part of some silly tradition, but the bag means that the tables get messy because you have to rip open the bag and grease goes everywhere. Also, the fries and bun get soggy inside the bag.  Note: this does not happen on a McDonald's tray.If the restaurant would change its dumb, backwards policy of serving all food in ghetto paper bags and the workers would wipe down the tables more than once a year, this place would be a five-star restaurant, easy. 3
Eating in. Bring a parka. No seriously. This place is freezing. The food mediocre. The service, not so good. Coffee was not even made when we arrived at 6:15 PM. Salt, pepper, sauce.....etc are available at the courtesy area. Are you kidding me. It should be on the tables. They apologized for the service, because it 'got kind of busy'. What!!! Welcome to the restaurant business, you WANT to be busy. Two couples left while we were waiting and they were ordering take out. If there is a way to order ahead of time and pick it up, do that. I sincerely hope the other locations are managed better. My last time visiting this location. 2
PerryWorst service and worst Canjun food. Gumbo was horrible and the other food was not canjun at all. 1
Yume is Japanese themed, with a nice selection of sushi rolls and bento boxed lunches, but the best food on the menu is Korean.  The restaurant is small, with a friendly and efficient staff.  Food is served promptly.  Quality control is excellent.    But I know what you're saying, so what?  What's so special about that?  Scottsdale has plenty of good Japanese and/or Korean restaurants, right?I've got three words for you:Bi bim bap.  This dish ranks #30 on the list of the world's most delicious foods and you've probably never heard of it.  You'll probably giggle when you say the name, but for heaven's sake, no matter how fun it is to say bi bim bap over and over, don't do it.  Sure, it's not often you get food with a name that's alliterated, but sadly, most people don't see the beauty in this.  Trust me, I know. What, you ask, is bi bim bap?  In Korean, it means 'mixed rice', but to you and me?  The most excellent beef/rice/veg dish you will ever have.  Seriously.  On the bottom is some nicely seasoned ground beef.  Atop that, steamed white rice.  Then, a rainbow selection of vegetables, some raw, some pickled, some cooked.  Then, the crowning glory, a fried egg - sunny side up, and a garnish of roasted seaweed strips. How to eat it, you ask?  First, there's a red bottle on the table, snag it.  I know what you're thinking, anything could be in that bottle!  Easy tiger, It's chili sauce. Now spiral a bit of sauce over the top of the egg and veg.  Note at this point, that there's a spoon in your bowl, a tablespoon.  You can use in conjunction with your chopsticks or on its own.  Take that handy spoon and break up the egg, letting the yoke flow.  Now mix it!  All of it. Tuck in, mate. You can now die happy. In my opinion, the menu would be complete with just the one item, but the seafood pancake (dinner menu) is also delicious.  It's huge, and as the name implies, filled with seafood.  What seals the deal though, is the sauce.  A thick brown sesame seed, soy, sugar, green onion concoction (ancient Korean secret recipe, no doubt) which probably has enough salt in it to raise your blood pressure.   Just go for it. No worries, life's too short anyway! 5
Service was good, food was mediocre and a little pricey. I had the mild sausage sandwich which was $11.00 but it took half the hoagie roll before I got any sausage. It tasted decent but $6.00 or $7.00 worth at best!  My son had the boneless buffalo wings and he said they tasted decent but really tiny for the price. $1.00 per wing should have been .25c per wing for the size. The fries were lousy I will say that.  Quick service and our waitress came around just the right amount of times. Since it is new, we may try again in a few weeks to see if there were any improvements. 3
Very long wait to be given prescriptions for back pain. Over a two hour wait with no one in the waiting room. Once the Dr. Came in had to wait again for the actual prescription. There should be more Drs on staff and the wait should be told up front to give pet owners options to go elsewhere. 2
We normally enjoy the food at the Cottrelle location but this location just opened so we thought we'd try this one as it was closer to us. We placed an order for pick up. We ordered the pakoras, veg chow mein and veg lo mein (they gave us non veg lo mein instead), chilli chicken, kung pao chicken, garlic paneer, deep fried tofu and veg fried rice. If you like your food bland then this is definitely the place for you. We have had Hakka food many times and enjoy flavourful and spicy dishes and none of these dishes delivered. Very disappointed. 1
I lost my corned beef and pastrami virginity at Corky & Lenny's, and can't believe I waited so long!  Had been going here off and on for a few years when visiting family, but only had breakfast or the non-deli items.  If I had simply stuck to these sorts of things, I'd probably be giving a two star rating, but oh, the cured meats!  Corky & Lenny's easily rival legendary delis like Zingerman's in Ann Arbor, but costs you less and give you just as gigantic a pile between two slices as the others.  Not sure what other reviewers are saying about cranky/unpleasant service, because I've had nothing but attentive and pleasant experiences here.  The only crank I've run into is the older lady in the Harry Caray glasses that's always working the register, but c'mon, that's part of the charm! 4
The Brie with scallop combination test strange. A bit bitter so I have to use the sweet sauce to cover. Haven't tried the other so I may give it a shot again. Ceviche was okay. Hard to chew as usual. 3
Wow. Jayd not only gave me what I needed for my wedding, she was able to accommodate us last minute and came to our house. She was completely professional, even when dealing with my crazy family! She also put my friends to ease since it was their first time.Also, she knows all of the hookups for beauty treatments in the valley, so trust her with those!!!! 5
Had the brisket sandwich. What can I say about it? Bleh. Never coming back here again. the brisket was so charred and dry I couldn't eat half the meat in the sandwich. And it was really greasy and salty. Usually I like the fat on brisket but this fat was just gross salty greasy and hard. The bun was good tho. That's the only think I actually liked. Very disappointing. The restaurant was hot and very dingy. The girls were nice. The bbq sauce isn't the best I had but it helped cover up the taste of the brisket. 2
Well I never Lived Here. But I got a really nice look at the place when I tracked my stolen iPhone To an apartment there.  You have to love the find my iPhone app! You could see it was in one specific section of the apartments... The police was nice enough to come out and knock on the doors, However most of the people who live there simply turn off the lights and didn't answer the door.  It's that kind of friendly place. So here's what you do if you want to live with people who will steal somebody's iPhone from a clothing store Changing room, Definitely move there. 1
I had an appointment from a referral and after having to call their office to find them (when they called to make my appointment they failed to mention the address is 7785 W. Sahara but the building sits behind a mini complex and sits far back from the street it is actually on, which is Buffalo) and even though I had had to travel by bus appx an hour and a half from East Desert Inn and Sandhill, I made it on time. I filled out the required pages of medical history etc and the final page was a document that was a "Consent for Treatment" form. It listed various types of treatment that could be required and many statements of the possible problems (loss of the use of hand, etc) that could arise. At each of these I had to initial that I had been informed (He is definitely attempting to cover his butt!) At the bottom of the form I was to sign over my consent. I did not sign and asked the receptionist if I could hold off signing until I had at least MET the Dr. She informed me that the Dr. would not even speak to me until the form was signed. So I informed her that I would not be staying for the appt (even though it meant another hour and a half home by bus and starting all over again with a different Dr.) I can't believe people actually sign something like that having never met the Dr. It is like having a 'friend' set up a blind date and the date calls and says I'll pick you up Friday at 7:00. Then you ask "Where are we going, what are we going to do?" And he answers: "It's a surprise." Would YOU get in his car????? 1
Tonight was my first and last visit to this restaurant.  A friend had recommend we give it a try, so my wife, mother-in-law, and myself decided we would go on their recommendation.  There were very few cars parked outside the restaurant, which should have tipped me off.  In the end, the service was very slow - not sure why, but they may have simply been understaffed.  The waiter was nice and polite, but we ran out of chips and had to ask to get more, and then had to wait a long time for our check at the end of the meal.  All three of us thought the food was very subpar.  I had cheese enchiladas, which are kinda hard to mess up, but they were dry and had a weird taste.  The rice was not very good, and was also very dry.  The refried beans were the best part of the meal, which my mother-in-law agreed with.  My wife had the vegetable plate, and thought it was passable, but nothing to write home about.  We all gave it a thumbs down and agreed it would not be worth it to come back.  We had just gone to Arriba for mexican food just a few days ago, and found it to be a few steps above El Palacio.in addition, they do not allow firearms into the restaurant, so if you are a law abiding concealed-carry kind of person, you should know that you are not welcome at this restaurant...another reason for a less then stellar review. 2
I love eating here. Make sure you make reservations, because it can be really busy. But be aware that you often have to wait for long periods of time even if you do have reservations on a busy night. The food is worth the wait though! Great staff. 3
The food is not good. Enchilada sauce taste very bland and strange. Kids meal are bad and it's all over priced. It's an open kitchen too. I don't see how they pass health inspections . Won't go back. 1
I'm great that you had such a great experience with the staff. Maybe I should call you to come and talk to the staff for giving me the return on the skids. I am a landscaper that does many backyards. I don't do one backyard I do over 10 in the season minimal.  They need to refund me for the returned skids. I am sure that you don't have much with this company will you just a plain friend. People should know the honest truth before they go spending their large amount of money and time. As I said I am a landscaper that does many backyards. If I kept on using this business my business would be just simply closed.  People should know the truth before they get hurt.  If companies don't like that then I suggest that they train their customer service department. Set up good customer service and I would definitely go there but for now they don't have it. 1
This place is becoming one of my and my husband's "go-to" places when we want a to have a certain good meal.  The marguarita's are better than any other Mexican restaurant in town--and I think we've tried them all by now.  The one drawback is that it is sometimes too loud to have good conversation, what with the Mexican music being piped in or the live band (that may not be so great) and the constancy of the TV's scattered throughout the place.  We brought the kids one time and my son pointed out the Mexican soap opera on the TV, complete with a semi-graphic bedroom scene.  Another time they had a disturbing game show on.  If those things are no problem for you, then I recommend it for an affordable, fast, delicious dinner. 4
I can't really say that this place is good or not but the owner runs a Groupon out of the business which is listed under Volu-Me.  I made an appointment and he was 30min late so I left.  Not very good customer service. 1
Great food but the lady at the cashier is the worse. She must be the owner. Not even a smile. I hate order to go and have to pay with her. The worse, absolutely worse. 1
I enjoyed it, I loved telling people I ate at LoLo's.  But it is Chicken, waffles, corn bread.  Not my favorites but a fun place to go! 3
Agree with all of the other poor reviews. Keys (card) did not open outside door or room and had to get a new key every day we were there. A wall had phone booths with no phones in them. I get that landlines are somewhat obsolete these days but it added to the third world look of the place. Computer room had one computer in it. Good luck getting access to it. The place looked good on the outside but once you got inside it looked third world. The elevator is at one end of the building so if you need the elevator and you are at the other end on the building you will be either walking a long way or taking stairs anyway. We went downstairs to partake in the breakfast and arrived to find they were already out of food. Breakfast claimed a 6am to 9am window and we got there at 8:20am but food was no where to be found. The staff was interesting. I think maybe they were equally frustrated with the situation as the guests were. And never saw a maid once or the results of any maid service the entire 4 days.The most frustrating part of the entire experience was the keys not working each and every time we came back to the hotel but the entire experience was interesting, to say the least. It was a low price so as the old adage goes, you get what you pay for. Next time we would either pay more for a good hotel or save money and sleep in the car (lol). 1
Average bowling place, nothing exciting. There is food but it's pretty pricey so I'd rather pass. The alley is big and there is a place for everyone to sit. Quick service and crowded enough that you know it's Not a terrible place. I'd definitely come back but when there is neon glow instead. It's $6 per person to play and show rental fee is $2.50 for adults and $2.00 for 16 and under. I'm not sure about the per person but my husband and 3 kids , 4 people all together paid $50+ dollars not including shoe rental. Not terrible but there is better places. Still a fun activity to do with the family and my kids and husband enjoyed it. I was at the Casino part which was a win win for all of us. 3
Extremely friendly staff, excellent customer service. The hotel is right next to the mall so close to lots of great shopping and amazing restaurants. Great location! Clean, upscale rooms, 32in flat screen TVs, granite countertops in bathrooms. And I don't mean to be girly, but in the bathrooms there is a 7x magnifying mirror with an LED light...perfect for plucking your eyebrows! YAY! 5
The Lizard's management appears consistently to value the benefits is keeping their draft beer lines pristinely clean - that and their attitude towards reasonably priced draft beer specials will keep any aficionado supremely happy. If you're a beer fan in general the more than 100 bottle list will keep you fluid. Food wise, the burgers are the best around at the price; wings are NOT up to Anchor Bar in Buffalo standard by any imaginative stretch, but locally, again, are hard to beat. As a plus, the service staff is the most professional in this class of restaurant you're likely to find anywhere and aside from the to be expected occasional malcontents a great group of actual professionals. Enjoy!By the way, the current manager, Kevin, obviously beloved by his staff, is either moving on to better and better venues or the top management of the L understands his professionalism and is clearly promoting him!!! 4
If I were writing this review on food alone, I'd give the place like 4 stars. They have really good food. They have this awesome pork belly biscuit app that is yummy. Good grilled cheese sandwich with some bacon and arugula that makes it a bit different from the usual. They have a good sangria that's like juice. I was looking forward to trying out different stuff when I went again, but I ran into the same problem, but magnified that I ran into last time I went, and that was poor service. I and a group of my friends went back, wanting them to experience the food as well. And we went on a Friday night around 9:30 and, as expected, it was busy. Now, the last time I went, it was another Friday night around 8 and their place was slow, like the only tables in were ours, a table of 6 on a high top, and a few other patrons at the bar. Service was slow then too. I chalked it up to the fact that our server was pulling double duty and playing bartender. But tonight was different. It was busy. It was like 15-20 minutes before happy hour, the band was going and the place was packed, like the usual restaurants in the area on a Friday night. And tonight, we were seated fairly quickly. Well, more like we were escorted to our table and then stood around, waiting for it to be bussed, but we were fine with that. We were able to sit down and peruse the menu. We were trying to make up our mind, when the person we thought was the server came over. It turned out that the guy wasn't our server, just a guy dropping off the silverware and plates. He apologized and corrected us in our error and assured us that our server would come by shortly. Well that didn't happen. People came by, and they kept on going by. At one time, one my friends attempted to call the restaurant in order to get someone to get to the table, but no one answered. Maybe the band was too loud or maybe they just don't answer their phones. It was then, that was had a glimmer of hope - a server heading in our direction. And what did this server do? Keep on passing us by. Well, needless to say, that was the end of that visit. We had had enough. We don't think we're gonna be back, at least not for a long while. 1
I used to have my gel/shellac manicures done here and Sophia was amazing!!! The nails lasted at least two weeks with no chipping (and I'm hard on my nails). They had comfy chairs and large manicure stations with the UV lights built in. I have been in twice since the new owners came in and I am done. First Sophia is gone, along with all the other recognized nail techs...that should tell you something. The place was empty and looked terrible. The nail stations are old and small. The UV lights are old and dirty. One of the girls even had bedazzled UV light covers!!! I'm sorry, but I think it looks trashy. The chairs are uncomfortable and I had cramps in my arms from the way they had to rest over the lights due to the small area of the station. Plus, the owner is extremely rude. I didn't know they had changed owners and under old ownership, you could put your tip on your card. I didn't have cash and the new owner scolded me saying "Next time, you bring cash." No buddy, there won't be a next time. 1
This place should have a lot more reviews - but I'm glad it doesn't, they don't need to get any busier.Its been there ages, and looks it. If you're all about ambiance, don't bother. If you pretend you're in a movie set in Pittsburgh 30 years ago it works pretty well. The service is sometimes hit or miss. Most of girls are good, one is very slow, one is amazing. They are all friendly and usually a few different people will check in to make sure that you're happy. Everything is made fresh so be prepared that nothing comes flying out of that kitchen - busy times it can take a good while to get food. The food is AWESOME! Worth any little complaints I might think up before it gets there. Once its on the table, I forget them all.-Fish Sandwiich-Salmon (huge and delicious)-Flounder-Shrimp a few ways ("Norfolk" style is oily for my taste, and I never had it growing up in Norfolk.)-Hawkins St Special-Prime Rib (sized for two, watch it)The prices are low, the portions are large, and just about everything on the menu  is delicious. I'm not one to pick a place because they give you a lot of food, but if you like a good value and don't want to compromise on taste, this place is a gem. 5
Placed an order through Postmates for lunch delivery: chicken pad thai, spring rolls and shrimp rolls.  The food  quality and taste was okay but overall lackluster, I felt it lacked the authentic flavors of Thai cuisine. The spring rolls were little more than an average grocery store pre-bagged shredded salad mix (iceberg lettuce and purple cabbage) wrapped in rice paper with peanut sauce that tasted like it came from a jar. Honestly, the thai spring rolls  available at Cheesecake factory of all places are far superior in both taste and quality. The Pad Thai which I specifically requested mild was much spicier than anticipated... I wasn't able to eat it which was disappointing as otherwise it looked rather promising. Not fantastic, but edible and relatively inexpensive.  Unfortunately, there is a district lack of affordable, consistently tasty and authentic Thai cuisine in Phoenix... I had hopes for this place based off the number of positive reviews but I find myself once again hungry and reaching for a snack after my $30 lunch. 2
The one of the staple bars that make Downtown Las Vegas great. The drinks are reasonable the staff is very friendly. The upstairs bar is pretty cool and it make you feel like you are not in Las Vegas. I come here once a week and I am never disappointed. I highly recommend this. 5
I shop here regularly and can't believe the variety of what's available, the organization, cleanliness and of course prices. They're always bringing in new items. Sometimes this store gets awfully lined up. This is the cheapest place in town to stock up on plastic left over and lunch containers, stationery, gadgets and candy - if you compare your prices like I do to identical products at the grocery store, mall, etc... 5
The pho here is so good.  I wonder how I've never came across this place.  The pho broth here is on point.  Not to heavily salty and just the perfect amount of sweetness.  Service isn't the greatest but it's not terrible. 4
Food is so good! Drinks are okay but don't hold up for the pricing. If you like a good burger come here. 3
Not to say that the receptionist was unfriendly or anything, she just never picks up the phone apparently! For 2 days of continuous calling I couldn't get anybody to answer the phone but kept hearing the message that for booking appointment I need to call back. I ended having to take time off from work just to come in to book an appointment with my family Dr.  Then I was told to call back to book my second follow up, now I tried calling 5 times in a day already and still no one picks up the call. I probably should find another clinic instead of wasting my time making all the calls.Update: Today is Wednesday, by the 8th call that I'm making at 3:45 PM, the voice message has already been changed to "Today is Thursday ..." and the message that I left earlier has not been returned. 3
The shop was weird. There's just one glass display case with closed boxes of various sizes. No chocolates were on display and you could only purchase pre-made boxes so you couldn't pick your flavors. There was no one inside at first, not even a clerk. I looked around and was about to leave when one came out. I was only getting a box of 2 and the clerk was nice enough to list which boxes had what flavor. I ended up with espresso and caramel, normally my favorites, but I wasn't impressed. The packaging was very nice but the contents not so much. The espresso was good but rather small - the smallest truffle I've ever seen in fact. The caramel was slightly larger but not very good. It had a bitter taste to it. I will not be returning. 2
Awesome service and awesome food! Nice atmosphere for a small restaurant. Very clean. Fresh cotton table cloths (no paper covering them like many restaurants which kind of defeats the purpose of a table cloth). Try the crispy Bombay chicken. It's sweet and crunchy and probably unhealthy but it will have you coming back!!! 5
Go for the beer, not the food. The food is decent but most of it is heavy, although the hummus is really good. The service is slower than molasses and the bar is so loud that it's difficult to have a conversation. The patio is nice but it's right on the street. Parking is tricky but that's Lakewood. 3
Terrible, terrible customer service! I was running late for my appointment because I took a wrong turn getting there. The secretary called, and I explained what was going on. She said sure no problem, see you soon. I arrived 6 minutes late, and when I walked in that same secretary told me I couldn't be seen that day because I was late!! What horrible customer service to waste someone's time like that. I had already been to see him once, and they pushed a lot of their natural supplements, and red light therapy. I tried both, the supplements did not help, and I assumed the red light therapy should actually have infrared light!? It was just a sauna! Terrible place! Don't waste your time, or money.The cancellation times you're referring to were because my father had several strokes and ended up in the hospital with complications. Your office knew this when I cancelled, and rescheduled. Since you can't plan a stroke around your appointments it was inevitable that I had to cancel late. HOWEVER, the part that bothered me was me having a conversation with the secretary telling her where I was since I took a wrong turn. The secretary said "No problem, see you soon". I walked into the office minutes later and was told to go home. THAT is my problem, and I'll stand behind my review to say that's TERRIBLE customer service!! 1
We chose this hotel because of the recommendations we read on-line.  The hotel is certainly very unique.  We were in Pittsburgh to see a Pirates game.  Our original plans were to walk to the game but we did not feel safe enough in that neighborhood to walk.The room we stayed in was small but comfortable.  The bathroom was nice sized but the shower stall is much too small.  The toilet seat was very loose, so, I had to tighten it.  Also, the in room coffee service was not good.The shuttle driver was terrific and very accommodating.The continental breakfast buffet was terrific and nicely displayed.I thought the TV was too small but the picture was good.  Had we planned on staying there for more than one night, I would have asked to change rooms.Having said all this we would stay here again.  The hotel staff was very nice and we loved the atmosphere of the hotel. 3
If I could just rate the food, it'd be 5 stars but in this case the two stars go for the terrible customer service. I've given this location 2 try's and both experiences were shitty. The guy with the beard who works the front attended us both times. He never greeted us when we got in or when we left. The first time we went, we ordered king crab and he forgot to give us the crackers for it so we had to ask for that. He didn't give us gloves so we had to ask for that. I ordered water and when it came, there was no ice (which wasn't a big deal) but when I asked for ice he never came back. The second visit, we ordered a pound of crawfish but there was only about 4 or 5 full bodies and the rest of the "pound" was just claws. 2
Are you kidding me? This place is a joke.  I haven't stayed there so I cannot speak of what may have been. If their customer service over the phone is any indicator, I'm sure we would have been in for a real treat(complete sarcasm). Due to this hotel adding a resort fee, the over all price is now unreasonable. Instead, I found a Double tree resort, down the street, to be cheaper, nicer (in my opinion) and NO RESORT FEE!! Hmmmm.... free wi-fi? free newspaper? I get that at Starbucks. Your resort fee is just another way to milk your customers. When i tried to cancel my reservation online, no go. When I called the resort to cancel. Boy did they make it difficult. Phone transferred 3 times, then finally a very rude woman whom reluctantly fullfilled my request. By the way, it was not pre-paid. It was fully refundable, so I don't know why they were so hesitant to cancel. Needless to say, I will not be a patron of the Firesky. Not as long is there is a resort fee or better resorts in the vicinity. adios!!! 1
I had one of the best online shopping experiences with UGP from designing my own shirt to ordering and pick up. Their customer service was great! Cade answered all my questions and walked me through the design process step-by-step. I was very pleased to have that kind of assistance. Thank you Cade. I will be doing all future designs at UGP. 5
This place is roomy. Membership required.  Pool and dart boards with pleanty of room.  TVs are abuntant.  Overall good enviroment. 3
I was getting tired of pizza and burgers on our visits to Toronto so we asked for a good Mexican place. It was a little way out of our way, but once we found it we ordered a little of everything, to sample of course. The place was small but was full with customers, and there was a steady stream of people picking up to-go orders. Good sign!After trying some food, it was ok. I hate store packaged tortillas.  I'm Mexican and for me that's a sign of a "Taco Bell" Mexican place. The guys working the counter were Salvadorian not Mexican, close enough I guess. The Salvadorian "pupusas were very good though. Stick to what you know guys! 3
Manager did not care about my experience. Mindy, the server was amazing and friendly and always smiling. Unfortunate that the manager was so flippant and unhelpful 2
My boyfriend and I stopped in here for dinner. First we went to the bar directly off of the casino, where we waited about 5 minutes and were not acknowledged once. We figured maybe we would have better luck getting a table. We stood in line at the hostess center, where there was one party of about 6 ahead of us. I'm not sure what was going on, there was a lot of back and forth between the party(who I don't think spoke great English) and the hostess, but we waited our turn for 5 minutes or so, while doing so the line behind us grew even longer of people waiting. At no point did the hostess even look up at any of use, and since the party of 6 was still in front of us, we waited. From the other door a couple walked up around the waiting party, and asked the hostess about seating, and she put them down!!! UMMM Excuse me??? You have a line of people waiting honey, why don't you try looking up! Needless to say we left, plenty of other choices in Vegas, although I think it's important to point out, we looked in the windows after leaving, and there were plenty of open tables. REALLY? 1
I agree with Stacy L. Terrible service. Went for lunch before the basketball game because it's close to Kohl Center.  Some customers got wait staff, some had to wait at the bar to order. No logical way they take or fill orders. Food was just so-so. Should have done what our 2 vegetarians did - walked over to Potbelly & brought food back here to watch the game while they ate. At least I saved money by not tipping & we got to the game early because we couldn't stand the place. Hey guys, you can't run a bar without staff!! 1
The Mesa store looks a lot better since they remodeled it, but unfortunately it's still in Mesa. lol They are sometimes picky on the books they take though. Last time I was in there: I'm a big Star Wars nerd, and so I have lots of Star Wars EU books. Well, they took something like 2 out of 25. By the way, while I was browsing I looked at the Star Wars section to see how many books I would likely sell, and they only had 3 or 4 that were duplicate titles. Same with Clive Cussler books. I get the whole trade in process stuff, but it would be nice to not have to back 20 times to get rid of all my books. 3
4 stars for the family meal, if you get it on a good night (3 large entree, 1 lrg fried rice, 1 lrg white rice, 4 egg roll, 4 crab puff $24.00) .We've eaten here maybe 10 times, the last visit was last month. That order was the best one yet, I actually think I got the owner's order or CE saw their Yelp reviews and fixed the problems.Anyway... I think I got the owner's order because the broccoli beef was mostly beef and only 3 broccoli, usually it's the other way around. I'm a huge broccoli fan so I never complained, but was in total shock when I opened the paper box.The fried rice had egg in it..... what???? I've been here how many times and this is the first time egg ever slipped into the fried rice haha. Lastly, they are coupon nazi's, they don't care if you are GOD himself, if you don't have the coupon you ain't getting the deal. 4
First time in tonight, ordered a pizza and some bbq wings. Not bad. I like thin crust, but this was very thin (see thru) and barely any sauce. However, overall pizza and wings were tasty. Wings were not greasy or fatty, like other pizza places in the area.We will go here again,many other menu items also. 3
I ordered a buffet from them during Memorial Day Weekend.  I was told it was in their warehouse and would take 1 -2 weeks to deliver to the Raintree location.  We didn't hear anything from them so called after 3 weeks and they said the manufacturer was still shipping.  They lied about it even being available in their warehouse and said they would call with an update.  We waited another week and then called to check on the status.  They said they talked to the warehouse manager and it was in the warehouse.  They said it would take a week to make it to the Raintree location and they would call us immediately when ready for pick up.  No call.  I called again after ten days and they still don't have it in the store.Seriously, this company lies just to get you to purchase when they don't even have the merchandise available. Do not ever purchase furniture from this company unless you can wait 6 months for delivery. 1
Far too pricey for a mediocre massage. I told the therapist several times I didn't want a relaxing massage - I wanted deep tissue- he didn't listen. The flute music is terrible, room was way too hot. The therapist had pointy sharp fingers- a manicure was in order and a better technique - I requested a man with man hands. I tried to give feedback upon leaving and the girl taking your money is there for just that- she couldn't have cared less about the experience. There are too many better places to go for the prices they charge. 1
had dinner there - ordered the international sampler and thought it was good but i wish i just ordered one thing. i didn't love the hummus so much, but the italian (lasagna?) was quite delicious! i noticed on the smoothie/juice menu that you can add honey or bee pollen, which isn't vegan. ok ok, i'm not vegan either, but i used to be and the mixed messages bother me! :) that said, it was good and probably the healthiest option in this crazy town of all you can eat fattening buffets. 4
Don't answer phone calls.  Don't honor appointments.  Don't respond to any messages of any kind.  I wised up and contacted my home warranty company for a change after 5 days of trying to schedule something.  According to comments on facebook page, have had their license suspended by BBB several times, and all other ratings websites rate them as low as possible.  In short, possibly the worst company I have ever had to deal with, and I don't have it as bad as many others here because at least in this case they never even showed up.In short, RUN AWAY, and encourage others to do so. 1
I visit the Fitchburg location at least once a week and the staff is great.  Where else can you find such a great selection of wines for under $10?  The staff has always gone above and beyond for me - whether it be putting together a wine basket, expediting my order because I'm in a hurry or making great wine recommendations. 5
Fun experience. Very different for a thrill seeker like myself. I would give it a 5 star, but i didnt like the attitude that they gave us when they were trying to push on the sales.  It really throws out the good experience that i had for this place. 3
Yep, this place is closed! Does anyone know why? So disappointed the only coffee place here closed. City place is the WORST place on earth for amenities. Just crappy pubs and banks left now! We need a Sunset Grill to replace this!! 1
Me and my  husband  seeing  Dr Nguyen  over  15 years. The best  dentist & staff . Specially  my husband  is like  a baby  when it comes  to dentist. 4
Like the environment here. But the waiting time for food is too long, around 25 mins waiting. Desert dippers taste good. We also ordered French toast and corned beef hash, which are not bad. But I hope the French toast slices can be thicker and softer. Overall 3.8/5. 3
Nice restaurant. Nice atmosphere. But the tables are too close together. I had the flatbread for starter. It was very salty. Had the hanger steak for main and it was also very salty. Overpriced. I wouldn't be a rush to go back here. 3
i went the past weekend for my birthday i was somewhat disappointed in the hotel. I've been to vegas 4 times now. The price i paid was decent since i got a deal from southwest, but i thought the hotel would of been better compared to when i stayed at planet hollywood. I was definitely wrong. Here's a few things that i liked about the hotel. I loved the aquarium, the flowers, the variety of restaurants in the hotel even thought they were pricey. i wasn't afraid to spend money. i loved the pool it was huge and gorgeous! but you have to get there early or its hard to find an empty lounge chair if you have a few ppl in your group. i was disappointed that the pool closed at 7. I was disappointed in the bathroom size. i had a tower king room? the bathroom was tiny! i thought it would of been nicer than PH. so i figured i should stop comparing, but this room didn't even have a coffee maker. I asked for hot water and they were about to charge me 4$! or $10 for a kettle. I had a 252$ spa serv for a massage, mani & pedi. Great ppl very professional. The masseuse i had wasn't that great i expected better since it was at a hotel AND gratuity was included... can't remember if it was 18/20% the lady who did my nail was nice & great at conversing, but didn't realize she filed one of my nails too much! so my nail was slanted looking. i was pissed! but i didn't say anything because it was too late. when i checked out the i told the lady and she asked if i wanted to tell the lady about it... i was thinking no theres no point since she filed my nail already. i obv said it trying to think that they would do something for me like a discount or a small gift. couple days later the color on the edge of my nails came off! didn't even last a week, and i wasn't even doing anything but enjoying my bday weekend in vegas! ( i had a better spa experience at the WESTIN)the carnegie: the food is pricey and it is decent but large portion. its great that it is open 24 hrs. the coffee tasted like water and the bagels were hard as brick. we were craving breakfast i should of just went to the buffet! lol but we slept in...the blt burger was pricey, but prob the best burger i had in awhile. SO TASTY! it was cool that this hotel had quite a few shops like froyo, candy store, tattoo shop, sport shop, watch, and etc. i would not come back to stay at the mirage. It is a nice location somewhat in the middle. the place got the dim theme going on. even the room the lights are ALL dim. it drove me nuts especially if i was trying to look at something if it was the day time i would of have to open the blinds. it bugged me bc i wanted privacy 3
For three years I've been going to Katie and I've always walked out Completely Happy.  However, the front desk girls sometimes act like you're interrupting their personal conversation, and more than once they've 'forgotten me'.  Katie has now moved on, and although I'd still recommend Dolce for their variety & location, I too, have moved on. 3
My husband and son and I ate here for the first time this past weekend.  The atmosphere is much better than we expected--the whole feel is more upscale than many Asian restaurants, with plenty of authentic decorations.  The crab rangoons were among the best we've ever had.  The chicken satay appetizers were "OK"--other Thai places I've been serve more than just two skewers, but they were still pretty good.  Not as much flavor as they could have had.My son (age 10) really liked the grilled beef entree.  It came with noodles.  The meat was very tasty, but the noodles were thick and served cold--kind of like eating worms.  Not good, but maybe this is commonly done--we just didn't like that.  Many good veggies with it, though.My husband had the chicken pad thai and liked it--a generous serving.  Now, to my dish... I wanted to try pho since I'd never had it.  With my current cold/cough I was eager for a hot soup to soothe me.  Being adventurous, I tried the Pho Dac Biet (a combination pho.)  Big mistake!  It came with tendon and tripe--or "cow stomach" as I learned.  The odor from the broth even made it through my congestion.... I couldn't "stomach" it!  I picked around and tried to eat some noodles and greens, but kept scooping out chunks of bumpy stomach lining and tendons.  Not exactly appetizing, at least for me.  So BE CAREFUL!  I guess I was ignorant in my adventure, but I really wish I had tried the plain chicken pho.  The servers were excellent and very friendly.  I would try it again but would order something safer next time. 3
Amazing salon. I see Heather whenever I get my hair done and she completely understands what I want done and I've never been disappointed. 5
My friend and I just had a lovely lunch in the courtyard. The tuna nicoise salad was very good- nicely presented, fresh veggies, perfectly cooked tuna. Joe, the affable, warm and friendly young waiter was very accommodating when I asked to have one of the grilled chicken sandwiches served on a bed of salad instead of focaccia. While I would have liked more seasoning, that's just a personal preference. And the freshly brewed ice tea is very refreshing and tasty. Kathy, the owner, was very welcoming and told us all about her story, and her daughter Emily. We will definitely be coming back and bringing our husbands. A must try for a casual breakfast or lunch if you live in north Scottsdale and wondering where to go. We wish Kathy all the best in her new endeavor. 4
good for what it is - soup, salad, sandwhich.i like the breakfast power sandwhich - it's basically an expensive egg mcmuffin with ham. i think i'm gonna just go to mcdonald's next time.their pastries are nearly always really dry 3
I usually go to my usual wax girl Alyssa (who is AMAZING) I love her. She knows exactly what I want without even me telling her and she always checks with me towards the end to see if Im happy with the results. However, because of certain events coming up, I had no choice but to go with someone else because Alyssa wasn't working that day so I went in with a girl named Bri. I have to say that this was the worst waxing appointment ever. I have natural thick eyebrows and this girl waxed off so much of my eyebrow that it didn't even look like the other one. She completely ruined my perfect brows that Alyssa had already created. Not only that, I also asked her to wax off the baby hairs that I have on my forehead and she WAXED MY HAIRLINE OFF to the point that I looked like Lebron James. Now I have these little hairs that stick in the middle of my forehead and are taking months to grow back. I would NOT recommend going to Bri. She does not know what she's doing at all. 1
If you are paying 7.50 for .3 liters of beer, at least the glass shouldn't have 1 1/2 inches of foam on top. 2
Omg! I love this place, amazing food, service, and friendly staff. My boyfriend and I come here quite a bit you have to get the avocado egg rolls they are the bomb ! Served with chili line sauce and chicken pot stickers but I would ask for the sauce on the side.for some reason the potstickers are swimming in the sauce  if ordered in original form.  If you decided to get a strawberry lemonade make sure to ask for water because it's overly  sweet. Entrees I got the luau salad it's amazing very healthy and he got the teriyaki chicken so good comes with your choice of brow., Or white rice . Lastly our server was very nice and attentive but seemed to be overwhelmed so we felt bad asking for anything. 4
My husband and I were catching a show at the V Theater and decided to visit this eatery. I'd say it's higher end fast food -- you order at the counter and the food is delivered to your table. It's more expensive then your usual fast food but is much cheaper than a sit down restaurant on the Strip. I had a lobster roll for about $13 and a Lobster Mary for $14. We shared a lobster bisque for $9. The lobster roll was so so, the bread seemed like a folded piece of Texas toast rather than an actual roll. The lobster meat also didn't have a lot of flavor. The Lobster Mary was fun because it's served with a piece of claw meat as garnish. The lobster bisque was blah. It was too salty and oily for my taste. If you don't want to spend $50 per person on your meal in Vegas, this is an okay place but just know the food quality is not that great. 3
Scared to post a review because people might find it and crowds will come lol.Pros: stadium seating, comfortable, large chairs, super ample leg room, clean theater. Manager is nice, he works concessions. Super decent pricing.Cons: 3x since it opened, we've visited and either there was no picture or audio was messed up. They fixed it within 10 mins but we've not experienced that anywhere else but in a foreign country. Bathroom needs updating: tiles are looking pretty worn. 4
Nice place for casual Italian. Food is always good and they give you massive portions. All the staff have always been really friendly and quick with service. 4
I've been here a few times. The good:- Very strong drinks. Almost, if there is such a thing, too strong.- Our first order of cheese curds. Hot, gooey, greasy.- Cheese soup + chunky tomato soup = delicious bowl of soup.The bad: - Slooow service.- Our second order of cheese curds. They were made with a different kind of cheese than the first (?) and were rather cold.I wonder what will change now that they're under new management. 2
My dad had emergency dental work that had to be done today. I made the appointment for him and the staff that worked there was very friendly.He is in his 50's and he told me that the dentist there was very good and one of the best he went to (he has really bad teeth so he has been with many dentists).It was a little pricey because it does have the 80 dollars examination fee. But considering the emergency and that it was on a Sunday, I think we came out satisfied. 4
Ditto everything Sam G. said about the food, and want to add that my in-laws constantly rave about the veal sandwich.  Also want to mention the coffee is really wonderful.  Best latte in Queen West (and goodness knows there's a lot of competition).  It's a great neighborhood spot, with lots of cab drivers, families with kids, older Portuguese gentlemen watching football.  It's family-run and the family and the whole staff are lovely.  They have a high chair and super clean bathrooms (though no changing table). 4
I'm always taken back when someone or something exceeds my expectations and in this day and age, going above and beyond seems to be a lost art. When my wife and I discussed buying a home a couple of years ago we were referred to Jennifer Hibbard of Twins and Co. The word on the street was that these were the people to work with and came highly recommended in our circle of friends. Wow, what good advice...Effortless to work with, tirelessly answering the even the simplest questions and expertly navigating our final purchase to make what could have been a difficult experience, one of pleasure and enjoyment. We had quite a few homes that we were interested in and Jennifer gave us all the time in the world. She never pressured us or did any kind of hard sell and that alone was priceless. We wound up waiting almost a year and a half before we finally pulled the trigger on a delightful 50's ranch in the Biltmore area that suits us quite nicely. I must say I always felt that we had an advocate in Jenn, genuinely looking out for our best interests, offering much needed sage advice and never dropping the ball...all this from a 3rd. generation realtor who makes it look easy and fun.  I always reflect fondly on our time working with such an outstanding professional and you could too. If you are in the market for a home there are multitudes of people that can service your basic needs, but if you want a passionate partner to help you with the largest purchase of your life, make it enjoyable, and demystify the process then the Twins and Co. are your girls. 5
This was a challenging rating. We were a tough group to handle, and they handled it with mixed success. I was at dinner with my family; a group of nine with three kids ranging from 3-10, a vegan, a vegetarian, and a meat eater. So finding a restaurant is no easy task. We made a reservation for 6:30pm, in hopes it would be early enough that the kids would not be too tired. Unfortunately, that wasn't necessarily the case, so we were not the most ideal family to be around. The wait staff were gracious, they were patient with the kids and were sure to bring out their food before ours. They even made a dish special order for one of the kids since there wasn't anything on the menu he wanted. They also offered a kids sized plate of mac and cheese rather than the full order. Unfortunately, other aspects were more of a disappointment.  After they brought out the kids meals, we had a good 20 min wait before the adult meals appeared. And one order was even later. The food was ok, but nothing that would entice me to necessarily return. The fish taco and the bruschetta were the highlights. And they were really good, the lobster mac and cheese was a bit underwhelming and the tilapia was overly salty. I really wanted to like this place, but in the end, it was just ok. 3
2 stars because the food (once it got there) was delicious.  Had the sliders and the beef cheek stew.  Sliders are served with a whipped aioli and were solid juicy slidersBeef cheek stew has a decadent jus and the meat was tender as a butcher's heart.  HOWEVER!  Service was absolutely atrocious!  Our server was aloof and did next to nothing.  Obviously the busser hadn't been trained either, because as my buddy is chewing a piece of his steak, the busser comes over and asks if he was all through, while there is still meat on his plate too boot.Nice beer list and yummy pretzel bread.  I would return and hope for a better service and make a final judgment after that. 2
Horrible place I ordered egg whites and wheat dry toast bread and they got all of my order wrong I ask to Pls fix my order and they told me that they couldn't fix it because they ran out of wheat bread, that it was the last wheat bread they had! so they refund me the money and I stayed with no food!! Smh.. It wasn't my fault or cashier's fault, because on the receipt it was very specific how i order my food! The cookers just don't know what there doing! FIRST AND LAST TIME COMING TO THIS PLACE! 1
I LOVE Sea Level!  Every experience I have had at this restaurant has been exceptional, and any time something has gone wrong the wait staff and management has gone out of their way to rectify the situation and make up for it.  Ask for Chris- he knows his shit! 5
The food is pretty good, but the service here has just gotten worse and worse the past couple years.The owner is really cool, but the vast majority of the staff is constantly short and bitchy with customers. They also don't attend very well to detail with orders, or estimated timelines for takeout. The last two times I ordered takeout, my wait was double what was quoted (40 minutes when 20 was stated).This place is officially "blacklisted" until further notice. 2
Went in for the first time today for the awesome price on the smog check.  The workers were pleasant but condescending.  After about a 10 minute wait, the technician informed me that it failed due to the gas cap seal starting to crack with age, but everything else was fine.  He then handed me the invoice with all of the other "recommended services" to the tune of $1105.00. The guy at the counter then told me that once I bought a new gas cap and came back he would charge me the $10 again and redo the whole thing.  After buying a new gas cap, I took my business to another inspection center.  The gentleman there was incredulous they would charge me twice when it was only the gas cap.  In short, go elsewhere to people who care about their customers and not just the money. 1
I was on a US Airways flight from KC today (599) that was running late.  I was supposed to be continuing on the flight (660) to SNA.  They let us get off the plane first in PH so we could make our connection. We got PH gate 15 minutes before the flight was scheduled to leave at 5:55pm. The supervisor (Arlene L) came out and told us our seats had been given away and we should go to the customer service desk to rebook.  The reason I'm writing is that Arlene could not have been more unsympathetic - she had one of the nastiest attitudes I've seen in an airline employee in a long time (how about a "I'm really sorry" for starters).  Despite booking a seat in first class, she could not have cared less.  I'm going to get home tonight on Southwest.  I deserve better treatment than this. 1
I cannot understand the raves for this place.  The forgettable experience began before we even got through the door.  The heavy glass door does not swing easily but the three staff member standing just inside just stared without offing assistance.   The service never got any better.  The hostess was better suited for an Outback, too casual and familiar for a place with $50 lobster.Our waitress finally sashayed over with an air of condensation, like we should know who she once was but isn't now.  Neither the waitress nor the helper cold find the energy to step around next diner when serving the plates and drinks.  He was probably never taught how to serve, she was probably just lazy and annoyed. Did I mention that there were only three other diners, a booth of two and a table of one.The food was fine, exactly what should be expected for those prices.  I had duck and shrimp tacos.  This first visit will be our last! 2
Always messing up my order. Zero customer service when advised of their mistakes..I really don't think its very difficult to read the side of a cup to satisfy a customers order.... Venti Ice Coffee, LIGHT Half & Half, and TWO Splendas not...zero Splendas... COME ON..... ugh...YEEZUS... not very hard to wrap your heads around guys.... 1
A hidden gem. Very nice amenities and reasonably priced. I definitely recommend this place for some good old R&R! 5
So, I have had Mineo's 3 times. The first two times it was bleh, but I really enjoyed it last night.  My previous complaints were that it was greasy and salty, but the pizza I had last night was perfect.  I feel conflicted about this place.  I will try it one more time and update my review accordingly. 3
I've been here many times before and it really just depends on the night. Some nights service is fast and great others it takes forever. You better order everything you want from the beginning or else it'll take forever to get just one additional sauce. Today our server Kimberlee was great. 3
When this location opened up, my friends hyped it up big time. I'm a HUGE lover of chicken and waffles. I always went to Hash House for mine and I expected the chicken and waffles to be way better since the restaurant is known for chicken and waffles.The chicken was too crispy for me. The waffles are very flat and not toasted enough. One of my friends thought of it as KFC fried chicken with Lego My Ego waffles.The GUEST SERVICING here was amazing though. They were friendly, catered to me periodically, and the kool-aid is DELICIOUS. If there's anything I'd come back here for is for the kool-aid, definitely. 3
Not impressed. I have heard good things about this place, this is the only reason why I have tried it...3 times. This time is my last.  The first two times I went for brunch.  The last time was for the dinner service.  For dinner, my boyfriend and I ordered the Goat Cheese Deviled Eggs, the Pepper-Crusted Ahi Tuna, and the Mussels with a tomato fennel broth.  We kept the menu because we wanted to order an entree as well, but we hadn't decided yet. Our appetizers came out and after trying them, we were not excited or interested in ordering more.  The Deviled Eggs were fine, couldn't taste the goat cheese, but I could have made the same at home, and for $3 an egg, I should have.  The Mussels were absolutely terrible.  The tomato-fennel broth was bland and had a terrible, mushy texture.  Half the mussel shells were missing the mussels, and they were not fresh.Lastly, the Ahi Tuna. Noticeably frozen tuna. Bland. The pepper crust was so overwhelming and with a delicate fish like tuna, RAW tuna, it was just bad. The chef should know better.I read reviews about the awesome beer list here.... Any of the beers can be found cheaper elsewhere.Won't be back. Don't waste your money. 2
The only time I come here is when it's late and I can't think of anything else to do with friends. They are open late and good for big or small groups of people. Expect at least a 20min wait if coming on the weekends. Service: The service has gotten significantly better from about 5 years ago. Staff are quick if you can ever get a hold of them (which can be problematic sometimes). Drinks come out fast too. You don't feel pressured to leave asap which is nice when catching up with old friends. Drinks: Last time I got the black sesame cold tea which was good enough, not the greatest but sufficed. My friend got the milk tea with tapioca. The milk tea was too sweet and light on the tea flavour but the tapioca was cooked well. Food: I don't normally order food but the menu has gotten bigger and almost all the tables ordered multiple dishes. Maybe next time I'll try..Atmosphere: I like the high ceilings and decorative lights. The people that come here can get a bit loud though. They have free wifi so people tend to watch shows/movies at their tables.. Nothing you can do about that. :/ 3
Took an hour and a half to get to my location even though it ran on the same main streets as them. Found a hair in my egg rolls, and did not receive the correct amount. Nor was there any napkins or forks, wtf! Never again. 2
Had an excellent experience with Greg Saxe...I ran out of diesel on the way back to Phoenix and BD' AZ Towing came to help out in the rain and bad weather!  Fast and professional....highly recommended! 5
i'm a complete curling novice, but i had a blast when i was here.you rent curling lanes by the hour, and equipment as well. you get a broom, and a smooth, custom made piece of plastic that attaches to the bottom of your shoe to slide across the ice. that's all there is to it! get out there and curl! it helps if you have a friend or two that knows what their doing, or at the very least look up the rules before you get there.this place is also within walking distance of downtown (just north, over the center street bridge) which makes it logistically practical.i'll also suggest you get one of the lanes on the sides.... for no reason other than it's easier access to the bar and to your drinks. drinks and glass bottles are for obvious reasons not allowed on the ice, and the side lanes are right next to the doors/ledges for your drinks. 4
Every time I check yelp for their hours I show up and they are closed. Today the sign was on door open and employees were sitting behind the counter eating and talking then tell me that they are closed despite yelp and their sign saying they were open. Doubt I'll be coming back for this horrible service.UpdateCame to In and Out on camelback & 101 received great service. Next time come here first. 1
Ventured into the Mental Health District eatery on a Thursday and took our spot at the bar as per usual. Love the new Spanish tapas food craze that's been inquisitioning its way through the Toronto food scene.After being mildly impressed at Bar Isabelle and offensively disappointed with Patria, we walked into Carmen with muted expectations.First we tried the Iberico Ham - tough - no marbling - texture of Asian style beef jerkey Second - Jicama with Avocado - texturally didn't work - felt of a glob of guac on a radish - maybe leaving the texture of the non-smashed avocado could work betterMain Course - Traditional Seafood PaellaHands down the best Paella we have had outside spain - served in its roasting dish with an abundance of fresh seafood - permeated with fresh peas and chorizo and Saffron and wait for it.... we have Socrato - the crunchy sweet caramelized peppers and onions-  take note all other Spanish Hautes .....ahem Patria.... - an amazing choice that fed 2 - 3 for $35Staff was friendly and attentive and fun - was recommended a well balanced Argentinian Malbec that paired perfectly with my Pae.Will go back for Paella alone 4
We went to Laziza after work for happy hour and it was disappointing, we ordered most of the appetizers, some drinks and a hookah. Of all the appetizers the hummus was the best but everything else was just bland. The service was ok when we actually saw our waiter. For a Hookah lounge I was expecting something a little more intimate and comfortable. I won't be going back to this place again. 2
Subway has bigger and better tasting sandwiches. For the price I expected something delicious, but it was pretty meh. 2
Had the best banana waffles there. Serving was huuuge, and coctails were tasty as well. 4
Had an outing with the girl's, and it was great first time here and I'll definitely be going back. Great food!!!! The Duce  itself is quite different,  but food. I recommend it 5
This place is slipping badly. I've been going for many years, and used to be a big fan. But recently they've been cutting quality, and today was the first time I've had a dish I would not order again, it was so poor. 2
The food and beer tasted good, but overpriced. German street food at a premium. The waitress steered us to more expensive choices, but not necessarily better choices. It felt more like a rainforest cafe experience than the authentic Hofbrauhaus, which I visited several years ago. Not a bad choice, but trust your instinct on the menu! Cheers! 2
I have to write a review on the Fractured Prune. First off I love doughnuts second I used to work in a bakery. So I know a little about the almighty doughnut. I was there this past Thursday night at Westgate where I was having a nice dinner at Opah Life. I wanted a little desert so I went to this doughnut shop it seemed clean enough so I made my selections and took them home. Mistake should have eaten one there I would have ask for my money back. I took a bite out of each on to confirm what I thought they were the worst doughnuts I have ever had. Horrible not sure if the oils was rancid or not hot enough either way eat at your own risk. 1
Great work done.  Had them run 3 lines of cat6 for high speed networking.  Also made a wiring cabinet in our upstairs master bedroom so all lines could be connected.  Also had them move an in-ceiling speaker to a different location and mount TV.  Was great work.  I love asking questions and the installers answered them all professionally without getting annoyed. Fast response, fast scheduling and fast implementation.  Will certainly use again when I need to run more cable in my home. 5
Service was really slow, however we were there on lunch midweek. I can look past those kind of things, next problem was our food. My buddy ordered a hard taco and two enchiladas and I ordered Mexican story fry. Food comes out and his "hard" taco is SOAKED in grease and juices from the enchiladas. My meal was alright, really greasy though. Just based off of this experience since it's my first time, I won't say I won't come back. It will just be quite a while until I give it another shot. Would not recommend to anybody. 2
Went here on a Fri around 5...loved this place!  Awesome vibe,great drinks & surprisingly welcome mix of beers too. I'd recommend the Belgian.  The waiter was really helpful at explaining board game instructions. All in all,a great experience. 5
Ok.  All you can't eat sushi. Well... It's as bad as you think it would be. The fish selection is limited, no yellowtail, no octopus. And when you do get a piece of fish it's sliced very thin. But my favorite part of the evening was when I asked if my hand roll could contain less rice than normal, I was told... "That's not how the machine makes it".  Somehow every bite I tried became the new worst thing I ever tasted.   The coconut shrimp just made me sad. I tried to find the shrimp. The octopus balls had 2 pieces of octopus that were the size of half a pea.  To end on a positive note - the sesame balls were good, and the tiramisu was akin to tiramisu, yet good. 1
I've been going to this place since I moved here 10 years ago. I still love some of the items on the menu but a few years ago they changed their chicken fingers, and they are definitely not as good as it use to be which makes me sad. But the service is always quick and they are usually always nice. 3
Sheila kept my money when i ended up not needing the divorce i paud her to do. Two months still has my $600 1
Are you aware that there aren't enough words in the English language to describe how incredibly big, thick, juicy, and GOOD Fat Bastard Burritos are? They have some of the thickest, tightest, and most solid burritos I have ever seen. One bite us definitely worth rapturing a neck vein. 4
A nice selection of loose leaf teas similar to David's Tea or Teavana, but independently owned. It's a really cute space and the owner has curated a varied collection of other items for sale (soaps, jewellery, tea sets, etc). 4
Let me just start by saying that Luci's has been a great refuge when I needed somewhere to go without a lot of noise (aka children screaming and running around).  Where they fall short is the food.  The menu is inconsistent and seems to change with the moon phase.  Recently I went in to order "dinner" only to find out what used to be an actual "dinner" menu with awesome comfort foods is now just the "lunch" menu extended.With all of that said... let me tell you the second thing that disappointed me about Luci's.  I ordered the meatloaf sandwich.  I was told it was close to the old "dinner" menu meatloaf and mashed potatoes.  I asked for the sandwich with NO BREAD!  Guess what?  Yep, it was brought 20 minutes later to the table with bread!  Guess what?  They fixed it by scraping the meat off the bread and bringing it back!  This is great for a place that prides it self in being "food allergy friendly".  I sure hope that the owner sees that this is affecting her business.  I used to recommend this establishment to friends.  I will think twice now before I tell a friend about "the cool place on the corner". 2
I was so impressed when Kandy, the Service Manager, read my review she quickly turned the situation around. I feel the quality of service recovery that Kandy demonstrated is similar to that of a Ritz Carlton. I had a massage today with Lori Ann at the Camelback location. It was superb !!! I'll be back. 5
Great food with great price. You won't feel you are paying premium for vegetarian food 5
trendy, "urban cafeteria". prices are not bad, and the food is good. try the roasted red pepper and feta foccacia! 3
PROS: Large selection of groceries, easy access.CONS: They 'forget' to bag groceries that you have paid for.  For multiple customers.  What the heck.  This seems to be a Indian grocery store disease.  Chor madarchods. 3
Absolutely amazing! I've come here off and on for about two years now. I work service so I'm all over the valley and if I'm in the area at lunch time I'm stopping! I have never had a bad meal there and I've tried pretty much everything. Dennis the owner has put a lot of work into the place and it shows. You can tell he takes a lot of pride in the place. Don't take my word for it so in sometime and try. You won't regret it! I can't sell it enough. 5
Best vet ever! We drive all the way from mountains edge just to update our cats on their vaccines because we only trust him!!! 5
Food is what I expect from Yard house. But the hold time was way longer than conveyed. While waiting by the kitchen observed kitchen staff handle trash and then food without changing gloves. 2
Way over priced. I got the VIP Pedicure, no different than the deluxe pedicure. At the mall they charge 35 and here it is 45. Hot stone massage was a joke, it was stone cold. When I asked the technician she said that's how it is supposed to be. Plus the nail color I picked , she said there is an extra 3 dollars for that, I ended picking up a different color. Never going back. 2
They lost 11 test results and consultation notes in the span of 6 months. The final one I had faxed over 7 times and for some reason they still claimed they hadn't gotten it. After calling through out the day and standing in the office for more than an hour they finally printed my results and sent me on my way. The next day I recieved a ntice that they would no longer provide me service. As if I would consider going back at that point. Staff was rude, doctor was horribly rude and poorly informed. Frequently pulled up webmd articles during appointments. Its pathetic to think expecting them too receive results in a timely manner was too much for them to handle. 1
I wanted to grab a quick bite before flying back to LA.  Service here could hardly be described as quick here, nor could it be described as accurate.  I never did get my drink order that day; not even a glass of water. 2
Ordered burgers medium well! They came out pink and bloody ! Gross  ..The sever said yep, we're having a problem with the cook? Wtf ? If you know there's a problem how about fixing it once !? Mfers.. 2
This is an excellent ttc route. Gets to the airport very fast from Kipling with minimal stops. can bring all your luggage with you and frequent service. Can't beat the price - $3! I honestly don't know why they bothered building that airport train. I hope they never stop this route. 5
Found this salon on Yelp and the reviews didn't disappoint! Got my manicure done by  Kevin and he did an awesome job. The polish came out flawless  and did a good job cutting the cuticles. Yuki did my pedicure and she was delicate and detailed oriented. Most places I've gone do not put special attention to callous removal but she definitely did her best. One of the things I liked the most was that they have a frequent user card, where on every 5 times you get 20% off. I haven't seen this at any other salon.Only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because they have few technicians and I can anticipate having to wait a little longer without an appointment and the color choices are not great (some of the polishes look old and unused).Will definitely go back! 4
1. Sat outside on patio metallic chairs and tables, when we made reservation expecting to sit in the restaurant, not outside! There was no information about this. If the restaurant inside seats g is full. Then they should mention to the customers making reservations that they will be sitting outside!!!2. Food is mediocre at best! They even screwed my order. Asked for risotto and got some pasta, not sure what.3. Asked for two cabs, someone at restaurant changed it to one big cab instead which could not hold all of us so we had to wait for another 25 mins for another one!! Would not recommend to anyone. Enough other good restaurants in Pittsburgh to go to. They have to have paid their way into magazines rating them highly! 2
Food is really good they just take a little to long to give you youre food but other than great food an they greet you well when you arrive. 4
Clean restaurant with sufficient amount of seating as long as you don't come during lunch time when the line is almost out the door. The food is great and the price is fair. 4
Very generous meal before my flight.  Pretty good, prepared on site, actually fresh and quite solid.  Very impressed... Very much not "airport food." 4
Only here for the beignets and a cappacino. Both were delicious but three stars because the service sucked. Single woman at a bar table apparently not a priority. 3
We were offered the table right be the entrance but I informed the host I'd rather wait for a less trafficked table. It took them 10 minutes to clean up after another customer, and right as I was going to sit down, the staff seated another couple that had JUST walked in, at the location I had been waiting for!  When I politely asked wtf the hostess just shrugged and stuck us at a half booth right next to the bathroom.  The worst customer service in recent memory. Avoid at all costs!!! 1
Spend a LOT of money in VS in here. Just take a cab in there from hooters. Easy to find in the mall. And the mall was sooooooo beautiful, looks like i were gooing outside. 5
I am loving the veg items! I wouldn't suggest the taco salad because you'll get a ton of the "flavor veggies" like onion in it and not much else interesting. This time around, I ordered the veg chalupa and cheese enchilada. Very tasty, nice portion sizes, and a great price. (Under $10 for late lunch!) I also love that black beans can be substituted for refried. My partner was able to get the sopas vegetarian and were tasty as well. It's not often that I have found carrots in med food and I like it. Our service was very slow this time. Perhaps because we were outside, I'm not sure if that factored in. Maybe due to the holiday staffing, but it was not packed at all. We had to ask for water after empty water glass being ignore on several server rounds. 3
I gave it 2 stars for the excellent service. The Meal itself was awful. How does a steak house get away with serving tough filet?  6 oz and my husband didn't even finish it because it was so chewy and tasteless. He also had a giant prawn that was over cooked. I had Sea Bass. A very thin piece that had no seasoning or flavor.I had raspberry sorbet that was inedible because it was so sweet. No one else at the table could eat it either. I asked for a table in the main dinning room but they tried to seat is in the corner of the patio. They were told when I made the reservation it was a birthday party and nothing was done to the other desert to honor that. You would think a fancy place like this would make the presentation of each plate beautiful but it's just thrown on the plate. All this for a whopping $240.00. Then I had to listen to my husband complain all the home. I honestly could have cooked a better dinner at home. So disappointed and feeling ripped  off! 2
The food was good, not great. I have definitely seen a better spread for an Indian buffet,  but considering it's location on the strip , the quality of food and the price, it's definitely worth a trip, especially of you're craving spicy vegetarian food. 3
Best mussels I have ever had and I have ordered them around the country. The space is intimate so plan to wait during busy times.  You can also opt to sit at the bar and get full menu service and the same great service. 5
Don't go here yet, this place is way too slow!!!!  Then the girl at the window instead of apologizing started giving me excuses!!!  Avoid this location at all cost they need time to get it together!!!!  I won't be going back 1
Hmmmm...I started out reading other reviews of this place and I'm thinking that maybe a 2nd visit is in order.  Our experience was definitely not like others.We stopped by here for lunch.  $5 lunch special includes your entree, 2 scoops of rice, veggies and a small drink.  We both got the BBQ chicken ... the boneless chicken portion was small, the rice was good and  the veggies consisted of cabbage (and that's it!).We were greeted by a woman on the phone who hung up only long enough to take our order and then returned to the phone.  Since we were the only ones in the place (at 12pm!!), I wondered if her conversation was meant to be entertainment?Considering this place is next door to several other really good restaurants, I can't help but wonder why anyone would choose this particular establishment instead of one of the others?Ample free parking, cause it's a shopping center.  Would we return? I don't know.  Would I recommend?  I just don't know.If we decide to give this place a second chance, I'll update my review. 2
Great place for Korean fix. Gamjatang is to die for. 4
I had a very unpleasant experience at this restaurant. The service was horrendous- not a smile, please, or thank you from the waitress all night. When she was clearing plates she waived her finger at a stack of dishes in signal for me to pick them up. Not appropriate. If she had asked me with her words I would not have had a problem. I thought maybe she didn't speak any English, but she spoke just fine (although rudely) when I asked a question regarding the menu. Not only was the service poor, but the food was not delicious, nor filling. The sushi was sub par, the teriyaki salmon was overcooked, and the maki rolls were tiny. The chicken and rice we ordered was not only lacking in flavor, but the chicken was dry, and quite frankly disgusting. We asked to speak to someone about the inedible chicken and when they finally came to our table he was rude and unprofessional. He said he would take it off the bill because he "didn't want to argue about something so dumb." Shocking. I will never go there again, and I would not recommend it to anyone. 1
Conveniently located, at least for me. But that is where the positives end. The store has definitely initiated some cost cutting measures. They eliminated self check out and there are never more than two or three open registers. They have re-merchandised at least half a dozen times in the past year, expanding medical and cold supplies and shrinking premium grocery items. They added a few dilapidated shelves near "express" checkout with odd items like carton-sized gold fish cracker boxes and adult diapers. It has more of a Walmart feel to it now and even the in store Starbucks has picked up stakes. It is my friendly neighborhood grocery no more.  I'll be shopping elsewhere. 2
Worst massage of my life. Not only did she constantly leave the room while im laying there exposed, all the noise in the hall was distracting! The curtains didnt cover the entire door frame and it felt very uncomfortable. NOT RELAXING AT ALL. And when it was all said and done she stood a foot behind me waiting for a tip. Even the receptionist said "ok you tip now". Seriously? if the service sucks im not tipping. i gave her a few bucks just to get her away from me. 1
Food is ok. Ordered Rad Nor and it seemed like the cook didn't put much effort in not burning the noodles. I thought I was eating fire. The Tom Kha was the only thing that tasted good. Service was quick and friendly. It could of been 4 stars if my noodles weren't burnt with a fire taste. 3
I attempted to try the buffet but was very disappointed by the types of items being served. The name of the place is 'Bread and Kabob'; but I found neither bread nor any kabob in the buffet. As a matter of fact, they were serving Southern Fried Chicken, Meatball/Noodles, and Rice. Very strange! 2
Come on- a 24 hour up-to-date gym that costs you 30$/month- it doesn't get much better or cheaper than that. I go in the mornings and/or evenings when gyms are usually at their fullest but I have never had to wait for a machine there, ever!... And they're open on holidays like Xmas an New Years!! They also have a very clean, modern and no pressure atmosphere- as a chick, it's soo not a slimy pick-up gym at all- you feel totally safe and un-cruised ++ it's a plus in my opinion! 4
I want to really like this place. The car wash is pretty good for the membership price I signed up for. The free vacuums are awesome too. But I have been here 6 times and 3 of the times the tunnel has been down and I'm getting really annoyed. The first time the attendant came up and explained to me want was going on, and gave me a coupon. This time no one even came up to any of the 4 cars trying to figure out what was going on to explain why the lanes were blocked off. Hopefully they can figure it out. Maybe it's just been bad timing!! 3
Great Show.  My 7 year old also loved it and got most of the shows.  There are some adult innuendos that made it fun for the adults as well.The magic was old fashioned but still amazing.We got free tickets (with a purchase of a drink) after we went to the Grand Canyon through Viator. 4
(I had to give this place one star so I could post my review) First and last time I go into this salon. Waited over a half hour for my appointment, even though they had told me what time they would be free. Walked in and all 3 ladies working had just started on other clients, even though I was 10 mins early. When of them was done, she motioned for me to take a seat at her table, but continued to eat some pastry bun (chewing with her mouth open, so classy) Was well warned not to go into a place because of the cheap prices, at this place you really get what you pay for. Still, I gave them the benefit of the doubt and asked for gel mani with chrome. I guess I should've been telling her point by point what I wanted because when it was done, I had to run out because it took everything in me not to get upset. Cuticles not cleaned, shitty filing/shaping and the gel is bumpy and uneven making the chrome on top look horrible. Save $30 on gas and go somewhere else. 1
I was looking forward to coming here for quite a while as I've heard really good things about the food here. I got 3 chillies for my food, but it was disappointing... There wasn't much flavour and it was really, really loud. Hard to hold a conversation here. 2
Went in with the family around 11:30 am on a Saturday.  There was no one in the dining area but when we left about an hour later the place was about half full.  Our server (Matt) was efficient and polite.  Ordered a side of mashed potatoes for my infant son.  They showed up a little too fast, as though they we sitting in a warmer waiting to be scooped out.  The wife ordered the angus burger minus the bun (she has a gluten intorerlance) with fries.  She enjoyed both though she thought the burger was just a little over done even though she asked for 'close to well done'.  I had the spinach, berries, goat cheese and chicken salad minus dressing.  It was very good though the chicken seemed a little sparse.  When it comes to chain restaurants, Houlihan's is average.  I will go back again when I'm at the mall. 3
I am huge sweets guy and Baked Bear is hands down one of the best. The idea is legendary and then they back it up with an amazing product. They could just serve ice cream cones and still be good! Seriously, that's how good this place. They could compete just on ice cream and then they have the idea of smooching it between a cookie and a brownie. 5 out 5 stars. Returning very soon. 5
We dodged a bullet with this person.  Wanted to have my bathroom remodeled.  I did my homework, checked the bbb, reg of contractors, etc, all A+ back in november.  He promised the work to be done in ~3 weeks ( in time for christmas).  I finally got most of the work done (gave up on a few of the items we did want done but weren't critical) by Feb 28th.  This one is a good example of why the current system doesn't work too well.  No matter how careful you are there are people out there that can take advantage of you or rip you off.  I managed to get out with the work that was done being ok (because I kept pushing and threatening).  Not my idea of how to get work done. 1
Have relied on AZ shuttle for years but now will try new shuttle service or drive.  Disappointed they have stopped providing water.  This is disgraceful and frankly stupid given the AZ heat.  What are they saving?  Five or Ten cents?  So bring your own water, oh and be prepared for stops at Denny's in Phoenix to delay your journey to and from PHX.  Fords they now use are noisier and less comfortable then Mercedes of the past.  Drivers remain courteous and competent. 2
Hands down, this is the best, most authentic sushi place in town. The sashimi is actually very fresh compared to other places I've been to downtown. The atmosphere is nice. It's lovely and quiet. It's one of those places you wouldn't really know of unless you just walk by it. We ordered a sashimi set and some tempura. Though the prices are on the slightly steeper side in comparison to other sushi place, the freshness is definitely worth it.Service was great. Did not have to wait too long for anything. It is definitely the kind of place you go to to enjoy and indulge on tasty food and not just to stuff your face with sushi 4
This place is no longer Pizzaiolo. Don't fooled, this place has seen a quick  decline in quality in recent months. Crust is hard and makes my jaw hurt (ouch). The sauce usually resembles watered-down catsup (yuck). That being said, I'd probably still smash an XL pepperoni if I had to...but like, reluctantly tho. 2
This is a mediocre car wash at best.  Yah they hand wash it but only wash about 70% of the car when it's wet, where it's supposed to be cleaned, then they clean the rest with spray bottles and towels when they're supposed to be drying it.  Especially when it comes to wheels.  When I asked the manager/service writer guy about it he said the owner wants as many cars through as possible, while he was agreeing with me, so they rush them through.  You have to walk the workers around and point out the mistakes and/ or missed parts that you payed for.  They now say there is an inspection person that checks quality but I've never seen a person checking cars ever.  The tire dressing they use and the way they apply it causes it to fling down the side of your vehicle, thus you have to ask them to apply it light, and / or wipe the tires down before you leave.  There are two workers I've noticed that actually work hard and clean your vehicle well.  The rest come and go with little to no training I'm sure.  They waste alot of water I noticed even though they are labeled as a water recycle wash, they even have a river through the dirt area downstream from the wash that has plants and weeds flourishing from the water that is wasted.   I've contacted the SNWA about it to no avail (sp).  The mats aren't actually cleaned also, they apply a chemical and agitate it with a brush... done, nothing removed.  Not the dirt and not the cleaner they applied.  It also takes over an hour for even just a basic wash.  Oh... and the person that sits in your car while it's going through the wash part will rifle through your compartments for whatever reason, steal your change at the least, and mess with your radio if not just to see how loud it will go.  Hope this helps anyone to know what they're getting into.  And check your vehicle before you leave. PS - Just watched them park my wet vehicle in the hot sun next to the two empty spots in the covered shaded area, nice.  Hope not to be back. 2
Chain restaurants aren't usually among my favorite places to find the best food in town, but in this case, Penn Street Station qualifies.  In the never ending search to find a good Philly outside of Philly, I found one at Penn Street.  The bread/meat ratio is good, the sandwich is moist but no too much so, and the cheese is stringy.  This sandwich is just satisfying. The restaurant is pretty basic, but it is clean and the customer service is good.  When you walk in the door the guys behind the counter usually greet you and after you order your sandwich they bring it out to you. Finally the French Fries are as good as you will find.  Add some catchup and malt vinegar to your fries and it rounds out your meal nicely. 4
Lovely little place, was always packed whenever I passed! Super friendly staff who gave good chatter & didn't mind the fact I took forever to decide (so many pretty sweets to choose from!)  They were also helpful in regards to my allergy needs & knew what went into everything which was great :)Cute place with some trinkets & tasty stock at the rear. Got a little raspberry & chocolate mousse.. thingy, really rich, nice presentation, enough to satisfy my sweet tooth for the day! Also got a mango smoothie, nice & refreshing though beyond sticky! Nothing a few napkins wouldn't fix though. 4
I had been looking for years for a massage therapist that is professional, knowledgable, and listens to my concerns and as well as adjusts the massage according to what she finds as the massage is taking place.  I have found that in Rosie.  It was the best therapeutic massage I have had in several years and will be returning as well as referring my friends and family. 5
I went here last night for mother's day and was very disappointed. I ordered the bulgogi and it was very salty. My daughter ordered the mac and cheese and we found a hair in her dish, we told the server, who just shrugged her shoulders and said "sorry". I will not be going back, the food is over priced for what you get. We tried to get reservations at Cafe Polonez, but they were all booked. Too bad.... 1
I was really disappointed with this show. For starters, I have seen many of the Cirque shows- Mystere, "O," Zumanity, Zarkana, Ovo, and La Nouba. I absolutely love the cirque shows, but not ONE. For starters, we sat in the second row. This was a mistake for two reasons: 1) it's actually better to sit further back for Cirque shows especially when there is any sort of flying around in the air being done. You have to look straight up or backwards at times. 2)the show had fog during several routines. Well these fog machines were literally right in front of us. It smells bad and I was choking on it throughout the show. Not fun.  The bad seats weren't the only reason I was disappointed. I expect amazing acrobatics to be done during these shows, but ONE didn't have much of this. I felt it was more choreographed dancing to Michael Jackson songs. Sure, the costumes and dancing was good,  but not what I expect from a Cirque show. There were moments I was yawning and would catch myself day dreaming. I feel they could have done a better job with this show, and I would recommend skipping it and seeing a different Cirque show that Vegas has to offer.  It was too much dancing around and not enough tricks/acrobatics. 2
Just no. Line was long but had the longest wait when we got to the front. The host was also being very unprofessional. Yes, it was hot but fanning yourself when all you're doing is telling the waiters how many people are in a party ... They have a big selection of food but everything was eh. Seems like they add sooooooooooooo much salt into everything :/ also, their "gelato" do not taste like gelato. Not even froyo or ice cream. It tasted like cold melting milk ... Bleh , was very disappointed. 1
Just want to say that this place needs to be managed a little bit better!!! You can tell that the girls upfront have a lot of their plate and no help from the site manager. Stephanie and Miranda are both very polite. Also the techs Monica and Melissa made me feel very comfortable and they are very knowledgeable. 4
Stopped in with my son to get lunch on a weekend last month. We found a booth right away, which is nice. We sat for some time waiting to have our order taken and we watched while a waitress cleaned other tables before she took our order.  It wasn't busy. I ordered the greek salad and my son, a bacon cheeseburger.  The greek salad was a large portion but wasn't anything to write home about. Not much flavor. My son's cheeseburger was "ok" Our waitress didn't seem to have much "flavor" either and she didn't really seem to care about our dining experience. We sat for a while before we realized that we had to pay our bill up front.I walked over to grab a fountain drink recently 15 minutes before closing, and the door was locked with customers inside. When I tried to open the door, that same waitress (the blond one) just looked over and then ignored me. 2
This was my first time in and I went with a group of friends. We had reservations and there was really no wait (less than 5 minutes). The decor of the place is adorable and the stylists all seemed really nice. That being said, I think it was pretty hit or miss on their ability based on how people were walking out. Some people looked great and others, not so much. I have long hair, on the thin side, but it holds a curl extremely well. I asked for the cosmo tai and ended up with long loose curls, but not a lot of volume. I really liked it...but as it fell throughout the rest of the night, I ended up with a mass of overly hairsprayed hair. The biggest issue I had was that while blow drying my hair with a round brush, my stylist kept getting my hair stuck in the brush and tugging to get it out. I noticed another patron sitting across from me whose stylist was doing the same thing to her.  The thing is, my normal stylist (who trims and colors and all that) could do this blow out in his sleep...with no tangles or stuck brushes. About the hit or miss...half of the girls in our groups looked FANTASTIC and loved their styles, and half weren't that impressed. One even put her hair up after we left because she didn't like her ringlets. I'd be willing to give it one more try...but I'm not sure if I will or not. 3
Cutsy stuff. I think the demographic for the stuff here would most likely be middle aged woman to elderly. Lots of knick knacks. I got this little coin purse which was a little pricey. Probably won't go back just because of my preferences. However this was a nice shop, just not my taste. 4
food is awesome. lack service many problems/ empty glasses/ wrong order/ waited for drinks. asked for the manager through the hostess. The hostess just went to the server. sever came over and never spoke with the manager. 2
Went to this place a couple days ago and ordered a Vegetable Panang Thai curry for take-out.What I found when I came back home was a bowl full of pieces of what looks like the stem or root of some plant (lemongrass? hard to tell). The largest part was at least an inch in diameter and impossible to chew (probably wasn't supposed to be chewed). That part of the dish was inedible and it took me a while to collect all these the pieces and put them aside.I tried to contact the restaurant to ask for explanations, they did not seem to care because they did not even reply to my queries.Will never go back here, even though it is steps from my apartment. I'd rather go to Lime on Eglinton to get a respectable Thai meal. 1
Probably the least expensive dining option at the Wynn. Best NY style pizza i have had outside of the real NY. And I'm a New Yorker.First time we went was our first night in Vegas. Trying to grab a quick bite after seeing a show. We ate outside on the patio and ate our slices next to the pretty waterfalls late at night. Very nice.Second time we came in for lunch with a larger group. Very busy, long line. They also have a vegan menu here (you have to ask for it, but every restaurant at the Wynn hotel has a vegan menu). My sister, the vegan, had a vegan sandwich (veggies on vegan bread) which she said was awesome.Here comes the bad news for vegans. This is a order-at-the-counter then go sit down and wait for your food to be brought to you place. The lady behind the counter who took our order was an english as a second language person. We told her repeatedly that my sister was vegan and everything she was ordering needed to be vegan. We pointed at the vegan menu several times. She still kept asking every time we ordered something, do you want that with cheese? Do you want the vegan one? YES, WE WANT THE VEGAN ONE we said, LOUDLY while pointing at the vegan menu. O.k., so at the end, we thought we had properly communicated that we needed all vegan food for my sister. On the vegan menu were vegan garlic fries, which we ordered. We made it CRYSTAL CLEAR we needed the VEGAN garlic fries, not the regular ones. Seriously, we said it SEVERAL times. Well, my sister gets her sandwich and fries and starts to eat. I say, what's that stuff on top of your fries? She said she thought it was big chunks of garlic. Then she takes a closer look and realizes it's cheese. We go to the counter and complain. The manager comes out. They replace the fries with vegan ones, but the manager seems to be blaming my sister for not ordering the right fries. Are you kidding me? We could not possibly have been any clearer. Seriously, this is a very big deal to vegans. No apology, no offer of compensation, nothing. Very disappointed in how that was handled.Here's some advice for Mr. Wynn. If you want vegans to eat at your restaurants, you need to ensure that the staff at all your restaurants understand the vegan issue, and that they speak english fluently. This was unacceptable. 4
Usually we are pleased with Bahama Breeze. ..However we made reservations a week and a half ahead of time for a going away party and when we show up  early for our time slot and are still standing waiting 40 minutes passed the time the only response we got from an employee when we asked what the hold up is was..."Obviously we get a lot of reservations here! " very disappointing! 1
This place totally sucks. I took my wife here for dinner and stood at the door for 15 minutes. No one approached us, no one offered to seat us, nothing.The place is a dirty shit hole that caters to a 3rd world crowd with no idea of cleanliness or hygiene.If forced between eating at this stink hole or cutting off my own cock and roasting it over an open fire, Id rather eat my dick.Its not even worth 1 star, but there isnt a choice for 0 stars. 1
We had dinner here. The service was great.  Our waitress was attentive and friendly.  The food was amazing.  We had Soondubu (spicy tofu soup), bibimbap, kimchi pajeon (kimchi green onion pancake with pork), mandu (dumplings) and kimchi.  The food tasted fresh, well prepared and cooked to perfection.  We literally couldn't stop eating.  I have lived in Korea and I can attest to the quality of the food at this restaurant.  The atmosphere was also very nice, it was intimate and romantic.  It is perfect for couples and dates. 5
So many people are posting reviews about the quality of service. I gave this rating a 2, because I recognize that Pikto is lacking in some areas, but their ability to reconcile issues is excellent.  I'm quite hard pressed to acknowledge that perhaps its your approach to the Pikto employees that made your experience a bad one.  If you are a jerk when you call and complain, they are less reluctant to help you.  I had problems uploading a layflat book to their new platform and I only had up until 10am the following day. Well, it ended up that it never uploaded and although I called in a panic, I didn't treat them like it was their fault personally.  They recognized the issue and were more than willing to help me.  I wasn't a jerk to them either. So, I ended up getting the service I deserved in light of the mishaps of their online uploading platform.  If you are nice enough, any one who is in the service/retail industry will be willing to resolve your issue. Thanks Pikto! I know some of your stuff isn't perfect, but your product is excellent and I will always come back! 2
I will start with the good! Sushi was good!SERVICE SUCKS! We sat for 15 mins before going up to the bar and had to ask for a drink. It was not even crowded. Service was so bad when we wanted anything we would have to go to the bar to get drinks which were weak. The bartender was so rude she acted as if we were putting her out. After being here for over 2 hrs and this going on we asked for a Manager who never came over. We asked again for the manager who walked past us 3 different times before coming over and was so taken back by our comments about her staff. She was RUDE and basically said it looks like the food was good since you eat it. REALLY THATS NOT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!I think the staff all young girls in their low 20's were more interested in the guys at the bar then servicing the customers they have.  We still tipped the staff but really should not have since the service was so bad.I would NOT suggest going here unless you want MAD SERVICE! 1
If you do come to this location, AVOID a salesperson named C.J. (obviously short for some other name.) Extremely rude, smug, and completely unhelpful. Not only that, but without helping our party with what we needed, he went to his other 'friends' and began gossiping like a high school girl. CJ is clearly only interested in his commission, and not with helping clients. Will be reporting his unprofessional attitude to head office. 1
Walked in 30 minutes before close.. All chairs stacked. Stood in line with everyone working just looking at us in line but no one taking orders. Everyone was too busy closing. Then when a lady came up to take our orders she was extremely rude.  Burrito was good but awful customer service. 2
Had some all day breakfast before a flight to Florida in May.I really dig the iPad set up for ordering and browsing while you wait. It also gives you flight updates from your gate. The food was A-Ok, standard eggs and bacon done properly. However that exact same dish would cost me $5 at a greasy spoon and I don't care to double that price for the iPad airport experience. 3
I hate the fact that I have to give this place such a low rating. Many aspects of it kick ass. I came to Vegas 9/25/13  for my honeymoon and spent my last night at the D. At check in I specifically asked for a nice room and would pay more. What they gave me was a room that was standard and next to the stage outside that blared music until late into the night. After complaints, we were moved to a better room that was quieter. Needless to say, we love old Vegas  but will stay somewhere else next time 2
This is the old fashion hardware store on steroids. They have tons of virtually every hardware item in open Bins and with the very knowledgeable, helpful staff. I look here for stuff I can't find at Home Depot. 5
Very disappointed that we didn't get all of our order. I ordered 1 lg 1 lg for .30 and our free pizza. the 2 pizza's came but the last one never did. Delivery guy said he was going back to store and would be back with our free pizza NEVER Happened, Very unhappy customer. might have to change pizza companies or change to carry out and change stores... 1
PLEASE BE AWARE THEY ARE A COMPLETE RIP OFF!!! DO NOT USE THEM EVER! They are a bunch of scam artists. They had a huge stain on my carpet and will not come out and fix it. They wanted me to pay more money- they are crazy!!! f%&^ them!If there were negative stars I would give that! 1
Just by chance I passed by the studio and saw the ad for the 'Hip hop hustle' workshop.  Four sundays in June for $40--never mind that I live an hour away, never mind I'd be out of town for one of those sundays...I. Wanted. To. Live. My. Dream.  Yes, it's a save the last dance/step up kind of dream but dreams are quirky.  You want what you want.I told this all to the husband, he quickly agreed-not because he really wants me to achieve my dream-he didn't mind spending a day in Madison every week.  The dance space is nice, a bit over the top pink but there was a respectable mirror ball.  My instructor, Jeanne, was friendly and, more importantly, helpful.  The first 15 minutes was a little warm up, learning some pretty easy choreography and then the majority of the class was learning a longer hip hop piece.  We learned a chunk every week and put it together at the end.  I felt pretty accomplished by the end of the lessons and wanted to continue the dream...The studio offers lots of different lessons, even a thriller workshop or a britney spears set of classes, and---my next dream: west  african dance.  I had been to Mali and there is really nothing to compare dancing with live drums; you are alive and you are joyful.I either wish I lived closer or they moved here...but moving to beloit? or janesville? hehee....highly unlikely.  I could probably fit a couple more classes but once summer is over, I'll have to put the dream away. 5
Under new management... Jenny has been doing my nails and always does an amazing job!!! Great new owners and always a great experience!!! 5
Honestly so overrated. Everyone talks my ear off about this place but the burgers aren't anything special, the milkshake i had was WAY too sweet and i seriously like my sweets. The worst thing about it was the prices; simply ridiculous. The place is way too small also. Honestly i'd rather eat at the five guys next door the burgers are better. Oops. Won't ever go back. 2
Booked through Priceline.  Disappointing since I was expecting a four star experience. 2
Food was good but not great. Prices were a bit high but Vegas has really become that way everywhere. Good service. 3
Nice place, games for younger kids, bar like feel for adults, missing the mark for teens; we tried hot dogs, burgers, sample platter, a little on the salty side, but otherwise OK.Come early to avoid crowds/lines. 3
We were optimistic for Sunday Brunch based on four overall Yelp stars, but this ended up being one of our worst dining out experiences. Ever.I ordered the crab cakes Benedict, and I didn't know you could make crab taste bad, but they did. It was dry, old, and chewy. The hollandaise wasn't bad, but there was so little of it you almost didn't know it was there. I ordered a side of grits for $2.50, figuring they'd be worth the hefty price tag, but they were stale, tasteless, and so old and overcooked they were just a homogenized mush. It was a disgrace to one of the South's most sacred dishes.Service was almost nonexistent. I had to ask another waitress for a refill of water because we never saw ours after we were seated. Bonus? The waitress of the adjacent table sprayed cleaner in my direction, splashing me with chemicals that, judging by the immediate burning sensation, weren't meant to be applied directly to human skin.All in all, the tab was skyrocket high for the quality, what service there was came with a frown or a spritz of chemicals, and we won't be back. 1
If I was able to give less than one star I would. I worked with Anna from Powerhouse Platinum and I end up paying for everything. First of all they gave me a house full of bugs spider webs and scorpions. Everything in that house was dirty. I wish I could upload my video from how they gave me the house. When I left the house I brought cleaning crews, carpet cleaner I changed the air conditioning filters dreamed the grass. She never returned my security deposit and she is also charging me $350 extra because the walls are dirty. I lived there almost for 3 years. Its called natural wear and tear. I hate them. I was so nice to give them the house in a better condition that they gave me. I will  never do business with them EVER... 1
Stop in, while having lunch near by.  They had wine tastings there, sample a few.  Nice store with large selections to choose from.  Ended up with 3 bottles of wine. Had to stop hubbby he could have bought more. It was like a chocolate candy store to him. The staff was very helpful. 4
Went there for burger fest. Had the $50 burger it was pretty good undercooked yet a bit dry. Would say this burger would be worth about $35 at most. The host was a little off asking us what we were there for? Like come on lol. Where here for drinks and some dinner. The place felt a bit snotty. Don't think I would return. 3
This is one of the best (if not the best) places for tacos in the Phoenix area. We've tried several different tacos and quesadillas and everything has been delicious. It's also the closest I've seen to authentic Mexican in Phoenix. The variety of salsas makes it fun to eat these dishes. 5
I visited on a Sunday afternoon and was excited just from their punny name alone. It was also a bao time (sorry not sorry) something came to replace use-to-be Go For Tea location. To start, it was very quiet with only another 4 guests sitting down. Maybe it was an odd time (3pm), or maybe most people ordered take out. The service was average, nothing spectacular. I ordered a Korean Beef Bulgogi steamed bao, as well as a Pork Belly steamed bao. Sadly I was disappointed with both of them - the Korean Beef Bulgogi had some flavours but lacked harmony. To be fair, it may just be a personal preference to keep kimchi (spicy sour) separate from bulgogi sauce (sweet). The Pork Belly lacked any sort of taste. Quite literally, it was made with a slice of pork belly and cold lettuce. While there was Hoisin mayo, I could barely taste anything. While I'm giving them two stars (one for idea and one for cleanliness), I don't think this was worth the price/effort. However, I do believe that the restaurant can easily improve their recipes by experimenting and perhaps reading the reviews they've been receiving thus far.I will consider coming back if they improve. 1
I love this store, Tom is really friendly and we love him! Many cute stuff and I recommend if you like stationary or finding some pretty gifts. The prices are quite fair. I've got a pencil bag and pretty mechanical pencil. :) 4
I love love love the tacos de camaron empanizando  great food great service and I also love the tostadas de ceviche mmm definitely  recommend 5
Doesn't everyone love yardhouse? Their happy hour is awesome.We gave them 4 stars, because overall they are wonderful. However, beware because they do have their bad nights. Tonight, we both ordered cups of clam chowder and one came out filled to the top and the other was way below the rim.Then our chicken sandwich came out uncooked!!! We sent it back and the manager was nice enough to come out and offer us more food & dessert on him.I have had the tomato bisque before and it was really good. Tonight, it wasn't good. I was very disappointed, because I LOVE tomato/tomato bisque soup.We definitely wanted to note that they have very good service. When you ask for a box, they do it for you instead of giving you a box to do it yourself. They even write the date and what food is inside of the box in the corner! Little things like that really do make a difference. 4
Not sure what has happened to this once fine restaurant the last few months.  It's been a favorite of ours and we've been regulars for years but will never return.  The last time (Sept '16) we were here and actually received food, the fish fry came out with soggy fish.  Our waitress acknowledged the condition but denied they had been sitting under a heat lamp or were microwaved. She offered no remedy or apology.  Today we waited 15 minutes at our patio table before a waitress appeared and offered menus.  After placing our orders we waited 40 minutes without seeing our waitress again.  Approached the manager who asked where we were sitting, as if that was to blame.  We left for the last time without ever seeing our waitress or our food!!!!! 1
1. I went to your store yesterday with a 50% off coupon.  Could not use it on an adult coloring books.  I looked around the store for something else but even with the coupon I found most items are pricey.  You have too many restrictions on coupons.   2. I have purchased items from 50% signage and when checking out the discount is more like 40%.  3. There is not enough staff on floor to answer questions. 2
Go to Leah at this place. She is great, not a chatterbox and knows how to cut Asian hair which is hard to find in LV. Reasonable price and no pressure sales to buy products. They are close on Sundays so plan ahead. 4
Ordered shrimp quesadillas...there was maybe 5 teeny tiny shrimp in each. Might as well of given me empty tortillas. Bartender seemed completely disinterested. Definitely won't come back. A downer. I'd avoid if in Vegas. Nothing happening here. 2
The food was ok. But the service was disappointing, we came at 1pm on a Saturday, it wasn't too busy, 6 tables two servers.  The server didn't give us water until I asked for it. At the end, servers were talking in the front for a long time before she handed the check. 3
Horrible store horrible customer service very very very horrible management. When I try to buy $3,000 in hot water heater covers and instead of working with me and getting them all shipped to my house they told me I had to go to 14 different stores to collect them all individual. I Went to the local plumbing supply house around the corner and had them all next day in one spot sad how Home Depot doesn't want to work with people. And do not ever buy an extended warranty it is just a rip-off they do not honor it if you did not keep the receipt after their manufacturer's warranty ends and then they try to say that warranty does not cover it steer clear of EX Walmart employees now working at home depot. They are all taking over... go to your local plumbing electrical Hardware Stores stay away from Home Depot 1
We went to Echo Sushi for the all-you-can-eat sushi (this place is always full every time I pass by). The sushi was very good, and very fresh. I love the variety of different rolls you get to choose from and that they have the option of brown rice too! They have gotten very creative with their rolls! The food was served very promptly after each order and the servers were very polite and friendly. Overall, tasty food with reasonable prices! 3
Third World country quality, Vegas prices. Avoid this place 1
Decent prices and the food is okay. We got the fried mozzarella, garlic bread, and lasagna. Mossarella was good and so was the bread. The lasagna had a little too much cheese for my liking but that is only one dish, the other dishes might be good. I did have quite the stomach ache after eating here which I read in some of the other reviews. That could be from any number of things though. There are too many other places to eat to give it a second chance. If on a budget then I recommend this place, otherwise I would find a different italian place. 3
Mike did a wonderful job of thoroughly cleaning our stairs and four bedrooms! Our carpets looked like new and he did it all for an exceptionally reasonable price, and took the time to make sure any cleaner/water/dirt was completely gone from our carpets. If you need your carpets cleaned and and cleaned RIGHT, definitely call Triple J! 5
That is not so bad as people complains. The air crew are nice and friendly. Please pre-arrange your check in and pay the luggage. Otherwise I didn't see any issues. Even it's very easy and efficient to get your checked luggage. The landing is better than the virgin airline. I didn't see this air company so "cheap" so described by those unhappy customers. I would recommend this airline company. 4
Great food and great atmosphere for a family.Very good value! 5
This is not my closest grocery store but it's my favorite to go to.  I like that they carry everything that I typically need, I find other locations don't carry everything and I have to go to other stores to finish my shopping.I do not like the new bakery though....this isn't totally bad since the baked good section no longer tempts me which is all in all better for my waistline:) 4
I question the sanitation of the utensils used..... I thought it was also rude that my appointment kept being interrupted because my stylists other appointments hair color was in the process of setting. Shouldn't double book like that. Just felt very impersonal and unimportant. This was my first time going to a hair salon in 6 years, so I was a little disappointed. My cut was very nice however for $50 I could get a basic wash and cut for a better quality experience down the road. 3
I'm a first time home buyer and my main concern was that my inspector wouldn't explain things or take the time to answer my possibly crazy questions.  Jeff Smith from Eagle Home Inspection,  LLC was very professional and patient with my home concerns.  I appreciate the time and thoroughness.  He took time explaining in detail concerns he found in this house.  I would definitely recommend Jeff Smith to anyone looking for a honest inspector.Thank you Jeff! 5
Cheap pbr and trading of recipes from prison. If you don't want to to go to a blue collar (or no collar) dive bar, don't go to a blue collar dive bar. Plenty of business in the front and party in the back; as well as misogynisticly-named sleeveless shirts.You can't handle the truth. 4
Love this place. Always get good service. Fast, efficient and low cost. They do an excellent job with dry cleaning all of my clothes. I bring comforters and other large items here as well and they always do an excellent job. I've had alterations done and they are reasonable in terms of cost and are very straightforward with whether they feel they can do the work and how it will end up looking. Nothing like fixing jeans and they look like they've been fixed in the rear! :) Would recommend this place to anyone looking for a fast, reasonably proved dry cleaning service. 5
Great place for drinks and a view of the Bellagio fountains from behind. Had drinks there last Monday with a friend around 6pm. No cover, no crowds, and was able to get seating in the lounge area and later at the bar. 5
Came in for the 3-5pm happy hour of 20% off- as listen on their sign. But when ordering I find out it's only certain items- even if I wanted to purchase more expensive items. And they were out of most Japanese beers. Not-so-happy hour. 2
2.5, rounding up to 3 because this used to be one of my fav AYCE and hope that this one not so great experience was a one time thing.So first off, Matsuda used to rank in my top 5 AYCE Japanese restaurants. It was close to where I lived, food was slightly above average, and service was decent. Mind you, I usually go with my family of 4, so maybe service was slightly better than if it was a larger group. But I haven't been going for about a year now. Until my office decided to have our annual Xmas gathering at Matsuda. I called about a month ahead to make reservations, since we were going to be 15+ people. Being around Xmas, I knew they would be even busier, and wanted to make sure we got a table at the specific date and time that we wanted. So I called around the beginning of dinner service to make a reservation for a Tues around Xmas. A guy answers the phone, takes down my information, and than tries to hurriedly hang up on me. But I had a few questions about pricing and wanted to double check he got my information right, so I made him stay on the line. He than sounded super annoyed, simply just answering "yeah" to my questions, and than at the end saying "don't worry I've got you reservation, don't worry ok" with a bit of an attitude and than hung up on me. So flash forward to the day of our reservation. We had a different number of people than we originally reserved for so we called to let them know the change, and they couldn't find our reservation. Well apparently, we were lucky since we were eating slightly earlier at 6:30pm, slightly before the dinner rush, so they said they would find a table for us and made us a new reservation. I wonder what would have happened if we never called to make a change to our non-existent reservation, we would have been stuck waiting hours for a 15+ table.Anyways on to the food, based mostly on this experience only:~Sashimi & sushi were a-okay, maki rolls were not as fresh.~One of my fav items here that you probably can't find at every AYCE is the Fish Head Soup. Its a pretty big bowl with one half of a salmon fish head, tofu cubes, and lots of nappa cabbage. ~Cooked foods were mostly average, nothing super good or super bad, that was particularly memorable.          ~Particular hits with my co-workers, but not necessary myself, were the Unagi Rice, Matsuda Golden Shrimp, and the Grilled Salmon Heads. Those kept getting reordered.~Desserts were okay. There were a lot of Mousse options. Good for if you like tiny cups of different flavoured mousses.Service was super slow. I can't believe in this day and age, we had to order by dictating our orders to our one designated waiter. Most other places have ipads, or at least an ordering sheet you can fill out yourself. This kind of ordering method becomes especially annoying when you have a large group. A lot of our food items were missing, or it did not come in the correct quantity. It was hard tracking down our waiter, and when we asked him to check on the missing items, they still didn't come. Drinks were not included. Weeknight dinner was $24.99, which is pretty standard now. I don't think I'll be back anytime soon. But maybe someday I'll give them another shot for old times sake, but definitely not with a large group. 3
Just finished eating here and it was okay...not impressed at all. It was a cute place but the waiter was unapproachable and seemed annoyed by us every time we asked him something (aka to get the menu again etc.). After reading the other reviews I was expecting amazing food and service but it was very average and not good customer service. Oh and the garlic rolls weren't that great either like others said. Wompssss!!! 3
I had the cashew chicken. I could do better in my own kitchen and I am not a chef. The chicken tasted old   On the plus side the portions were large and reasonably priced but who wants a lot of old chicken? 2
We had the noodle soup and rice dish.  The food quality is just OK.  Another "run of the mill" Vietnamese noodle food.  Nothing special - just OK.  Not sure why others rate them high.It is on the expensive side for Vietnamese noodle soup.  The extra large bowl was $8.25 but the size is just a regular size bowl when compare with other restaurant.  A good thing - they do wash and clean their bean sprouts.  The rice and pork chop just come with 1 piece of very THIN AND DRIED CHOP with plenty of rice - again not much food for the amount that they charge for the dish.  NOT GOOD.I have to agree with a couple of other reivews.  NOT MUCH SERVICE.  They just drop the food.  NOT VERY HELPFUL asking about the menu.   COMMUNICATION IS LIMITED. WATCH OUT FOR THE MANDATORY 15% TIPs FOR PARTY OF 6 OR MORE -  EVEN THEY ARE NOT VERY HELPFUL WITH THE SERVICE.  IT IS BURIED IN THE BILL.  I ENDED UP PAYING THE TIPs TWICE FOR NO SERVICE.  WATCH OUT!The bill was a little over $100 for a party of 6.  I think there are better choices to go for the amount that we spent. 1
Nice looking place, but service needs help.Seated ourselves and took way too long to get anyone to notice us.Since we weren't getting any service, I went to the bar and ordered two drinks.   I was told "no", that someone will be with me.  So I had to go back to my table and wait even longer for someone to notice us.After a much longer wait, we finally ordered drinks, which took way too long to arrive.Our table was soaking wet.The food was decent, so I'll give 2 stars instead of 1. 2
So decided to make a trip to Jamie's restaurant for some good food and ambience. Eight weeks after opening, its now a first come first serve, no reservations.Waited 3 hours for a table of five. Does that make sense? Why? Noticed a party of 6 who waited less time and were seated ahead of us, hmm. Another table of 12 is seated ahead of us. Manager, told they don't seat a party of 5 in a table of 6. Why would they lose that one seat. Really? Translation/interpretation, if u don't like it u can leave. Not a good start, and the attitude from the Manager, was astonishing. Once I complained further, got a table of 4 in which they seated 5. So ambience was missing...and accommodation. The food, ordered the garlic bread and ravioli fritti's. Ravioli frittis were very good. Garlic bread was a Naan (homemade pizza dough) with garlic bread and rosemary, really? Main course, salmon and the 10oz ribeye, both were very good.  The ribeye was very thin for a steak, but was tasty. No time for dessert as we were very tired. The waiter was very accommodating and friendly, a positive.Overall, my experience at Jaime's: money over customer experience, food was nothing special or different then other similar type restaurants. Two words, very disappointed. 2
The ceasar is fantastic! Stick to the appies and dim sum. The mains are over priced. Pretty sure they cut the scallop up three times and charged $23 for it. Huge disappointment. 2
I just love this program. In 1 week I lost 10lbs. Dr. Mike Miller was awesome:-) and the MA'S were great too. The wait was fast and the receptionist was wonderful. 5
I had a bridesmaid's dress altered here and was very disappointed.  It wasn't THAT complicated of an alteration either and I'm not all that picky.  The dress had a 'sash' around the waist and when I had to get the dress hemmed, in turn the 'sash' needed to be brought up so it was the same length as the dress.  Despite 2 attempts to get this point across, the alteration was never made.  Additionally, the way the 'sash' hung in the back, when the dress got taken in on the sides the first time, nothing was done to adjust the 'sash' and then I had the thing hanging way to the left, almost on my side instead of hanging straight down my back.Ok, maybe the 'sash' thing was complicated?  But beyond that issue, the hem was done terribly.  It was a tee length dress and the hem was done so poorly that it was 'bunched' weird in several locations so that it didn't lay flat.  Not to mention when I picked up the dress, there were still white fabric pencil marks all over the bottom of it where they marked the hem and never bothered to remove it when they were done.  I also specifically had to ask for the dress to be pressed when they were done.  I wouldn't have really expected to have to do this and i would not have cared that they didn't except that with the hem not done well, before pressing it it looked horrendous....at least pressing it helped to sort of make the hem lay flat.  Basically, I didn't feel like any of this was done well and even though the lady seemed a little embarrassed that her help didn't do a good job on this dress, she also didn't seem to care very much either.  She acted very annoyed that i needed additional alterations after the first attempt...when second alterations were mostly only necessary b/c of the bad job they did the first time.  Maybe this place is fine for simple stuff like hemming pants and the like, but i wouldn't trust a dress for a wedding with them again! 2
Entered the "sports bar" at noon today to catch some NCAA basketball tournament games. They were playing country music. I am not sure what they were thinking and I didn't wait around to find out. TV's don't make a sports bar, maybe they should take the word "Sport" out of their name? 1
Bad bad bad services. I ordered 4 items, and they came on the table almost together. The table was too small, it could not to be placed all of the foods we ordered, and there was no more spaces of the table for the bowls, fork and spoon, but the waiter did not aware it, and we asked him to change other bigger table or add one more table beside us. He looks not willing to do so. He just put the dishes on the table, and then went away. At the last, the printed the wrong bills to us. BAD!!! 2
The old menu is gone. RIP, old menu.I can't seem to find a copy of the new menu online, but it's smaller and more generic than before. I ordered a kale salad with pulled pork - got a tiny, expensive salad topped with prepackaged-tasting pork strips.510 is still fine for a pint. 3
been here twice now and its been great both times. the service the atmosphere the food, everything is worth your money. the baked sweet potatoes are amazing. the steakhouse salad is incredible and very filling i might add. Ive had the filet and the burger and man i have never had a beef patty that had so much flavor. 5
Went for lunch with two friends and ordered the L&V burger ($10) medium with the tots.  Burger was very well done, tots (5) were greasy and unseasoned.  Beer selection of mostly local craft beers was better than average but over-priced (even for Hudson).  Gastropub?  The L&V has a long way to go: basically bar menu/food with over-priced drinks and very average service.  There are a few better places very near this location you may want to try first. 2
Came for dinner on a Sunday night, not too crowded. But big table sizes. Hostess was very friendly and welcoming. Waitress, not so attentive and seemed stressed out. Took her about 8 min or so just to take our drink order and when she did, she said, "three ice waters for the three of you?" When clearly there is only 2 of us. (Scratching head) Not blaming the waitress, but it the booths have a stink to them, like they wipe them down with dirty water and dirty towels. Not really appealing to the nose when you're hungry and waiting for food. But the 2 stars are for their menu and quantity of food. Glad they finally updated their menu. 2
Seriously just because this is in west springs/ cougar ridge doesn't mean it needs to be over priced.  Felt so ripped off the pastries are tiny and just mediocre.  I get that this is a small business but find it hard to understand how much it would cost to to actually make the sizes to a size that has substance to it. 1
Always pretty good food! Great price. Awesome hot sauce. Love the traditional portuguese food! 4
We have been semi-regulars of Ronnie's for a few years. The food is consistently very good, the portions are huge, and the servers are all extremely nice and very attentive. It's not fancy or gourmet, but it's seasoned well and tastes good. My bf always gets the steak & eggs special and for the price, it's always very good (potential for chewy cheap steak, but it's not). The only criticism I can give is that since they expanded the dining room last year, the kitchen sometimes gets backed up when they are swamped (more seats but no extra kitchen = slower food) so you will sometimes wait a little longer for your food. We always have some type of special request on our order (extra cheese or sauce, no sausage, etc) and they always get it right. I definitely recommend Ronnie's, and have sent many friends there, but if you've never been there before, you may want to go on a week day when they aren't so swamped. But... the place is swamped for a reason. 4
Delicious pizza with lots of options for toppings and a friendly staff! What's not to like? 5
I don't mean to single out this location its all of The Keg that has gone down hill.  My friend took me here recently service was ok food was not.  I had peppercorn NY the steak was ok the sauce sucked! How do you screw up peppercorn sauce?  Also prices are up seems like that company doesn't care about quality anymore.  The Keg of 10 years ago I miss you! 3
Good place with good food. No complains . Tried shrimp and club sandwich, both delicious. Waiting could be lengthy sometimes, but it's worth it. Will be happy to come back and try something else. 4
I give it 2 1/2 stars if I could figure out how to do 2 1/2. Fresh OJ wasn't very fresh. Fruit wasn't particularly great.   I got the Southwest burrito - it was OK, not the best chorizo I've had. Will not be going out of my way to return anytime soon....  May be a good choice if you're in a rush and don't care that much about really awesome food. 2
Hit happy hour (4-6PM; $2 off beer and wine, 1/2 off all tapas) on a thursday.  Place was busy but had seating available.  We opted for the bar.Ordered a couple of beers a piece, nice and cold with optional cold pint glass.  Limited selection, we had Peroni and Newcastle.  Food selections:  chicken lettuce wraps- on-point, my favorite item on the tapas menu;  kobe beef hummus- seems weird, and was a little, but tastey, and the flatbread they serve with it is good; lobster bisque- I did not try it but when asked how it was, described as "lobster bisque."  So, seems like "so-so" to me.Overall, good experience.  Good service.  We were watching the chefs and prep in the kitchen and they were tediously measuring out EVERYTHING- to the ounce.  So, you're going to get consistency here. 3
Not really a Chinese restaurant, but an Asian restaurant that serves selected Chinese, Thai and Sushi dishes.Late on a weekday afternoon I sampled from the dinner menu. I tried the hot and sour soup. Most of the hot seasoning was on one side of the bowl. I had to finish mixing it up.The pot stickers were not inspired either: tough and overdone.The atmosphere was comfortable: dark and good for conversation. The service was excellent.House of Hunan left me longing for the Chinese restaurants of Northern California. 2
While visiting Scottsdale from out of town for a medical conference, I wanted to treat myself to a spa day/massage. I decided to come in for a one hour massage and visit the spa amenities the hour prior to my appointment.   Before my appt at Joya spa I climbed Camelback Mountain which is a strenuous 3+ hour hike up and down the mountain.  It would be an understatement to say that at that moment all I wanted was to relax in the spa environment and have a wonderful massage.  The Swedish massage was fine, not great.  It kind of seemed like the massage therapist was in a rush the whole time and not really focusing on what she was doing at the moment.  She didn't even ask me if I had any special area of focus (let alone any areas of injury or places to avoid).  As for the spa amenities, I was only able to enjoy the pool that is a part of joy out of it overlooks Camelback Mountain.   I had really wanted to enjoy the hot tub, sauna/steam room, cold shower as a way to unwind from my hike and relax for my massage. Unfortunately there were several rowdy girls in the hot tub talking so loudly that it made it impossible to relax anywhere in the locker room other than the quiet sitting room upfront where you meet your massage therapist.  Aren't there rules at spas that you should only whisper and not talk loudly in a group of 8 or 10 girls? I was very shocked and disappointed to find this type of behavior at a high end spa resort.  I mentioned it to the employee who was checking me out at the end of my massage and she simply said sorry and offered to give me a free day pass to come visit the spa.  When I informed her that unfortunately I wouldn't be able to use a free day pass since I am flying home tomorrow, she just said oh I'm sorry. Obviously none of these things are horrible but it definitely took away from the spa environment that I was expecting and that I paid for. I definitely expected a more peaceful, relaxing, spa experience for $200+.  Would not come back again. There are a lot of other spas in the area. 2
Nestled in between the galleries and boutiques at Gordon Square, Sweet Moses is a new treat bar. On a Saturday night after an opening at Wall Eye Gallery, the place was hopping. There was quite a wait in line and the place was packed with people until they closed.The sundaes are nothing short of artful. I've got pictures as well as a link to their menu on my blog: http://whatsincleveland.blogspot.com/2011/05/sweet-moses-soda-fountain-and-treat.html I'd call it pricey, but mostly worth it. Water came in glasses with crushed ice. Popcorn came for free to our table. It's romantic in an old-timey way.I couldn't help thinking that most of the proceeds from my six dollar sundae went towards the seamless branding and marketing this place has. This place would get more stars from me if:   - They had the structure to handle the high volume they're getting. The wait for a sundae is kind of ridiculous. But... they're new, so I have a feeling they couldn't have been expecting this kind of volume.- The prices were a little better... but, once again, the seamless brand experience doesn't come cheap.Things that made me happy: - They accept Discover - The pretzel and doily and popcorn - The crushed ice in the water 3
Let's just say one thing: don't expect them to let you in even if you come before closing time. We got to the place at 11:30pm, and there was one party ahead of us - so there was no line to get in. The hostess seats that party and then tells us that they are now closed and that we will not be able to dine there. There were no parties behind us. Okay what the hell was that! The restaurant clearly said it is open until midnight, not until 11:30pm. Absolutely ridiculous and rude. Never coming here again. 1
I've been wanting to try this place since I saw it go in, so I went for happy hour with a friend. I got there quite early and sat at the bar; figured I would just have a drink until she got there. I ordered a lemon drop martini--a favorite drink, and something that most bars can handle. I have no idea what the bartender put in this. I think it was sour mix and a very small amount of vodka, based on how incredibly sweet it was. The bartender asked if it was ok; I said it tasted awfully sweet so he kindly offered to add more lemon juice. He added quite a bit more "juice" from a container behind the bar and the drink tasted exactly the same--which is why I think it was sour mix. Oh well, I thought, I can stand to drink this and I'll switch to wine afterwards. The bartender apologetically explained that he "is not a martini person" and left. Fine, I get that...but this isn't a complicated drink and *you are a bartender*. I finished that drink and waited about ten minutes for the bartender to notice (again, at about 5pm on a Tuesday, when the bar was perhaps 1/4 full). He finally came over. I ordered a glass of wine. My friend texted to say she was finally on her way. Five minutes later, still no glass of wine in sight. I told her it wasn't worth coming and we met at Casbah instead.I finally flagged down the bartender ten minutes after this. He seemed to have no recollection of my wine order so I paid and left. Definitely won't be back! The specials were...nothing special, and certainly didn't rival the many better happy hours in the Shadyside area. 1
Great place for happy hour food.  The tapas are so insanely cheap that you can order a bunch and put together a nice little meal.  I'm not much of a drinker so can't speak to the booze values. 4
Delicious sushi, very classy, slightly expensive (depending on the size of your belly), good for dates :) 4
Visited Alle Darsene in July of '14 - it was recommended by the staff at Hotel Belvedere and for good reason! Our dinner was fantastic and the service was impeccable. The restaurant was filled with a mix of international visitors and Italians - great energy but not too crazy.  Will definitely return on our next trip to Como! 5
Low prices, huuuuge portions, I would have loved this place in university. That being said, their rolls go heavy on the fillers like rice and fake crab (impossible to avoid in this place) and skimp on the nice sashimi meat. We ordered alcohol, apps, and the most expensive thing on the menu (large party tray) for just two of us, but they didn't bring one of those little freebie side salads, which I've sort of come to expect at little sushi places. Side note: we will definitely order their ramen again, as take-out, great broth. 3
Where to begin....so I was in the mood for a Lobster Roll. I am actually from New England so it's rather important that this meal not suck. Unfortunately, it sucked. I don't know what was more insulting; the hotdog bun or the $18 + I paid. How dare you serve it on a soggy hot dog bun. Rude. The lobster part...flavorless and disappointing. The fries, salt-less, not as disappointing, however I probably had like a total of 11 fries. COME ON! 11 freaking fries. The coleslaw was ok, it needed more or less of something but I can't quite put my finger on it. It was served with some bread and pesto(?) it was so warm and good.All in all the decor was beautiful but I didn't go there to eat fancy chairs and flat screen tv's....Service was good. 3
I have never been more disgusted in my entire life. On Tuesday, my girlfriend and I were really craving Indian food so we looked at the menu on India times website, decided what we wanted and then gave them a call. My girlfriend began to place the order for pick up when the man on the phone said he was out of one of the dishes. So she politely turned and asked me what I wanted instead, and I said nothing just order the other dishes we decided on. When she tried to speak to him, he then said "call me back when you know what you want" and hung up. Now believe me, I am in the industry and know what it's like to deal with indecisive patrons, which is why I am always fully prepared when I call in an order. I then took her phone and called him back. When he answered the phone he picked up saying "what?" so I asked "why did you just hang up on me? He then began yelling saying " I told you to call back when you were ready to order" I then said " I want to speak to your manger" he then hung up again. I called back 5 or 6 times, each time he would pick up the phone and hang up. We then drove to India time to speak to him in person. There was not one customer in the place, when I told him who I was he then became so angry and began to scream and yell at me calling me stupid. (the whole time my girlfriend is video taping this) he then kept telling me to get the f**k out. He was so close to my face, screaming, that my girlfriend actually thought he was going to hit me. I was so shocked and mind blown that I actually wanted to call the police. He was a tall bald Indian man with a gold ear ring in his right ear. I hope this review will steer people far away from this place. 1
Lunch here is soo good!  Their house noodles are amazing. They are perfectly spiced and cooked everytime!  Comes with soup, an egg roll, and tea when you eat in.  All for 7.95. So worth it.  I dont even have to order anymore.  I go so often they dont even give me a menu!  One server is much better than the rest , but nothing beats these noodles for me!!!! 5
I'm gonna go ahead and say 'Meh'.  I'd give them an extra star for the cheapness and free ice cream but there are a lot of other places that I could eat better and cheaper food.  It's not that it's bad, but I feel that all of those sushi places on Bloor are pretty much interchangeable in both food and price (although, I would actually say that New Gen has a more creative menu).SOB is always packed, which should be a testament to quality/value but it's also related to poor service.  I'm usually pretty forgiving of slow service in busy venues as long as the food is good or staff is apologetic --unfortunately this didn't happen on my recent visit.   I attended a group event (for eight people), yet despite our reservation we still had to wait 30 minutes for a table.  Service was not only slow but also sporadic; everyone at the table received their plates at different times and one person didn't receive their food until everybody else was finished eating.  It's not as though any of the food choices were overly complicated, there were no substitutions and some people even ordered the same thing but received their plates ten minutes apart.  This to me, is the worst and least forgivable service infraction --the purpose of going out to dinner as a group is to share a meal together, not to stare hungrily at the person across the table because they have food and you don't. 2
I came here for family dinner (6 adults) on a Sunday and was hugely disappointed. There was a bug in our soup! A man in plain clothes (the manager?) came by and explained that their dried vegetables are sourced from China and that they have no control over the quality control overseas. He said sometimes bugs wind up in the food no matter how well they wash their vegetables beforehand. Seriously?!?! I was pregnant at the time so this was more than a bit disconcerting. They did not replace the uneaten soup and still charged us for it. The other dishes tasted OK (had to keep checking for bugs) but were WAY overpriced for their quality and presentation, especially in this area which is full of good, cheap Chinese restaurants.To add insult to injury, the waitress brought us the bill before we even requested it. And then IMMEDIATELY after we paid (literally after handing back the card machine), the manager asked us to leave because it was crowded that night! INCREDIBLY rude, and simply inexcusable after we purchased a $160 meal. 1
Local, organic, with gluten-free options, tastey, reasonably priced! 4
-5 stars!! Worst place ever. Don't bother going here you will definitely regret it. Save your money for a better serviced, hygienic, more organized and professional establishment. (You would think when a party of 40+ people are coming they would provide better service considering all the money you just brought into this dump for them) No one from that birthday will ever be wasting our time making that mistake again. 1
Excellent food! Was here over Christmas with a friend and we shared some steaks and side dishes. It's an a la carte menu so you can order to share.The dry-aged New York strip is the best! We also tried their filet mignon which was very good, nice and buttery; but the dry-aged NY strip blew it out of the water. We also ordered the roasted Brussels sprouts and the Yukon gold potato puree - fabulous...and fabulous! 5
Our finicky kids love the hotdogs, fries and onion rings.   Outdoor patio is busy but nice and clean.   Salads (Mediterranean and apple/walnut) were a good size and we all left with full bellies. Maybe it was the chocolate and strawberry milkshakes that put us over the top.   Thick and creamy!  Salads are prepared and served at a different area of the restaurant so it can be hard to grab everything when it's crowded and you have little kids in tow.    Will visit again! 4
Their specials (from midnight til 6am?): $8.99 for a burger and fries (+$1 ea for bacon, cheese, mushroom, etc)$8.99 for steak and egg with hash browns and toastIt used to be $3.99 for the burger, but then they raised it to $5.99... NOW, it's $8.99... BUT STILL WORTH IT!I had their burger and I added the bacon, cheese, and mushroom because that's what I like! LOL! The burger was HUGE! It was definitely filling! The fries were amazing! Totally caught me off guard. They were perfectly crispy and seasoned really well. My burger was delish! My boyfriend had the steak and egg. It was pretty good, too. Granted, the steak was a bit bland, but it was perfectly cooked. The hash browns were a bit different than what I'm used to. They were CHEWY! I couldn't figure out how or why, but it was interesting. I'm always FOR trying new things! This place is located in the Flamingo. You have to walk through the casino to get to it, but it's worth it. This was my first time here, at the Burger Joint, and I was a bit surprised that it was THAT GOOD! The staff were so warm and inviting. Overall, this place is a good place to go for a late night snack on the strip...even on a weeknight! 4
Unless you're trying to kill a $20 and an hour don't waste your time. It's got some cool fish and animals (jellyfish were cool) to see but compared to real aquariums like Shedd in Chicago it comes up so short. It feels more like a Vegas "check the box" than a true attempt at building a great attraction. 2
Frequent the Tavern Grille for lunch from time to time. If I reviewed the place 6 months ago I would have given it a 4 for surprising me with a thoughtful menu and great service. Unfortunately, recent visits have served to taint my original impression, and I can only dole out a 3 a this point.Their beer selection is excellent, with a variety of local brews on tap along with a great selection of bottled beers. Local brews, especially IPAs, garner a star all on their own.Their menu has a huge variety of options, and many of them promise substance above and beyond your local bar food. Unfortunately, execution on the food tends to be so-so, much of what we've sampled being a little...bland. My reuben was average at best, and my wife's chili burger (order by mistake) was clearly topped with canned chili - a big no no in my book. I do have to say I enjoy their take on green chili cole slaw.The serving staff we've had have been cheerful, the waitresses definitely being a positive for the place. But the past two times our food has come out so late that it was the manager coming by with our food to apologize that we had to wait so long. Predictably, the food was cold both times.I was hoping we'd found a new go-to lunch place, but at this point, I think the search is still on. 3
The called themselves "The healthiest frozen yogurt in America..." Can't confirm that, but it's very tasty and light. The Spicy Mango is wonderful. At first, I thought it was strange but it was yummy and tingly. Disneyland dole whip is also delish. 4
Overpriced, over rated. The burger wasn't good, the fries were limp.  I will never go back.  In-n-out for me... 1
Drive past here a lot. Always wondered what it was like. Stopped today for a late lunch after looking for houses in the area. Quite impressed. Really good selections on the menu, lots of Italian options. Tasty meal, nice ambience, and good service. Will definitely go back. 4
Dinner on opening day, Shoyu ramen times two. The first shoyu ramen ordered the original way and the second, due to dietary restrictions, side pork items only with soft boiled egg and veggie broth instead. Tasted great, but restaurant could not substitute pork for chicken for me and would charge to do so. I wasn't trying to obtain something for free but thought it would have been a compromise at least with a piece of chicken and still charge me $2.50 even if I declined the pork items ?! That did not sit wellwith me. This restaurant is similar to Monta entree availability. It's okay but maybe they should be more flexible w orders or have a build your own soup / noodle bowl. 3
We love coming here to pick up our corn tortillas and chips (for cooking at home) which are made fresh on site.  The chips even keep and taste great up to a few weeks later.  We haven't tried eating in/take-out from here, but based on the comments, I don't think we're missing much.  One of the hidden gems in Kensington. 4
Although this isn't my home parish this is one of the few parishes around the dioceses of Las Vegas that offers Spanish mass. It is a little bit of an older church but it, like all the other churches around, is very welcoming. I believe my favorite thing is when they do their taco nights. Those tacos are the BOMB DIGGITY!!! Not even taco bell compares to what they sell. The church has floor seating but there is also a second story that offers extra seating. 5
Atmosphere is cool.  Fish tacos are fresh but missing something in the taste.  Steak tacos were better.  Make reservations.  I would go back but not hurry back. 3
Dear Foodies,Normally when I write reviews they are about the alcohol and food that I enjoy at the establishment. However, this time around I only enjoyed the delectable cans of beer here at Short Leash because we ate elsewhere before stumbling over to this place during First Friday. I had the Coconut Porter in a can and it blew my hair back. I also tried a yummy Pilsner that they have in a can as well. Their beers on tap or not that adventurous or exciting to me so I opted for can and was very happy. I will return to eat the food there; it smelled and looked amazing as the servers walked the food to the tables behind me. 3
My wife went to get take out at this establishment tonight. We didn't order anything fancy or complicated to make. After waiting in the restaurant for more than 30 minutes for our food (2 falafels), we ate them immediately because we were so hungry. They were not even warm, they were cold. The lamb was so chewy it was nearly impossible to eat. Cold, chewy lamb is not what I had in mind. There are lots of great restaurants in the city now. If you can't nail down some Greek food standards, and serve food hot, people will choose to go somewhere else. I know I will. 2
So I have been burned by yelp reviews before, but this time they sent me to a delicious food truck! The jerk  chicken was decadent. If you have a low tolerance for spicy, however, probably stick with the beef patty. I promise it tastes WAY better than it looks. We also got the jerk chicken burrito special, which was all the flavors at once. Highly recommend! 5
Please beware, this company DOES NOT RETURN YOUR DEPOSIT. Instead they refuse to return the deposit and indefinitely state they are calculating the cost of damages. The company rarely responds to calls and when they do they refer you to an email address...which of course no one responds to. It's a shame to see so many reviews on Yelp that state this same problem (see "not recommended reviews" section...very eye opening). 1
Came to this location of On Tap after a long day at work.  I was seated immediately, and we got our drinks asap. The food wasn't anything to write home about and our waitress (Miss Brookelynn Estepp) was terrible.  We saw her 2 times the entire time we were there.  We were ending our meal and got our checks.  I paid my $50 tab while my fiancee tipped in cash (how we always prefer to pay at restaurants) I even tipped an extra $2 on my card in addition to his $28 cash.  So in total, we tipped Miss Brookelynne $30!  We leave and get in the car and I see that I have a friend request from our Waitress, Miss Brookelynn. I thought it was odd, so I ignored it.  Not 2 minutes later I see a Facebook post that she tagged me in, I open it to see that this waitress POSTED A PICTURE OF JUST MY SIGNED RECIEPT (signature and FULL name included) the posts says "We don't tip $2 on a $50 tab (my name)".  To which in any other circumstance I WOULD AGREE WHOLE-HEARTEDLY, but in this case this was not true I tipped $2 on my card, yes.... but there was a whole $28 in cash sitting there too honey buns.  So yeah, for posting my signature- on the internet as well as my full name to try to put me "on blast" I will NEVER again eat here or ANY other ON TAP. 1
I came to Ah So for a friend's birthday. The cooks were awesome and really put on a good show. The food was decent, but a bit over priced. However, the service and show made up for the higher cost. 4
Hidden gem in indian land sc!! We went to check it out and bow we are hooked! Best variety of infused olive oils and balsamics out of this world! ! All glutten free yummy baked goods and a ton of drinks to choose from!! The service was superb! !! 5
Spiffy place, definitely a social setting. I enjoyed the concept of the bar not to mention the staff especially Taylar who was extremely helpful and informative. Taylar made the experience amazing keeping a smile on her face throughout the entire time. I do think the drinks could be a little stronger, I could barely taste the alcohol. Overall it was a cool experience. 3
I am completely new to town, and I had an appointment at 9:15. My schedule is nuts with starting school and finding an apartment and I have to leave to go back home for my sisters wedding so I needed a wax ASAP! I got lost trying to find the European wax center and ended up being 10 minutes late. When I walk in and get checked in, they said they could not take me back because it was over 9 minutes past my appointment. Not even A CALL to let me know that was their policy. I had to rearrange my schedule. Left a bad taste in my mouth. So, I give no stars if I could. 1
The coffee is amazing! It is fresh doesn't have that bitter aftertaste. I will definitely be coming back! 5
I have been here twice. The front desk service is fabulous!  They have greeted me each time with smiles, offering water and helpful with questions I had. Dr. Reed is down to earth and completely professional and caring. I would highly recommend Camelback Healthcare to anyone looking for a great team to take care of all your needs. Huge fan! 5
My husband and I came here last night for an impromptu dinner date and because we had a gift card to use. My husband ordered the Shepard's Pie & I ordered the shrimp scampi/herb crusted salmon combo. The quality of food has gone down the drain. My husband got super sick from the Shepard's pie! My plate had way too much sauce and was extremely garlicky. It was basically drowned in sauce, my shrimp was soggy and the plating was a mess. I don't think we will be ordering any food from the restaurant but only cheesecake. 1
We have booked 2 rooms for 2 nights for us and for our 2 teenager boys. The drama started when we checked in and there was no room available with separate beds for the boys. That got resolved when we agreed to pay extra (700$ for the 2 nights). We were told we cannot use the refrigiratore in the room because it is full of items for sale and a removal of an item will immediatly cause a charge to the room. Just to clarify its 106 in Vegas right now. When we came up to the rooms I was shocked to find out that in order to make my self coffee in the room in a disposable cup I have to pay 5$. The boys wanted to use the gym and were told it will cost additional 35$. Apperantly the is no limit to being greedy. Furthermore, an old sock was waiting for us by the dresser. And to top it all, an Ice Cube party is taking place right now and its 2:20 AM and we are all wide awake with no chance of being able to sleep. Guest services just told me it could continue until 4 AM. How are we supposed to be able to drive to LA in the morning. This is the worst ever.In all fairness I had to add to my review the fact that at checkout I told the manager about our experiance and we got compt for the last night. 2
Great food and juices.  Kale chips are awesome as well as their homemade "granola" which is addicting.  Freshly made vegan meals are very good and the juices I have tasted are all excellent. 4
Thank you Roxanne for taking care of my annulment in such a professional way,I would recommend Mr. Louis Schneider without hesitating at all. He is very honest and professional. His staff is outstanding.Thank you againRita D. 5
I love rebar, there are tons of friendly people here-I almost always make new friends when I come. The drinks are always flowing, and the food is always good! My favorite dishes are the black bean burger, the jicama that comes with the wings, and the grits and shrimp. Definitely a good place for vodka mixers-less options when it comes to wine. 5
Meh..... Service is good and our waitress was very nice. The food is mediocre and nothing special at all.  All of our meals and pizza we're cold and tasted like reheated  frozen food that was over priced. 1
I live close by, but I don't want to go to this Urgent Care ever! I have been there before most recently 10 days ago. The front office reps are terrible! This morning I arrived there right around 8:00 am. While walking in I seen an older gentleman outside by the front door having difficulty breathing. I go inside and there are patients waiting to check in. I asked out loud if I should sign in, and a patient waiting said they haven't signed in. The front office rep said she had to get set up first. She was turning on the tv and opening blinds. She knew of the gentlemen outside, she stepped out and I heard her tell him that the provider should be in soon. Then she was still messing with the tv. Then medical assistants came thru the front door and td her that he should be brought in back to have his vitals taken while waiting. He goes back the front office person starts checking others in. Then finally my turn to check in. I fill out the paperwork and have ins card and license in hand , but the front desk busy with paperwork doesn't look up just says "hold on".  Stand there for 20 seconds she is still  doing paperwork. I go sit down for about 30 seconds and someone else goes to desk and hands her their paperwork and she takes it without telling him to "hold on"!! Sorry but they have terrible customer service. I tear up my paperwork drive down to Queen Creek to another Urgent Care, no one in the waiting room, fill out my paperwork and give to the knowledgeable and friendly front desk rep and I am seen by dr within 5 minutes.  It's worth it to me to go somewhere that doesn't treat you like crap! 1
I would not recommend Joyce for bridal alterations. First and foremost, she is not friendly at all. I put on my dress for the first time since I bought it at her store, and was so excited about it. She made me feel rushed and took away from the moment. Then, she charged me $200 for bad alterations, which I ultimately took to get fixed for $100 elsewhere. 1
Not the best place to sit in and eat as its very cramped. We had a group of 7 and we pretty much covered more than half the floor space. The nigiri/sashimi isn't anything special either but the rolls, my dear lord  the rolls are glorious. One supersized piece of sushi roll at Sushi Bong is probably equivalent to 3 pieces at your typical AYCE. We ordered the largest party tray and it had every single roll stuffed with cucumbers and avocados, on top of the sashimi and tempura of course. I was baffled when my friend who ordered often from here told me that the rolls used to be even bigger.  How is that even possible????If you are around the area and craving for some quick sushi, this is definitely a place to check out 4
So i just got married on 7-15-16 on the terrace gazebo. It was absolutely beautiful for a small intimate wedding. Staff was great, everyone was very helpful and seems genuinely happy for you. I booked a reservation for a ceremony over the phone and i was told on the spot what times were available that day. I took the 930pm which was perfect for us cuz it was not too hot outside. Now i live in LA and didnt come down till 4am the morning of the wedding. So naturally all my planning was via email and or phone calls. Everything still came out beautiful and exactly the way we planned it.I didnt wanna pay over $95 for just 4 pictures so i chose the normal $299 package with no added photos.Day of i was assigned my own photographer.Now my photographer Roger was great! He took great poses and was very sweet.  He even offered to take poses we personally wanted. He took over 170 pictures.The next day when i went to see my pictures i was thrilled!! It was so amazing i nearly cried. And nearly cried again once we saw how much the pictures are.  Now luckily my husband is the sweetest man in the world and payed over $ 700 so we can keep all our shots.So my suggestion is to all u lovely couples, when choosing ur packages do not worry about a package with pictures. DO NOT ADD a photo session because ur photographer will take pictures for u anyways and the packages u are offered once u see all your pictures will be completely different But i couldnt be happier. Truely it was amazing 4
Food is good! Definitely above standard and representable. Place is so small but well decorated.Service is general. Everyone looks like just doing their job.A place you will always remember and go back. 4
Great food and wonderful service!!!! The manager is really friendly too! I would definitely recommend the steak quesadillas and the margaritas. I love the feel of the restaurant and that they are renovating the front entry. I can't wait to see it completed. Thanks for making this meal and experience!!! 5
This store has so many flip flops to choose from it was hard to pick out just one pair. I was a little upset with one of the workers in there trying to get me to buy the smaller size rather than the size that fit my foot. 4
This is a quaint, hole-in-the-wall, mom and pops type of place. It's usually not very busy, which baffles me cause they make the best damn baos & dumplings in the city. The owners are very personable and friendly, although there are a few communication problems if you don't speak mandarin. As someone who has had fresh off the steamer bao from vendors in China, I can vouch that this is probably going to be as good as it gets for authentic food in Toronto. I am pretty sure their the flour is home made, and bonus points for their Green Onion Pancakes that doesn't taste like someone dropped the salt while making it.Edit: Pro-tip : be patient or speak mandarin since there might be a language barrier when ordering online! 5
Great pizza, great price!  Cannot beat this for the money!  Crust is delicious and toppings are fresh.  I have a family of four and this fits great within the budget!  Perfect for a family of picky eaters.  Everyone gets exactly what they want and how they want it! 5
had a $20 slow cooked pork dish (cochinito pibil) that was described as a house speciality.  Nothing special.  Salty, a little dry...lots of spices. Obvious sauce drips on plate rim were partially wiped off...made the plate look unapetizingly dirty at first.  The $7 Modelo tasted great! 2
To preface this: I think smiling banana leaf has some of the best thai food in pittsburgh.Why did I give it 3 stars?  Their main waitress is absolutely awful. She is rude and ruins the experience nearly every time. I have friends that refuse to go to smiling banana leaf with me because of how rude the waitress is. 3
Went on Father's day. I will preface this review with that yes I know that Father's Day is probably one of their busiest days of the year. I will also say that I don't blame our server for the slow service we received, I think it was management's lack of having the store being properly staffed for the day. My steak was cooked perfectly and the sides and salad were good. So on those merits I will give three stars. But the speed of things left a lot to be desired. We were seated immediately, but didn't get greeted or have our drink orders taken for 15 minutes. The waiter kept trying to make it to our table to get our order but kept getting short-stopped by impatient people at other tables. He obviously was getting overwhelmed. After our drinks finally arrived 15 minutes later he took our order. Then finally after an hour after being seated we got our entrees. I should have taken the hint when the waiter did that thing where they just throw the check on your table without asking if you want desert, but we ordered desert anyway, which turned into a half hour ordeal after first placing the order. Then my daughter received the  wrong item and we had wait another 15 minutes for them to fix it. So almost two hours after being seated we finally left.Luckily I had really good company, and overall had a great tasting meal. It is just that it was at the speed of some french restaurant where you get the table for the entire night. 3
Everything is barely mediocre. It doesnt have anything special, the owner is incredibly rude/cheap, and everything is so unnecessarily expensive. You have to pay extra to get a few more pieces of lettuce, and food quality is sub par at best.For better kbbq, i recommend... well anywhere else! 1
Very decent pub with pretty good food and drink selection and professional, efficient staff. The macaroni cheese with chorizo is the heartiest meal I've had in a long time and the cocktails are pretty nice and well priced. A great place to make your local. 4
I love this location, the problem is that it gets soooo busy here it has an effect on the quality of food being made. The line to the drive-through gets 20-30 cars deep at peak lunch and dinner hours. I've been here about five times total and twice my food has been a bit undercooked.I know it recently opened, but by now the kinks should have been worked out. If I had to choose, I'd go to the Chik-fil-a at 31st Ave and Beardsley instead of this. 3
Not the same experience when the owner isn't here. When the cats away the mice will play. Not a relaxing experience at all today. Very rushed and sloppy. All the employees did was talking back and forth with each other laughing which is very uncomfortable! Sorry you told me you had new better people. That doesn't seem to be the case. Very disappointed 1
Place is always packed for weekend dinners, harder to get in if there's more than a party for two.Giant portions, love that there's enough to share or to munch on the followinh day.  Cheese crisp and p'zookie are our motivation to come here, wish tables were not too close together, but I get it's part of their charm, plus that would mean less tables and then there  would be a longer wait ;) 3
I had my monthly service today with Sam S. He performed a quick professional job. 3
Lemme start of by saying the low rating is not because of the food quality or service. Both of those are average. But honestly, this place is thievery. Maybe people who like this place aren't middle eastern or haven't been to a restaurant that serves this type of food because at this place, they think it's fine to serve you HUMMUS for $16!!!!!!!!! We asked for some hot sauce, and they charged us for a tiny bit. When we asked why, they let us know it's made with 12 intricate ingredients. Come on man we weren't born in rural Canada, we know you don't charge for hot sauce. The icing on the cake is when you ask for more pita, and they bring you 4 tiny triangle pieces and then charge you. Kabob for $31? Dawg.... that should never exceed $20, idc what meat quality you're using. Lamb kofta is two smaller than usual kofta with beans. Yes because beans are very pricey and worth $25. To the manager, your food quality is fine. Just don't expect people from the region to buy into this prices. We know pita is worth 0.05 cents. I felt insulted lol. 2
First time there, was not too bad, service was ok.  Second time, food tasted like a frozen dinner, service is very poor.  Will not eat here again. 2
Have always loved this place, but the last visit could have been a lot better. The meat was over cooked and the service below par. The tres leches was to die for though! 3
used to have good wings in the past; however, last couple of times--ordered the thai wings--really dry and tasteless (seemed refried and had no meat or sauce on them); since then, have been avoiding this place; lots of better places for wings. 2
Pros:-I love the food-locationCons:-Could lay off the hipster attitude of the hostesses-decor is uncomfortable 4
LAMP was very good. The staff was friendly and service was great. We got antipasta, a grape and gorgonzola salad and the Gem pizza for three of us to share. The ingredients were fresh and everything tasted good. It is a bit pricey but not unusual for the area it is located. The main reason for the four stars (rather than five) is I didn't like the food quite as much as some comparable places in No Scottsdale. I would definitely go again though. 4
Saw it on Diners,drive inns and dives- it is a gem! Glad we went service was awesome,good and rprices great. My only complaint was it dint appear to be very well kept.Dust pictures and baseboards on the walls which you would sit right up to. A good clean could fix all of that! Have already reccomended it to several people and will make it a regular stop... 4
excellent, authentic French bistro--decor is 70's basement meets bistro, but truly one of our neighbourhood favourites. Wonderful fish, affordable wine, creative desserts. We keep returning and have never had a bad meal in 7 years. 4
Cool spot for a late night prime rib break from the tables. Solid Royal Player club specials. Some booths overlook the casino floor so you can stay close to the action. May visit again. 3
Can I say milkshakes to die for!!!  SOOO many choices and an awesome vibe!! We both were happy with our meals, offbeat takes on classic diner foods. 4
Usually order from this location. Always dependable product and good quality. Manager is personable and accommodating. This is one of our go to's. Thanks guys for being awesome! 4
This company is for the birds.  So sad the wrong people are running it.  They have all this marketing at the wrong time.  Way to push sales people.  They're overpriced with the items they have in stock.  Get a clue and a new group to run the company.  This whole year I've seen it go down the tubes.  Bye bye Joann 1
Yes horrible place yes it was cheaper by like 15 bucks but not even a month later my phone acted really weird!!! It would freeze every five min I couldn't do anything I would have to hard shut it down!!! I tried it out for two more days then I couldn't deal. I went back to the store noting I called prior to getting there they had a sign that said they will be back at 11 I arrived there 1120  came back on the weekend to explain to the guy he took my phone back said it been a couple days pass the month (they didn't even tell me there was only a month warranty) that he would make me a deal and only charge me 70!!! Or a new screen!! I said u guys did a shitty job why do I have to pay more to fix it.. Long story but yes they didn't want to fix it so I left don't waste ur money on this shady place!! Just pay the little extra and go to a professional place 1
My wife took me here to look at a possible retirement party spot.  Wow, this is not just a spot for that.  From the moment we walked in, the smiles, the laughter, the fun oozing from every corner, every decor - even the light fixtures, you can't help having a smile on your face.  Next came the menu and the beer list.  So many choices and ones I haven't seen any where in Phoenix (hint: Any of the Deschutes beers), all on tap no less.  Then the food, appetizers and pizza, the best I've tasted in forever.  The staff; our waitress, McKenna was fun, attentive, and made us feel even more welcome.  After thoroughly enjoying a relaxing meal, the General Manager came over ( Matt Bertrand), just check up on us.  After explaining our retirement plan, he sat down with us and gave a run down on how we could do it.  I could go on and on, and this place deserves all the accolades, however I'll just say, this will be the place to have our party.  And, we have just found our new favorite place for a night out! 5
I have been looking for a good Chinese restraint for lunch near work. This one fits the bill perfectly. 4
I've been to Spuntini several times - for multiple occasions - over the course of let's say.. oh... 4 years?When i went for my birthday (first time) it was AMAZING! The food tasted good and everything was fine. Service was good. Ambiance was just right.I went another time for more of a romantic dinner. The service was good, but the food was not as good as I remembered.I went the following year with friends again. I'm not sure if the cook changed but seriously their pasta was not as good as I remembered. I probably won't return again if i had a choice. I don't hate the place, but it's nothing special. Rather spend my moola somewhere else. 3
Best poker room in Arizona. There are big screen TVs every where.  Food is great and staff were friendly. 5
Found cockroaches in the room. Awful awful maintenance and cleanliness. Didn't know how bad condition of the hotel was- just thought they had a cheap deal for the day. We just checked right back out and got our money back. 1
your basic DQ the girls are young and don't want to be there! very short with you and not the most personable. 1
10$ for a 3 piece tender meal.  I got the world's smallest tenders. Definitely not worth the price. Very disappointed.  They didn't even offer to switch out tenders.. 2
this place is fantastic! professional, attentive and timely service. a walk in led to truck issue being fixed quickly and expertly so that i could continue with a cross country trip. excellent customer service and a pleasurable experience overall. 5
Can I do ZERO stars?!?!?!I was here for a semi-formal informative event for a student organization. We had a nice suite and our room was packed. Granted, we had more people in there than we were supposed to (especially according to fire codes), but what happened next was UNCALLED FOR.The security came in and SCREAMED his lungs out at us. He was straight up RUDE. It was completely unnecessary. No one was under the influence of alcohol or anything. Everyone was a grown up, competent person. We would have appreciated him sincerely telling us that we have too many people and that the management is asking us to leave, but NOOOO he just had to yell at us and be a complete jerk face.We were all happy to leave and we will never be back again.OH, BUT WAIT... THERE'S MORE. We were all trying to leave, but some of the VALET attendants were ridiculous as well. There was an asian man who was very rude to me and completely blew me off when I was kindly trying to ask a question.Finally, after all of our friends were gone, there was 1 other couple and myself STILL waiting for our cars. We were one of the first people to give our tickets to the attendants. We watched people give their tickets and get their cars in just a few minutes, while we were waiting THE ENTIRE TIME. Only after everyone was gone and we were the last ones left did they FINALLY say, "what happened to your cars?" At that point we were SO ANGRY and over it.NEVER GO HERE EVERRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!! UGH im getting angry thinking about it. 1
This was my first time visiting Mucho Burrito, and based on that experience alone, I would be back.I've had my fair share of visits to Mexican-type, burrito chains (Burrito Boyz comes to mind), without much luck. Ya see, I'm not a fan of cilantro (aka coriander). I absolutely hate it. I will deal with it when necessary (usually in salsa is fine because it's always pre-made and it's very faint), but I cannot stand it when it's used as a garnish. This is why I tend to stray from Burrito Boyz because I'm pretty sure they cook their protein with cilantro. Gag.Mucho Burrito, however, does not. YAY! Boy, was I ever pleased. I ordered a chicken quesadilla, which came loaded with cheese, chicken, peppers and onions. I was mulling around the idea of getting a combo (chips and salsa), but glad I didn't because that thing was massive and came with a side of sour cream and salsa.It was delicious. And they even have a liquor license! I had a Corona with mine. Yum! 4
Fair prices. I did not feel like I needed to get several prices after talking to them. They were booked out till 3 days....a good sign they are in demand. He explained to me that the prior repair(only about 3 years ago) had given me cheap small springs. DO NOT GO WITH THE BIG NAME REPAIR COMPANIES) . I recommend these guys and will use them again. 5
We went to Harlem on July 6th for Summerlicious Lunch.   This place has character, its comfortable, with a very cozy feel.  Great atmosphere, Great food. The service was great. The server was very engaging and genuinely nice and attentive. We had the Catfish sandwich and the vegetarian curry with coconut rice and for desert the Plaintain in brown sugar caramel sauce. (very delectable a definite must have). I would recommend this venue. It is a delightful experience 4
My partner and I retired and bought a house in Las Vegas in April, 2010.  At that time we tried out yours and the Aliante Stations buffets and yours was, hands down, the best.  We visited the Cannery several times a month for dinner and a couple times for lunch.  We have always brought our out of town guests there for gaming and food.  The quality of your food has steadily declined since we started coming to what is now inedible.  The prime rib is now a low quality, tough,  underdone steamship round; the tempura shrimp is 'popcorn shrimp' , a dried out bland product that bears no resemblance whatsoever to the shellfish; the seafood fra diavolo is now skimpily scattered atop an overdone spaghetti and your caesar salad is overdressed and limp.  Without exception the other options available appeared to have been held on the steam table until past their prime.  In fairness, I didn't try the pizza.  I don't go to casino buffets for pizza.  Incredibly, while you've lowered quality you've discontinued the bounce-back BOGO that we've enjoyed since arriving here.  Regardless, the meal we had this evening, November 11 at 4:30pm was not worth half of what we paid.  Be assured that the next time we go out to a casino or entertain out  of town guests we will be giving the Aliante Station another try.  A pity, really. 1
I do love the Desert Steak house, but if you are going to use the same concept as fast food restaurants being that you go to the counter and order your food and get your own drinks, well then you need to lower your price. Please go back to the way you were. 3
The restaurant was very clean. The decor was lovely. The serve was polite nothing exceptional about her service worth mentioning. The beef carpaccio was pretty good. The bacon wrapped scallops were nice. Overall it wasn't bad. 3
Ordered the Mexican salad this past Saturday and was unsatisfied with the taste of unwashed lettuce. Upon confronting the waitress about this she apologize which I was thankful for. Offering to make me another which I refused due to that being a waste of food. The manager then approached me saying this was a normal complaint from people in the restaurant. Blaming it on the meat making it taste like dirt. I proceed to tell her I had the same meat on the nachos and they tasted fine. The woman clearly had no culinary experience telling me how the same meat tasted more dirt like in my salad. I having personal culinary experience in schooling and job atmospheres laughed to myself and politely just asked for the bill. On top of all this my friend had ordered a dish with the same lettuce which also tasted quite nasty. If your looking for fresh this is not the place to be. Your getting fast food quality for steakhouse prices. 1
First off the customer service in this place is great.I walked in to the mac shack wanting and hoping for a warm, cheesy, goodness that would be the next new level in my mac and cheese arsenal.so I ordered the "smoke house" mac and cheese, which by the description from the menu sounded ridiculous. I was pumped, I thought to my self man this is going to be epic!!!also got the garlic bread (because I love some good garlic bread) so I sat down in there very well done restaurant areaThen a short time after I got the soup...I mean mac ... well it could have passed for soup. looking at it stomach rumbling I take a bite, instantly an overwhelming taste of very sweet bbq sauce hit my taste buds and not a hint of the smoked gouda as promised from the menu. The dish resembled vodka sauce and mac elbows, no cheese and so much soupy sauce that I could soke it up with the garlic butter covered little Cesar's style bread sticks.after about 6 bites I gave up and abandoned the dish.I do really wish that I would have had a better experience at this fast casual restaurant. maybe the cook needs to be retrained or replaced either way they wont getting any $13 lunches from me. to me first impressions are everything and should be. this places food did not impress me in the slightest. 2
Had a horrible experience! It all made sense why it has a bad reputation. I will never step into this restaurant again as long as I am breathing! 1
Centurylink in general. Terrible. My bill went from 19.99 to 90.00 I called to see why. They told me because the promotion had expired.. So I was in the process of cancelling. But the woman told me that of I keep service they will throw in a free tablet(Verizon). So I said cool. Never been told that I would have to pay for it.. I mean why when you tell me its free? So I check my credit  and the tablet is in collections. For  266$. If I'm calling because my bill is high what make you think I would accept a tablet that's almost 300$ on top of that. When I cancelled because I moved I was giving a price of 89. To my last bill. So I pay it then I call to complain about the tablet. I have a 40 bill.. Not to mention I've been on hold for 45mins.. Still on hold now as I type. 1
I've now been to Quivey's Grove twice: both times I was completely underwhelmed by the food, although the service is friendly and fantastic. My first entree was the meatloaf. Full disclosure: I make AWESOME meatloaf, so I AM biased. QG's offering was not bad, just forgettable and in need of salt. On my second visit, I ordered the Black Angus Steer tenderloin medallions, which came with a Madeira mushroom cream sauce, sauteed vegetables, and parmesan potato. The first thing that struck me was that nothing on the plate went with anything else. The sauce on the medallions (which were tender and juicy) was excellent: I could imagine serving the entree over mashed potatoes or even polenta. Instead, it waged war on the parmesan potatoes: a nasty, clearly pre-cooked, cheesy potato casserole that more resembled something you might find at a potluck. The other filler, sauteed julienne peppers, also clashed with its plate-mates.  In a word: DISAPPOINTING. QG isn't an inexpensive place to eat, and I would expect quite a lot more from the food for the cost. 2
Sadly Bishoku has now been re-named "Chop Brasserie Asiatique" by their new owners.  No it's not an Asian brewery, so I have no idea why they chose this name, but in the end, since the change over, the quality has gone down hill.The last time we went, the waitress was very rude to us and food wasn't great.  The rolls are still fine, but the nigiri and sashimi was definitely not as good.  The sushi pizza is still good and unique, but I don't think I'll be going back.  RIP Bishoku! 3
Delivery was fast. Got a free Sweet potato roll, but that couldn't take away from a rancid flavour and very wet almost mushy rice in the sushi. 2
It may be a chain in a strip mall in the middle of nowhere, but this place is as good as it gets for Suburbia. The gourmet sandwiches are delicious and not overpriced, the casual atmosphere and free WiFi make it pleasant to hang out and get some work done, and the smoothies hit the spot in hot weather. Love the freshly baked bread, too! 4
Top 3 Places you HAVE to go to in Vegas. If you are planning on going to any pool party, this is the place. Music was good, drinks were strong, people were so fun! We got a cabana there which made it more enjoyable! Special thanks to BEX for being such a gracious host and the best VIP hookup in Vegas!  I along with the 11 other girls would never had as much fun without her help! I miss Tao Beach already! 5
I don't understand how so many people have had great experiences with the owner. He gets grumpy when we use a card instead of cash and it's not like we're placing a piddly order -- we're buying more than enough to justify it. I prefer to get the food to go (I love the tzatziki) but recently decided to eat in and realized I won't ever do that again. I had ordered Greek fries but received regular fries instead. When I mentioned this to the waitress, who was really nice, she told the owner who then complained about me in the nearby kitchen. I like to think that cashiers, waiters, and customer service people in general appreciate my patience and kindness but this guy makes me feel like it's such a hassle for him to even bother with me. I had another bad experience ordering lunch today and I'm done with this place...I just don't get it. :( 2
Wait 2months for App.  Not a good place to use.!! Harmon address. This place Suck's........ 1
I went in today for Shellac. Called ahead and spoke with the owner who told me it was really slow so I could come on in. I live really close so it was a short walk. The lady who did my nails (I think she is the owner) was very kind and had an excellent rapport with her other customers. I could tell she had many regulars because she addressed them by their first name. I got black nails with my ring finger a different colour (sparkly gold). Overall it was a pleasant experience and I would go back but next time I won't get black. She was very careful but the black still ended up smudging a bit at the cuticle and bugs me a little bit. She did a hell of a lot better job then I could ever do with a dark colour so it's not the biggest issue for me. The shellac manicure was $30. Something to note; starting October to March they will be closed on Sundays for winter. 3
Ok, ok, I get it. La Baguette is terribly French and I'm just a rube from DeFo. But come on. $7.95 for a few sparse ingredients slapped between two halves of a baguette? Furthermore, although I have impeccable dental hygiene, I found the sandwich quite literally PAINFUL to eat. I don't believe that ANY sandwich--even a rustic, terribly French sandwich--should cause my gums to bleed. FURTHER furthermore, the proprietress' irritation at my lack of exact change was palpable.Sigh. This was on my bucket list, but I would never go there again. 2
I was at this particular Popeyes, about an hour ago. I'm more of a KFC kind of person but, I was right by and decided to give it a try. I drove up to the speaker box on their drive thru lane; I was immediately greeted, I was offered to listen to their specials, I ordered a special combo with chicken, fries, a biscuit & a drink for $4.99. I asked the order taker if it was possible for her to hold the biscuit and substitute for fries instead, she kindly said it wasn't possible, so I said that's fine just hold the biscuit; I wasn't going to eat it, & I didn't want it to go to waste.. Before completing my order I asked her to upsize my drink to a large, and so I thought she did. When drove up to the window, she was nice, but not enthusiastic, just the minimum.. I paid she gave me my drink a SMALL drink, and when I got home I opened the box & the first thing I see is a golden buttery BISCUIT. I rated my overall experience 2 stars, because the service was fast, but my order wasn't correct due to the lack of attention to detail. From other reviews I've read it seems the employees should be oriented on customer service. 2
Staff is nice. Had a groupon for here. Did the highlights and deep conditioning. The deep conditioning was just conditioner that sat on my hair for 3 minutes.... Could have done that at home. My highlights were not even recognizable and there were spots of blonde. I need to go elsewhere to get it corrected. Feel like I wasted my money and time because there aren't event highlights. 2
Very good food and we had a great waiter as well. However, it is a little overpriced in my opinion. My husband and I went for lunch and our bill was $100. We got a burger, sandwich, a large beer and a mixed drink. 3
Noticeable improvements in keeping the rift-raft off the course.  Appears new owners are doing a much better job.Greens are in superb shape and an overall fun course to play. 4
From the moment we stepped out of the car we were less than impressed. We were being dropped off by friends and there was NO ONE around to help unload our luggage. When the bell hop finally did make an appearance he was extremely rude and kept telling us to move the car, did not help us with the bags and made fun of us for not knowing where registration was then walked off. We were then charged the extra $20 a day resort fee even though our reservation (from another discount site) stated all taxes and fees included. When we finally got to the room it smelled like a Dog had taken a dump in it. It had not been cleaned at all either. I called down to the desk to switch rooms. They informed me it would take 30 minutes to get us keys to a new room sent up to us so I had to go all the way back down to the front desk for them. For my Inconvenience the desk clerk (who did not apologize for the error or look me in the eye) gave me the exact drink coupon that is already provided in the welcome brochure. Thanks but free drinks are already provided when I gamble. After getting sorted in the new room we went down to the casino floor to gamble. We were in the hotel a total of three hours when we went back to the room to find out that they had reset our room keys and for my imposition I had to go back down to the front desk again to get a new key. Again no apologies!! Worst customer service ever. I knew this hotel was older but the rooms are extremely outdated and comparable to a cheap motel 6. Never going back. 1
It's the shift-lead, Hannah? Do not blame the teenagers for a terrible shift leader. I guess that is why they don't call you a manager, because you don't manage anything. My smoothie just tasted like dirty ice today. My $8 smoothie because apparently you can only "add" items and not "substitute" them. Again, this is not the teenager's fault, the shift leader must be held accountable. 2
That was a terrible experience. Made an appt to test drive a car (q50 tech) which I confirmed they had in stock. Showed up, car is missing - and they lost the key for the other car in stock. Really? What's the point of making an appointment? Typical experience I'd expect at a ford dealership - definitely not one I'd expect from a "luxury" brand. 1
Had their standard gyro which was BIG, so much meat on there it could have easily been split into 2-3 individual gyros so they def do not skimp on portions & you get your money's worth. Tasted great, no complaints. 5
I created a yelp account just so i could comment on this restaurant because I w disgusted by the experience.  The waitstaff was horrible. The restaurant was not even busy. As people arrived, they made them wait 30 mins and then seated them at tables that had been open the entire time. The food was good but I will never go back given the horrible experience. 1
I went on a Friday night with a large group of coworkers after a long week. It was one of the most horrendous nightlife experiences in the two years I've lived in Vegas. The atmosphere isn't too bad but it isn't too great either. The only major difference I saw from the former Cadillac Ranch / Ranch House is that the mechanical bull was replaced by a small dance floor. As mentioned in previous reviews, the staff is obliterated early on in the evening which makes it challenging to get a drink in under 15 minutes (after you place your order). Prepare to repeat your order several times. The DJ stopped the music periodically to insist all bars be filled with girls (both bartenders and patrons) who would then dance on the bar while the bartenders poured free "shots" directly into patrons' mouths. The shots were in an unmarked bottle and were an odd purple color. Avoid the mystery bottle that just grazed the mouths of 30 other people.Overall, I understand the idea of a party bar but this one missed the mark. The bartenders had more of a party than any of the patrons. Long story short, spend your money anywhere else nearby for better service from staff sober enough to remember your order. 1
Food was decent, but the service was absolutely terrible. Both servers who served our table were so hostile that I pretty much lost my appetite - which sucks because it's all-you-can-eat here. Would not come back here again. 1
The customer service I received at this location was so egregiously bad I will never set foot in an AAMCO ever again. I made an appointment for 12/31/10 at 3:00 pm about a week in advance. 90 minutes before the appointment, I received a call stating they were closing for the day and I would have to reschedule. In my attempt to get more than just a simple apology, the lady behind the counter accused me of having the problem! Just disgusting. 1
Nice place, great service from the chef (he stand in every table explaining the details of the plates). Prices are ok. The oysters were very good. 4
Although the food was good, we had an issue with the service.  When asked to accommodate a variation on a menu item the waitress was not willing to even try to the point of rudeness. Then between courses she placed our used silverware that were on our plates back onto the table. When we asked for clean silverware we were given an extremely snide remark by the waitress. Her rudeness ruined the ambiance of the beautiful patio dining. 2
Unbelievably poor customer service. Was given the wrong information during booking our stay. Was told that our rooms would be connected when in fact they were not. Couldn't get confirmation via email. Spent two hours trying to fix their mistake. Very little was offered in the way of restitution.One of the guest managers, BLANCA SEM, is very rude and incompetent. Very unprofessional staff. Caesar's Entertainment has employed high school graduates in their 20's to serve in guest relations for their hotels. There are no adult, upper management professionals available. Unbelievable. 1
The concept is actually pretty neat. I just don't really like the cupcakes that much. If you are a cupcake fan at any level, this place can be heaven. Maybe with a little time the selection will improve, but at a single moment there are only so many varieties. There were some creative ones but they were still semi-standard. Ex: add alcohol. I think they also have specials day to day which is a huge plus, but unfortunately I can't eat cupcakes every day.I personally would have liked to see a chocolate cupcake that looked like chocolate was a central component to the integrity of the cake. But heck that might be what separates cake from brownies. The cupcakes are worth ordering and when I went there were indeed an impressive number of cupcakes. Because this is a new place, I am sure they will appreciate regulars. You might also want to check to see if they will do custom cupcakes/cupcake orders, because that certainly could be a possibility. 3
How this place is still open is beyond me. Service is horrendous even though no one is in the restaurant. I stopped in for a beer with some friends, sat in the bar area and it took around 15 mins for our first pitcher to come to us ... we may have been the only other table at the bar. Couple at the table next to us sent back their food two or three times.Don't waste your time with this place. 1
A basic place but the food is good and service is also, limited wine and beer 4
Excellent job on cleaning a massive white couch that I have.  Could not be happier with the service, promptness, and professionalism.  I would gladly recommend Sunrise to my friends and colleagues. 5
I haven't tried the rest of the food here, but the donuts are great! They have several different kinds of cronuts! A must try! 3
The food here was fast and delicious but the manager horrible. I was completely ignored when trying to order and when asking about the menu wasn't bad enough, the lady(Norma) who was taking my order was actually the manager. No eye contact, no smile, and just plan rude. 2
Left the performance feeling misled.  This is NOT your typical Cirque du Soleil performance - it felt more like a musical.  As others touched on, this was more like a tribute.  What they should have done was name it Viva Elvis in large font, and in very small font, state "by Cirque du Soleil."  Yes, there were some acrobatic performances (trampoline was very cool) but if you go in thinking you will see a lot of amazing feats, be prepared to be disappointed.  What you will actually get are images of Elvis growing up, and many of his hit songs, some sung by him, some by the performers."O" is definitely my favorite.  KA was really good as well.On a positive note, there was some sort of promotion that we were not aware of, yet without us knowing or asking, we were given a 30% discount.  What a great surprise! 3
I had emailed Air Supply Inc at 9:30PM regarding one of my vents in my house having a burning smell and 2 mins. later I got a call from Dave stating they could send someone out the next day.  I ended up scheduling them to come out and the tech checked both of our a/c units on the roof and even though he could not determine the problem he suggested that we clean out our ducts because the units themselves were fine.  I was happy that they did not try to charge me for multiple "what ifs" and they even gave me a deal on the inspection.  Very happy with their service and will definitely contact them in the future! 5
I'm giving it 3 stars because I only like 3 items here (not the other items on the menu), but these 3 items are actually really good and on its own deserve 4 stars.  I only like pho at 3 locations here in Vegas and this is one of them.  It's good and the place is cleaner than Pho So 1.  I also like their che ba mau because it comes with shaved ice, and they serve it in a plastic to go cup (in case I don't finish it).  Their spring rolls are pretty good too, but I can make those at home.Update:  I changed it to 4 stars because I've missed it so much while I was gone that I ate here twice a week while I was back home for break.  :oP 4
I thought my shoes had the biscuit when my puppy chewed them. This shop made the best of a bad situation and I am thoroughly impressed by their work and will return, hopefully for other reasons. 5
Food was good but pricey. Gave you large portions enough to share. Restroom was disgusting. 3
The wine list is a good 40 + pages.  They even had wines from the boyfriend's homeland.  (Trust me, it's not easy to find Uruguayan wine.) The sommelier knew his shit, without making me (the total wine novice) feel like a total wine novice.The cheese plate was great.  And the olives.  Oh, the olives.The Spanish guitarists and flamenco show were enjoyable and unpretentious (aka non-Scottsdale-y) on the Sunday night we were there.  Big ups to Omer for introducing us to this place. 5
Bryan is fantastic. He is polite, responsible and on time. He takes the time to explain things and his prices are reasonable. I found him recently on Yelp and will continue to use him for all of my electrical needs. 5
We wanted to take my nephew to this restaurant so he could watch the planes. I checked the Yelp reviews before leaving so I really wasn't expecting too much out of this restaurant.I was appreciative because the hostess did help us find a table near the window so we could see the planes. But honestly, that was the only positive.Our food was just not good. My husband's plate had a giant hair (and it clearly wasn't his as he noticed it right after the waitress set it down and he has buzzed hair) in his potatoes. He asked for new potatoes but the waitress did have the mm make a whole new plate. My sister ordered a taco salad without meat and sure enough she had mostly meat in her salad. That was also remade. My nephew was only eating his fries, not his grilled cheese, and we kept encouraging him to eat the grilled cheese. I finally took a bite and spit it out. It tasted awful, almost as if the cheese was spoiled.I will most definitely not be returning. 2
This restaurant is hidden in the country side of Gastonia...who would've there would be a seafood restaurant in this part..but here it was. The menu had a great selection of seafood and for those who are not into seafood..there is an excellent selection of pasta and steaks all at a reasonable price. I had the crab cakes, which was delicious. I took away 1 star because service was not that great our waitress was not attentive to our table..and I took away another star because the salad bar looked a bit messy. Over all the food was good and the price was good. It was comfortable. I will definitely come back and give it a second try. 3
whenever I write a 'less than stellar' review, I always wait a few days. I just like to take all emotion out of the review. I have waited almost 2 weeks to write this - mainly because this Papa Murphy is less than a mile from my house and I always root for the local businesses in my neighborhood.Here goes:I have been to this location enough to fill up a punch card (12th visit gets you 50% off your next order)... So I thought - AWESOME! On Halloween, I don't want to cook and we are having people over before going downtown for the Las Vegas Parade. I bring a friend (who has never been to Papa Murphy's). I have talked up the place to her and convinced her that pizza would be better than Mediterranean food for the occasion. We walk in, there are 3 others in the shop, two are waiting for their pizzas and 1 is paying. We walk up to the registers, pick a couple of salads and grab a menu. We we not greeted, but, you know, people get busy - and we are gabbing away anyways. Well.... after standing next to the workers 'building' the pizzas and a few feet from the left register for 5 minutes - Another woman walks in to the shop. The manager or owner (I assume) who is building the pizza, asks another employee to help 'the guests.' The employee proceeds to greet the other woman and start taking her order. After a moment, the 'Manager' asks us if we've been helped. We let her know we hadn't. She proceeded to tell us because we weren't standing right at the register, thats why know one had helped us............ *REMINDER* : I've been here enough to earn the complimentary 50% discount. It's not my first rodeo at this place. AND we did go straight to the registers when we arrived. How would we have picked out the Greek Salads (which are in between the 2 registers).... Needless to say, a place that makes it the guests fault that they weren't helped is not a place that I need to spend money at.... It's really too bad! I have had no issues the other 11 times at this location - but those times I came in after 6pm (this visit was around 1:30pm). I have always been helped by the night male 'manager/owner' (assumption on title, but these are franchises that are proprietor owned)..........I will say, I've never seen it busy at this location, so maybe when they get more than 1 or 2 people in their store at once they get a little "overwhelmed....."But, I think it will be awhile before I return, and needless to say, my friend will never get to try Papa Murphy's because she doesn't like rude service- especially when it's at a pizza place that you have to take home and cook yourself. 2
I love Terriaco's and I have been going there for years.  There is a big difference in having alterations done at Terriaco's versus a seamstress.  These guys are pros.  They could look at you and know exactly what clothes you should wear.  Domenic and Frank know a lot about clothing and how it is made, and how you should wear your clothes.  I have worked with both Domenic and Frank and both are very honest which I LOVE, but I guess if you are overly sensitive you could get offended.  Personally I like to get someone's opinion...especially a man's opinion on what looks good.  This is the place to go if you want something to wear for a special occasion!!  The clothes at Terriaco's are beautiful, and fit better than dept. store clothes. 5
I have been here before during the weekday and week nights and usually have on par service. Tonight was otherwise. Coming on a Friday night dinner rush was an epic fail. We ordered several rounds of AYCE with food items and drinks being missed each time and having to reorder while the third order comes and the first isn't all there yet. Waiters and waitress just not refilling tea. Bummer. Not sure if I'll be back on the weekend. They definitely need more staff to adequately handle their dinner rush. 2
Good times at Made in Mexico. The size of the portions is well worth the price, and the fresh margaritas are worth a try, very tasty. All in all this is worth a try if you are in the mood for Mexican 3
When my company needed a property manager to manage our real estate assets I was recommended PMP Carolinas by a trusted colleague who had been in the real estate business for years.  When I reached out to Scott to inquire about the company services, I found him to be an extremely engaging and knowledgeable of the Charlotte market.Thanks for being an excellent partner in helping manage our investments and making the incorporation of our properties so seamless. 5
Stayed here for my sister's wedding. Honestly one of the worst experiences I've had at a hotel. Front desk staff was shockingly incompetent and rude. Sat staring at their computers while we stood in front of them for five minutes without acknowledging us. They didn't even look up to tell us they needed a second. Took us forever to get our rooms and once we did get our rooms, they put us in the wrong one. We thought we lost all of my sister's baggage. Talk about unnecessary stress the day if your wedding. When we came down to try to fix the situation, they tried to blame it on us. The list of head aches they gave us and pretty much all the guests that stayed there for the wedding is too long to go through. It's only saving grace was the exceptionally kind maid staff. Still.. would never, EVERRR recommend this place to anyone. LIKE EVER. 1
My friend and I went to Montreal for the day and stumbled upon Big in Japan.Neither of us were particularly hungry but wanted a small snack. We came right at the end of lunch and were told we can order from the lunch menu or the dinner menu if we waited 20 more minutes.We stuck with the lunch menu, but the dishes were all rather big. I did not see any appetizers on the menu.  Also the menu is not very big or anything that resembles a Japanese restaurant in then Western world. We decided on splitting the cold ramen noodle salad. It was huge- two of us stuffed ourselves in order to finish it. The dish itself was rather pretty upon presentation .. Full of color, soft and crunchy ingredients. The dish was tasty.However, the sauce, that was a big part in the dish was way too salty. The atmosphere in here felt a bit strange. I could not pinpoint why, either way, our waitress was very nice and attentive ( we were 2 out 4 people in there) and she also spoke English very well. I hope to get back there to try more and update the review. 3
The place was clean and service was ok. Wanted the fish tacos but they pony had the shrimp do I decide on the al pastors.  Should have had the chicken or beef because the pork was very oily and more fat than I would expect from an upper end street taco place. 2
I just had my first cevapi meal here and cannot believe I have been missing this place!  I am always on the look out for these places with my Serb husband, so discovering RM was a treat. Cevapi are delicious, and so were the spreads (kajmak and urnebes). I don't think they are trying to compete with places like Southstreet or Hero as it is a Slavic restaurant, but that being said I will take a burger from Royal Meats any day.  It's authentic and tasty Serbian grill.As for the service, which people seem to complain about, it really is a cultural thing.  Eastern Euros just don't do the fake pleasantries many of us westerners are used to.  If super friendliness is what you're after with your burger, go to Southstreet and revel in having a smiling 19 year old slather guacamole on your whole wheat burger. 4
Extremely overpriced for the length of the races. It was 250+ for a family of 6 to do 2 races.Also very selective in how they handle collisions with the wall. My son got pulled out of race halfway through for hitting the wall a couple times, while on the next track over, people were bashing each other with carts, ramming people into the wall, and some hitting the wall multiple times one each lap.Oh, and the email spam is insane. We had to signup with a family of 6, and For me and all 4 kids, I have received 21 emails in less than 24 hours, and thats after we made sure the box to avoid any future emails was set to say don't send emails. There are even more that went to my wife's email.If you go, use a fake email address 1
Meh. Came here 3 years ago and recently visited again. About $40 for brunch and an additional $10 for mimosas/bloody marys. Wait time prior to getting seated was about an hour. There's 1 line to pay and 1 line to get seated.Food was alright. Didn't have a particular favorite and wasn't wow-ed by anything. There is pork belly, kalbi ribs, prime rib, bone marrow, and the crabs rolled in at around 3p. I liked the kale salad and farro salad but I was here to get fat. Dessert, although presentation wise looked appealing, were not that great. I'd stick with the gelatos and chocolate covered strawberries. Our server was attentive but chefs didn't seem happy to be there.Honestly, it'll probably be another 3 years for me to visit again. Over-priced for what they have to offer. I'd wait longer and pay more for Bacchanal. 2
I've been to many KBBQ places. We LOVE getting the AYCE bargains, but this was just disappointing. For a city that is known for it's quality food at cheap prices, this just doesn't cut the mustard. The selection of meat wasn't impressive and the price for this selection was too much. You can get better options at most KBBQ places in and around L.A. for quite a lot cheaper. There were many sides which made it a bit better but it lacked an essential side dish. There was no steamed egg. Truth be told, I probably wont go here again. 2
Went in n a Valpak coupon. Had dinner there. It was super slow, but thought maybe because nothing else is open around them.The Super market was closed down. The service was friendly, that's a Pro. the Cons, where do I start. Food was hot on one side, colder on the other or in the core of the meat. Wierd.Food took a lil longer, but that was ok, if it was busy. It was a lil $$$ for the quality of the food. I will not leave Pei Wei again, I swear.My last thought, we should of ate next door at Los Fav taco shop. 2
The food - I ordered an omelette.  You can build your own and I went with sausage, swiss cheese, onion, mushrooms and bell peppers.  It was very good; as light and fluffy as it could be with all those ingredients.  The omelette came with either hash browns or fried potatoes and either biscuits/gravy or two pancakes.  It's a lot of food!  I couldn't finish and brought the biscuits/gravy home.  They have a number of breakfast options but I should point out that if you're on a diet you're not likely to find something light on the menu.The price - the omelette, hash browns and biscuits/gravy set me back less than $9!  That works out to 1/3 of a cent per calorie.The service - They were busy but the service was still very good. People were walking around with coffee and we were checked on often enough.  The inside - the restaurant has a diner sort of feel.  It's clean, nicely laid out with a lot of booths and tables.  Things are getting a big old inside but this isn't a fancy-schmancy place so it's fine.Not on my side of town and my waistline couldn't handle coming here often but if I'm in the neighborhood I'd stop in again. 3
I went here on a Friday night. I had always passed it and wanted to stop by, so I did with three friends. I wish I hadn't.The decor was nice, and we were seated right away. We decided to order the Spring Roll Platter ($10) that was supposed to have four different types of spring rolls on it. When it arrived, we thought they got our order wrong. It was a big pile of mango salad, with about 4 spring rolls cut in half. Not only were there only two kinda (chicken and shrimp curry?) but it was less spring roll platter and more mango salad with a side of spring rolls. We were really disappointed. When the meals came, it was worse. I ordered a peanut pad thai, and it looked like something someone threw up. It was really gloppy and....gross. I ended up not finishing it. My friends were less than plussed with their food, although the stif fried rice seemed to be the best thing on the table.The price and service was ok, but the food is terrible. That was the first and last time I would ever eat there again. 1
My husband and I were looking for a fine dining experience - a night away from our toddlers. We took a chance with Firebirds as we had never been. We started the night with the lobster spinach queso, which was amazing with the fresh bread (in lieu of the chips) served prior to the entree (as suggested by our amazing waiter, Sam). He was funny and gave us a great feedback about the dishes and wine. We ordered the slow roasted ribeye, which was perfectly cooked - definitely try it. We also enjoyed the spiced pecan green beans and lobster tail. We ended the night with a warm brownie (it's large and my husband and I shared). The prices were fair and honestly we felt we received a LOT of bang for our buck. Even after leaving a 20% tip, our bill was surprisingly affordable. We loved the high end feel of the restaurant while it was perfectly acceptable to wear jeans. It is casual without pretention. Loved it all! 5
went here yesterday....being from Chicago, I had to check it out.  Fries were terrible, greasy and limp.  Hot Dog was ok, but the bun was hard on the ends.  Prices are pretty good.  The woman that took our order was really nice.  The actual owner was behind the counter flippin burgers and he did not say "hi" or even smile at the customers.   Maybe he was having a bad day.  Overall, I prefer Joey's a lot better, which is also closer to home for me in Glendale.  I just happened to be in Surprise for an appointment, and I saw there sign on the road.  Anything with Chicago in the name, and I will stop!  lol 2
After multiple times asking for a medium rare steak it came back well done . A lot of money for a over cooked steak 2
I had dinner here a couple of times and I would have to say that I've yet to be overly impressed with the food. Everything has been sorta "meh."  The service is absolutely great, and the wine list is also very good but dinner has felt very anticlimactic. In addition, is it just me or does the decor in the restaurant  cross the border from classy into cheesy? I mean, I realize what they are trying to do but the painted brick/landscape....really? Feels a bit Olive Garden-y to me. I may be up for trying it one more time, but honestly, with so many better options in Tremont the odds aren't looking so good... 2
So this was a converted property...less than a year old since Marriott's purchase.  Great service, particularly in the new concierge lounge (open since Dec. 2012).  Renovations look well done, but be prepared for small rooms and worn carpeting.  Overall, I'd stay here again primarily because of the service (and lower price vs. the airport Marriott).  Clean, comfortable, etc...your average Marriott trying to be European, but the folks there really do try hard and want you to come back.  Why stay there....because it's downtown, service is fantastic and price.  Why stay somewhere else...because you want to be outside downtown or you're your a Starwood Platinum. 3
Bad customer service. I waited in lobby for 25 minutes and no one even came out to help me. 1
Leaps and bounds better than the average sushi takeout place. Sushi was very fresh and well executed. Portions are not huge, but I would rather quality over quantity anyways. Would definitely eat here again. 5
Good authentic mexican food.      I went on a Sunday where they offer a good Mexicana brunch menu.We were three people ans share a few item. Mole taco-   not a lot of place have this and I get it every time it is on menu.Pulled pork -   tasty and good texture and flovourCubana      great pull pork sandwich.    It tasted like in house baked bread Brunch menu only on weekend     Chulaquiles-  tasty mix of everything.   Read the ingredient to make sure you like all the item Mexican coffee was nothing to write home about   they are expanding .  So better go now.  But renovation do not interfere with the existing business .It has an collection of ecliptic toys on the wall.The  female chef came out to chat with us.  She was in a full black chef uniform. It should be more fun after work with a few drinks. 4
I don't know how this place stays in business. The menu is so limited. Would you like chicken or chicken? Chicken in a pita? Chicken on some lettuce? Chicken rolled in a tortilla? And the pita chips are bland! Yuck! And  the potato salad has something in it that is way too tangy. I've only been twice and tried different dishes both times but I just don't get anything greek about this place. 2
Scott has been cutting and styling my hair for over 5 years before bloom and even now. Very professional in this salon, and every hair stylist in the salon is truly and artist. 5
$20 an hour, I've paid for less and gotten more in LA.  I have to tell the lady to go harder like 3 times and they still expect a $10 tip.Definitely not coming back for sure. 2
The pretzel bread and spread is amazingly delicious. The food is really tasty. The servers are horrible. If you ever get Rodger run in the opposite direction. We Ate here two nights in a row thinking maybe the first server was new, but no both nights received the same low class service. The best part of the staff is the bus men and woman and the hostess. We have learned that the servers "pool" their tips this could indicate why they do not care about service or it may just be that they have better things to do than give halfway decent service at one of the best casinos and hotel in vegas? 2
best auto shop in vegas best work. best price quick service.  went in on a monday with no noticepicked up car on wednesday whoa 5
Food: 4/5Service: 3.5/5Cleanliness: 4/5Price: $$Whenever I move to a new city, I need to find a few things. My go-to spots actually, including a sushi joint, bubble tea, favourite drugstore, and a place to get my authentic Korean food. Although I've been to a many Korean restaurants here in Montreal, I was hesitant to say that they were my go-to place because none of them fully hit the spot for me. Something was missing, whether it was the expensive prices, not so clean interiors, or just plainly not authentic. I think I can finally say that I've found my go to place for Korean food in Montreal; it's located a little far out from downtown Montreal and its name is Ave Seoul!I discovered Ave Seoul accidentally; it wasn't on any of my foodie bucket lists nor was it recommended to me by anyone. Hubby and I just happened to be near the area one evening and so we decided to try the Korean restaurant out as it had great reviews on Yelp. When we arrived, there weren't many customers (it was an early Tuesday evening after all) but by the time we left, the kitchen was very busy getting customers' orders ready!The restaurant's menu was extensive: they had great lunch combos which I wanted to come back for, and they had everything from Korea's classic bibimbap to casual snacks, stews, chef's specials and much more. Hubby and I both had some difficulty picking what to eat because we really liked everything on the menu! The evening we visited on was rather chilly so we both went for something hot to keep ourselves warm: Ttukbaegi Bulgogi (bulgogi noodle soup) for me and gam-ja-tang (pork bone stew) for hubby.Not long after we ordered, our dishes arrived. Hubby and I were both very pleasantly surprised with the presentations of our dishes; the side dishes were served on a clean dish, there were utensil holders, our dishes it self were very visually appealing!This was legit, and the most legit one we've found in our city so far! The pork meat was soft and easy to take off the bones while the broth was just spicy enough to give it a kick. It wasn't difficult for hubby to finish his bowl of rice because it was so good. The stew itself was served in a rather large hot stone bowl, bigger than your regular bibimbap bowls. Gam-ja-tang is traditionally cooked with potatoes (gam-ja is potato in Korean) and we were disappointed to find the potatoes in this dish slightly undercooked. Other than that, the flavours of the stew itself were great and it didn't seem like any MSG was added to our stew.I ordered this because I was craving bulgogi but I wanted soup at the same time. It's essentially your well known bulgogi but with broth and glass noodles inside. It really is perfect for a cold day. Whenever I had ordered this dish previously at other Korean restaurants (outside of Montreal), I always found that it wasn't done very well. It was mainly too greasy and they had used fattier meats over leaner pieces. Here at Ave Seoul, I was surprised that it was done really well without any extra fat or greasiness. This restaurant was the least place I had expected this from so I really enjoyed my dinner at Ave Seoul. The amount of bulgogi and glass noodles in my soup was basically overflowing because I had to give about half of it to my husband.We would definitely go back to Ave Seoul whenever we're craving for Korean food in Montreal. Sure we cook it all the time at home but we still like to eat Korean out once in a while. With affordable prices, I'm surprised that Ave Seoul isn't as well known in Montreal. It's definitely a bit of a drive from downtown Montreal, but I don't mind; I rather travel a little more for authentic Korean than waste more money on not so authentic stuff. 4
I contacted One Luv Bridal for my wedding and have been so happy with the customer service from day one. Whitney was wonderful and fast in responding, her prices are competitive and she really takes the time to try and understand what your needs are. I asked for hair/makeup for myself and hair for my two flower girls. On the day of my wedding, both hair and makeup girls showed up at least 15 minutes early. They were personable the whole time and really took the time to understand the looks I was going for (even if I was confused myself). I cannot recommend One Luv enough to all brides. It was a stress free morning and I was so happy with the results. 5
Attended a birthday dinner last week at this place. Owner was very attentive to making sure everyone was satisfied.  Our waiter was just as attentive. Meals were great and full of flavor. Very good Italian food for a place in Arizona where good Italian is hard to come by. Definitely would recommend trying this restaurant out! 5
Everything from start to finish was perfect.  I went for my anniversary last night and it hit the spot.  The host was lovely and seated us right away.  We were twenty minutes late and he wasn't bothered in the least.  Told us we did him a favor since the reservation before us lingered.  We eat meat occasionally but ended up ordering entirely from the vegetarian menu.  I had the mushroom salad which was wonderful.  My husband had the gnocchi, which I was jealous of and if I had a longer arm I would have eaten half of.  My main was the tortelloni and my husband's the tortiere.  Both were delicious.  I wouldn't change a thing.  The Bellwoods Brewery beer from just down the road was nice and the wines by the glass were interesting.  4 oz pours may not seem like a bargain at $9 - $15 or more, but I guess the alternative is to make it 5oz pours and jack up the price by 25%.  We got the dessert board for two, which I feared might just be a bunch of fancy sweets prepped earlier in the day by a pastry chef who was long gone by evening.  Turns out it was, but that was ok.  The madeleines were lemony with a little crispness around the edges.  A square of nougat was chewy and nutty.  The vibe was lively though not too loud.  As luck would have it they played one of my favorite albums of all time during the second half of our dinner.  I read a lot of other reviews and my assessment is that Woodlot is a victim of its own success.  People love to find a reason to take down really popular and trendy places so they can feel good about their superior discernment.  Don't be fooled.  This is one of the best casual restaurants in Toronto and it deserves five stars on Yelp. 5
Food sucked. Better in sun valley. The turkey burger was mush on a roll not even shaped like a burger. I'll drive the extra next time 1
These movers were great. They came at short notice after some sketchy movers fell through, and they did the job in very quick time. The fee was as quoted with no hidden additions. I would definitely use them again/recommend to others. 4
I am so happy with a recent experience at The Paper Place in old town Scottsdale, that I'm compelled to write a review.  I'm hosting a bridal shower 'cocktail party' for a friend's daughter in a month, and I knew I wanted to make it special, but also the timing was tight for me to mail out invitations.  I didn't want to go electronic and thought my only other option was hand-written.  I was so wrong!  I had heard great things about The Paper Place, so I went in to see if they could help.  Judy is the sales associate who worked with me and she is absolutely a delight -- knowledgable, creative, efficient and lovely personality.  In less than an hour, we selected the perfect invitation 'off the rack', received wording suggestions from Judy for all our particulars, decided on font, selected coordinated cocktail napkins with matching print font, and then she put a rush on the printing of the invitations and envelopes... no hand-written anymore :-).  She even suggested I buy floral stamps which I never would have thought of, but love. When the invitations arrived 2 days later, she helped me stuff and stamp, and suggested the main post office so they would be sent out that day.  And the price was very affordable.  So if you want an extra special event, look no further than Judy at The Paper Place. 5
My daughter has been here for just about a month now. She received AMAZING support and EXCELLENT care. Her physical therapist was Ashley who was super super patient with her despite my daughters anxiety and fears. Ashley really helped my daughter believe in herself. My daughter still doesn't have full feeling in her legs but she is so much more confident & stronger. While she was here her nurses were all good but her favorites were Jamie & Shelly durring the day what a GREAT team. Stephen spent so much time making sure she was comfortable at night....where would she have been without all of that kind of care.  It's hard to leave a loved one at a place they don't want to go knowing they are in pain BUT you should know that the staff Really works hard to make sure they achieve the goal of being self sufficient. There were so many staff members Miss Julie our case manager....oh my gosh so so Great. Dr. Barnes came in every day to check on his patients and when he couldn't another doctor would. The Kitchen staff super Awesome and the food was good. I guess I could go on and on hope your experience is as wonderful as ours!!! 5
Nail It Salon is my "Happy Place". I have been a customer from day 1 and will never stray. I broke my arm a couple of months ago and effort and care that Carlyle, Merry, Vivian, and Anna all provided was over the top! They took care of every need and were always concerned for my comfort. Oh...and my nails are alway beautiful! 5
Not good. Took my car there for the $14.95 interior/exterior service and was not happy at all. Took them less than 10 minutes to complete it and the shabby towels they used left lint inside and outside my car. I ended up bringing it home and wiping it down myself. Needless to say I wont be going back, not even for the free wash they offered after I complained. 1
This place is decent, and I'd definitely recommend it over one of the Rio Mirages. The food is a bit on the pricy side for what they offer, and I prefer Popo's in Glendale. If I just need some quick Mexican food though, this place has always been satisfying. 4
I had my big olde english sheepdog groomed here and they did a fine job and the price was on par with everyone else. Actually I think the price is about $10 more, but I'll pay the extra money because of the extra service this place provides.I really appreciate that they have a pet taxi, bc of this service my dog gets a ride home for free (but we did tip the driver). Since I have a little child it's hard for me to bring my dog and pick him up on the days I would have time to pick him up, so the taxi is worth it for me. Bc of this service I can now drop off my dog before I go to work and my husband (on days he's caring for my daughter) can be home to let my dog inside. This is easier for me than having to bring my 100+ dog inside while holding my baby.Shauna's is right next to Mountainside Fitness, it's right in Surprise so if you live in Surprise this place will be easy to get to. I also thought the service was great too. I'll definitely be taking my dog back here the next time he needs to get groomed. 5
This place is awful.  It is run by lazy high school kids.  Take out is a complete joke.  Cold food and the lazy kids make you stand at the counter for 30 minutes to get your food. 1
Loved the calamari but other food was hit and miss.  Second time which will be the last time was when my husband ordered the Mild chicken wings.  When they were brought to the table I asked him if he had ordered buffalo wings as I could smell the heat in the sauce .  He said no that he had ordered mild.  He hadn't tasted them yet,  When he did taste one he had to put it down.  He flagged the waitress and told her they were not mild and she stated that it was and that their mild was spicy.  No offer to exchange for something else.  Who would expect mild to be spicy??  Another waitress came by for refill and she asked how things were and he said again the chicken was spicier then expected and she said she could tell by the smell that they were hot  and again he mentioned that he had ordered the mild and they were not what he expected.  She politely smiled and walked away.  We ate the other items and he asked for a box to take the wings home as he hates waste.  It was at this time that the original waitress offers  ranch dressing for him to cut the heat and eat them there AFTER we've eaten everything else and are asking for the check as shes dropping off the box.  Not what I would call an honest effort to be helpful because it only came at the time for him to tip.   Completely disappointed with the whole experience.  FYI, I tried the wing and it was  similar to the Buffalo wing sauce, Frank's. 1
We used to bring our dog here for his grooming. He was always happy to go and the groomer did a great job on his cut. The problem was that four out of seven times we took him there, they ran two-three hours late having him finished. After missing my brother's birthday dinner, we switched to Doos for Dogs... 2
Kind of tucked away and hard to notice, especially being next to the really glammed out Ella's Deli. But worth a visit if you're looking for a good gyro or kebab. :]The donuts are alright too. They have a wide variety! Myself, I really rather like their cookies. They also offer homemade baklava.Really though I can reccomend their sandwiches with a side of the seasoned fries. Quite yummy! Vegetarian options also available such as potato kahbi or falafel sandwiches. And they had a lot of beverages to choose from too.Although the location is not ideal, it's worth a stop if you're in that part of town. :] 3
Have been going here for years, and getting...and loving the cornbread.  However, as of the 1st of the month, they started charging $3.00 for the cornbread...but neglect to mention that.I would think if they changed the policy just a couple of weeks ago that they would now inform customers that they are charging for cornbread...which was free. 1
There's a golden light that scintillates from this place. It knows of hygiene and cleanliness. I am appreciative. Though, the patissier here is a pretentious she with a head so large I wonder how it fits through the door every morning (figuratively speaking). I walked in to order macarons, this lady did not blink once to withhold her tongue to promptly correct my accent, suggesting I didn't roll my 'r' the way the french do.I'm sorry, I thought I lived in Toronto, a predominantly English-speaking city. Jussayin'.Might I just add, I am fully bilingual, and her accent did not at all come close to the real pronunciation (smh). And then this lady proceeded to say: "Any self-respecting pastry chef knows how to say macaron the correct way" It was callous, and condescending, making me feel very uncomfortable, and belittled. NOT the way a business owner should treat their valuable customers.She must've had God on her side that day. If there wasn't a glass counter filled with maca'R'ons between us, I would've fed her a few open palm wake-up calls. So, though their product may deserve an extra star than I gave credit for, she abates that rating with her temperament, disposition, and ego...WHICH I BELIEVE IS FAIR. You review a business based upon not only their products, but also their service. I got my macarons, the only one worth paying for is the mocha flavoured one, the rest are deplorable, the texture is not what a macaron should be. For someone who is so confident in their macaron expertise, she really falls short in her abilities to prove that. Their viennoiseries such as the croissants are super fluffy & buttery, overly so almost. It oozed transfats. They really do live up do their moniker, 'Butter Avenue'.Just because of her, I'd never return. I'm not trying to go places where I'm disrespected and treated like I've committed the worst crimes known to man.Tip: Go early, they're ALWAYS sold out of their non-macaron items...or DON'T if you don't want to start your day off with a rude glare and a generally sour note. 1
good pho for the west-end.very clean, very unusual for asian places, especally vietnamese restaurants. however, usually nice asian restaurants aren't authentic but this place is run by true viets. don't get their thai mango salad though, it REALLY sucks. it is DRENCHED in fish sauce or whatever. 4
Blueberry cheesecake gelato, hands down one of the best things I've ever tasted! 5
Saw a car I liked on the internet on Monday for a price I thought was very fair. Got quoted a different price over the phone, went in on Thursday and yet ANOTHER price. Sat down and worked some numbers and couldn't get where I wanted to be so I left.....came home and? You guessed it, a different price AGAIN!!!!!!! This place is shady! I have fantastic credit and have purchased a multitude of cars and trucks.....run away and run away FAST!!!!! 1
They've got a new circular bar in the center of the casino that plays awesome...AWESOME...music.  The table games are now set up to radiate out from that bar.  Love it. Blackjack paid.  Pai Gow paid.  The Penny slots paid.  Nice.Shockingly, when we visited a few weekends ago the joint was pretty full...and the MGM was shoulder to shoulder. 4
I am very pleased to have found this restaurant which is several cuts above other pho joints I have eaten in in the past thirty years. It starts with brilliant pho broth: here is a very complex , low salt highly complex broth . It reminds me of the broth used by the sadly gone White Lotus on Lansdowne that was my flagship spot  for excellence until it closed about three years ago.Anyway hooray for excellent golden turtle broth. I had the soup last time which brought me back today.I tend to evaluate using two or three standard dishes and today it was vermicelli with grilled pork, grilled shrimp and spring rolls. Verdict: massive shrimp lightly grilled, lots of tender pork and as in earlier visits very plump non- greasy spring rolls which I dipped in Hoisen sauce as an experiment.My bowl of Bun had lots of mint and bean sprouts, and the accompanying sauce was not too vinegary all well balanced.Overall extremely satisfying and served up with flair and professional skill in a very busy lunch hour. So I will go again though it puzzles me to see some negative reviewers dissing this place for another pho joint nearby. Guys, stay out of the commercial rivalry and avoid negativity! Life's too short. 4
When you walk into Korean Village you will be quickly greeted by their friendly staff. The restaurant is roomy with a nice atmosphere and has large comfy booth seatings - my fave! The menu is extensive with many options from platters to BBQs and the usual Korean dishes (pork bone soup, bibimbap etc.). My partner and I ended up sharing the assorted Grilling BBQ Platter (pork, beef, chicken, seafood). The selection of meat was not bad but just a bit over-marinated in sauce which made eating it quite salty. Prices in comparison to their serving portions are not very filling but other than that, the service is excellent as the waitress was helpful in coming back and forth to check on our cooking meats. Overall, fun experience with attentive staff that really want you to enjoy your time there.         Note: take notice of the many pictures of celebrities and newspaper articles on their wall that have eaten here. 3
Having been to every brewery in CLT multiple times, I can easily say, this is my least favorite.  Not trying to be too mean to the place but first and foremost, the beers are very 'meh'.  None of them stands out for quality or taste.  I always get a weird vibe in this place, the crowd is just a little off, certainly comprised of the locals that live within walking distance.. which is not terribly appealing.  I would go to Lenny Boy or Triple C any day over Syc if i'm in that area. 2
A bit disappointing.  The food is edible, but nothing to swoon over. Its a trendy little spot that relies on hipsters. Think white guys in sweater vests wearing Kangol hats with women in pashminas and colorful cowboy boots. The bartenders appeared to be required to mix all their drinks over their heads.To call the food there Mexican would be a bit of a stretch. Possibly Mexican inspired or if you want to stick with trendy nomenclature Mexican fusion, but definitely not something that makes you think that there is a pack of a Mexicans in the kitchen. The mole sauce on my dish was quite thin and bland, and the yucca fries were tragically flavorless. The chicken was well cooked but poorly seasoned. The side of black beans was delicious but seasoned in a way that make me think of India, not Mexico.The dinner was by no means unpleasant, but I'm not going to be racing to get back there. 2
Hole in the wall place that at first glance looks dingy on the inside, forgotten on the outside. Dude at the counter could not stop coughing during my entire order, that should have been a clear signal this place is on life support. Mistakenly didn't order the lunch& went for the Chicken Katsu /Sweet n Sour combo plate (they even throw a ton of rice). The Katsu was old and had zero flavor & below average dipping sauce.  Sweet n Sour chkn was bland and made yesterday. Not recommended nor will I go back voluntarily. 1
The food was all right, nothing too outstanding about it and nothing too bad about it. The service was all right. I find that the price was a bit much. I can understand paying extra if they were including their hot pot in the price, but they don't; they charge extra. 2
My husband is peter piper pizza #1 fan, and I must say I have gotten to love it to. Today I placed a care your order and was pleasantly  surprised that the phone only ringed once and one picked up so super friendly with a great attitude. Once I got there I proceeded to pay the girl in front was very helpful and with a good attitude. I asked for a cup of water and the manager asked if I was waiting for a Carry out and he gave an actual drink cup. I thought that was very nice. I'm happy to see that people take pride in serving well with a great attitude. After being in many fast food places and stores people really have bad attitudes and are not helpful I was happy to be treated well. And not to forget the food it was delicious as always. 5
Was looking forward to having a late dinner here and all was going well. Ordered the Greek salad, potato wedge and falafel box. Wedges were okay pretty sure they were cooked from frozen as they had a mash potato mouth feel, seasoning was decent though. Greek salad was iceberg lettuce with peppers, onions and a few small black olives (also both the "me-salad" and the Greek came with the same vinaigrette). Finally we get to the falafels... Looked pretty great but they were basically chickpea-ran-through-it doughnuts. Wasn't a fan of the taste or texture, soft spongy with that distinct timbit taste. Tahini sauce was runny and flavourless. Maybe I'm being picky as the rest of my table enjoyed their dishes, but I'd rather go to one of a thousand hole in the wall shawarma places than come back here. 2
Dear Yoshi's.  You and I go way way back.  Remember that one time I ordered Combo #2 (Teriyaki chicken)?  Oh yeah I mean that was about 500 times.  Remember that time the girl behind the counter was puzzling over my request for some Gomasho?  Oh I meant the 500 times (it's ok, eventually she figures out what I'm asking for).  Remember that time Kirk and I saw a cockroach hanging out near the bathrooms?  It really happened!  But only one time did I see it.  Don't get defensive now, Yoshi's, but please take care of that problem if you haven't already.  It's ok, we will still do business together---especially if you keep your prices moderate.  I'll still order Dragon chicken.  I'll still brave your parking lot, fending off the odd transient here and there.  It's nice to know you'll always be there for some decent japanese style food at a moderate price. 3
This is our second time visiting Claim Jumper and this time I was extremely disappointed with the service. We arrived at the restaurant around 1:30 and it wasn't crowded at all either. My waitress name was Cinthya and she was very rude. We came in to celebrate my daughter's birthday. After we placed an order it took very long for them to bring out the food to us and it was another waitress that brought out the food and I asked politely if she could bring me some chipotle sauce and she never came around to doing that. Almost at the end of the meal I barley saw my server at all.      Then I went up to one of the other servers at the front and told them that it was my daughter's birthday and then a few minutes later my server Cinthya came to the table and questioned out loud in front of everyone at the table and asked "is there someone's birthday at this table?" very rudely. This was a surprise for my daughter from my husband and I and for her to ruin that was unbelievably frustrating. My husband responded for a no because it was meant to be a surprise so I corrected it that yes it was my daughter's birthday. A few minutes later she brought out a red velvet cupcake and she light the candle and just threw it on the table without having the courtesy to even wish my daughter a happy birthday.    Then we asked for a to-go boxes and bags, she brought out the boxes but not the bags then she disappeared off somewhere! If this is how Claim Jumper training their employees to treat their customers then mostly likely we will never return to Claim Jumper again. 2
Totally mediocre. I'd just as soon go to Applebee's or chilis. Came here on a Saturday night for some preseason football, but they only had two games playing.  They got my order of wings wrong, but quick to redeem themselves with $5 "Zipps bucks. " the wings were tasty with plenty of meat on them. The service was friendly. Probably wouldn't come back just because there's better places for wings and football. 3
So I love Bomberos. I like the fire pit, and the trees, and the decor. But the thing I love the most is the atun escabeche(sp). Salty, sweet, and delicious.  As a side note, my 7 year old daughter loves to come here to hang out and read, apparently Junie B. Jones books fit in really well with the ham and cheese sandwich. I highly recommend it. 4
I had my hair cut by Anthony a few months ago. At that time, my hair was desperate for a cut and pretty dry, after I grew it out for my own wedding and a friend's.  Anthony was very nice, and I was impressed by the clean, professional salon. However, I wasn't too keen on him talking me out of getting layers when I said that I wanted them, as I have had layers many, many times before and am happiest when I have some bounce to my hair. I appreciate a professional opinion, but I know my hair best of all, and I regret letting him talk me out of it. I left with a healthy, yet all one-layer cut, which became boring to me within a week.  I just feel like for the price that I paid, I should have gotten more. I could have had a friend with a steady hand cut my hair all one length for free.  Overall, this experience just taught me to stand up for what I want and not let people talk me out of something I really want for my hair. 3
saw employee hork and spit. saw employee picking nose while putting out produce. prices good. most of the staff do not speak English so shopper cannot get help. veggies fresh...fruit less fresh. on-sale OJ often not refrigerated. buy selectively here and you're ok 2
Went here a few weeks ago during our stay and on a Friday night it was OK. We got walked in and free drink tickets but the crowd just wasn't cracking that night. Bartender was nice though but the gambling area didn't have much energy. We got invited to the cabanas and the bartender there was very sweet. Music was OK...but they played the Micky Avalon "My Dick" song LOL! 3
This was some of the best Mediterranean "fast" food I've ever had in the West. Casual atmosphere, friendly staff, convenient. Ask for a sampler of their sauces. 4
Pretty small restaurant. Need to make reservation every time. Sashimi is fresh. I always order the chirps hi sushi which I love the most! Portion is more than enough for a girl. Comes with cake of your choice. Tofu cheesecake and greeted red bean cake are my favorite. Its curry dishes are tasty too. I recommend to go with any course with sashimi. A bit pricy though. 4
Let me begin by telling you I was recently in the market for a 2014 Nissan Pathfinder. I had done all my research, and knew what trim level, color and options I wanted. I talked to someone named Cruz at your dealership a few months back, and he was really helpful. I wasn't ready at that point and he followed up and I still wasn't ready. When I became ready, I decided to stop by this dealership for the first time around noon on Saturday, March 21st 2014. That's where I had one of the most unpleasant experiences of any dealership visit that I've ever had.I had never met Cruz, so when I went in, I had no idea who he was.  I went in through a side door, so I did not immediately see the receptionist. I walked around the dealership, aimlessly, for at least 5 minutes. No one said anything to me. I saw someone and decided to ask if there was a Cruz working, and he replied yes and did not seek to point him out. I finally found the receptionist (Daylin), and she seemed not very friendly and into her phone. She did page Cruz, and I began to wait. 10 minutes later, I asked for him again, and that's when Jacques Deadwiley came over and asked if I was being helped. I told him I was waiting on Cruz, and he attempted to call him on his cellphone. He walked outside and came back in and told me he was with another client, and that he himself would help me.We went to a desk, and I told him I only had 30 minutes today, and he said cool. I told him what I was looking for, and he brought in a salesman who took over. He was very nice and began taking my info. Again, I told them I had 30 minutes and had to be somewhere. I had Jacques card, so I planned on calling back after he had my info and I could see what kind of deal he was going to offer. After being there about 45 minutes, I walked over to the glass booth and told them I was leaving, but I would call back in a few. That's where the real problem began.Dawud Muhammad, who I had not spoken to and only know his name based on your website, aggressively threw his hands up and said "I thought you wanted to buy a car!" in a condescending tone. I replied "And this is supposed to entice me?", referring to his tone and approach. I then walked out to my car. Dawud followed, and as I got in my car and attempted to close the door, he was holding onto my door. I can't really remember all that he was saying, because at this point I was insulted and ready to go. The salesman came out and I told him that I felt Dawud was an a**hole and I asked for the salesman's card. He said he didn't have any on him. After another brief exchange with Dawud, I drove off.I called Jacques back in 10 minutes, and he asked me why I left. I told him, just as I had originally told him, I had to be somewhere. He replied "I thought you wanted to buy a car? I had the deal worked out and then you walked off". I advised that I did and that was why I was calling back. I asked what the deal was. He said he had thrown the numbers away since I left and had to start over. At that time I told him that I felt like he was playing games, and to forget it. He angrily hung the phone up.This by far is the worst I have ever been treated by a car dealership. Nissan dealerships in this area and I have never had such a horrible experience.  I have worked in sales before, so I can honestly appreciate an aggressive sales approach. This was over the limit though. You can't talk to and treat people in this manner and expect them to patronize your business. I felt insulted and I think they tried to shame and belittle me in an attempt to push me into continuing to stay there and wait forever. This experience sucked on every level.S/N: I purchased the car I was looking for at East Charlotte Nissan a few hours after this experience. 1
This Buffet at Bally's is decent, it's not bad. I came here twice, once the line was long due to dinner. I haven't been here in years. But it's a good buffet, it's nothing special but it gets the job done. 3
I can say that is one of my favourite burger. It's simple maded but delicous. Grilled Cheese menns two slices of melted American cheese, spread with onions on a freshly baked bun is one of the secret menu. Marvelous! You also can order a double cheeseburger... 4
My boyfriend is kind of a down home, "we love Amurrica" kind of guy, It's part of his charm, it's what I love about him, but the kind of cuisine that accompanies this quality isn't my cup of tea. I rarely eat red meat. I avoid fried foods whenever possible. That being said, I like to see my man happy - a knife in one hand, a fork in the other, and a big plate of Western goodness between the two. TEXAZ seemed perfect. I read reviews, (not on Yelp, unfortunately), scoped out the location, and surprised him by taking him there a few months ago. I, for one, loved the atmosphere. It was loud, a little rowdy, and filled to the ceiling with junk! An eclectic assortment of ephemera clung to the walls, accented with knick-knacks and taxidermied animals here and there. Imagine the inside of an Applebee's, except 10 times darker and decorated with items people actually accumulated over time, not stuff that came out of some corporate "wacky interiors!" starter kit. The waitress was pleasant, but inattentive. The portions were huge, but bland. Even the biscuits were especially boring, and it's hard to make a buttermilk biscuit any more boring than it naturally is, just by existing. I tried to score some honey mustard to liven up my tasteless chicken entree, but no go - no sauces were available! What?! Even my boyfriend seemed less than thrilled by his big ol' meaty hunk of meat, served with a side of some bland starch or another. My boyfriend also found the beer selection to be lacking, but I can't vouch for the accuracy of this observation as I do not care about beer in the slightest. For what it was, it was pricey. I felt like we could've gone to almost any other sit-down restaurant in a 2 mile radius and had a better experience for less cash. We left full, but with nothing good to say other than "my, that was a lot of food." Hardly ringing praise for a $50+ dinner bill. I don't think we'll be back...the lure of the 1970s concert posters and deer skulls isn't enough to justify a second visit. 2
I hadn't been to Shiraz in over two years, but was excited to take my out-of-town, gluten intolerant sister there for dinner. What a disappointment! A plate of about 1 cup of plain rice with a little saffron for colour and a small bowl of fesenjaan with 4 small bite-sized pieces of chicken and the rest sauce is NOT worth $20. We had to order an $8 salad separately which was another small bowl of diced tomato, onion, cucumber that I could have whipped up in under 2 minutes. This boring little side salad should have been included with the meal. (The eggplant dip was good.)The two stars are for the service; our waitress was lovely. I would address this with the owners but there is no email address on their site. 2
I took my Dad for his birthday here thinking it would be a nice place to have dinner. I couldn't be more wrong. The food was okay but the portions were very small. I ordered the steak and shrimp and it was a joke. I got to Small shrimps and a small thin piece of meat. Everyone was upset with the portions very small. The service was probably the worst service I've ever had a restaurant and my wife and I go out a lot. The waiter Matt forgot everything we ordered and waited a long time to refill our drinks. He also charged my card 3X for the horrible experience. I later called them and they told me he messed up and that it was unfortunate for me and that I had to wait til they release my funds on my bank statement. I find it amazing how they can just say sorry, we charged your account 3x and we aren't going to do anything about it. I feel I deserved some compensation for the headache of dealing with this horrible service and their mistake. Our bill was approximately $300.00 and I had a restaurant.com discount of $100. I was charged $200.00, my brother was charged $200.00, and my brother-in-law was charged $200.00 and now we are pending at the bank because they don't know how to pay attension. I hate that in the fine print it states we have to tip 18% because he deserved 5% tops. Hopefully you read this and you don't go to this place because they are just awful. I recommend Los Olivos in Scottsdale if your looking for good food and great service. 1
Stopped in while my boyfriend & I were on our way to Cathedral Gorge. With all the driving we were desperate for a good beer. Friendly staff & we loved the Hop Ride American IOA. We are from San Diego so we basically live off IPA's. Awesome addition of going upstairs and checking out the beer vats and where they brew from the glass wall. Well worth a stop on our drive :)BONUS: We loved all the chalk art. 5
We had just bought a home in Phoenix and wanted to get rid of all the carpet and replace with laminate. We hid all the big box stores and LL. We did not see anything that we really liked and the prices seemed high to us. We walked into Paradise by chance as our closing was a few blocks away. We met Cosmo and he showed us some laminate that we loved. It was much nicer and seemed to be a better quality that the other places. We gave Cosmo our measurements. He worked out a price on flooring, underpaying and installation. The price was great and we signed the deal with a handshake. Cosmo is a man where a handshake is his bond. Not many businessmen left like this. We gave him the key to the house as we were going back to Denver to pick up our furniture. We could not wait to see it installed. It was perfect. His installers did a GREAT job. They called me to see how we wanted it to flow and the precision was perfect. House was left clean and ready for furniture.This is the place for all your flooring needs. Jay and mary 5
So basically I made a reservation for bottle service for my birthday, letting them know it's my birthday on Thursday at Candi bar for 5 people and everything was good. I had done this for my boyfriend's birthday last year so we knew what it was like. They called me around 4pm the day of (Saturday) confirming our booth leaving a voicemail message while I was sleeping so I hear it and call them back at 6pm confirming it and everything was good. They told us to come around 10 or 11. It's 1045 and I call them telling them that we will be there in 45 minutes and everything was good. So we get there and the bouncer says we aren't on the list and there was never a reservation for us. He's being a rude prick and was trying to find a way to not let us in like looking at the guys clothes, but they were dressed up so that wasn't the problem. So after pleading with the bouncer and manager they let us in telling us to go to coat check so we go and pay. Then another manager comes up to us and is all nice shaking my hand knowing that I made the reservation. And leads us away from where the booths that we expected are to the corner of the club to these shitty little wobbly cafe tables that only fit three people. So I'm like no this isn't what I asked for and they said that since we are only five he bumped us down the list for a party of 7 even though I made the reservation first. So we are going back and forth with the manager being like we want a booth since we are still paying the same to sit at these tables as the people in the booths. So we then decide fuck them let's go to another bar. When the guys are getting their coats I'm like well I'm here I paid for coat check I might as well have a shot or something before I go. As I'm ordering the manager comes up to me, taps me on the shoulder and tells me I have to leave because I don't have a table anymore. So I'm like fuming and almost crying. So we get our coats and leave. And the only nice employee was the coat check girl and a big bouncer inside that asked me if I was alright when I was about to cry. So we leave and walk a couple blocks to Edgar Hypertaverne where I spent my birthday last year and have some drinks served by nice employees. 1
The food was ok. You get a lot of food for the price. There is bot a lot of seating. 4
Very pleased with my experience there.  I saw April for waxing services.  She was so personable and friendly.  Very accommodating for my crazy schedule.  It was my 1st time for this type of service and April was very patient, answered my questions, made me comfortable and overall created a wonderful visit.  I will certainly be back! 5
After my 8 lb poodle was attached by a coyote, I went there. The staff and doctor were very nice and took good care of my dog Bradley.  This will be my go to ER for all my pets. 4
I keep coming back for the massage. Lisa is a professional! I highly recommend the soy candle massage. The experience with the staff is always exceptional. 4
Came here to get togo...got a sisig bowl and a tocino bowl wanted to see what it was all about...also ordered side of egg for the bowls $20 wid tip. Got home and saw no eggs!!! checked my receipt and got charged for them too. Also i got garlic rice which was an extra .50cents ea. most of upgrades u hav to pay for extra and i didnt even know until i saw the receipt. Its pretty pricey for a food truck sized order very small. Sisig was very sour and tocino was just ok meats wer shredded. Didnt even fill me up. Id rather go get a 2 item combo at fiesta fililina across the street for $6. Probably wouldnt come back here anymore. 1
At first I was a little confused with how the place was set up, where to order what I wanted. The staff was okay, chatting with each other while I looked around. Finally a cook explained the set up. I had the vegetarian tacos and my boyfriend had chicken tacos. Flavors were good. salsa bar was overwhelming, I wish they would label the 8 different salsa. Mexican corn was beyond good. Dj playing in the corner on Saturday night was a great surprise.  Planning on coming back again. 4
I've only eaten Indian food a few times but my husband has been over to India for business a couple of times and was feeling a bit nostalgic.  We decided to try this place after I found it here on yelp with such good reviews.  He liked it for the flavors & went back twice more after he said "I'm full, I need to stop."  I liked it for the flavors as well but I also liked the fact that I could sample different dishes without having to order a big plate of something that I don't like (as can sometimes happen when you're unfamiliar with the cuisine).  ALL of the staff was friendly and attentive and I swear that each of them stopped by our table at one point or another to check on us.  They had a real team feeling about them.We'll be back. 4
We stopped in here for dinner and cocktails on a Saturday night after friends we were traveling with got several referrals to check this place out. It's down the strip near the Riviera Casino. We walked into the lounge area as there was a wait for the diner side and decided we just had to hang out on the lounge side! The seating area is low back velour couches with little marble pedestal tables. There are neon lights and plastic flowers and mirrors! Oh the mirrors! Cue the 70's music!!!  The servers wear 70's style long black nightgowns and are very friendly. Ok food and drinks- we tried a few of the specialty drinks (green tea martini, oatmeal cookie martini with ice cream of course, espresso martini, White Russian). They make a solid drink here. We ordered a few appetizers- be warned they are enormous. Our little pedestal table was overwhelmed. The food on the lounge side was basic bar appetizer fate- but it's the atmosphere that wins here. There is a fire water table thing in the center of the lounge as well- very cool. Overall a very funky fun place to hang out. I will be adding it to my list of stops next trip.  Don't forget to break out your leisure suit! 4
In & Out Burger is my FAVORITE.  I could have one of their burgers any day, at any time.  Hands down, my favorite.   DYING for them to expand and come east!!Reviewing this location in Phoenix as it was the last one I visited.  I was with over a dozen rowdy softball players, and they put together our entire order in no time.  Their locations are always clean, with classic decor and super friendly staff.  I've heard that they pay their employees very well, so they're in turn loyal, and treat the customers (and prepare the food) very well.The menu is simple, and everything on it is fantastic.  You can't go wrong. 5
I ordered from here online and I was very impressed at how quickly and accurately the order was processed and delivered. It was delivered in less than the expected wait time, and the sandwiches were wrapped and packaged very nicely. It's very obvious that this place loves good sandwiches. 5
We stopped in last Friday to have a quick bite to eat and take advantage of happy hour specials.  In a city full of great food, we couldn't have regretted our choice more.  It's partially our fault, as we were in "we're on vacation and we can eat whatever we want mode" and ordered fried calamari, fried cheese sticks, and fried chicken fingers.  No, the menu doesn't state fried so redundantly.  Taking the blame for our unhealthy choices, I still have to say this is the worst food I've ever had in the Phoenix area. We were raking our brains trying to come up with any other place that was even close to this bad, and couldn't come up with anything to compare it to.  My boyfriend's comment, "how can you screw up fries?"  The only plus was that our waitress was quick, and nice.  She offered to replace my beer (ordered the special, terrible!) with something I would like, and was very pleasant. 1
Had breakfast. Was not at all impressed. Eggs were watery and there really wasn't much variety. Think there was more variety in desserts than actual food for breakfast. We were arrived at 1015 so we also were able to see some lunch stuff being brought out towards the end- not really impressed again and I am pretty easy to please. Was going to consider coming back here for dinner based the on good reviews on here but after this breakfast we decided to pass. 2
Ok disclaimer, the food here is pretty good.. Like 4 stars good. I would even say it's my go to Korean restaurant here in calgary. We were craving Korean tonight so of course we decided to come here. We knew it closed at 10 so we walked in the door by 9pm. To our disappointment we were turned away by staff saying they were closed. I politely pointed out to the staff that the open sign was still on so it was misleading. He proceeded to correct me saying the open sign was off. I walked outside and there it was, a bright ass sign saying "open" with the hours printed underneath (sign said 10 btw). I understand restaurants closing 30 minutes early if they're slow but a whole hour? That seems pretty unreasonable. 3
This place is ok. I've been here twice and get in and out quickly. I'm cool with $40 for a 'full service' oil change but I doubt they're doing anything other than just changing the oil because both times despite claiming they filled my washer fluid, they did not. They also always try and up sell you on air filters. AZ seems to lack good, quick oil change stations that don't require an appointment. 3
One visit suggests this is a strong addition to Montreal's boulangerie scene. The selection isn't vast, but it includes two pretty serious rye breads -- one 100% rye, the other 67%. I tried the latter and have at least one reason to return. Ace baker Julien Roy, formerly of Le pain dans les voiles, is part of the team. There are a few tables, and they also serve coffee. Bonne chance ! 4
We went to Farm and Craft last night for my birthday dinner, and it was the worst service we have ever had, from start to finish. The hostess ignored us, and we waited 8 minutes to be greeted by our server when we were sat. I ordered a beer, it took 10 minutes to get. We waited another 5 minutes to order, and the appetizer took 25 minutes to get, and the entrees came out a minute later. To be fair, the restaurant was very busy. But the service was terrible. We will not be back, which is a shame, because this used to be one of our favorite spots. I'm not sure what's going on with this place, it's gotten worse and worse. Do yourself a favor, and don't go here, unless you sit at the bar, and only come during the day. The dinner service is a train wreck. 1
Ehhhhh...I just don't know. I've dined in at this Claim Jumper about twice a month for the past 8 months that I've resided in Vegas, and probably ordered the take out another 5-10 times or so when I was working more frequently in Town Square. Everything here is so unbelievably inconsistent, that it's hard to give this place a solid rating. When the food is good and the service is good, this place is definitely 4-5 stars. But when its bad...boy is it bad. Claim Jumper has an excellent menu and dessert selection. This is their strength and weakness - they offer a little of everything for everyone while specializing in absolutely nothing. They also offer a full service bar that's pretty handy to grab a Stoli Cranberry when you're waiting for a table on a Saturday night. And the drinks are pretty darn good, especially when this blonde guy Chris is in the bar. He makes a mean martini - the kind that makes me shamelessly fall off my bar stool when I get up to follow the hostess to my awaiting table.The servers are hit or miss. I've had a few that were friendly and talkative and gave me free dessert for being a sweetheart. I've also had some that were outright hostile by slamming a plate or cheese toast on the table or rolling their eyes and groaning when I meekly asked for a refill of iced tea. Luckily, I've found a server that is polite, friendly, and thorough, so I just request him when I go in. "Are you sure you're willing to wait 40 minutes for a table with him, ma'am?" Why yes, yes I am; I've got my appletini right here to entertain me.The food for the most part is mediocre and generally lukewarm by the time it reaches the table. But the portions are ridiculously huge. I order off the Little Jumper's menu most of the time (when I have a server that's willing to accomodate that), and even then I end up taking about half of it home. I've had a variety of different dishes (lobster, steak, turkey dinner, burger, pizza, country fried steak, etc.), and I find I'm disappointed most of the time. Their mini pizzas and sliders are phenomenal though.Decor is nice enough. Booths are comfy. Bathrooms are clean. Outdoor spring/summer seating looks nice. The music that plays is mostly 80s and is completely awesome. It's half the fun of going there.Lunch take-out has proven to be a worthless joke for me. Despite ordering 15-20 minutes before I even jaunt on over there for pick up, half the time they forget to put my order in, and the other half of the time something happens in the kitchen and it has to be completely remade. I appreciate the quality checks the staff makes before handing my order over to me, but I'm starving. It's just one freaking soft pretzel! Pleeeeeeaaaasssseeee feed me...I only have 5 minutes left on my lunch!Worth noting are their fantastic managers. If something goes wrong, they're there at your table to make sure it gets done right. They're very friendly and on top of things.So there you have it. Some good points, and some bad. I've put up with it, mostly because it was easy and a comfortable routine for my husband and I. But recently we discovered "I Love Sushi" so I think that's going to seriously cut into our Claim Jumper visits. Which is absolutely fine by both of us. 3
Charging customers for decaf coffee or requesting to have same type of ice cream on your Profiteroles is a bad practice to keep faithful clientele. 2
The food is excellent. However, the ambience is horrible and the service is terrible. We have picked up there three times within the past two weeks, and every time we did not feel welcome. The waiters and the servers do not speak to you and the the girl behind the register seemed like she was annoyed that we didn't know what we wanted and was rushing us. They look at you cross-eyed and are rude.  I did not feel welcome there. 3
No pride in their work.  1 year and 40 days later I numerous buckles in the carpet.  I called and spoke with Ron,  to ask about their warranty for work. Ron looked up my file and called back the following day stating it's past 1 year, we can come out but there is a service fee of $60.00 to come out. take a look because it obviously needs to be stretched out 1
Makers and finders was a hidden gym located in the Fremont District of downtown Las Vegas. The food was very good as well as the different products an atmosphere that we were privy to. I will definitely frequent this location in my near travels to the Las Vegas area and look forward to it. 5
Had a great bday celebration, waitress was great, and the music was awesome! 4
This place is so over the top.  It's the furthest thing from fine dining, which makes its prices hard to swallow.I wouldn't have gone there except I got a gift certificate.  Even so, my gift certificate wouldn't have made a dent in the cost of dinner, so I opted to pop in one Saturday for lunch.The service is ridiculous.  Waiters all dressed up in black-tie garb and they overemphasize probably-affected accents and speak at insane bellowing volumes.  With the tables as close together as they are, it just made me feel like everyone in the room had to be involved in my ordering process.  And there are all sorts of unnecessary flourishes in taking orders and presenting the food.  Now, I'm not saying the servers weren't nice.  They were.  And it's probably not their fault that they're all costumed and eccentric; I suspect that's part of the gig.  But it doesn't come off like a fine dining establishment.  It seemed like a farce.Likewise, the food is ridiculous.  The one thing I can say about the high prices is that at least you get your money's worth in quantity.  I mean, the amount of food served to one person bordered on obscene.  I had the gazpacho, which was salty but otherwise bland.  Then I went with paella, as it seemed to be the house specialty.  Goodlawd what a mountain of food!  And that doesn't count the entire plate of veggies that come with it (green beans, broccoli, cauliflower) and the plate of potato chips ("spanish style fried potatoes" my a**) and the plate of plain white bread with butter in little plastic packets with foil peel-off lids.  Nothing served had spices or flavor, just S&P and oil.  Way too much salt in everything, I was chugging water for the next 24 hours.  Then, uninterested in all the generic desserts offered, I opted for some kind of sorbet, maybe grapefruit.  When the waiter returned, he informed me they only had coconut (of all the sorbet flavors he had offered me).  I insisted that I didn't want it, because I don't like coconut, but again, I'm not really sure the entire room full of patrons needed to be privy to that conversation.In the end, I took the majority of the paella and the veggies home.  I wasn't about to eat them, but it seemed wasteful to throw them out, so I pawned them off on someone with a lesser palate.  The server was quite gracious in sending me home with lots of broccoli and cauliflower, which he noticed I had eaten all of, and just left the green beans.  Unnecessary, but kind.I feel really bad hating, because the service was awfully well-intentioned.  But the whole experience was just way too in your face and low-quality.  I truly don't know who considers this place worth patronizing. 2
Plates were dirty. Coffee cups smells like they were cooking eggs . It makes u feel u dont want to eat eggs anymore. 1
Six of us dined and took down a fairly large portion of the menu to share. Highlights included tender grilled octopus, the delicious trout, head on shrimp, and well-priced wines by the glass. Service was very good as well. Unfortunately, not all was great. The beef brisket was actually terrible. Extremely salty, very weak chimichurri, and a giant inedible fat cap. Awful. Papas bravas should have a spicy sauce. These came with a pedestrian aioli. At $45, the paella was not worth the price, as it was relatively small, and I didn't taste even a hint of saffron. Brussels sprouts were bitter and very unevenly cooked. They will have to up their game to succeed in such a pricy spot. Hopefully they can pull it together. 2
While visiting Montreal from NYC (yup, a tourist), I wanted to find a place to eat that was not filled with my fellow ugly Americans, and that I could walk to from my lovely Latin Quarter B and B.  This was it.   The goat cheese salad was so good that I dreamed about it and had to go back again for another taste.  It was sort of like the early stages of addiction.    That said, the gazpacho was eh- the bread was not entirely blended in, and getting a soggy crust half  way through my bowl was not that pleasant, though the taste was good.The atmosphere- sidewalk cafe on a nice night-- was lovely.  So, too, was the service.   Sad to say for the local patrons, I highly recommend Les Deux Gamins to my fellow travelers. 4
Dave "purchased" ice from us. In good faith we provided terms. We listened to his lip service time and time again, year after year and believed the best in him (our fault of course!). 3 years later he wrote a check because he ran into us. Of course it bounced. To this day they owe us $559! Do not do business with these horribly shady people who do not pay their bills! 1
I love this place. Nice selection of craft beers,  late night food,  solid To Go set up. The service has never been fantastic but I love the atmosphere and the GOURMET Asian food. I love people watching at this place and love stopping in for a beer. This will always be my first TO GO option on  the way home 4
Kathy has been doing my nails for over ten years. She is a wonderfully talented nail tech who is as skilled at her job as she is creative. Kathy has managed to turn nail services into an art form. She is constantly trying out new techniques and different looks. Not a week goes by that I don't get someone not only complimenting me on my nails, but also wanting to know who does them. That is how unique the results are. Of course, if you are looking for the basics, she will more than deliver, and do that just as beautifully and professionally. Kathy is extremely reliable and will do her best to make herself available to give your nails that special look for any occasion, be it a trip to Hawaii, a night on the town, or a that annual pilgrimage to see your favorite baseball team! I wouldn't dream of using anyone else!! 5
This is the place to go to if you are out with your friends looking for cheap going out clothes. They know their market they have good items at great prices- which is exactly what the girls who shop there are looking for.With that said- i was not pleased with my experience. The merchandise is cheap- but you get what you pay for- but there were also no small sizes. I'm a xsmall or small depending and there was nothing for me to even try on, everything was a size large. Also, I was shocked that while me and about 5 other girls were in there shopping the two sales girls were in the fitting rooms trying things on! I'm sorry but you need to help your shoppers- not yourself. you do that once you close or before your open but not while your on the clock.Their accessories were cute- $8 sunglasses were pretty great, but i couldnt get myself to buy anything. I didnt want to help them if they werent going to help me. 2
Chompies changed their corned beef a while back. It's not the same quality and flavor. Scott's and Goldman's corned beef is superior . We  used to be regulars, now we are occasionals 2
I can't even tell you how much business I gave this place... two words: never again.I got my hair cut/coloured there for about 3 years. They did a good job, but the service is really not up to par with the other salons I've recently been to. Firstly, I hate it when people try to hard sell me stuff. They are masters at trying to sell you Aveda products. I'm sorry, but I'm not interested in purchasing a 30$ bottle of shampoo. Secondly, I don't like trekking 30 minutes to a salon only to hear "Oh, your appointment is cancelled, oh your hairdresser moved you to another time..." In other words, "your hairdresser is booking other, more important people in your time slot." I know this for a fact because when I arrived for my 11 am appointment (which she who shall not be named "suddenly couldn't attend,") she was at her station with another client, one whom she seemed to be very friendly with. Lest we forget the time I had a wedding and had to wait 2 hours for a stylist (one which I didn't even book) to start working on my updo--- which was apparently impossible. 3 different stylists tried to do a simple braid before 1 finally got it done. and when i got my makeup done, i told the artist i wanted a nude lip colour... she put dark red. i kindly asked her to change it and she gave me major attitude and said it looked good. I'm just beyond turned off. I'm sure many people have had great experiences, but I've been very unhappy with the neglectful service. Screw up my appointment once, shame on you. Screw it up at least 5 times, peace out. 2
Lizeth is the best in the business!! Above and beyond service. I have worked with her for 3 years and have had exceptional results. I recommend Lizeth to anyone looking for a tax professional 5
The decor and food presentation are very nice, and the food is alright - but for the portions they serve, the prices are downright criminal. I walked in off the street and asked for the most popular item - it was an $11.29 Butter Chicken Kathi Roll. While the roll was decent (chicken was pretty dry but flavours were good), the size of the thing was comparable to a McDonalds Breakfast Burrito. I'd call it a snack rather than a meal. It's too bad the place doesn't sell these rolls for $5 - there would be lineups out the door!! 3
I've been going to lou's for over two years now. He's honest and he does very good work. He's my go to guy. 4
This is the best fish and chips place in Mississauga I've been to. I've only had their halibut and chips, and stick to it, though I'd eventually like to try some of their other fish (if I can get past the halibut!)I've only ever gotten take out here but it is served pretty quickly and properly for fish and chips, in a cardboard box. I can't stand places that use styrofoam as it makes the fish soggy. Thankfully, these guys do it old fashioned!Their fish is lightly battered and crisp. The fries as delicious and obviously fresh. I also believe they are double fried. The home made tartar sauce is good, though they usually give you the packets with your to-go bag, I would like their homemade stuff! It's much better! 5
WOW! This place must make so much money they don't require any new business!!Left 2 voicemails plus personally visited the gym and left my info with the personal trainer there asking for information on signing up. No return call a week after first contact. Too bad because it's ONE BLOCK from my house. 1
I went in first time experiencing very rude service by one female staff.There is simply no knowledge of serving customers in her with very harsh language, arrogant attitude and improper language etc. it's better the owner train their staffs to be more friendly customer oriented. 1
Great food, great service. Ask for Kathy... She is the most personable and sweetest waitress I've ever met. 5
Food was bland. Chicken Tikka Masala was flavorless. Not spicy. Samosas were cold on the inside. Naan was good. 2
We decided to come to this restaurant to celebrate a friends birthday. You could really tell it was a great establishment as soon as you walked in.First of all the customer service was impeccable amazing great can't ask for anything better they were always on point. Then the food came out and it was to die for and your plate was full can you just wanted more because it was so good. Wait there's more don't forget about the sides wow they are amazing and you got everything you wanted and if you wanted more you got more.All I can say is the food was terrific the service was impeccable the restaurant was nice and clean. the restroom was kept very spotless and the dessert was amazing we had a fabulous time and we will be back. 5
Do not go here if you are not a fan of smelling like a cigar nor if you like your espresso martinis!Pleasant open spot to people-watch.Ideal for older couples and seems to be frequented by groups of middle-aged to older men 3
Place is beautiful! Wonderful view of the river and city! Staff is nice, but could be a little more attentive, at least in the case of my waiter. Myself & BF chose a salad starter (Caesar & wedge) and both were tasty. I ordered the cowboy ribeye which was accompanied by creamy mash potatoes. It was giant (16oz) & so yummy. My bf also ordered a steak, the ny strip, and his was smothered with an onion and mushroom based gravy, also great! My favorite dish however was dessert. We ordered the  chocolate truffle cake, basically a molten chocolate lava cake with French vanilla ice cream topped with Heath bar shavings. Holy moly so GOOD! That was definitely a great end to the evening. The bill was just a little over $100 for 2, but for what we got I thought it was a solid deal, and walked away fully satisfied ;-) 4
Tonight was the first time I have ever walked out of a restaurant because the food was taking so long.  After waiting an hour, numerous tables received orders ahead of us who had arrived after we were seated.  Manager did not show up to talk with us after waiter said he would. We have eaten here many times and enjoyed the food. This might be our last visit.  Management showed no interest in even talking to us. 2
Yelp's description for a 3/5 star rating is perfectly appropriate here, "A-OK". Service is fine, food's alright but boring, and even at 6$-7$ it's over priced for the portion size. I was in the mood for some veggies so I got the Veggie Burger (super dry) and a Beet Salad (pretty good with nice big chunks of beets). Fries were meh. 26oz house beer was solid at 6$. My friend didn't make much of his tacos or sliders, but enjoyed his cocktail. The place gets busy so we waited 30 minutes, went for a coffee nearby. It's cool that they take your phone number and call you when your table's ready, but it's not worth the wait. Maybe a good place to grab a drink and get some snacks, but not ideal if dinner is the main priority. 3
The dessert from the restaurant is very great. Judging from the dessert almost I would give them a 5 star. The settings and decoration are beautiful inside the restaurant.The price is reasonable and affordable.The servants are polite and helpful.However, the main meals are not as great. I give them a4 star simply because their main meals could be better 4
THE DRYEST BURGER IVE EVER EATEN.... $40 for 2 burgers and fries and I would rather eat a McDonald's double cheeseburger. 1
I haven't yelped forever n my first yelp ia bt dmv...that's how bored I am. Lets see ky review the vending macines r overpriced. The chairs suck. It smells funny. Pep smell. At least the ac runs well. Maybe I shld do what I did last time n buy someone's numb for 100 bucks...muhaaahh 2
Booked this on Priceline. Possibly the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. Dirty and smelly. The maids could made the bed with the sheets on sideways!For the price I expected much better. 1
Sweet little place! Great burgers!! Live music. Sorry to hear they are moving to a new location. Loved the little house!Second trip--crab "burger" was like a blob of crab salad on a bun. Not real tasty for me. Husband tried the crab and shrimp stuffed portobello- 2 1/2 stars out of 5, he said. It was thickly covered with melted cheese, a (less than) subtle touch it could be much better without. He said the asparagus was good. The service was good, and they did comp my meal, which was nice of them. In the future we will stick to the burgers!! Live music was very pleasant. Beers good. 3
This place inside Woodside mall has been here for years. Came here quite a few times 17 years ago but probably haven't been here in over 6+ years.Had the large noodle with rare beef and brisket. The noodles were nice and the broth was very tasty. The meat portion could have been a little more generous, but overall it was a very tasty and not too heavy meal. Prices were good. $7 for small $8 for large. Only accepts cash and debit. No credit cards 4
The best experience I've ever had with an agent by far. Jenny worked closely with me to find the perfect place. She was extremely diligent and flexible. Jenny simply goes above and beyond for her client and most importantly she listens and considers preference when scouting properties. She was with me every step of the way, assured that my bid was received promptly, and negotiated on my hehalf when it was appropriate. She's diligent, fierce, and a joy to work with! 100% recommend. 5
My husband and I stayed here last weekend for a much-needed Vegas getaway. The particular room we stayed in was alright..."A-OK" as my 3-star rating can attest, but honestly? Despite the additional kitchen sink and wine glasses in the cabinets, our room in particular wasn't any more special than a Hampton or Garden Inn. Maybe I'm spoiled by suites at the likes of the Venetian when I travel to Vegas. They're clean and comfortable, and if the price is right...as everyone says, you don't really spend all that much time in the room anyway in Vegas, right? Least you're not likely to find a dead hooker in your mattress or anything. It's also kind of far from the action of the strip, located essentially across from the Sahara and a good few blocks from the Stratosphere. While I'm not a high-rollin' Vegas snob in the least, keep this in mind if this is your first time in Vegas. No casino and no crazy cigarette smell, which is nice, depending on your preference. Hilton Grand Vacations definitely has perks...a 24-hr. convenience shop if you want a late-night sandwich or want to split a bottle of post-cocktail champagne or wine with your sweetie. Nice exercise room. There's also a cool rec room with foozball and such if you're stuck here for a business meeting or what have you. Seems like the perks are better if you're a time share owner here. I'm a measly Hilton Silver member so that's probably why I got an "eh" room. I'm also going to be honest and knock off an additional star for the constant barrage of phone calls I received booking AND staying at this place. I was called at least once a day on my cell prior to arrival (whilst playing phone tag...I'm somewhat respectful and try to return all calls) to "ensure check-in was smooth", which basically translated to me as "Purchase our time share plan!" They will also call your room once a day to try to sell their time shares on to you (loud phone ringing in your room in Vegas is always kind of startling, especially when you're trying to sleep off that last 4am cocktail...)I'd recommend this place if you're already over the hooplah of the Vegas strip and want a somewhat-inbetween getaway. Overall it's clean, comfortable and reasonably priced. In other words (and I abhor this saying but) it is what it is! 3
Been dropping in here for several years now, the odd lunch or breakfast. The food is tasty, plain cooking, nothing uber-creative. Fresh ingredients, always. Service can be slow or reasonable, depending on the capacity. Plenty of coffees and teas. I see all these reviews about friendly service, and I guess that's fair for the most part ... still, there is this one lady who serves and takes orders who's always busy and really hustles ... but always looks like she's just swallowed a glass of vinegar. I have NEVER seen her smile. Takes away a little bit from an otherwise pleasant experience. 3
They're the best! Nothing more needs to be said. I will 100% never turn down Chino! Jade red chicken quesadila all the way!!! 5
Staff was very friendly, but the dentist called me a liar be because I miss mark something on the form.  This dentist seemed to not know how to pull a fragile tooth. When did dentist become dental monitors? 1
Service was terrible, took 4 phone calls and a trip to the front desk to get towels. 2 out of 12 elevators were working. 0 out of 12 were working on the last day. Took stairs into a construction site with all our bags. Parking lot was full. Don't stay here. 1
Was craving a Belgian waffle after having an amazing waffle down in NYC. After a quick Google search this place came up and my girlfriend and I decided to check it out. She ordered the strawberry delight waffle and I ordered a breakfast crepe. The waffle was tiny and my crepe wasn't up to par with what I was expecting. The waffle was good but it wasn't great...the dough didn't taste fresh. My girlfriend ordered a hot chocolate which was actually very tasty. The service was also very slow, we were surprised to see only 1 employee working on a Sunday. Will probably search for another waffle place the next time we are craving Belgian waffles. 3
This hotel has been/is in the process of being renovating, & the new part is very nice.  There are all new furnishings, new carpet and furniture; decorated in a clean,  contemporary look. There is free wifi and cable.  Good location. 4
Great customer service , always fresh , well worth the price and super professional. My go to spot for sushi takeout 5
I had New Ho King delivered.  I did not/do not/do not plan to go to UT.  Those things said, and understanding there may be some ambiance-related pieces I am missing, the food was not so good although delivery service in both depth of menu (its like a road map of food....just keeps on unfolding) as well as open hours was impressive.  I would not totally rule out ordering here again...but it's going to have to be pretty late at night and probably a push between being conscious or passed out when the food arrives. 3
We decided to try this gem this past Saturday night. What a find! The ambience is fantastic - I felt like I was in NYC. Food was equally as good. I had the filet mignon with carmelized onion risotto (amazing) and my husband had the seafood bouillabaisse, which he loved. I really like that their entrees change each day in order to provide the freshest food. It also allows the chef to be creative and mix up the dishes. Sadly, we didn't get a chance to enjoy the lounge next door as it was reserved for a party, but it looks fantastic. I'm looking forward to going back! 5
No liquor, had very good hot sauce, made me have the toots after but all Mexican food does lol. I would give this place a try if you're looking for a chillPlace to eat it but you can also get out of quick. 3
I think it's too expensive for the type of food served. I've been there a couple of time and food is ok. Service is good and I guess it takes the usual time time prepare food as any other Mexican restaurant. Not bad for the family. 2
My husband and I stopped for Saturday brunch and although the decor and waiter were welcoming, the quality of the food was disappointing...particularly after reading some of the rave reviews. We both had the lobster eggs Benny and the sauce was very good...but the lobster was overcooked and dry while the mango for the salsa was under-ripe, too crunchy and bitter.  It lacked brightness and flavour. Also, there were large amounts of grounds in my coffee...which was just off putting. 2
This particular location had a lot of their products however, lacked the service you would expect from these places. Walking in, there were two employees standing at the entrance and soon as they saw us, decided that we were not worth their time. Another one did smile at me later but didn't offer any help or assistance voluntarily rather stood there looking beyond the entrance door. Probably waiting for a more rich looking customer.We walked around and found quite a few items we wanted, but no one offered to help even after seeing that we were looking and holding so many different products. This didn't necessarily make us angry, rather disappointed that the workers feel as if they own the brand rather than work for it. We did purchase a few items, a wallet and a cashmere sweater, but didn't feel that happy forking over our money. Whereas if you go across the street to Chanel, could spend thousands of dollars and feel triumphant because of their impeccable service and zeal to help their customers. I don't really recommend this place unless you truly need something from here that you can't get at Holt's. 2
Best Steak house, went there for Father's day dinner, all of the food from appetizers and  salads,  to main course and side dishes were all amazing. The service was superb, our waiter went out of his way to make sure everything was perfect .  Also, the bar makes you any drink that you want! Highly recommend this place! 5
Im an average height guy 6', and I get into a comfortable position in seat g13 and there's a stupid piece of glass blocking half of the screen. The glass has no purpose except to block the screen. Remove it or I would never come back here again 3
This is a great gem in the South Side. Because of the location, parking can be an issue. We were seated upstairs and liked the decor. We started with the polenta with brussel sprouts which was outstanding and the mozzarella with was good, but not nearly as good as the polenta. I would pass on the mozzarella the next time we return. For our main course course, we had a half order of rabbit and the braciole - which I loved! It was so tender and the sauce was great. The issue was we also had ordered greens and beans, which did not appear with the meal. We thought maybe it was coming as a next course, until she gave us the dessert menu. When we asked about the greens and beans she looked confused that they had not been delivered. She apologized and had them packed to go. I was a bit surprised to find that they were still on the bill. For dessert I had the hazelnut mousse. We will return for sure. 4
Ordered the Peking Duck.  The waitress brought it out to show you the whole duck before carving it up.  When they brought out the sides that accompany the duck, I was disappointed that there is a huge disproportion of wraps compared to the carved duck skin, I mean almost 5 duck skins to 1 wrap, like they weren't making enough profit off you so they intentionally give you less wraps because you will ask for more and they charge you for more wraps - thus my 2 stars and not 3 for my review for this point.  Other restaurants don't charge you when you ask for more wraps!  Taste wise it wasn't any better than other restaurants I tried duck.  Their dishes other than duck are a better choice as it's heavy on flavour and sauce typical of northern Chinese cuisine.  Second, typical of some Chinese restaurants and this one is no exception, they don't take credit cards.  I'll go elsewhere for these 2 reasons when I'm in the mood to have duck 2
I rented a car from National, Las Vegas airport location, on 06 May. I needed the car for one day. I did not purchase any extras including their insurance. The only exception to that was a few extra dollars which exempted me from buying gas when I returned the car. I was about one hour late in returning the car. They told me that there was a grace period and I wouldn't be charged. The car was the cheapest they have, my request. Bottom line the total cost was around $30.00 but when I received my credit card bill the total was $109.94? I don't like doing business with people who cheat and I'll no longer get a car from National. By the way I didn't get to walk down the isle and pic my car, they brought the car to me. 2
I LOVED my experience at R Salon. Cool atmosphere and nice people. Kenzie was sweet and gave the best head massage EVER!! I loved the results-she did exactly what I hoped she would do with my hair. I didn't want anything but they also have coffee, lemonade, tea, and snacks for their customers!! 5
I highly recommend Arizona Air Experts. I use them personally and have referred them to numerous clients over the years. They are honest and trustworthy. You can't go wrong with Caleb and you won't be taken advantage of, like some of the other HVAC companies out there. 5
Filet sliders - goodTomato soup & Brie sandwhich - mehSurf & Turf (shrimp, chorizo & tomato) covered in a salsa verse - excellente 4
UTTER DISAPPOINTMENT... place an order for a medium sushi/sashimi party tray to arrive and find out that the order was missed... they left 3 people who worked overtime on a Thursday night starved and hungry. To add insult to injury, they shrugged it off noting that they didn't receive the order when I have a call record on my phone... totally unacceptable! here's the best part... THEY WERENT EVEN BUSY :((((( 1
Ordered delivery, and the food was great. There is a $20 minimum, so expect to place a big order. Customer Service: The woman on the phone was extremely rude. Beyond a confrontational tone, she basically hung up on me. After I spent 20 dollars, of course. 3
The best 'snowflake' I've ever tasted! It's like heaven in a bowl. Oh and the owner was the nicest person you will ever meet! He made us a sample of their pong shake and it was really delicious! I would definitely come back and try other flavors and will get all my friends to try them. 5
I am one not to write reviews but since I have plenty of time on my hands waiting here I decided why not. Well if you plan on coming here on New Year's Eve for dinner expect to wait 2 hours !!! We were initially told 1 hour and 20 mins so we decided to accept it, but it has now been 2 hours and we still haven't been seated. I just don't want others to get the wrong impression I don't appreciate when restaurants tell you a certain time but then it extends way over. Once you have invested an hour and 20 mins you just keep waiting I sure hope the steaks are good. So once again expect the minimum of 2 hours 3
I have been going to this place frequently for the last 1 and half years and the food was great until recently.  The last few times I ordered take out food and I always find the curries highly diluted with water, samosas fried in old oil and their signature biriyani not flavorful at all.  The last time I ordered take out food from there, I even found a piece of meat in my veggie curry!! Like others have mentioned, the service is poor, the place is highly understaffed and not so friendly staff either.The place used to be known for its flavorful, cheap food but sadly the quality has degraded over the last few months... 2
What a great gem! I recently had a smoked salmon, poached egg breakfast that was out of this world. The flavors were perfectly balanced and the portions were just right. The price was what I expected and I will definitely be back. 5
The steak Burrito Chico (smaller version of the Grande) is amazing.  The guacamole is disappointing.  The service is friendly and the prices are dirt cheap.  Definitely a bargain and quite tasty. 4
My daughter's friend visited this salon on April 23 for a haircut and color change.  She was a brunette and was interested in a much lighter color.  She is now orange.  After numerous attempts to correct the color, she left feeling ugly.  Her hair is fried and she has to live with a horrible experience that should never have happened.  The stylists are not only inexperienced, but also unprofessional.  They harassed the young girl continuously during the appointment.  The "manager" refused to discuss the situation.  For $220 the problem should have been corrected.  I strongly suggest that you consider this salon seriously before having anything done or anyone work on your hair. 1
UPDATERe-rating after a year. I don't know, the ramen just wasn't impressive. With their high price, I don't see any value anymore.I've tried and were disappointed with many Ramen restaurants here in Toronto. I think I can give 5 star to this one :-) I had the Tonkotsu (Otokoaji) and the soup was fatty and salty and just the way it's supposed to be. And the noodle is the thin type (like angel hair pasta) which is typical and authentic noodle for the tonkotsu soup.Yes, I agree with others that I wish egg came with it without extra charge and wish it were a bit cheaper, but I'll come back. Poke salad was good, too. I'm curious to try other dish on the menu. Keep up the good work, Ryoji! 3
Very nice independent coffee shop near old town Scottsdale.  Usually some great jazz playing on the radio (they have live music too) and it a nice quiet and open feeling space.  Friendly staff - definitely recommend.  It's 'attached' to a church but don't worry - it's independent and nobody has attempted convert me ;) 5
I stayed at the Delta for 4 nights. The first night was terrible, the next 3 were fine. When I first arrived I noticed a piece of toilet paper left in the toilet, and when I flushed it overflowed. The water seeped into the carpet outside the bathroom. At this point I was almost late for my meeting, so notified the front desk and left. When I returned, the bathroom had been cleaned and an industrial fan put in the room to dry the carpet. There was no mention of moving me to a different room until I returned to the desk, voiced my displeasure, and asked to be moved. I was relocated to an 'upgraded' room at no cost. I'm not sure what these 'upgrades' were, but I suppose it was a bit bigger. At least it was clean. Like others have said, the TV was surprisingly small.What I like about this hotel was the location and price. Very close to where I needed to be and ideal for downtown shopping at the Eaton Centre etc. As well, I paid $68 Cdn on Hotwire and was happy with that. I will probably return if I have a meeting in the same location as it was a decent place overall and very convenient. 3
So I went here on a Friday night after work just looking to eat something quick before heading out that night. I got a burger, fries and drink and it came to like $15 lol. Ok so with that price I'm hoping this is going to be a really good meal. Wrong. I got a some kinda bacon cheddar burger and it took 15 minutes to make. Employees didn't really seem to care. Then it turns out the smart cook mixed up my 4oz burger with someone else's 6oz. Then the sandwich lady said she'll just switched the patty's and rubbed a bunch of shit off the burger with paper towel even though I told her not to (YEAH, SWEET). Overall, it's just another burger joint that thinks they're hot shit but they're not 1
This shop is great if you have a honda or acura. I found them before I moved here from my specialist in Arizona, who I used for about 10 years.james is straight up and gets stuff done fast and cheap. Anytime I leave the car for more than hours they hook up free stuff like buffing the LED lights(much brighter after), rain x windshield, etc. 4
It took me a long time to find a great Mexican Restaurant in Scottsdale, so I was very excited to find Frank and Lupe's!   The chips and salsa (one of my favorite parts of the meal) are delicious and I have been satisfied with them every visit.  I also have never been disappointed in the food.  I have to agree with some previous reviews that the service is terrible.  At times it seems like you need to beg to even eat there and they are never friendly to the customers!  Improved service would make this a 5 star review! 3
Ate on the patio as we had our dog with us, which was nice. Our server was very attentive. The food was not that good. Ok it was awful. The pretzel bun on my breakfast sandwich was very greasy and the hash browns were so salty they were almost inedible. They also tasted like a nasty cigar. My girlfriend's Beat (?) sandwich had way too much aioli sauce on it and the aioli tasted like bad body odor. I'm not a picky eater and I literally had a hard time swallowing the bite I took. Almost made me puke. Even our house coffees weren't good, tasted burnt. How do you mess up hash browns? We will not be returning. 2
Consumers Beware...Overpriced service is what the Sunny Plumber amounts to. Any company that charges from $1600 to over $3000 for a tank water heater is insane.  If you're looking to get ripped off give them a call, they'll be more than happy to show up with a smile and stick it to you where the Sunny Plumber don't shine.  I saved A LOT going elsewhere getting the same equipment installed. I'm not trying to bash, just being honest.Good Luck! 1
Worst service I've EVER had in my life! Server did not care about service at all. No server to begin with. Had to flag someone down and he was upset that we did that. No one checked on us through out the meal and when it was time to pay they held my card for 15 min. Worst service of my life. 1
Food quality is not what it use to be, we had nachos and the stew. Been going here every Jan for 5 years, don't know if we will be back. 2
I've never had a bad meal here.  And while I wouldn't say I've had a mind-blowingly great meal here, everything I've had has been a well-executed, slightly-upscale take on the "supper club" food I grew up with.  Well, one exception on that "mind-blowing" thing - the fried cheese curds are amazing. It's a feat to elevate something as heavy as fried cheese to a crispy, transcendent little morsel, but they do an excellent job (and offer a wide variety of tasty dipping sauces.  I prefer the smoked paprika).Breakfast, lunch, dinner - always solid, always delicious.   Breakfast/brunch here is a hidden gem - fresh scrambled eggs, house-cured smoked salmon, granola with Door county cherries, and other takes on brunchy classics make appearances, and there's even a few actual good options for vegetarians.I've always had fresh ingredients, excellent preparation and seasoning, generous but not overwhelming portions.  Oh, and they have one of the better Friday fish fries in town, especially the walleye.  I've heard their Saturday prime rib is delicious, too, but I've never actually been able to get a table on a Saturday night to try it.And therein lies the restaurant's main problem.  The Old Fashioned is a victim of its own success.  Even after the expansion into the old L'Etoile space, the restaurant is seemingly always uncomfortably crowded, loud, and the waits for a table are often unreasonably long.  If you do choose to wait, you can either pack into the bar area, stand outside, or try to cram yourself into the tiny vestibule.  It's not really something they can do terribly much about (although I do wish I didn't feel like I was running a gauntlet past the bar to get to the restrooms), but it is uncomfortable enough that when they say "it'll be about an hour wait for a table" I usually go elsewhere. 4
I haven't been here in awhile but I do remember I would get my Chocomaina body scrub and butter here. It was the 3 for 33 deal, absolutely love The Body Shop products my other fav was their perfume mist and the Scent Love Ect. The customer service was great too Joel helped me pick out everything. 5
Brought my Mesa Lonestar in for repair a while ago, not only did they take the time to diagnose and fix my amp problem, they also took the time to sit with me for a while and help me dial in my tone better. Quick turn around and friendly service. 4
The lineup wasn't as bad as people mentioned, there is certainly worse waits for Brunch in Calgary - for good reason.Only thing good about this place is their coffee - which isn't even their ownI ordered the pulled pork hash and it was bland. Meat was dry. They try to be Calgary hipster with sweet potatoes, but it's just not that great. The onions were cut like the chef was being lazy - which overpowered the dish. Same thing happened with my gf's granny smith grilled cheese sandwich. One would think that a tart granny smith infused grilled cheese would have sweet caramelized onions, not barely cooked almost raw sharp onions almost an inch thick! It was like eating a raw onion sandwich with some melted cheese.I would choose OEB, Galaxie or Diner Deluxe over this place any day. 2
First, the owner is not customer friendly, she did not seem to care at all. Second, the prices are outrageous, $3.10 for a donut and $4.50 for a pizza bun which were good but nothing exceptional...Not impress at all...Will not go back... 1
3.5 stars, but I'm not rounding up. The food was pretty good but for the price I'd much rather go to Il Mulino. Service was a little spotty but I also didn't realize this was such an uppity place. I rolled in with my bandanna and Kid Rock t-shirt, this got our party immediately seated in the back room by ourselves, ha ha. I might come back for happy hour but even with a $100 off coupon it was still too much. 3
Came with friends to celebrate wedding anniversary, we liked the food and the wine (great selection), but what made us give a 5 stars was the service from our waiter Pedro. He helped us get started with the tapas menu, great suggestions and the way he handled the wine made the meal complete. Would for sure visit again and we hope Pedro still there. 5
This was my second time eating Ethiopian food and my friend recommended this place. We shared three main dishes amongst the three of us. I enjoyed having a taste of all the food but I felt that I was mostly filled up on oil and not substance. Also there wasn't much difference between the dishes; a few stood out though it got tiring at the end. I did enjoy the bread though; it was nice and moist with a little bit of sour taste. (like sourdough bread?)Service wasn't very good as we waited a long time for water, ordering and the bill. The tablecloths are also pretty gross since there's leftover food other people spilled all over it.It was a good experience for trying new foods but I'd rather go somewhere else to fill up and leave a smaller dent in my wallet. 2
Ok food. I guess, given the concept,  I expected a bit of interaction with the server. That was minimal. I even told the hostess 'i wait tables back home, so he can really be a dick to us' and we got a basic schpiel from the server and a dropped check.  Not really any interaction, which I feel like is the point of the brand. 3
Good Servants does an okay job when they show up on time.  I have been using them for about six months now, and I have finally had enough.  They are very disorganized about scheduling.  They have shown up at my house to clean when I never called them.   Each time I had them come clean, they were well over 45 minutes late.  The last time I was supposed to have a cleaning, they were an hour late.  I called and the woman said they were finishing up another house and would be there in 15-20 minutes.  Unfortunately, my time is too valuable and I will be looking for another service. 2
I've been to this firehouse a few times recently and have been pretty pleased. The first few times the service has been a bit slow and lacking personality. However I took my wife with me this last visit and there was a bar tender with a broken foot who had us almost in tears from laughing so hard. There were a few older gentlemen a few seats down from us and she was joking with them and chatting about their family and her kids. This bar now seems to be more of a local place to hang out with good company rather than a typical sports bar that you just go to from time to time.  If there were a better selection of craft beers the firehouse would have 5 stars easily!  Not even a decent IPA! The bartender was knowledgeable about beer however the bar had nothing good to offer.  We were  also introduced to the eli steak which was delicious! It is not on the menu, which makes no sense to us but we will be back for it! 4
Mixed experience.  Sausages and home fries were cold.  Server seemed genuinely upset.  In summary:  Service? Great!  Food?  Not so much. 1
There wasn't anything special about the food. We went to have all you can eat sushi and didn't feel like we got what we paid for. The service was average. The food literally took 50 mins to come out. Come on the place has a 1 hour time limit and took that long to serve. Basically we only got to order 1 round and that's it. The fish also wasn't really fresh and was obvious.  I felt the place was a rip off. Not everything was horrible, the restaurant has a nice interior design and atmosphere. But other than that theres way more better sushi restaurant better than this in las Vegas. 1
The service was fine and responsive to our needs.  The shrimp with peppers was good and had some kick due to the peppers.  The filet was good but not great and the loaded potato was also tasty.  I would eat here again and recommend but the meat quality is not top shelf. 3
They have some delicious mulitas!!! I've been coming here for over a decade and the last 2 times I had bad experience . The first time was they but way too much ice on my raspado and charged me extra for additional fruit and they didn't put the extra fruit . Btw everything is expensive here which I don't mind paying . I came another time after that and the pineapple was bitter, the mango was old and squishy and the strawberries were sour , I am so disappointed . Their raspado game is weak now . So I will be looking for a new raspado place . But I will still keep coming for the food 2
Unfortunately I can only give Wolfley's a 3 for a few reasons. Went there for lunch and while its nice they have an outside area (duh), the seats were a little dirty and that was a slight turn off. The menu while large, almost comes off as too overwhelming and mediocre to make it worth its size. I settled on the BBQ Chicken Salad which was actually really good, the only problem was it was the only thing on the menu I was even interested in. Big pro's go to the wait staff though as our waitress was sweet as can be and checked in often. Overall just kinda...eh. 3
Drove in from California for the Thanksgiving holiday and ended up with a screw in my tire. Dropped it off for them to fix it and when we went back, we were handed the keys and the employee said "Happy Thanksgiving".  He did not charge us anything for the repair or for putting the spare tire back under the vehicle. Very nice employee with a nice attitude. Would definitely recommend this business. 5
This Company is awful!!!  I have been with Extra Space Storage for 2 years.  I started with a 5x10 for $54.  They have jacked up the price every 6 months and just received a noticed they now want $75.  I have never been late on a payment and to jack good paying customers is just wrong!  Now this company is going to have an empty extra space and taking my business elsewhere.   I will never refer this corporate company to anyone!!  Have to end my review now so I can call and reserve a Uhaul.  Unreal! 1
I don't think I will be going back to this place. I was there for over an hour just for a wash and blow dry. And the prices were clearly marked on the pricing board. The lady who did my hair said "oh they put you in for something different" and charged me extra. I was so annoyed that I just paid and left. Also I wanted a specific hair style and was told they didn't know how to achieve it. Less time chatting and more time perfecting your craft and this should help! It was beachy waves I asked for, come on! I did not have a pleasant experience and will NOT be a returning customer, famous hair... I think not. 1
Aw man, I really wanted to love this place. Got lost as mapquest told me to turn into 6th street but it's just off of 6th. When I walked in, felt like I was in the 70's. Pretty small space but cute interior with classic oldies playing in the background. Ordered the root beer float, nutella, fruit loops, smores, bacon fritter, mexican, blackberry, and lemon meringue donuts with a salted caramel almond milk latte all for about $25. The root beer float, nutella, smores, and bacon fritter were pretty good (not pictured: the fritter and nutella because I ate them before I snapped a pic); everything else, I'd pass on. The coatings on the donuts were very melty and I wasn't too fond of the fillings in them. It was runny! Tip: have a bunch of napkins on you while eating them because I spilled all sorts of fillings on myself and had to lick my fingers off. They also have their own homemade syrups for their coffee drinks (salted caramel, vanilla, and hazelnut) but the latte I got was just alright.Overall, cool spot, friendly staff, and okay donuts that are on the pricier side. I'll give it another try but for now, I still prefer pinkbox and ronald's. 3
First time eating authentic Cuban food. We will be coming back for sure next time in Vegas. Try the tasting plate which has three meats, salad, platanos and black beans and rice.  My wife had the Cubano sandwhich with pork. My son had the pollo y arroz. The portions are large for my gordo friends like Juan V.and Trevor T. 5
BFG was amazing! Fellow yelper Ramil B. introduced me to this place and it was awesome. BFG stands for Baked, Fried, Grilled which are the 3 options for how to have your chicken strips. They have a variety of sauces to accompany including "Wasabi Cream." Sides for the chicken are fries, grilled vegetables, garlic bread and mac&cheese. There's something for those who come just to stuff their face and something for the more health conscious.The owner, Jin, is super friendly and he definitely makes it his mission to have a relationship with each of his customers.The artwork on the walls are cute and inviting.This is a great mom&pop shop. A definite cane's replacement. In fact, they are even cheaper than cane's! I LOVE THAT!Speaking of canes, I could choose BFG's garlic bread over Cane's texas toast ANY DAY, HANDS DOWN. The garlic bread is smaller, but it tastes way better.Only downfall, it's nowhere near my house. HAHA. 4
I've been here a few times with my family and there's really nothing for me to "complain" about.... their service is on point, if not, gets better every time we eat here, the taste of the food is always consistent, and the serving you get for the price is great. I've read plenty of comments about the service..... maybe you guys should make sure your staff is consistent with the service? I'd really hate to come here one day and end up with a server who doesn't take care of us. 5
When I learned that Anise Cafe was closed I about died! I'm sure a lot of people felt the same way. When I found out they just changed name and new location I was jumping off the wall! Why? It's simple The food is delicious, outstanding service!, pleasant environment!  I am now a happy happy person! 5
This is one of Las Vegas' hidden gems.  Unfortunately it's become well known (which is why I didn't give it 5 stars).The deep fried whole lobster is nothing short of incredible.  Definitely my favorite Thai Food in Las Vegas 4
REALLY WANT TO LIKE YOU SAUCY. You are getting 1 star though. Only for the beer. Living in Hingetown I was super excited to find out we were getting a Brewery that also crafted pizza!  I keep trying to give Saucy chances and they keep failing me. July 5 opening day we went in and my first impression was WOW! I liked the look and feel of the space. I sampled all the beers on tap. Really like the IPA and the Hefe. Got the Bees Knees pizza and was very impressed. At this point I was thinking YES, this is going to be my go to spot. Second and third times in this place got a bit peculiar. A day later rolled in here after work. It was packed and the ordering areas were chaos. People seemed to be confused on the beer and pizza ordering lines. The bartenders had trouble pouring beers. There was no seating anywhere. You would think for such a big space they would have better usage of it. Upstairs is nice and open but there is only a few seating options. This puzzles me? Saucy has beer and pizza. These two things require inviting comfortable seating areas. I can tell they tried at this but failed miserably. This is not a place for locals. It's a place for the masses. They want to herd you in like cattle. Get in line. Order beer. Drink beer in a corner while waiting for the pizza you ordered in a separate line. Then shove pizza in your mouth as quick as you can because there is nowhere to sit and enjoy it. Worst part of all is consistency. I've ordered the same pizza 3 times. Always turns out different.  One time my 12 inch pizza was only 9 inches. How does that even happen? One night after work I went in just for beers. I really do like the beers here. The "core" beers weren't even all available. The ASAP IPA and B. F. Hefe weren't on draft!!! Another day I placed a pizza order and got a text it was ready. Went to the counter and long and behold no pizza. They said the order was entered wrong and I will be getting a second text when the pizza is ready. This process took roughly 45 minutes entirely. Overall Saucy is not very welcoming and there pizza blows. Hingetown is a small Pocket of Ohio City that tends to feel more like a community. Saucy has a West 6th / Townhall vibe that doesn't quite fit in our neighborhood. I will be across the street at Jukebox like always wondering what could have been. 1
Beautiful space tucked inside the Tower Suites. It backs up against the pool and has seating on the patio. Ate lunch there during March Madness. Service was excellent, the wine list was very good and had several excellent and rare half bottles. My Kobe burger was competent, not memorable. The Old Bay Seasoned fries tasted great but lacked some crispness. Highlight of lunch was seeing Steve Wynn at an adjacent table. Slight recommendation. CTS (Consider the source). 3
We had the grilled salmon special and greek salad with chicken it was good .  The service was excellent.  I m hoping they will serve breakfast.  Not many family own restaurants in Huntersville that serve breakfast.  Will be back for the potroast dinner special next time. 3
Great beer selection. Food is tasty, but nothing to write home about. Getting a seat can be a problem during lunch or dinner time particularly on weekends. 3
We're not going back for a long time.  There was crap, bits of food and paper, of one sort or another under the tables that we could see from sitting on the patio.  The tables weren't all that clean.  Our waitress dropped my salad order on the ground and cleaned up only half of it.  She left the rest there until half way through the meal when she came back to our table to refill our waters and I pointed it out to her.  She cleaned up so little of what was still on the floor that when we left, I put my napkin down on the mess she couldn't be bothered to clean up so that we wouldn't step in it on our way out.  They weren't busy this evening; she certainly had the time to clean the floor.  Cleanliness isn't a priority on the patio; it makes one wonder what the kitchen is like.  Not cleaning up her spill lacked courtesy and was just a bit of an insult.  The food was just meh. 2
I get take out there 3 or 4 times a month every month  since the store opened a couple of years ago.  I've never had a bad sandwich and never met an unplesant employee.  Clean & polite & decent prices. 4
I was especially impressed with this restaurant! The food was great and fairly priced and the service was very attentive and friendly as well. I ordered chicken satimbocca with vegetables and it was delicious. The lemon chicken Greek soup was also a favorite. 4
I'm sorry, but the only thing authentic about this place is the word China in its name. Yes, I understand it's a chain, but not a large one so I would suggest spicing up your kitchen and serving less corporate chinese. I will give a better rating for the sole fact that I do like their lettuce roles but that's it. 2
Went here to see what the hype what about this place, I wasn't that great like I thought it would be. Their cupcakes were okay, just way too much frosting which made it too sweet. However, they do have a variety of different flavors to choose from but they just need to lay off the frosting a tad bit. 2
In & Out is a hamburger at it's best.  I have tried more expensive places, but for taste and value you cannot beat a Double-Double.  Tastes better than anythign from Habbit.  Fresh taste and great fries.  Off menu items are great, and worth the search on the web.  Go Animal style on your burger, and you will not be disappointed. 5
Seviche has a lively, colorful atmosphere that added to the dining experience. Our server was very attentive and knew the menu very well. She was able to offer many suggestions. The rest of the wait staff was also helpful when it came to seating us, turning the air down, everything.Served tapas style, the food is conducive to sharing and ordering lots of little things. We tried for all ranges of the menu and thought the dishes had interesting flavor profiles, were prepared well, and tasted great.The seviche section allows you to choose a fish and a style of preparation -- they are delicious! The filet mignon was also a wonderful cut of meat.Mojitos are a bit pricey at $9 a drink for the small glasses they are in, but are delicious all the same. 4
Food portions are very small, and very overpriced.  Was underwhelmed with the tacos, meatballs ,guac and cevice. Nothing special. However the Mojitos were delivious and the patio is lovely. Will be back for a drink only. 3
I've been at this location a few times. Great food. The servers are okay---not great. But I just wish the place was bigger. Sometimes you can't get a table to get some dinner. 4
We were driving by and saw their $2.99 lunch special sign.  Since it was lunch time and we were hungry, we decided to stop in.  It was about 11:30 on a Friday morning and surprisingly there place was populated by a bunch of men drinking and eating.  (No one works in AZ?)We grabbed a couple menus on the way in, but quickly caught on that we needed their "lunch specials" menu - which we went and got.The bartender/server/cook? was the only one in the place waiting on all of us.  So, the wait was a little much considering.The $2.99 lunch special was a hamburger and a drink.  So, I ordered the 1/2 tuna sandwich with side salad for $3.99 and my hubby got the fajita roll up for $5.99  (drinks come with).  Our lunch bill was just a little over $10 for the two.    Food was o.k.  Nothing spectacular, but just simple good food.  The place is clean, lots of TVs and arcade games, a small stage area (for a band or karaoke (?)) and ample free parking.  The only suggestion I would have is maybe hire another person to help out.  Although probably quite capable (and possibly the owner), one person just isn't enough.Will we return?  Maybe, maybe not. 3
One of the best massages I've ever had.... I walked away feeling like melted butter....it's far but compared to the other not so great massages I've had in Vegas it's worth it! Kandis is the best in las vegas 5
Steve and the guys were great! I had two dents in the car that were really bugging me, but not enough to pay body shop prices.  So I gave these guys a shot. Boy am I glad I did. The dents are gone. Service was fast and friendly. I would highly recommend their services. 5
The whole smell and flavour are exactly how it tasted when I was in China, although the noodles tasted a little bit harder than I thought, I still think it's a good dish 4
The food is pretty ok here.. But I found part of a clear plastic bag in my food once. 2
Just ate at this restaurant and I was extremely disappointed. This is the first review I have written. I read reviews that were good, and I should not have believed them!  I ordered  the open faced chili cheeseburger and that was a mistake. I asked the waitress if the chili was homemade and she said no. She told me I should have gone with the bacon cheeseburger. Fries weren't the fresh cut kind and the chocolate shake was bland. 1
Thoroughly unprofessional ownership who will not pay their bills. They leech off suppliers to compensate for their inability to operate their business. If you want to support that, go right ahead. I'll take my money elsewhere. 1
OK DONT GET ME STARTED ON POPEYES. THIS PLACE IS AMAZING AND THE BEST.I came here 5:50 on a Friday night and I went to drive through. It was a 45 minute wait which totally made me evaluate my decision on coming here next time. Though I think I will wait till the hype goes down to come back. Though the wait was worth it. The chicken is delicious and crispy and everything you want. I had the $7.99 2 combo meal which include 2 chickens, a biscuit which is my favourite thing there because it's buttery and matches perfectly with the chicken, a choice of side, and a drinkHonestly this was so very good and I would come back on the biscuits alone. I FUCK WITH THIS SO MUCH.  If you had just eaten KFC since now, this will change your life because it's WAY BETTER. the only thing that sucks is the waitHonestly its a good place to go but it is a tiny location and I could say how I alone could speed up the drive though but I'm not the manager. The food is great, service is polite, Popeyes is a good US branch, and blood is red. It's just the facts 4
Very disappointed.  Considering the price was way too expensive, we expected much more in quality.  Service was not good nor bad.    Small burgers and serving size for fries was worse. 1
Good food and the manager there rocks. She walked around and made it a point to talk to everyone. The building however can get a little crowded but it's a hotspot for Gilbert so it's to be expected. Overall it's a cute place to take the family! 4
Very chill atmosphere, beer us of usual trendy quality. Service is very relaxed and quick. Food is a very unique taste from the UK. Much like a meat pie but a pasty. I recommend to all in the mood for something new and fun. 4
I hate to leave bad reviews but.....I was a member for many, many years. When I signed up I was under contract for 2 (or 3?) years for which I couldn't break unless I paid a huge fee. Regardless, I've been a long time customer, way longer than my original contact term. So somehow, much to my surprise, I was informed I've signed a contract in perpetuity (?) And I didn't inform them in the proper way that I was moving, which evidently involved some incredibly complex written procedure (verbal isn't good enough). Consequently, they say I still owe for my last month, which I don't agree. Regardless, they sent the disputed amount of $40.00 to their collection agency! Yes, forty dollars is worth the franchise losing a customer for life. This issue occurred several years ago. Every year I get a call from their collectors, every year I tell them where they can put their $40.00! Just beware of this business. Be smart, do NOT give them your social security number. Better yet, go to another gym. 1
Mucho Burrito is Chipotle's bland Canadian cousin.By "bland" I don't mean not spicy. They will give you habanero sauce if you want it. But their pork, chicken and beans are devoid of any seasoning. And their veggies are often undercooked, often making raw green pepper the dominant flavour in a burrito.In this location in particular, watch out for them being skimpy with the cheese. They'll fill the scoop, and then quickly tap 1/3rd of it on to your burrito. Watch out for dry, crunchy white rice as well.I appreciate that Mucho Burrito exists, and except for the price it's a better option than Taco Time or Taco Bell. But it's not all that good. 2
First of all, the food here is amazing. I usually get a salad with the classic sweet pork. The sweet pork is to die for, it's always delicious. They put a tortilla on the bottom of your salad and the tortillas (which are being made fresh in front of you) are absolutely delicious. I crave this salad nonstop and have been going to Cafe Rio about twice a week for the last month or so. This place gets three stars because of the inconsistent service. This is a new location and it's obvious they are still working out the kinks to get things going smoothly. My biggest complaint is that most of the time, getting down the line is very slow. People starting their orders often don't know what they want or are asking a lot of questions to the ONE person getting their food going. I've been 2-3 back in the line and waited there over 20 minutes just to get a to go order. This would be unheard of for most fast food places and comparable places like Chipotle, who have figured out how to get people in and out in minutes. Then, once you've made it through the slow moving line to order, there is usually only one cashier and there is another line a few people deep to wait in. I often wonder why they don't have two registers going to move people faster. At this location, I've seen people in line say something to the manager, who will open the other register but I just don't think customers should be requesting this. Often, their cashiers seem unsure of the flow and things get mixed up at the end of the food line as well. Overall, I will continue to keep coming here because the food is so delicious but I will admit to dreading the inevitable wait I will have to endure to get it. 3
Not only did they deliver before time super great flavor and very fresh thank you!!!! 5
Asked if a restroom was available at 04:23 am after my shift was told by clerk to walk to a casino though I was waiting for the bus I asked the man what if im a customer he said I told you buddy we have no restroom I asked how do you use the restroom then you hold it he said nothing don't conduct business here. 1
I was out looking for a place for a late lunch in rural Geauga County, and found that the pickins are slim.  Mangia's entry on here was pretty good, so we decided to check it out.  I have no complaints with the service, but the food is mediocre at best.  I had the eggplant parmagiana and my partner had the chicken parm.  Both dishes were essentially pre-formed, pre-breaded patties covered by a thin layer of marinara sauce and a slice of provalone that was placed under a heating element.  Both meals came with a side of pasta, which, had it been a steak, would have been great because it was tender and you could cut it with a fork.   But it wasn't a steak ... it was pasta. And pasta shouldn't be "fork tender."Don't get me wrong, it didn't taste bad ... it was perfectly edible, but it's not anything an Italian might recognize as food of the motherland. 2
Pretty cool place.  A little hole in the wall bar.  Had a fun time with friends but we had to move tables because they were about to start trivia night.  Man those guys take that seriously.  It was packed with trivia people!!! 4
I have been a patient at FHDC for approx. 10 years. When I first started going here I lived a block away from the office. I have since moved and for the past 3 years have lived over 55 miles away, yet I continue to receive care from this wonderful ensemble of professionals. Every member of the staff is friendly, organized, professional and accommodating. Dr. Prost is a talented, dedicated to his craft, embraces technological advances in dentistry all the while being a relatable, down to earth person who gives back to the community through various philanthropic pursuits. My hygiene services are handled by Tiffani, I don't even know where to begin describing how wonderful she is. Tiffani is friendly and inviting, pays attention to every detail and is ever encouraging good at home care. I can't imagine putting my dental health in the hands of anyone other than FHDC. 5
I ordered my first carry out GF meal from Jim 'N' Nick's today. The cashier was new to food allergies, and didn't know many answers to my questions. However, she was eager to learn, asked the chefs, and the manager to be sure she answered all of my GF questions. She found the food allergy listing and walked me through the items available. She went above and beyond to learn about and respect my allergy. There are many GF options available in the meats. Many sides as well. I will eat there again! 5
I ordered chicken fingers, bacon cheese fries & a oreo cookie shake. The delivery took 1 hr & 45 minutes. The food was cold & the fingers were over cooked. The shake was described as a custard ice cream shake but it tasted like crushed ice-milk with that consistency too. If thats a  custard milkshake, which I have eaten, then im a blonde lol...On the plus side was that they put a lot of bacon on the bacon cheese fries. But, thats about it. Needless to say, im never ordering from this place again. 2
I don't understand what all the fuss is about. They're oversized, overpriced sloppy donuts. Nothing new or fancy. Just a fad. 2
This food here is fantastic! My wife and I eat vegetarian most of the time, and this is one of our mainstay restaurants for take-out nights. But don't let the 'vegetarian' label scare you off, this is just damn good Indian food by any standard.Our usual order is the aloo paratha (potato bread), masala dosa (dosa stuffed with spicy potato), and the chana masala (chana dal in a liquidy masala sauce with rice). One order of each of those is enough food to stuff two people, for a total of $18.53+tax+tip. Note that's 1 order of each of those, total, not 1 for each person.I'm docking one star because the service when you eat in is lacklustre to say the least. Most of the time they don't seem to care whether you get water, take your order in any reasonable time, etc.But the food is good enough to keep me coming back again and again for take-out. 4
Good place.  To be honest not worth 48$ for 2 people.  Kind of steep for 10-15 minutes.  Plus the Photo charge.  I know they need to make $ because how many times would a person go back for the same expectations of a chainsaw around the corner (well probably morre than a few).  I just think that if it was cheaper they could attract repeat business.  15$ per person seems reasonable.  Or if they charge $20+ dollars give them a drink ticket at least you will keep them in your establishment drinking.  Overall I did scream a couple times and its a good date spot! 3
We had a great experIence , the waiter was super nice and helpfull, the kids chicken fIngeRs were delicious and so was the chicken pot pie! Salads and soup were fresh and tasty, also the poppy seed little munchkins were yummy!!! 5
This was my first experience eating Ethiopian food.  It was a fun communal experience as our dinner club ate with our hands getting food from the center of the table.  We ordered the combination platter to sample a variety of food which I enjoyed.  My friend had the Ethiopian wine which had a smell that I wasn't use to, but was different to me.  Service was fine and the waitress was friendly.  She educated us on what to order.  I did notice a roach in the bathroom crawling on the sink. I hope they exterminate.  The place is in an old strip mall that doesn't look like the most visually appealing area near the strip, but its a hidden ethnic joint for Las Vegas foodies. 2
Love the vibe, ambiance, and flavors.  California comfort food done right.Great drink menu. It is so nice to feel at home and little details like the luchador masks and the repollo in the tacos make it all come together.  Minus one star for the smokers. 4
Went for dinner Aug 2012 at the roof patio. Food was ok for a pub I guess, standard menu with no surprises and fair dishes. Service was below average. Too many tv sets around for a patio. Small separate place in the back for smokers - not too friendly for a big open patio. Bit overpriced as well - would rather spend that amount of money to go a restaurant trying a new dish or better cooked. Overall average rating although it looks great from the street view. 2
This is one of my favorite restaurants that I crave if I have not been in over a week. The staff is always friendly. I love that they have a punch card. The food is fresh and delicious. I usually attend with my bestie who also loves this place. I have the chicken burrito and it comes with fresh chips and salsa that is so yummy. The price is just right. It can get busy during lunch but that is to be expected with a good place. The environment is open but they also have a nice patio area. Now I am craving it so I will have to go tomorrow. :) 5
For casual tacos and a good drink, head to Barrio in Lakewood. The food is fresh but the service model is a step away from Chipotle. I hated the process for "build your own." Very confusing but maybe because it wasn't explained to us. The server was aloof if not "put out" by us being in her section. Again, don't go for the typical restaurant experience; go for the novelty. 3
This was my first time to Vegas, so I don't have other hotel stays in Vegas to compare it to. We stayed for one night and it was a Saturday. When we arrived we got a M Life card which was pretty quick. Waiting to check into our room at the reservation desk was another story. We waited in line approximately for an hour to check in. That may be typical for Vegas, but I wasn't expecting it. The room was pretty nice, but for the price we paid, I guess I was expecting more. I wasn't to thrilled when it was time to get in the shower. There was only one washcloth and it was two adult guests. I had to use a hand towel to shower with! The shower wasn't very clean and had hair on the wall from a previous guest. Gross! Next time we go, we're going to try out another hotel in the MGM family, but not sure if we will try Mandalay Bay again. 3
My wife and I have been a member of the gym for over 4 years.  While the freeweight area is nice, the powered equipment has gone way downhill over the last 6-8 months.  3 of 4 bikes do not turn on/work at all.  3 of 6 treadmills don't turn on, the 3 that do may or may not incline, and every single treadmill has a ripped seam in the tread, some are to the point of posing the potential of tripping.  1 of 3 ellipticals are out of order and the one that remains is a machine that most avoid after giving it a try, it's just not a good machine.  It's frustrating to know that the $90 per month isn't being used to repair the equipment that is the reason for our membership.  Yes, most of the machines are outdated - but at this point I would be pleased just to have them be functional.I would email the owner but they have no website or email listed anywhere, and when we are there in the off-hours it's just an hourly employee using facebook behind the desk. 2
This is the some of the yummiest Chinese food I've had since moving to AZ, and absolutely the yummiest Chinese delivery I have had since moving here.  I've only found three or four places total that have delivered, and all of them have been mediocre or worse, except for Asia Lee.  Everything I've gotten from them is delicious; last time I ordered Szechuan Beef, Pork Egg Foo Yung, and the free Chicken Fried Rice that comes with any order of $15 or more.  I wasn't a huge fan of the pork that came with the Egg Foo Yung, but the egg patties themselves are savory and delightful.  The Szechuan Beef is my absolute favorite, and it made a great lunch when I reheated it the next day, as welll.  I've never been inside the restaurant, so I can't vouch either way for the last review, but honestly, why would I go to the restaurant when I can have all the yumminess delivered right to my door? 4
If you will look into all of the reviews you will see the same negative feedback in regards to the owner Apollo and the staff who verbally tell you that you can cancel your contract anytime with a 1 month cancellation fee knowing your not going to sit there and read the fine print. Im a man if honesty and integrity and i dont need to lie to get something accomplished. I know that what i say i was told about being able to cancel the contract when i signed my son up and what Fasi will claim they told me is just he said she said, but i have no reason to lie and its not even my reason for needing to cancel.  Its no coincidence that everyone is experiencing the same issues with apollo. Apollo continues to tell people of his extensive background in the medical field and gives his professional medical presumption of your condition to deny cancelling the contract. I have provided a statement from my sons "licenensed" doctor but Apollo is aparently still the higher authority and can deny canceling the contract because he doesnt agree with it. So bottom line is we the consumer have to follow the terms of the contract but apollo can use his judgement wherever he feels necessary. I know that the contract does not require me to see a specialist or to have apollo diagnose any medical issues. I have not stopped payments as i know that will tip things in Apollos favor  and show me breeching on the contract so i continue to pay monthly for nothing because my son cant physically continue. Apollo tries to effectively respond to all these negative comments with politically correct word manuplitation but he cant deny that his opinion on a statement from a licensed physican weather he agrees with it or not, is not a requirement of his contract and i provided what was needed to cancel the contract and continue to have to pay. Lets see what response you have to that Apollo! Or are you now a legal expert as well as a doctor and im giving false information? None of what Apollo responds back with even matters...who needs to know that you used to be a nurse or took some respiratory classes? That has no bearing on YOUR contract. It doesnt state that i need to have my son see multiple specialists or have Apollo the medical expert give his diagnosis and approve it. I just dont understand why he thinks his previous jobs have anything to do with a statement from a liscensed doctor, or why he thinks his opinion supersceeds a statement from a licensed doctor. Apollo claims that he tries everything he can to "work" with people by offering to freeze accounts for a short period of time or transfer the contract to someone else, but those are olny options that benefit him and not the consumer not to mention that canceling the contract is completely within my right having provided what was required. If Apollo thinks this technique of fighting everyone who needs out if a contract is somehow the only way to do or stay in business i feel sorry for him. Responding back to everyone with how much Fasi does for people and the community for many years does and is so positive in every aspect if their business is not fooling anyone. Word DOES get around and your malpractices will be exposed. Sooner or later the wrong person gets mistreated and manuplited, i am that wrong person.This matter is going to small claims court and i will update the results once they have been reached. 1
It gives me no pleasure to write a bad review, but Harrah's deserves it. Today is the second day in a row with no housekeeping. Trash not picked up, no toilet paper, no clean towels, no bed made. My husband called management to tell them and management tried to blame us for "leaving up the 'do not disturb' sign." Nice try, but no, the do not disturb sign was never up. Your housekeeping staff simply forgot us. Two days in a row. A better management response is to apologize profusely for the oversight and to assure us that housekeeping will be dispatched at our convenience. We are long-time Harrah's customers, but I feel that they no longer care about our business. This is supposed to be my vacation and here I am: angry, writing bad Yelp reviews, sitting in a dirty hotel room, waiting for Harrah's mythical housekeeping staff to show up. 1
Found the staff to be rather rude, maybe they are just used to dealing with unsavory people when it comes to complimentary drinks and gaming at the bar. Maybe they are burnt out and need young blood and energy behind their bars. We moved to a little bar across the street next to a liquor store that had some cheap drinks and good bartenders. A real dive, but if you like dives this one is a great find considering the location.   Then made out way to the Cromwell. 2
Yelp stated it was closed Saturday night but it was open. This is a total college bar so if you're over 25 don't bother. Waiting in line just to make it look busy so that was lame. Then 3rd floor smelled like vomit, liquor, and cheap perfume. ..lol over all it was entertaining but I wouldn't go again unless I'm trying to pick up trashed white girls who think they can twerk. 2
Don't order piggy club sandwich it's very bad only ham, bacon, luncheon cost &6.99 No drink! Service Bad !! Portion very very small! Tea time pastes like kids meal! OMG 1
I was on the phone trying to order with Khao San Road for over 30 mins calling back over and over again. No one picked up. Called here they picked up on the third ring took my order and had it ready in 15mins with a smile on their faces. ^ that is service worth  great job! Will defiantly be coming here more often. 5
I have always wanted to try this place based on awesome reviews on their breakfast from friends and family, especially the French toast.  Finally stopped in this morning around noon for lunch and was kind of underwhelmed by the whole place.Typical 15 to 20 minute wait for a table but noticed everything looked very classy, with white tablecloths and Specialty menus because of it being a Saturday. Talked to the waitress and she commented how they are trying a new thing with the specialty menus and going for a more decadent feel. Not really what I was looking for since I had two small kids with me, but we decided to give it a try anyway.They did not have many options on the specialty menu for the children so we paid $16 for a waffle and chicken for them. We could get ala carte items on the side , so we ordered a side of scrambled eggs.For the adults, we ordered the strip steak,  asparagus and gruyere scrambled eggs with hollandaise sauce.Everything was delivered to our table and looked very well plated. The waitress was slow to fill our glasses and we never got our side of scrambled eggs. By the time they came we were basically done with our breakfast. The chicken and waffles was very tasty and the kids enjoyed it.The steak and eggs was disappointing. It was two very small slivers of medium cooked steak, with a few half pieces of asparagus over the scrambled eggs. What was supposed to be hollandaise sauce looked more like a combination of egg yolks and butter. The taste wasn't awful, but for $22 a plate I guess I had higher expectations.Overall it was not a terrible experience, however be prepared to know that you are ordering from specialty menus on the weekends and it is on the fine dining end of the spectrum. I was looking forward to having some great local French toast, so I guess I will keep looking. 3
The family and I have gone for the 'pumpkin patch' the last 3 years (we don't get live Christmas trees).  Great pumpkin selection, reasonable prices.  Wish they had a few more food vendors due to family food allergies.  Definitely enjoy going and making great family memories. 4
I went to Dan because he had the most, and the highest reviews on Yelp. I had never had to take my car to have it tinted before, so I was a little unsure of what to expect. Dan was super informative about the choices of tint I could choose from, and the benefits of each.  He installed my tint quickly all while having great conversation while he was doing it. I 100% recommend using Dan! 5
Compass restaurant heading in wrong directionAs a member of the Bronte Outer Harbour Marina, my friends and I visited for lunch. What appears to be high-class dining is only a facade of overpriced food, cold waitstaff, and an awful clash of ingredients. After ordering our $35 meals, we waited an hour for it to arrive. Upon arrival, we could not even finish our meals. The ricotta cheese balls were inedible as they were swimming in butter. The $25 burger was horrendous. Hugely disappointed. I'd rather have eaten at a halfass fast food joint than this place again. To top it off, food poisoning was the cherry on top of our unpleasant meal. That night caused severe stomach pains. NEVER will i go back. It's no wonder the people of BOHM don't eat here. 1
We loved our food and the service the first time we went, however our visits were not consistent. The second time we went the server mixed up our order and the food wasn't very good even though we ordered the same thing the first time. It's a fun place to grab a drink and some food when watching a game, but don't have high expectations. 3
Very loud, service is very slow and food is just ok.  Went with a group of girls and we couldn't even order dessert because it was impossible to get our server to take our order.  Will not be returning here. 3
Had the Chimi, Tacos and Bugogi fries.  Had no ides what to expect of the fusion taste.   Simply put, I was blown away.  Definitely on our return to list of places! 5
Ok BBQ. I prefer the sauce added during the chopping, so adding it was just ok. The price seemed high for a pound at $12.99. Hushpuppies were a good blend of corn meal and onion. Staff need smiles. 4
Great healthy veggie options with environmentally sensitive packaging. I had the 5 star salad. Delicious!! Service was fast and friendly.   Clean upscale decor. 5
We were there in the afternoon and the place was pretty empty but the food was excellent we ordered the Korean BBQ combo for 2-3 people and it was plenty of food for us, I would say it feeds 4 people. We ordered spring rolls and dumplings as appetizers and it was really good. I highly recommend this place. 4
Frisch's is pretty reliable, family-friendly fare. Decent prices. I usually get a bacon burger. Their onion rings are above average. The salad bar actually seems like a pretty nice option, although I've never selected it. I have done the breakfast bar, which has a surprisingly nice selection. My inlaws seem to love the liver and onions, but I'm not quite prepared to go there myself. 4
Pizza is cooked ahead and slices are reheated when you order.  Tasteless and expensive. $7 for cheese slice and $8 with topping. 1
I am debating 1 or 2 stars.... I am not a very picky person - it doesn't take much to make me happy. However, I have had my car cleaned at various Danny's and I am honestly never happy. The job is less than average, but sometimes I just want a cleaner car, quick and easy. There are always spots missed, sometimes I take time to point them out and they get addressed, other times, I just want to be on my way. Today we got "The Works". The guy said our window was chipped and if we signed up to get it replaced through them, today's wash would be free. We declined and noted that there were no chips. I always detest the window repair piece.... They didn't do much of a vacuum job and didn't bother to clean out the cup holders. I pulled the Dyson out to the garage and did it myself when I returned home, on Mother's Day. I also cleaned out the cup holders and retreated the leather seats. $15.99 for what they did and 30 minutes more of my own labor, it looks nice now. 2
Slow slow service, very dirty place, menu complicated any topping that you add is an extra charge, food average : Go somewhere else you will be there for at least 1.5 hrs for just breakfast 1
It's funny, another yelper mentioned a great ambiance - but I guess it's not to my taste. I don't need silence when eating my ramen, but the music was way too loud. It's not really enjoyable when you server has to yell at you, and you have to yell back for them to hear you. To make matters worse, there was awkwardness at the communal table between the random couples (yes I've sat at communal tables before without issue). Thank goodness the food was better than I expected! If it was just based on food, I'd have given it 4/4.5 stars. 3
We had a fabulous dinner last night. I had the salmon with lobster/bacon risotto and my husband had the center cut filet with bleu cheese and mashed potatoes. We ended by sharing an amazing chocolate pecan pie. Our friends shared the cheesecake which was "to die for" and 4 inches high!! They took home more than half. The atmosphere was classy but not stuffy, unique and very comfortable. Looking forward to visiting again soon! Best night out in a long time. 5
I took the Ballet Barre class, and it was pretty good. I went on a purchased Groupon, which was 2 classes for the price of 1. What I liked: The atmosphere: I did really like the minimalist / modern decor. It's cool and fits right in with its uptown location.The class itself: It was relatively low impact, and only about a third of the class was actually using the barre (the beginning was arms, the middle on the barre, and the end abs / stretching). The instructor was great, and the class size was good. I do wish we had spent more time on the barre.The locker room was very clean and nicely arranged (although there are only 2 showers, which could mean waiting a while after a lunchtime class).What I didn't like so much:Price: This place is pretty expensive. It was okay to take 2 classes with the Groupon, but to join full time is a lot of money to only have access to about 3-4 different kinds of classes. I am a full time Y member, and for a lot less money they offer many different choices.Mats: When we arrived (I went with a friend, who'd also purchased the Groupon), the guy at the front desk asked if we had mats. We said no, we didn't know we needed them. "It's in the course descpription" was the answer; though no one reminded us of this when we registered for the class. We had to pay $2 each to rent a mat for a 1 hour class. $2!!! Definitely a rip off. For my 2nd class have no doubt that I will remember to bring my own. I mean, $2!!!The windows: The exercise room is right at street level on the corner of Stonewall / Church St., and it is totally windowed. So people are constantly walking by and staring. Maybe I am extra self conscious, but that was distracting to me, and at times in the class it made me pretty uncomfortable (like when men are walking by and starting at a class full of women doing hip thrusts). Also, my guess is that in the summer being in that room is like being in a fishbowl of magnifying glasses; meaning, won't it be really hot in there?Overall - it was a pretty okay experience to try a different kind of class with the Groupon, but I wouldn't pay the regular price for a class, not would I consider becoming a member full time. 3
I gave it a 3 star, because for the price I paid *$65 for a suite with our players card, we had a very good time.  It is not a high end hotel - but the service was what I would expect, the pool side cabana was perfect, ($400 plus for the day with drinks, etc) the pool staff were the best we had had all week.  The Mirage pool staff were lacking, the lines were too long, the MGM staff was okay.  But until we started to spend - they were unsure if we were worth their time for service.  But its Vegas, and I expect that.  The Luxor was great start to finish. BUT I wish they had outdoor restrooms by the private pool. 3
Dr. Zaveri has been a very thorough and compassionate practitioner, doing all he can to get me back my quality of life. He has employed multiple modalities, beyond just throwing meds at me with no answers. I would recommend him to friends or family. If you're a reasonable person who wants to get better, I would absolutely recommend him and his practice. 5
You walk into Joel Robuchon and know that every detail is going to be taken care of. The interior was so beautiful. We sat in their atrium which had a wall covered in beautiful green flowers and were nice and secluded; we felt like we could be a little louder here than in the somber, yet gorgeous dining room. The wait staff was phenomenal and they seemed to adapt their personalities to their customers - they could tell that we wanted to be a little bit more laid back than the atmosphere so they brought it down a notch for us. The food was nothing if not spectacularly presented and everything was very flavorful. One of my favorites was a tomato and mozzarella salad - now that would sound simple if you were dining at any other restaurant, but here it was quite a masterpiece. I also enjoyed the Pea soup, the turbot and the lamb. (I normally don't eat quite so many dishes, but all of the menu choices were Prix fix.) My favorite things about the restaurant are the cheese and pastry carts - the things that add ceremony to the evening and that make a dinner at this restaurant an experience rather than a meal. I guess my only complaint is that the dinner was so well orchestrated it seemed as if some of the soul was missing. 5
I was expecting more from Le Cartet given their reviews.  We arrived at 11:30am on a Sunday and waited 45 minutes for a table.  My iced coffee consisted of hot coffee pour over ice.  The ice melted after two sips.  I ordered the 2-minute egg with ham and cheese and toast.  The egg and the toast were good.  The ham and cheese were disappointing.  They looked like they were from a supermarket deli.  I would not recommend this restaurant.  It was not worth the wait. 2
Foods ok. Nothing to write home about. Service is definitely lacking. Probably won't be back. Too long of a trek, too much money for crappy service, and too many other, better pizza places to spend money. 2
I know you'd probably expect a better star rating but I'd have to say I  also expected more than I got. First of all, the food is good. It's really quite good. But not always excellent. The portions are copious but the presentation is non existant. It feels like you're on a farm almost. I can see how that's fun but in that case, it might be a little pricy for the farm experience. Second, service is good but it left me with the impression that the emphasis was on the upsell and not on the dining experience. If you go, I recommend the  second service, that way, you'll stay longer and enjoy the evening. Wine selection is good but not all the waiters are apt at suggesting the right bottle. All in all, it's definitely worth the visit and it probably it would have earned at least another star if not for the price or the impersonal experience. 3
Blessed by the service we received! My husband and I were referred to Fred Roach and are so grateful! I would highly recommend him. Not only did he thoroughly take time to look through the property and get very high quality photos, he also took the time to go through his report with us. He was very patient with us and answered all of our questions. 5
this place deserve no star at all but yelp is making me to give out star so i have to , Me and my wife was here lastnight start off with some appertizer everything went by good , after our entree has arrived i tasted the broth and it was straight up bland so i ask for some salt to reseasoning again  the meat was tateless the brisket were old they have turn into yellow so terrible, this is my first time and i think i will never return , the service was good . dont come here if u dont wanna get sick of eating old food 1
good value for your dollar.  you get a lot of food. it's tasty but they use a lot of salt.  They put on a good show.  I'd go back. 3
I love Chik fil a's, but I was overwhelmed by a terrible smell when I walked in here today. Gross. And the bathrooms were full and garbage overflowing. We walked out without ordering.This was from November 2012. 1
This place might be a reason for me to move to Montreal. It absolutely beautiful even on a rainy day. It really merges the European and the diverse Canadian culture into one. I love how everything feels very authentic from the architecture down to the cobblestones you walk on. Came here everyday during my weekend stay in Montreal but I would definitely spend a full week just roaming around the port and maybe one day taking a cruise down the river! 5
Their claim to fame, the Smoked Meat, is pretty good. But everything else I've tried has been just OK (or in some cases unavailable due to weird supply shortages). Soups are OK, knish was OK, beef brisket OK, fries were soggy and greasy, meatloaf was overpowered by thyme or rosemary (don't recall which)..I really wanted to like this place, but unless I order a smoked meat sandwich I usually end up disappointed. 3
Very good food! I had the fish taco and the seafood pasta. Delicious! The place was clean and the staff helpful & friendly.  There were a lot of people but service was fast.  Definitely a great place and we'll be back! 4
I've had samples of their ice cream which are also very good, but I always go back to the Ferrero Rocher! 5
Stayed in the courtyard for 4 nights , First room was horrible, Found cockroaches in our room was then moved to another room. Had a mixup with room service and tried to fix the problem they wouldn't have it though. Phil was very rude and racist , Told me "do you even speak English" found that very rude. Was planning on staying here once a year for the festival might just look somewhere else. 1
My first 3 star review.I really can't write that the food was terrible because it really wasn't. The problem is that it was nothing special. The burger had gristle and was salty, boring. The toppings are nothing special. Offering one "special" topping and one generic topping is not worth the prices they ask. $11.00 for a combo? I'd rather go to Moxies and get a burger from them for the same price. Much better. All the hype for these "specialty burger houses" just makes the disappointment they offer that much worse. Lower the prices, offer more selection and give more fries, then you might be worth the hype. As it stands these places Hero burger/South St/Five guys are nothing more than hyped up dives with not much more to offer than the "regular" burger dives. 3
The Gull and Firkin is very hit or miss. It's a okay place to grab a drink and their fish and chips is pretty decent but the service and some of the other things off the menu is a gamble. I've given it a try several times and there have been times when everything has been good and times when everything has been bad. So unfortunately on my last experience is what will be cited most. We ended up with 3 different waitresses taking orders from us (weird) and NEVER  order the crunchy chicken sandwich. The first one came our and I took a bite which was just bread I then opened it up to find that I had scared the chicken into the furthest corner of the bun. It was literally the size of 2 quarters and that's generous. The good news was they apologized and had another one ordered right away. The fries were good though. 2
Great place....clean and modern.  Location is not the best.  Too close to the university.  Too much disruption. 3
Insider scoop: 1 star...DO NOT buy your meat from this place!!There's really only one thing to say about this grocery store - do not shop here!!! 1
I used to come frequently until one day the food became inedible. Today, after more than a year, I decided to give it another try. Warm pop, inedible taboule salad and ok shawarma. 2
Don't waste your time!!! I dropped my wife off here for a quick fill. I returned an hour later and she was still waiting to be serviced! The most ridiculous thing was that she had made an appointment! I would have snagged her and left but they had already strategically soaked her nails in acetone so we had to stay to fix this mess. Never again! 1
Decent pho place. A little skimpy on the meat (only about 3-4 beef balls in my large). 2
Mandarin Wheat beer tasted like baby aspirin. The karaoke DJ was a complete jerk. We will not be back. 1
I just moved down here and I'm so happy I found Maile!!! She's a perfectionist and she makes my lashes look beautiful!! I get so many compliments on them. I will never have anyone else do them besides Maile. 5
Great place for a burger and a beer.  The bison burger is my favorite for a leaner alternative to beef but I'm not crazy about the chicken sandwiches.  They also have great build your own salads with very fresh ingredients.  This place seems to always be packed so I would call ahead to see what the wait time is. 4
Was just in Vegas this week, Stopped  by this place for pizza at about midnight, they close at 2:00 A.M. They were not busy at all. So you order your Pizza a lot like subway sandwich shop, I just had sausage and cheese  thin crust, for  $12.00  for about a medium sized pie. To sum this up it was the worst Pizza I ever had, for it to be natural burning oven, the cheese did not melt very well and it was very rubbery, the sausage was pre-cooked which meant when the put it in the oven it really dried out, the sauce had no flavor just bland, no spices at all. If you plan on going here do yourself a favor and don't.  Worst Pizza Ever!!! 1
Used them 2x to clean my carpet, they did a goof job.  The third time I used them to clean my travertine, they did a good job, but they charged me a Trip Charge of $24.95, I live in Chandler and their company is in Chandler, unfortunately that was the last time. 2
im a sucker for chicken fajitas and this place is great. not too expensive either 4
Best thing going for North Town. You must try the hot wings & hot chicken tenders! The fries are perfect but burgers are whatever. I've never tried the Mexican or sea food because I'm addicted to the wings and fingers. You get a lot of bang for your buck! Last night i went and ordered 2 regular cheeseburgers, 10 piece hot wings, & 4 chicken fingers which came out to $20 and some change. Parking sucks though when it's busy. 4
good food, ok service. ipad menus are ridiculous though. they make me feel. . . embarassed. 3
This is such a beautiful spa! I had visited here for the first time recently and I will be coming back! 4
This place is da bomb! Service is amazing,music is pumping,and you never have to wait long in line. The VIP hosts are the best in Vegas, this club is a must!!!!!! 5
This place used to be great. I used to go at least a few times a month when I lived in the area a couple of years ago. So I was excited to go again and show my friend my "old local brunch place". To be honest I was sorely disappointed in the service and quality of food. When we arrived there were 2 free tables right in front of us but we were still told to wait. We waited awkwardly a few minutes while the servers chatted and laughed with each other in the corner in no rush to try and seat us. Eventually we just sat down at the free table right next to us and the server came over in a huff like we'd just "disobeyed" her.And then there was the food. It was nothing like it used to be. Soggy toast, greasy yet undercooked eggs, potatoes are not crispy like they used to be and they now have a different spice on them with a taste I can't place, but the best way to describe it would be... weird.Coffee would have been good if it wasn't luke warm. Not a good experience. I am extremely disappointed that their quality seems to have gone downhill since I last went.I won't be going back. 2
We visited October 2013 before and after a show at the hotel that Dick's is at. Our lunch was overpriced, but we enjoyed the crude entertainment and drinks. We did opt for the souvineer cup knowing we would want to come back for drinks after the show. Our first experience was pleasant enough and left us happy. When we came back that evening though, the bartender was spending so much time with a patron across the bar and taking selfies for her, that he flat out ignored others at the bar. When we finally got his attention, he tried to overcharge us for our drinks. We did have to ask him about it, and this is where it draws the line between funny crude joking to flat out being a true dick. The bartender didn't know the difference at that point and was literally being a jerk. We did call him on his attitude knowing we could be misinterpreting it, but he had a totally jerk ass response and validated that he was being rude. We didn't deserve this. We paid, but left without tipping. He went back to flirting. I would have expected better from the bartender (even mediocre service) being that this place is a tourist location. 3
If you have to choose an ASU dining hall, Barrett would be your best option. But I'd rather do fast-food every day than have to eat there.The food is average or even below-average quality. While it looks like there are a lot of options, the dining hall essentially provides pizza, soup, and a few different pasta meals each night. The stir-fry is always very popular at the beginning of the year, as it looks exciting and offers a customizable Asian lunch. But the sauces are all varying shades of watery soy sauce, and the lines quickly die down.The kitchen workers seem to be untrained in how to cook (or, should I say, reheat) most of the food; several friends and I have gotten sick from undercooked hamburger or chicken. As for food allergies: I have Celiac Disease and can't eat gluten, and have found the dining hall to be horrible at managing that restriction. The food is all cooked in the same pan, so even if you ask for chicken without a bun or for the gluten-free pizza crust, your food will be contaminated by allergens all the same. Coupled with the fact that the workers don't switch gloves when handling special food, there's basically no way to eat uncontaminated food in the Barrett dining hall unless you survive on a strict diet of fruit and Trix cereal.But, I have to say that there are times when the food is genuinely good. Their chicken breast is great, and the fruit is always freshly-cut. The salad bar has good options for toppings and sauces, and the ice cream bar cycles the available flavors. And finally, my 2nd star goes out to Mama Vicke, who does the card-swiping. She (and the other ladies at the front) make visits to the dining hall so enjoyable. She's always happy and laughing, and engages in conversation with the students while they wait. She remembers little details about all of our lives, like asking me how my boyfriend is or asking my friend how his company is going. She's truly an angel sent down to make the ASU dining experience more livable. Barrett gets 2 stars for the smart decision to hire Mama Vicke. 2
It's no secret I go out of my way for Artigiano.  Love the coffee!  Hard to find a table at peak hours and gets very noisy, but you'll know why if you are a coffee lover.  They are the only place in Canada that I've been to that is able to include coffee art on a soy latte.  Almost hate to drink it... NOT! 4
I love the food here, I've never gotten something that I didn't like. The customer service is hit or miss. However, this morning was awful. There were 4 people in line when I came in, no biggie - actually that's the least amount of people I've ever been behind. The young man taking the orders, not only mumbled every word, he also spoke extremely softly - I heard the two customers before me say "Huh?" or "Excuse Me?" several times for him to speak up, while placing their orders.  The employee that was taking money was polite, noticeably stressed, but polite. After paying for my breakfast sandwich, I stepped aside to wait. The other busy bees were running around between the back of the house and front counter getting bagels made, sliced, toasted, boxed... While waiting, I couldn't help but notice the orders that were coming out before mine - 3 out of the 4 were wrong. Wrong bagels in a Baker's Dozen box, the other box's bagels weren't sliced, another gourmet bagel was the wrong bagel all together... I've never seen that many missteps from the employees! Also while waiting (it took quite a while for my order), I overheard someone, who I'm assuming is the Manager, complaining to another customer her annoyance in having to train other employees and how she just "didn't have time for such nonsense." Hmm.. 2
This place is definitely not your ordinary pizza place. Wow!!! Love at first Bite!The name goes with the pizza. The crust was nice and Crisp, and you can tell they use quality ingredients I would definitely recommend checking this place out! I now have a new favorite pizza place in the valley. 5
Yes, pricey... Um you are in Vegas. Illy coffee is always solid. Their almond croissant, best one I've eaten. Grapefruit salad, pairs nicely with my croissant.  Like the name, doing good. Overall legit. 4
Went here tonight by accident, we were looking for a steakhouse that closed down nearby and discovered Don Pedros. The atmosphere is fun and party like. Service is good. The food is fresh but taste is just acceptable. We had the mixed seafood platter and gaucamole. The salt content of everything is high and the margarita was way way overpriced and not good. This is not going to be my go to place for good Mexican food, only for dining in a fun atmosphere. My go to places for food will be on North Tryon or even On the Border is better. But I think this place did a great job of decorating and creating a good social and relaxed atmosphere. Definitely worth checking out for the atmosphere and service, food just happens to be available as well. 3
This has a beautiful classy style as soon as you walk in. Great professional staff. The menu has something for everyone. Clam chowder & the lobster bisque soups are the best in the Valley. Sea Bass is tasty as is their burger and the fried chicken. If you love Fresh sea food cooked perfectly and creative dishes? This is the place. A little peace of heaven here in Arizona. 4
This place was alright,  I'm still looking for a place like that late night stand that I frequented so much in Chiang Mai... I haven't had much luck here in Phoenix... 3
The buffet always has a long line to get in. Then It is pricey, but The seafood is good tho. I might come back. But i liked The ceasar palace's Better :) 4
Bit of an average location. No comfy seats. Outside your sat on the road basically. Small inside. Not the best spot to hang out. If you walk north a block the next Starbucks is way nicer. 3
Had dinner here a few nights ago, overall it was nice but I certainly didn't leave thinking it was all that. Spent a while looking at the menu. For one there are no capitol letters and the font can't be any bigger than size 10 so I sort of found it difficult to read. Secondly, nothing really sounded that good, maybe they switch it up often. Girlfriend had some sort of girly pear drink in a martini glass, this probably stood out the most. It almost tasted like drinking a fresh pear but with a little booze, quite good. On the other hand, my Coors Light tasted like beer. Several different artisan type breads were offered, we tried a couple, I like the pretzel one the best. For dinner I had the mushroom risotto and GF had a steak. Risotto was fine, GF's steak came pre-cut up into little pieces. Is this supposed to be for the dog? We both thought that was pretty odd and basically cheating if they're trying to see how well they cooked it. To wrap it up, we had the tiramisu. Our waiter said it was the best ever (I hate it when wait staff say that). It was good, I mean it's not like I'm not going to eat a big cup of tiramisu but it was by no means the best ever. It was on the dry side actually. Mph, we tried it but I don't think we will come back. 3
Feeney's used to be a wonderful restaurant.  However, I have not enjoyed the last 3 meals I received there.  You should get more than 4 shrimp in the shrimp scampi for the price, there is simply something wrong with the cheese on the pasta, and the I had to throw away the last steak because it was just fat.  Hopefully, things will improve in the future. 2
Went with the family here on Saturday night.  The place was busy, and after being told that we would have a 30 minute wait, our pager lit up 10 minutes after we got it.Our server was great in letting us know about the special beers and food that was available.  I ordered one of the special beers, and it was quite good.   She came by later to ask what I thought about it.We ordered the fried pickles as an appetizer, and I have to say, I was very disappointed.  I am a fan of fried pickles, but these were way too salty for us, and we were only able to have about half of the order before we gave up.One reason why I like Bad Daddy's is that they have a buffalo burger.  I am a huge fan of buffalo, and to me, it has a better taste than beef and is overall better for you.My oldest had the same burger, and loved it.  It really is served well.I also liked how the sides are served in small bowls, separate from the rest of the meal.  I got their home made potato chips, and they are very good!  Very crispy.  I have had other home made chips at other restaurants, but they usually end up soggy and all bunched together.Our server did keep tabs on us, and got refills on our drinks.  Well, except for my request for another beer on special.  Either she did not hear it or just forgot.Regardless, the food was good (except for the fried pickles), the service was overall good, and the restaurant is loud.  Not a place to have a nice, quiet dinner.We will go back, but there are so many other restaurants to try in the area! 3
I would give them 2.5 stars because the donuts are always on point- when they have them in stock. Can't say the same for the drive-thru service! They are rude and interrupt while placing an order, they are usually out of donuts, but don't tell you until they have already ran your credit card. This has happened 3 out of five times (no matter how early or late I get there).  The problem is, it's the closest one to my house and my kids love them on Saturday mornings as a treat. Oh, and please put back the picture signs with the donut names. This would be helpful at the drive thru. Thank you. 2
Went with my girlfriend for dinner and it was perfect, got the oyster, mix sashimi, beef ribs and drinks. Food came at a reasonable time, sashimi was kinda fresh and oysters were amazing. Service was great but always make a reservation. Would recommend and go again. 1 star off because not enough skewer menu and tables are kinda close to each other with no barriers. Not a big deal. 4
ACRYLIC NAILS WITH GEL NAIL POLISH. Definitely will not be spending my money there again. The people are very RUDE! And the did my nails so half ass. When I asked to speak to MANAGER there isn't one there, when would she be in they told me they didn't know. I normally don't get my nails done but I decided to treat my self and I told the lady just make them look super nice. IT LOOK LIKE I WENT TO WALMART AND GLUED ON MY OWN NAILS THEN PAINTED THEM 15 COATS THERE BIG AND BULKY. she didn't even push back my cuticles so u can see the GAP very easy 3 of my nails r crooked.when I told her y it goes to the side she said that's the way my nails grow. this place sucks!!I PAID 50 BUCKS WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY. 1
There has never been a more glorious hole than this!After lusting over the website for weeks, my husband decided to take me out on a Sunday lunch date which included Glory Hole Doughnuts as "dessert". We got there at about 2:45pm and were told that unfortunately there weren't any donuts available until quarter after 3pm. We were given a number.We came back promptly at 3:15pm. At 3:30pm the donuts started rolling out in batches. It was like a fashion show of sugary creations and we started naming the donuts out loud as they came out. By that time, the line-up was out the door so it was good that we had come earlier and got a number because they employed the numbering system for only half an hour and only up to the number 5. We were number 5. Numbers 2-4 were nowhere to be found. We may or may not have bound them to chairs in an abandoned warehouse prior to 3:15pm. We ordered a half dozen mixed. Also ordered two coffees, which we realized afterwards they gave to us for free. The service was great. We joked. They laughed. They smiled. We skipped out the door in merry delight. Now, on to the taste test...Here's what was worth mentioning...Butter & Toast - When I go to heaven, I wish to float in butter and eat these til eternity.Elvis with Marshmallow - One word: bacon.S'mores - I want s'more! (Sorry, bad pun)The donut itself, though, is the real winner. Its soft and light without being too airy because it needs a little weight to carry its hoard of toppings, which also do not disappoint. They are deliciously huge - bigger than a bagel. They range in price from $2.00 to $4.00 each, and you can get a half-dozen for $20. 4
SCAM!So many promoters in the casino passing out bands that do nothing.  $25 at the door.  Was told a bunch of incorrect information by the promoters, that the staff would not honor and all the manager said, sorry, nothing we can do about them lying to you.  I wish it wouldn't have happened.  Got out of Caesars in a hurry, get me once...never again.  Had I been offered a drink or my money back... I would have not even posted this review. 1
This review is for the Scottsdale Red Robin, at Pima & Shea.  Very disappointing visit.  On a Sunday afternoon and I wanted to take my son to lunch while we watched some football.  I had seen the commercials about their gourmet burgers, and decided to give them a try.  While looking for a booth to sit in, we noticed that several televisions were not working and were unable to find a place to watch football, not a big deal.  We finally found a booth and sat down.  A member of the staff come over and told us that we were not able to sit in that particular booth, because it was too close to the bar!  I couldn't believe it, it wasn't even close to the bar.  It was about 20 feet from the bar, I thought they were kidding.  She said we had to move to the only available table which was in a corner, next to the bathroom without a view of any television.  I kept asking about other tables and booths, she kept telling me that they were too close to the bar area.  I asked if we could sit outside, or was that too close to the bar, but she said that no tables were outside.  I have never in my 50 years experienced a less desirable atmosphere to experience a meal.  Unfortunately I will never get to experience the food at Red Robin.  Not a friendly family environment at all. 1
This Queen West store has lots of unique shoe brands and styles including my new favorite, Miz Mooz.    Balisi does carry hangbags and clothing but the styles aren't really for me and I tend to stick to the shoes.  The service is great at Balisi as they have enough seating to try on your shoes and do a bit of a walk around.  I have only been to the Queen location but it is good to know there are others in the city in case your size or colour isn't in stock. The only problem I tend to have at Balisi is deciding which ones to leave behind... 4
Transplant from the northeast. Tried the General Tso's, sauce was more like teriyaki and chicken was overcooked. My 11 year old loves Chinese and I got this at 7 pm so he was pretty hungry, had about 3 bites and was done. Look elsewhere. 2
We went there with high hopes & but got disappointment.Many of the items had just rice with charred vegetables without any spice. Even meat items had no taste. We felt it too costly for the quality we got.Desserts were okay. 1
Surprisingly good. Definitely better then the pho that was served by the previous owner. I ordered the assorted meats pho. The broth was very flavorful. The meatballs were cut in slices, which made eating it more convenient. I loved that they already had small dishes at the table to use to separate the hoisin sauce and Sirachi sauce for dipping my noodles :). I did not like that there was no option for a small pho vs large pho. One size fits all?  The special drink of the day was the tri color jelly. Too much ice for my liking. Maybe I was also too full to enjoy it. I would definitely come back for another bowl of pho! 4
Stopped by earlier today because my car desperately needed to be cleaned. I pulled up and a nice girl named Kat helped me pick out what kind of car wash I wanted. They have lots of different things you can do so it's important you understand what comes with each wash, since they're all different types of cleanings . I ended up getting the VIP car wash and added the carpet cleaning. They were doing a promotion at the time so I got $10 off the carpet cleaning and since I had recently gotten my oil changed next door at jiffy lube I also got half off the car wash. So this $54ish wash only cost me around $30. Which was great for me. It took them about 2 hours to finish my car... but like I said it desperately needed a cleaning so I figured it would take longer then normal to clean it up. The cleaning looked great, and the best part for me was watching the detailer, Kayce I think his name was, RUN to get a towel and finish up my car. The hustle really impressed me because I've seen a lot of other  car places where the people are very lackadaisical. So I could tell he worked his butt off cleaning my car. All in all I was very impressed with their service, the people in the store were very nice and helpful, and my car looked great! Cleaner than I had seen it in awhile. I definitely will go back for my next car wash! 5
Food was def on point! Got fried whiting, greens and mac and cheese! The greens and the fish stood out the most! Mac and cheese good but not great!! Greens were seasoned to perfection with a perfect hit of sweetness. Fish was rather thin in my opinion but seasoned pretty well....Their whiting is a joke compared to Mert's!! Nevertheless food was good and I will definately be back when Im back in the area!! 4
The girl with the long hair always helps me out in the morning. I get either a Vegas sumo or a build your own bowl with salmon, and she always makes sure to pay special attention that she doesn't touch any of my food with shellfish items (I have a food allergy). Poukei rocks, thanks guys! :) 5
I love this location! Everyone is so friendly and welcoming. It is by far the best one hour workout you can have! Every trainer that trains here it's awesome and definitely knows what they are doing!  Go orange! 5
This restaurant opened my mind to the whole vegan/gluten-free thing as a dining option.I mean, I want to be healthy, but I don't want it to be... unpleasant.  Especially when I'm paying for it.  I got the Soup & Salad Combo of Amazingness that everyone here raves about.  And it was.  It was amazingness.  The soup was hearty and rich.  The salad, deceptively filling.  And so well dressed!  Delicious.  Delicious.  I recommend it v. much. 5
We went to this place last night and really enjoyed the dinner. Cool ambiance w/ a rustic loft warehouse vibe.  We ordered the sharing platter w/ the beef brisket, ribs, and fried chicken which were all unreal. We also got the burnt ends as a starter which had a great smoke flavor to them. The drinks were a little on the expensive side...Worth checking out this place for a dinner/! 4
Great burger black and bleu Fries good but not fresh cutShrimp cocktail excellent and great homemade horseradish Ice cream sandwich cheap at $3 not bad but straight from the box nothing specialService and burger both excellent 5
I had passport photos taken of my 6 month old and they were rejected at the passport office for too many shadows. I wasted 3 hours with travel time and the lineup at the passport office. 1
Super slow service. Not busy but we waited like 20 minutes to get our order taken. Don't order the chicken lettuce wraps. Don't know what it was, but it couldn't be chicken. When our rolls came we had to ask for wasabi and ginger.  They brought three out of our six drinks. We had to ask for the complete order. Unfriendly. 1
Soo after 2 other mechanics, especially my family mechanic couldn't find the problem. With my Hyundai Tiburon, Aloha Automotive came to my rescue! My car wasn't showing a check engine light (CEL), so none of the mechanics knew what was wrong when it stalled. Jason & his team just cleaned out the engine & works brand new, no problems. Charged me for only labor. Very honest, friendly people. Would recommend anybody to them! 5
Been coming here for years! They are always so good to my dog, they don't lock him up in a cage for hours, they let him hang out and play with the other dogs. He is always happy and groomed perfectly. The owner/manager is so sweet and always so accommodating. Love this place! 5
We had heard of Buldogis from fellow yelper Anthony S, but had never made it out there because it was so far from where we live. One random day, Kalila and I found ourselves on that side of town and took advantage of it by finally trying this place out.My favorite food is hot dogs, so I definitely had high standards and high expectations.I ordered the beef buldogi dog and kaliia had the banh mi dog. We also got the chicken wings with a side of asian ginger sauce.The beef bulgogi dog was very delicious and flavorful. The meat was tender. The bulgogi mayo was a great compliment to the hot dog.Kalila's banh mi dog was really good as well. The sriracha mayo was perfect for her. Not too spicy and not too mayo-y. The pork belly and banh mi slaw worked well with the hot dog.The hot dogs themselves are thick and juicy. Each hot dog is really loaded up with its' toppings so you get your money's worth... if not more.The chicken wings were not anything special. I was looking forward to the asian ginger sauce being something similar to the asian zing sauce at buffalo wild wings, but it wasn't even close. The asian ginger sauce was more like an oil and you could barely even taste it. Somewhat of a disappointment since their hot dogs were so good that the same amazement couldn't transfer over to the chicken wings, but it's ok. You're not really ever going to go to bulDOGis for chicken wings. You will go and get hooked on their amazing hot dogs.I just couldn't resist another hot dog. I then ordered the buckeye dog. The corn relish was the business. The bacon was crispy. It was awesome all around.They have a large menu and plenty more foods to try.Aside from the menu behind the counter, they have an additional menu of specials written on a chalkboard wall to the left.There are clean restrooms inside (separate men & women, individual use).They have 2 tv's and if you ask for the remote, they will allow you to change the channel. We watched the rebels lose to SDSU. Our stomachs were happy, but we left heartbroken.MUST TRY THIS PLACE. 4
Las Vegas is known for excellent buffets. And I'd been looking forward to trying this one since my other friends have always raved about it. Maybe this was an off night, but it was so bad, I won't give it another shot. Sorry! Maybe we should have taken it as a sign when there was NO line at 7:30pm on a Saturday night. We had prepared ourselves for an hour wait and thought we had scored when we walked right in... WRONG! Let me start with what was good - the shrimp cocktail, the shrimp over cheesy grits, duck ravioli, the prime rib, and the gelato bar. Now for the bad - a lot of the food was stale, probably because there were not enough people eating to cause them to need to make new food. The ribs, korean short ribs were tough and chewy. The crab legs were small and when you were able to get some meat out of them, it was soaked in brine. You could actually squeeze the solution out of the meat, just like a sponge. The fried chicken was chicken wings and they were cold and not crunchy. The spaghetti and lasagna was Olive Garden quality. The dim sum (har gow) was tough and over cooked. The service was slow and deplorable. At one point, we returned to our table and it had not been cleared, so we put the dirty dishes on the clean table next to us. For the rest of the meal, those dirty dishes stayed there and no one cleared them... We even had a bet going on whether they would be cleared before we left! They weren't... This buffet was so horrible, I spent the whole meal pissed that we had spent $42++ per person and this was maybe a step above Hometown Buffet. We should have saved our money and eaten at Golden Corral on the way here! Save your money. Go to the M Hotel for their buffet. 1
Expensive standard subways prices. Rude service (probably because they treat everyone like the high school kids next door). No air conditioning! I'll only go when I'm desperate for a sub and have coupons. 2
"Wish" is short for "wish I never came here".Great patio, so-so food, absolutely atrocious service! Asked a server to pack my food to go, 3 times! Finally after 40 min in +30C weather someone came to pack it , just to bring it right back in the clear plastic container!? In this weather? If they treat customer's food like this, I don't even want to know what's going on in the kitchen.Definitely will not be coming back. 1
I've got to see it before it closed. It's a big part of MGM and what's makes them MGM. It crowded all the time. One of few things where parents can bring their kids to. It was free so nothing to complain about. It sucks that it had to close. 3
I was in town for business and got back to my hotel around 7PM (dinner time). Having work to do for my client, I decided that I would order food to be delivered to my room and chinese food sounded great! I ordered General Tso's Chicken, a small Pork Lo Mein, and the fried dumplings. I thought I was in for a treat as I don't often get the chance to have chinese food. Little did I know, that the food about to be delivered from Taste of China @ 5415B Monona Dr, Monona, WI was horrible.The chicken smelled a little different, but when i tasted it I could tell that it had been left out on the counter for hours instead of being in a cooler prior to preparation. The pork lo mein was OK, so I ate some of it and the dumplings were edible.The next day, I was sick all day. I called the resteraunt and complained when I got back to the hotel and they offered to replace my order. No way was I going to go for round two of the food poisoning game. Instead I told them that I would be posting this review and reporting them to the health department. DO NOT EAT THERE!! YOU WILL BE VERY SORRY THAT YOU DID!! 1
Rock solid dinner for families in the Regent neighborhood. I like their margaritas a lot! 3
I was very selective in choosing the pre-school our daughter would be attending.  After many interviews with a number of pre-schools, I was immediately comfortable and impressed with Westbrook Montessori.  The educational program provided our daughter with a solid foundation, the warmth, and attentive, caring staff from the owner - teachers - assistances was evident.  Thank you to all staff at WBM for not only helping my daughter adjust to a new experience but providing me with the comfort in knowing she was in a safe, fun environment.  I would recommend WBM without hesitation! 5
Extremely dis satisfied with our stay at the Boulder City Camp Ground at Lake Mead Natl Rec area.  It took over one hour to fill up our small 23 gallon tank in our RV at the sanitation station due to the slow trickle of the water coming out.  Wasted over an hour filling up our tank that we could have spent enjoying the park.  This is because the privately run camp ground next door on federal property no less, was taking up all the water.  That and very poor maintenance of the campground services  Later we found a water spigot near our camp site that ran at full blast.  The park rangers there need to get off their behind and put a work order in to fix that dump. 1
Atmosphere - a bar for bicyclers with bikes hanging all over and arty photographs of Pittsburgh and/or bicycles or both some for sale. On walking in I thought we'd made a mistake on seeing the very small bar with a couple tables then walked up a couple stairs in the back to a room with 10-12 tables. Mid-Sunday afternoon there were a couple beer drinkers and as we left a Triathlon group of 10-15 came for a meeting.Service - surprisingly excellent for a bar considering we were the only ones eating at the time and brought 2 kids with us. Kids were offered coloring books and a selection of markers. One small topping mistake with a burger was quickly remedied and even the chef/cook apologized in passing which was exceptionally nice.Food - the menu is fun with wild mixes of toppings (peanut butter bacon burger, burger on a salad) that looked fun to try. The kids' meals (usually 2.99) were actually free (Sunday special) and there are a few typical offerings that come with fries, applesauce or celery/carrots. Burger 1 - Primanti style with egg, cole slaw, fries - was a strong good. 3 starsBurger 2 - Veggie (all burgers can be made turkey or veggie) boca-style dipped in hot sauce with hot pepper cheese, bacon (yes!), lettuce, tomatoe, blue cheese dressing on side. Delicious. Bun was soft yet not too squishy. Onion rings - can choose for .95 extra instead of sides. Delicious beer batter, perfectly cooked real onions inside, generous serving. Could have used a little more salt in batter but forgiven because tasted homemade instead of an oversalted mix.Pretzel appetizer - yummy, typical baked not fried, served with a yummy cheese that seemed like a real cheese spread made with butter instead of plastic nacho cheese. If so quite surprising.One surprise is that most of the choices on the menu were not very healthy for what you'd think would be a healthy-eating bicycling crowd. Maybe if you triathlon then you don't need to watch what you're eating. The salads were few and very simple. More thought went into the burgers and the sandwiches. There were a a couple simple vegetarian with cheese paninis and the veg burger options and the seitan wings that we didn't try.Overall primarily a bar with fun and pretty good sandwiches and burger and a couple salads. I'd return for fabulous happy hours and daily specials. $5 burger night for example. $10 any sandwich and a beer night. 3
Noisy beyond belief.A huge party at a long table screaming at top of their lungs. Ruining the whole room . The staff , specifically the female mgr refused to suggest to them to be more quiet. Been going there for 15 years. Never againToo many better options 1
I don't even remember why we decided to go here...but we did and it was a hit w/ the out of town friends.  We came here twice with friends & family from Chicago and Arizona.  They were very impressed w/ the place!!  The price is alright.  But, would I pay $30+ to hang out and freeze my butt for fun...no I would not.  You get black fury boots, thin gloves, jacket and 2 drink tickets.  When I first walked in, I was really impressed.  It was bright, had a bar, bar counters and seats.  After a while, it gets cold.  And the music they play is not the kind I really listen to...I believe it's house music?   Overall it was a good experience...a must see in Vegas.  We would definitely come back to show more friends from out-of-town...only because it's different. 4
Thanks for taking care of our insurance needs while my husband's truck was involved in a hit and run. You truly made the issue seem like we can handle it and made it less stressful. Thank you for caring about your clients! 5
My favorite barbeque in Charlotte.  If you had asked me a few months ago, I would have only rated it a 3...because they had removed the smoked, creamed corn from the menu for a while.  It is back and I love it!My favorite time is to swing by after church (Calvary Church...shameless plug) when the Panthers are playing.  I enjoy the first half of the game with my family and then head home at half time!  My favorite dish is their smoked brisket with collard greens.  Get their pepper sauce!  If the color is bright...it is new and not too hot, but if you want good flavor, look for the more muted colors.  They have at least 3 types of hot pepper in the sauce, which makes for a yummy taste.  The brisket is tender and smoky, and really does not need sauce, but the sauce is tasty too.  The bacon wrapped jalapenos vary in heat...be warned...sometimes you will get a tasty one that seems mild, and then sometimes you will get a heat bite...still tasty, but be aware.Oh, and the pecan "cobbler" is rich and yummy...plan on rolling out of there if you get that.It is football season, see you there. 4
After recently moving back to Toronto from Vancouver, my sushi expectations were high. Asuka did not disappoint and in fact, made some of the best sushi I have EVER had! The Green Dragon Roll will change your life.Exceptionally fresh and perfectly presented, the food was truly outstanding. I couldn't stop "mmming" aloud in the same vein as the awesomely obnoxious What About Bob? movie dinner scene. Great service, and delicious fresh fruit that was the perfect end to the meal. No surprise it's a celeb hotspot and will definitely be a regular spot for me. 5
I placed an order on 10/10/14 around 9:40am,  using the Paypal (eat24) app on my phone. I been reading the reviews and some are good and some are not, so I decided to try it out. I got to the store at 10:10am and I told them I had placed an order and I was picking it up. I gave them my name and I had to wait 5 minutes, I could tell they forgot to do my order which was the Char-broiled caesar salad, because they were asking me what I wanted in it, when I had already specified online. My time for pick-up was 10:05amI waited and after 5 minutes someone from the kitchen gave me my food. I went home and when I opened the foam container, all I had was a Big Tortilla Bowl filled with bad lettuce(practically brown) up to the top and just a few pieces of tomatoes, 4 croutons and ONLY, I repeat ONLY 4 tiny strips of Chicken, they weren't like Chicken tender strips, all I had was  4 strips of chicken which looked like they pulled from the breast.  My total was $10.11 for this salad, which I didn't mind at first, but this is pathetic. I would stick to Subway's Salads around the corner, even they have fresher lettuce. 1
I use to come here more often andI forgot why.  So i made a special  trip.I order the  beef noodle and tendon along with a side order of sticky tofu.I was expecting more from the beef.  But it was good but I was underwelmed.   The beef tendon was good though. Hand made noodles was a little under cooked.Tofu    was great as usual. Over it was an ok experience but I use to love the place inside First market place that closed ten years ago.   Then opened up at leslie and 16 th for about a year.   That was the best beef noodles in town 3
Don't waste your time. I made an appointment several weeks out for a Friday morning. I took off work, showed up this morning 20 minutes early, and the receptionist told me she was sorry but my appointment had been cancelled. I said I didn't understand. She said someone, couldn't tell me who or when, had called and spoken with someone, again, didn't say who, or when, or what number they called, and cancelled the appointment. I explained that no one spoke to me, and I wanted to know who they called, etc... she wouldn't tell me anything. She did apologize, and offered to get me in next week. They have so many doctors and NPs there, but she didn't offer any alternative to next week. She didn't escalate, and other than saying sorry, it seemed like this was a normal event for her. No sense of ownership, no caring, etc... I was hesitant to go, seeing all the other poor reviews this morning. After today, I won't ever be going back. There are many other alternatives in Chandler and Phoenix, so if you haven't gone before, don't waste your time. It isn't worth taking off work only to find they won't take the time to see you. 1
Incredible service, food, and environment! From the valet parking to the dessert options ... this is the best!! 5
Another great staple of Madison that is a must try. Food is very good and beer is of course good. You can get free popcorn for the table. Order food and drinks at the bar and they bring it out to you.The outside seating area is awesome too in both summer and fall. A must try if you are going through Madison. 4
Food *** - Service *** - Ambience ****Fairly mediocre food. Their curries are palatable but no matter what curry you off of their menu, they all taste the same. At $10 a curry, and for that portion size, they are fairly over priced. The ambience and staff are ok. Restaurant is quite clean.I would go back here if I had no other options. 2
I picked up lunch here for myself and my husband.  We ordered a Prime Rib Wrap and a C3- basically a chicken BLT.  Both were quite good and quite a bit of food.  I didn't even come close to finishing.  That said, it wasn't outstanding.  Now I don't expect a wrap shop to exactly rock my socks off, I think of it as a place to basically grab and go not dine and linger so to me the prices are a bit high for that type of establishment.  I am sure I will go back again but it is not something that will incite a major craving that MUST be satisfied. 3
Definitely not the worst sushi I've ever had. However it wasn't good at all. I would stay away from the tuna it tasted off and very mushy. The only thing good about this restaurant is the service. Lastly, it's very easy to order too much. Keep track of the quantity as they charge for every uneaten piece. 2
A bit of drive, wish there were more locations but I love the food. Pretty pricey but...whatever. Treat yo self!! 4
The complimentary breakfast was basic but good and the room was clean.Watch your credit card charges.  We stayed for 2 days using points and so the total charge was $70.  But when the bill posted on the credit card, there were 5 additional charges totaling over $2400!!  I'm not sure how they messed up so badly. 3
This review is long overdue, my puppy's awful stay occurred in January but I thought better late than never. Also make sure to read the "reviews not recommended."I was mortified of the condition I picked my dog up in. The first thing I noticed upon getting in the car was the stench of urine. When I got home I examined my puppy's paws to see they were CAKED and stained with dried urine. I immediately called the facility and asked if he was given an exit bath as promised, to which they replied that they did in fact give him one (disgusting and hard to believe how dirty his paws got from "1 night" after his bath). They said I could bring him in to re-bathe him but I didn't want to bring him knowing it would stir up un-needed energy. I washed his paws to find that they were rubbed compltely raw and were super pink and swollen. Finally I lost it when about 2 hours after being home HE STARTED LIMPING. I immediately brought him back to the facility for some sort of medical attention- being I was visiting from California and had a long drive home the next day. Not only that, but when I picked him up HALF of the food I gave them was given back to me. (I measured his exact normal amounts, no reason there is HALF the amount of food, especially when they told me he was eating fine daily)The woman who I spoke with when I went back was nice, she applied nose cream to his paws and gave him a beneadryl to help the swelling go down. She said the manager would call me later or the next day which never happened. I am mortified that upon picking him up after his multiple day stay his paws came in contact with so much urine that not only did it cause them to become raw but his fur to this day is still stained yellow. (see photos)Luckily I don't live in the area so there is no need for me to ever go back but I wouldn't EVER EVER go back here. My puppy-being obviously exhausted which is expected- was wimpering in his sleep for days which he has NEVER done. How can you run a facility so filthy that my dog's paws are stained with dried urine when "he was given an exit bath last night." I don't expect him to be clean as a whistle but really? Disgusting!Thanks to you guys now I'll be skeptical to EVER boarding him in a facility like this again. 1
Quiet a decent place for brunching and if you're a big fan of coffee and beer then they have something for you in the menu, a coffee flavored beer. Just swing by. 4
We purchased the suite of Frigidaire appliances (attached) at a cost of over $5000 a little over two years ago. In that time we have had to replace the microwave and now recently have had this major repair on the $2000 refrigerator to the tune of $700. I was well aware that this was outside the one year warranty but I think this is an exceptional circumstance given the design flaw of this major appliance.I have well researched this issue on the web and have talked to a number of Frigidaire service reps (who all ask to remain anonymous interestingly.)  What I have concluded is that a system where a small plastic ice cube tray which is highly likely, if not guaranteed, to break over time releases a sensor that shorts out an entire system which should not and cannot be classified any other way than a design flaw. In addition as I found out, the company has rectified this flaw in subsequent designs which clearly confirms this was an issue in the previous design whether they  deem it a design "improvement" or not per your consumer help line. I also know that there has been no recall due to this issue.I asked the company by phone and letter to cover these repairs or make good on any on this. They turned  me down flat and said since it was more than 1 year it was all my problem. Shoddiest  work I have ever seen. Dont ever buy an Electrolux product if you are smart 1
My friend had a wedding emergency, she was to be married the next morning having everything done but the nails and feet. The owner not knowing us stayed open for us. She put four specialists on the two us and did an outstanding job. I was so impressed with the cleanliness of the spa. They have liners in the foot spa to protect the customers from germs. The care they took and the work preformed was excellent. The shop is hidden back in a small center. I suggest you find it. Five stars from me. Clean comfortable well decorated, is an upscale spa with reasonable prices. 5
I really enjoyed the food while eating it, however it seemed to be like clockwork for our whole party, 4 hours after eating made you want to throw up. It ruined our evening events. Also I think that it's absurd to automatically add 20% gratuity for parties of 6 or more. Most places only start to include gratuity after 8 people and at 18% to split the 15-20% debate. It's as if we are tipping them for their inability to handle more than six burgers. I believe that the servers would be more enjoyable if they actually had to work for their money using their personality. 2
Super Expensive and quoted one price by the owner Michelle and charged another that was three times the amount.  Quoted minimum amount for maintenance of $100 and charged $525.  In fact, my card was said invalid funds as I did not expect to pay the much. I ended up writing a cheque for very cheap hair and I got taken.  Not a pleasant feeling especially when she knew I wasn't working.  Used the worst quality hair that came out within five weeks (extensions) - not a good experience for me.  I always had to wait for service and I was never treated nicely.  I thought it was a racist thing.  Luckily I found a wonderful place that does great extensions and colour called Wave Length Hair by Joyce Jones who is amazing.  In fact, she couldn't believe how bad my hair looked and ha to take out the extensions that I had in for only five weeks from this salon and put in her own extensions using high quality hair and didn't charge me.  She only charged me for maintenance because that is what she quoted me on the phone.  Her colour was beautiful.  I had many compliments two hours after I left.  I thank God I met her.  She's been doing hair/extensions for 35 years and is truly the best and very honest! 1
Highly recommend this place!Great haircut by friendly staff..... Great prices!Best of all, no wait..... Quick in and out! 5
My wife and I were eager to try this restaurant having just finished a five year stint in Washington DC where we became big fans of Chef Jose Andres.  China Poblano didn't disappoint.We sat at the Dim Sum/Noodle Bar (there's also a Taco Bar as well as regular dining tables) overlooking chefs meticulously preparing different dim sum dishes.  My wife ordered a margarita, which comes topped with a salt foam in lieu of the traditional salt-rimmed glass, while I ordered a Singapore Sling.  Both were quite tasty.While we looked over the unique menu we ordered up some lengua tacos (don't knock 'em until you try 'em), which were one of our favorites at Oyamel (a Jose Andres restaurant in DC).  The tacos were as delicious as we remembered them.Meanwhile, the dim sum chefs in front of us inspired us to try some lamb pot stickers which had a nice flavor highlighted by some cumin and other seasonings.  A gentleman next to us was eating some type of Chinese sandwich which looked and smelt fantastic. We decided to get one for ourselves to see if it tasted as good as it looked.  Sure enough, the Rou Jia Mo sandwich was simply awesome.  My wife and I agreed that it would make a great late night snack...especially if you had a few drinks.The one downside about most of the dishes at China Poblano is their size.  If you go on an empty stomach, plan on ordering a few dishes.  Of course, that also means you get to try more dishes which is something I can live with.Now that my wife and I are based on the West Coast we go to Vegas often, and now that Jose Andres has a great place like China Poblano here I'm guessing we'll be frequent visitors. 4
The new owner of a year or so has done what is proper and just!  My ski jackets and paint for lost and his dealing with the problem was perfect. He was professional and prompt and always keep me in the loop.  Never did I think he would screw me and he just stood up and did the right thing.  Refreshing to see someone makes a problem go away instead of get bigger.  By making the fix to the problem right he showed me that this is a good company to deal with. The norm would not have done me right and I'd still have a problem or I'd have to compromise on some way. Thanks for being upstanding and honest, values our world need more of! 5
Rooms were acceptable, great pools, good restaurants.  The valets and servers in the pool areas were great. However, the service and the attitudes of the concierges and housekeepers at this JW made me a lifetime Hilton customer. 2
We moved down here from Flagstaff, so the first time I had Pita Jungle was up north. It was great food, but piss poor service up there. Occasionally we'd get sat and then the server or whoever would never show up... ever.When we got down here we found out there was a Pita Jungle down the street and we were a little apprehensive to go there due to a few bad experiences at another location. When we finally went, we had great service, and have returned quite a few times since.We try not to come here too often for fear of it getting old. The food is not always great, but still eatable. When it's not great, it's just a little bland (only thing keeping it from being a 5 star). The Chicken Curry Salad is hands down my favorite dish. I'm usually shocked by the portion sizes. I don't think I've ever had a small portion here. The Chicken Curry Salad and the Medchilada are HUGE. And that's not a complaint. They also have, hands down, the BEST hummus.Every server we've had here has been on point and speedy. I read a couple of other reviews about this location and I have retort: I don't care what my server is doing elsewhere in the restaurant as long as I get good service. If he/she is serving a table clear on the other side of the restaurant and my service doesn't suffer then I'm a happy camper.Part of the other reasons we keep returning to this location are the prices. Good size portion dishes are right at $10. Other places with similar dishes would be in the realm of $19-$23. 4
First of all. I'm a fan of chef ramsay and hope every thing perfect.  This is first time i try this burger.  When i walk to the host two girl cute asian just talk to each another and doesn't look at me. Until o ask for table for 1 they offer me to sit at bar it ok for me but she just point to bar and say go ahead snd back to talk to each another again. The burger need more salt it no test and asian salad is so so. It not matt for 14$ for burger and 13 for salad. In&out is alot bettet. 2
I first heard about this place from Cleveland Magazine's 2010 edition that focused on Cleveland's best diners.  We decided to check it out on a Saturday morning at about 10 a.m. The address is on Lorain, but consider parking on a side street to avoid the metered spaces out in front of the restaurant.  We parked on the north side of Lorain, because it seemed to be a slightly better neighborhood than on the south side, and only had to walk a quarter of a block to the front door.We were lucky when we got there, because there was just one open table and it was a two-top. Actually there seemed to be a charmed quality to the morning, because the place was continually full, but it seemed like every time a party walked in, one of the tables would finish up and leave ... no one ever seemed to wait more than 2-3 minutes before they got a table.The ambiance of the place was interesting.  As for the decor, it looked a little schizophrenic.  One side of the restaurant is sort of an industrial-80s homage, while the other side is a neo-graffiti mural of a Japanese-style monster attacking Cleveland.  It almost seemed like there were two owners who each got to choose the decoration for their side of the room.  The crowd was incredibly diverse for Cleveland.  There were a few families with kids, while at another table there were a group of bikers, and at another was a table of gentlemen of three different ethnicities. It was a mix of different races, economic groups, ages, and social statuses.The service was pretty quick.  We had a very attentive waitress who welcomed us and informed us that the restaurant had been in the newspaper that morning, and told us that she'd bring us the article to read.  We found this charming, although we didn't really care so much about reading the review.The menu is extensive and the prices are surprisingly low.  We took advantage of the the economical options to try out a few extra dishes.I ordered the "Three Eggs with Two Sausage patties, hashbrowns andtoast" for only $4. I also ordered a side of three pancakes FOR $3.50.My partner got the "buiscuits and gravy" which came with three eggs, and hashbrowns, for $5. He also got a side of corned beef hash for $2.50.Overall the food was just fine; it's exactly what you expect from breakfast food at a diner. My critique is that nothing was extraordinary.  The eggs were done very well.  Mine were scrambled, and were fluffy, without being too moist or too dry.  My partner had his over easy, and they were perfection.  The pancakes were light and very hot, which made them perfect for soaking up the butter.  There were a few minor disappointments though. The hashbrowns were mushy, without any real crust to them.  I think they were frozen potato strips that were kept on the griddle for too long without enough oil to make them crisp.The gravy for the biscuits was a little underwhelming, and may have come ready made.  The corned beef hash also seemed like it was from a can. Again, it tasted okay, but these are simple dishes that can be done easily and well from scratch.I mentioned before that the waitress was very attentive; unfortunately, the kitchen was a somewhat slow.  Despite the delay, the waitress did an amazing job of keeping our coffee full, and letting us know about where things stood in the kitchen.  While we would have liked our food about 10 minutes sooner than we got it, the customer service more than made up for the delay, and she waitress could hardy have done a better job of making sure we knew we had not been forgotten.Overall we really enjoyed our meal and will definitely be back. 4
I ordered a pair of shoes online in the same size, make and model as my current shoes but when they arrived they were actually an inch longer, a size bigger and didn't fit. I drove all the way to the store to inquire about exchanging them for a smaller size, or even another pair of the same size, assuming they'd been mislabelled. The owner/manager refused to listen to my request. He repeated rudely that there were no exchanges or refunds-- no exceptions. When I asked other employees if there was anything I could do they gave me a look like they'd like to speak up but didn't want to risk the wrath of the boss. I called Asics and they immediately offered to ship me another pair, admitting that mislabelling shoes can and does occur. I went out of my way to support Brown's when I could have ordered the same shoes for the same price on Amazon. I believe in small businesses. But I will never go back to this store and will make certain to tell all my cycling/running friends to take their business elsewhere. The owner has less concern for his customers than any business owner I've ever encountered in any part of the world. 1
I have just returned from the W Hotel in Scottsdale.  The hotel is beautiful however after the first night I awoke to a horribly swollen face which first appeared as a bug bite.  Went to a pharmacy for meds.  After the second night I awoke to a blistered face and called for the hotel doctor.  The doctor has told me that it is a contact reaction to something on the linens or pillow. He prescribed many meds, some unnecessary just to be on the safe side.  I was in Scottsdale to attend a wedding which of course was impossible to do.  The hotel provided another room for the last night as I was unable to leave in the condition I was in.  I have traveled all over the world, even to third world countries and have never had a problem with linens, etc.  I am not an allergic person or sensitive to new products, etc.  The hotel is willing to pick up my in room dining charges of $52.00 and takes no further responsibility.  They have checked for bed bugs!!!! 1
Well white spot.... Now you've gone and done it. We have been coming to the white spot for years and noticing the service start to tank. It's been three or four times of hour and a half plus meals because of service/not enough staff/no glasses/no cutlery. I honestly feel bad for the staff having to deal with hordes of angry people on a regular basis. Pity, because the food is always good. No more white spot for me, I'll be taking my business elsewhere. 1
This is by far the best Shwarma I had ever had! Service with a smile, tasty, and late hours. I would highly recommend for everyone to have it 5
There are only 2 pros to this hotel - location and shopping. With that being said...Where do I begin? I have had PH on my list of hotels to stay when visiting Las Vegas and I was looking forward to staying there. The pictures on line of course, appeared to be well appointed and contemporary. What the hotel offered was contemporary but worn and torn! The lobby is very misleading. It was clean, vibrant and colorful, which made me excited to see my room. As soon as I hit the elevator and saw the doors close, I knew something was very off. There were scuff marks on the walls of the elevator, scratches and initial carvings in the metal and the doors looked like they had been kicked several times with scratches and dents. Approaching my room, the hall way carpet was torn and stained in several spots, unravelling and bubbled in others. I came to discover during my stay that all the elevators were beat up.I got to my room, the Resort Room, and it was covered in a layer of dust everywhere. There were spill marks on the desk with splatter marks down the leg of it. By that point I was uneasy and checked the bed for bed bugs! I opened the closet to hang my clothes and noticed the wood was chipped all throughout the bureau, with the worst of it where the ironing board was placed. One of the drawers didn't open properly.I called to have the room cleaned and dusted. Throughout my entire stay of 3 days, no one cleaned the spill marks down the table leg. There were chips in the wood on the tables as well.The pool - another disaster! PH charges $118 for reserved day beds. That would be great if the daybeds weren't all stained with mysterious spots, some of them questionably large and obvious. Regular deck chairs are wobbly, with support bands busted off or missing. And since they were supposed to be white, they were visibly dingy.The casino - Signs pointing you where to go are confusing. As a group of 6, we got lost quite a bit, continually walking in circles, even when sober, lol! We actually started paying attention to location markers like light fixtures and escalators as points of reference because the signs were useless. Not to mention, the casino constantly had dirty glasses and beer bottles everywhere. The place just couldn't stay cleaned up. The Strip entrance to the casino was horrid. The glass doors were never clean, with a dirt film of finger and handprints covering the inside and outside.Call me partial, but I love a clean, well appointed hotel, no matter if its cheap or expensive. If I'm paying upwards of $800 for 3 days, I want what I paid for which is high quality, good service and cleanliness. I'm very disappointed with the cleanliness and upkeep of Planet Hollywood. I have stayed in many different hotels on the strip from the Stratosphere to the Bellagio and I will not stay at Planet Hollywood again. I will not recommend it to anyone. 1
I am a new home owner in Las Vegas and This is the first and only restoration company I will use. the service was exceptional. First off, they actually answered the phone, and we're very polite and secondly I was able to make an appointment for the next day and they were on time. That's the kinda attention a customer wants to receive. And the best part was the work was completed faster than expected and the estimate was right on!! 5
Got take out tonight. Trust me when I say Level 1 spicy is pretty damn spicy. Had the Street Noodle 2. Good choice. VERY limited menu. Don't go expecting to peruse lots of options. CASH ONLY. Good service. 4
Food: we ordered Beef Sashimi, special Tuna sashimi, scallop sashimi, black cod, spare rib, bibimbap, i also got the original ramue drink. Total is about $65 including tax and tip.we liked the tuna and cod the most, i personally liked all EXCEPT the scallop sashimi. it got a 'unfresh seafood' taste.... Black cod was amazing!! loved the miso flavour twist. downside: we did see a hair in the tuna sashimi the 1st time and i asked the server to bring me another one...kinda gross :S but we were so hungry (after the 2 hours wait!!!!) so it didn't actually impact our appertize.I'm only giving a 3 star is because: 1. wait time is radiculous. 2. server was too busy to pay us any attention. 3. portion is honestly a bit small compare to the price...taste of food deserves a 4 though. 3
SNOBBY STAFF. end of story. I wish I asked the 2 girls names so I could expose them on here and hopefully get them fired they were just plain rude and uptight. Get over yourselves. 1
Work til 8 a couple nights a week. The past three weeks I have stopped there and I couldn't get food. Three weeks ago they ran out of bread,  week two sign in window was closed for technical problems and last week sign in window said closed due to power outage while the lights were on and staff was cleaning up. I have tried to call Lisa (owner) who seems never to be there and left message without a return callEvery week I get same order 3 giant steaks and spend over $35. Not sure what goes on before 8pm, but don't waste your time driving out after 8. 1
Hyde Park does a nice job capturing the ambiance of prohibition era speak easy - a true relic of days past. The iceberg wedge was ambrosial but not byzantine. It was your typical wedge but infused with  a raspberry vinaigrette reduction. The taste flow of the burger starts with a fresh crispy sesame seed bun and finishes with the velvety savor of grass fed cow. The service showed flashes of eloquence but graded out average. The waiter forgot the asparagus but we didn't ding him for it. 4
Burgers were pretty good. I had the Nad-alie and my husband had the Tallulah Hula. We shared the Cajun fries which were just okay. I had the Peach is in Fashion Manhattan which was okay as well. Our server was very attentive and nice. Sitting outside (upstairs) was really nice! 4
On the plus side, the food was piping hot and the service was quick.  Quite simply, this was one of the most tasteless meals of my life.  I had to salt my food and put some of the hot peppers from the jar on my food to get some flavour.  Hot and sour soup:  It was very bland and not spicy at all, although it did have a few shrimp.  Even the Mandarin, now when you go to a Chinese buffet, many of the items are compromised, their hot and sour soup was much better.  Sea bass: boringNoodle dish:  boringSichuan chicken:  also boring.  Now, you would think that anything Sichuan would be hot and spicy.  This was not.  As another person on restaurantica put it perfectly, "Overall though the dishes lacked a bit of flavour punch, as we found every dish to be somewhat bland overall in flavour." 2
This is likely one of the most casual/no frills restaurants in Koreatown but the food is delicious  - the service is quick and they are generous with side dishes which I think is some of the best in Ktown in terms of flavor (not presentation).   The staff are always kind but don't expect exceptional service as this is a place where you go to get a fast and inexpensive meal- with most entrees (including 6 side dishes) at approx. $8, it's the best value of any restaurant in Toronto!  The food is always very fresh and always made to order...enjoy :)The kimchi or tofu stew are good options.  The sizzling platters can be a little greasy but so tasty : ) 4
First time at baton Rouge,  I was not really impressed. The decor was just blah, the tables were chipped yet the service was decent. I ordered my steak medium well which came back medium rare, vegetables were half raw. The best thing on my plate was the baked potato. Don't think I'll be coming here again 2
It's pretty much already been said so I won't bother repeating. This place runs like a factory. Smiles all around. Great food, although not particularly light food as you may expect from a Japanese place. 5
I had a chicken caesar wrap, the wrap was a green one denoting it was spinach. A pretty standard green flour tortilla wrap, but the contents were certainly worth the money. They load the wrap with real chicken breast meat that appears to be cut off a rotisserie chicken! It's very good along with the fresh romaine, and shredded asiago (?) Cheese stuffed inside. It was rolled nice & tight so it wasn't messy at all. My only gripe would be that they need to add more Caesar dressing or make the chicken more moist. I mean, it is loaded with chicken but the breast meat can be a bit dry. All in all, would def go back to to get a Wrap, or their pot pie-heard it was to die for good :) 4
This hotel was actually fairly nice for being so cheap. The rooms were clean and they have a free continental breakfast. I would have given this place 4 stars but their free wifi was broken and they've charged my credit cars 4 times now for this room. I understand that mix ups happen when charging hotel rooms, so I placed a call to the front desk to clear this up. The front desk clerk basically went psycho on phone screaming at me he can't help me. Didn't offer to take down my phone number and have me called back, just went straight to screaming as soon as I explained my situation. So now I'm dealing with their corporate office and my bank. Super 8 is a franchise, so there's not much their corporate offices can do to help even though they can view the transaction history and that I've been charged 4 times for the same room. What a headache! I would have saved myself a bunch of stress by staying at the Hilton Garden Inn for $25 more 2
This is one of my favorite restaurants in Arizona!  Great food, drinks and really unique and nice atmosphere.  However, tonight's service was not on par!  Our server skipped me when going around the table to take orders and then she left quick.  When something was said when the food was brought out she told me she thought I wasn't eating.  Well, I never said that I wasnt eating but did say I was not drinking.  Either way, as a server you should never assume. Then when I paid for my diet coke. .. $2.45, I gave her a $10 and she brought me $7 even back!  (Do the math) granted .55 is not a huge chunk but that is not right!  I was very disappointed, then when we asked who the manager was we were told it was that young lady who was our server. . Of course. 3
Jimmy's is an eclectic cafe in the heart of Kensington market. It's open air, tree shaded, back seating area is lovely on a warm summer's day. The prices are reasonable for what you get and while there's better coffee around, the atmosphere is nice and the staff are friendly. Their fascinating book collection is worth a look. 4
Great atmosphere,  reasonably priced drinks, bartender hooked it up in the tequila & sprite drink 4
good food, but if you order To Go, especially for kids, know that you don't any salad or bread for them and hardly any for regular meals. LAME. Their unlimited salad and chicken picata is yummy, but DINE IN for the unlimited salad and bread. 1
We have been here several times and it has been remarkable each time! We live out of town but it is worth the drive! We saw the Toronto Symphony orchestra perform Beethoven's 9th symphony. 5
Came here with a group for lunch and was very pleased to get to know this spot.  Service was excellent - quick, unobtrusive balanced with helpful.  I'm a sucker for duck of any sort and the confit was the perfect portion and very very tasty.  I'll be back! 4
Hostess was short, cold and did not look happy. Bottom line this place is a bar. Food is average at best and the lack of any decent appetizer makes it more below average. Go for a beer, nothing more. 2
The new owners don't know how to make general toa chicken.They didn't make it crispy and she started arguing that at least it is chicken and the chef said it went soggy in the sauce.  Both untrue. They wouldn't exchange or give a refund.  I even told them that I come there all the time.  Never again. 1
Food is ok, looks like a pub or a restaurant but expensive if u go by pub style & cheap  in terms of restaurant but then food is not that great 3
We were at Houston's tonight and the bartender insulted my husband. He had one and a half drinks, we were seated at a table for dinner, my husband stepped up to the bar with our friend Kevin just to have a conversation away from the table and get another drink and the bartender refused to serve him. And the way she did it was very rude and embarrassing. We had already ordered our dinner and they had just brought our appetizers, but after talking to the manager who supported the bartender, we got up and left. Here we are at Sumomaya having a fabulous time. We will NEVER EVER go back to Houston's again and will urge our friends do the same.  I have never seen my husband so insulted and angry as tonight. And it started out so well with my husband having a good time talking to a gentleman named Mark who has been on the board with Bob Bondurant since 1988............you're missing out Houston's........we're here year round when all the snowbirds go back to wherever and ate here regularly......you need a lesson in diplomacy! I would give you a zero but that's not an option. 1
Great beer selection! Got an Oktoberfest in the springtime, totally made my day! Mussels and poutine were great-granted made with cheese as opposed to cheese curds. Worth the moula, was a little disappointed in the sausage platter as it was not a lot for $9, but they had a good kick to them! Nice area, good place to chill and the staff were excellent! Definitely gonna have to hang out here more often. 4
If you want a tasty meaty lunch,  the sandwiches are good.  It is so busy in the evening,  it's hard to get in. Barque Smokehouse is a good place to take friends to with its big Roncesvalles - facing windows. 4
This little noodle bar is perfect for Vegas.  It was all about the show.  Watching the chef stretch noodles by hand made me want to eat here.  The interior of the restaurant was really cool too.  The quality of the noodles was great.  However, when I order a pork belly noodle bowl for $20, I expect more than a single piece of pork belly the size of a domino in a scrambled egg whites in a soy sauce based sauce.  So disappointed. 3
Delicious! ordered two steak frites, one with filet and both with Bearnaise sauce. The star should be the steak which was good but man I loved all the frites! I ordered my filet medium rare and I may just be being picky but it was more on the rare side. I still loved it either way! 4
I have been taking my kids here for years and they really like it! They really enjoy open gym every other Saturday night from 6-8:30pm. 5
If you are looking for quality real bakery. Here is the place to go. I have tried almost all if their bakery and o love it. They taste like no others. Just right sweetness and real ingredients' favour that you can smell,taste and see. This is real dessert that is harder and harder to find which should be appreciated. Enjoy! 5
Stay aways from this place. Although the classes seem good, all the good trainers keep quitting. The management is horrible, the managers keep changing so often and any issue you have( which is always the case with money) they just blame previous mangers. They keep charging your credit card in spite of cancelling your account. All that they say is they will look into it and never refund. I had requested for a refund because they had charged me two additional months even after quitting and its been over two months. They say they are a busy company and they are still looking into it. Well, they are a shitty company with shady practices. Very greedy for money!! 1
Not your usual bar food. Food is well prepared and very fresh. Their fried options are not dripping with oil like most bars. I have had their salads and have tried a few of their sandwiches (yum for blue dust club) and their apps are also solid. Very well stocked selection of beers. I also love how uncrowded it is, with seating never being an issue. Staff always very kind and attentive! Good bar w/ all the making of a regular hang out spot! 4
I hate leaving bad reviews for nice people but this deserves it.  He did great work and was in and out, which is why he got the two stars he did. But he didn't have all of the necessary equipment to fix a flushing mechanism in a toilet on his truck, when that was what we told him was broken. Seems like he would show up with the necessary tools for the job! To make matters worse, he was referred to us by our leasing company, it took him 2 weeks to get to us. 2 weeks without a flushing toilet!!! I understand it's not a huge job but it's also in out and move on! The most irritating part of it all, $73 for a simple fix. $8 for parts, $65 for labor when he was here for less than 30 minutes! After waiting 2 weeks I am happy to have a flushing toilet again, and he was very friendly, but next time I will be finding someone else. 2
We came to LV for a family vacation. We used our Choice points to secure the Bluegreen Club 36 Resort room. We had great service. It was 1 mile from the strip and close to the airport but once inside you could not hear the planes. Free shuttle to the strip every day. Free parking. On site restaurants and stores made it very easy to stay in and let the kids enjoy the indoor pool. Big rooms with washer/dryer, full kitchen and large bathroom with double sinks in one area and a single sink in the adjoining area. We would definitely stay here again. 4
Food was good the service on the other hand was terrible. Upon arriving we did get greeted and seated. However, we had to get the two servers attention to take our order. When we told one of the ladies we are ready to order she gave us attitude. When she brought our drinks over she just slammed it on the table and didn't even give us any straws. Now to the food. We ordered the beef soup dumpling, beef dumpling, house fried rice, deep fried squid, and duck. All were delicious! You can tell that the dumpling are made fresh. Overall, I would of gave this place a better review if the service wasn't bad. 2
Had salmon Benedict which was pretty tasty and the side potatoes were great.  The real surprise was was the fruit bowl that came with breakfast - best I've ever had! 4
Asked our cab driver for the best seafood buffet and the Rio Carnival Buffet was recommended as the best.  Our party of 6 was extremely disappointed as soon as we saw the seafood spread.  Variety was actually pretty good, but nothing screamed quality.  I would not pay the extra for the seafood if I were to do it again.  The regular buffet was an ok value but there are much better buffets for a few bucks more such as the Wicked Spoon at the Cosmopolitan. 2
I love the Pampered Pinkie, especially since  Shanna works there! I have been going to Shanna for five years and she does amazing work. She always knows what I want and what looks best. I trust her completely with my hair, she's never done wrong. She is very knowledgeable in her job, love going to her an  would never go anywhere else!! My mom also goes to her we love her. We recommend  her hands down. You will leave extremely satisfied! 5
Love this location, have been going for at least 5yrs. Staff is great. Facials fantastic 4
I went to Best Buy to purchase a new package on appliances, one of the sales person said that I was going to be next, while I was checking out the appliances I noticed that someone else came up and the started helping them out before me, I'm a Hispanic male so they didn't take me seriously. I did talk to a manager but he couldn't do anything for me. I went across the street to Home depot and they treated me like a customer, so I bought my new appliances there. 1
Called at 5pm to inquire about notary/courier services and they were able to come by my house by 7pm.   By 8:30pm all documents were notarized and brought to FedEx.   Amazing service.  Highly recommend. 5
I always wanted to eat at Hooters, I wish my first time would have been a better experience!! The food and drinks were excellent, but the service was horrible. Our server was "Jefanie" and she could work on her customer service skills. She was a bit inattentative and every time we asked her questions, she either didn't hear us or looked at us like we were crazy. I was there with my boyfriend and his best friend. I think she thought they were flirting with her every time they spoke to her, it was obvious to me. And the funny part was they didn't even think she was hot. I'm in the hospitality industry and understand that people not only go places for the product, but for the experience too, she made mine not so great for a first-timer and she got a $22 tip out of it anyway because we're nice like that. Next time we'll go to a different Hooters. 2
Great service . Courtney was lovely and cute :) will return for the steak and Mac cheese . 5
$118?! For dry cleaning everyday clothes!!Run fast and far to another cleaner, any other cleaner! Sad to say I didn't check Yelp first and paid big time for it. $118 for 17 pieces, no silk, no beads, not leather, cotton, nylon, sweaters none wool. I could have replaced multiple pieces for far less. 1
Ehh. Ok. Nice looking spot, but the entrees left something to be desired. Bar was full, but would be a good spot to just drink. 2
Not too bad, not amazing though. Tried brisket (good), garlic mash (ok), pulled chicken (ok), beans (great). The food felt a little pricey for the quantity, and no sides included with the sandwiches. The wrap was around the "snack size" wrap size from McDonalds, so don't go for that if you are hungry. No BBQ sauce sitting around (sacrilege for a BBQ joint) although you could buy BBQ sauce if you wanted BBQ on your BBQ. Staff was friendly.  There aren't many options in that immediate area, and there are quite a few businesses/offices around so maybe they have a captive audience? Or maybe I've just been spoiled by years indulging in the pleasures of southern BBQ spots. 3
Under omelets, it said "frittata". So... is it a frittata or an omelet?It's an omelet with lots of vegetables in it. So good with breakfast potatoes. There is a line to get in but it moves fast. It helps if you buy snacky stuff out on the street beforehand. We sat way back at the counter and it was perfect. Nice and quiet.I f'n loved Pittsburgh. 4
Went to new location behind cracker barrel last night. Really hopping this space will work as it is close and a cool building. Sorrentos moved from a small location by the college and the wait staff is NOT ready. Highly unorganized and not attentive. Sat at bar to get good service but did not receive. They forgot to put in appitizer, were not knowlegable about wine selections and 3 bartenders walked by our empty glasses for 10 minutes. There were only two other groups at the bar!!Knowing my wine I found a nice bottle of of Italian wine from Piedmont region. Wish I could remember the name as it was good. I had to order a bottle since after two glasses we couldnt get someone to pour us another. Ordered calamari app. Which the waitress forgot to put in. nice work. I did like it as the calamari was tender but the batter was a bit oversalted. The marinara was good. I had the veal marsala and my partner had the special halibut with a lemon caper sauce. Both were very tastee and it is worth mentioning the zuchini side with the fish was above average. they were not grilled but also not mushy and finished in a red sauce that was modified from the marinara. The canolis were average at best as the filling was little more than sugar and ricotta and was a bit thin on consistency. We love this location so we will give them another chance probably with the kids in tow. Hopefully they step up the service. 2
Pho is served in larger portions but unfortunately don't make up for its lacklustre taste. Haven't tried the other menu items . 2
I went to this place on my birthday because I had driven by so many times and needless to say was interested. I loved the overall atmosphere, it was so fun and the waitress was very nice. The menu does have a TON of choices but as far as the foods quality goes, I wasn't in love with it. It was a good time though so i'd probably go back. 3
We come here all the time but lately they can't seem to get an order right!!! Why is it that I have to check my order both at the drive thru, the window and when it gets to my car it's still wrong!?!  Why do you bother confirming my order if you are just going to give me whatever you want at the window? It's like playing Russian roulette!!! Totally disappointed. 1
For a discount sushi restaurant, this fits the bill! They give generous portions and their soup and house salad is good. Their salad dressing is just the right combination of soy and sesame - very addictive - I am trying to replicate the recipe at home. The service is average to slow, but never intentional rudeness that I have experienced - more that they are overrun with fewer servers than they should have... but if you need something - just ask for it. I like their teriyaki bento boxes, and the S7 lunch special - spicy honour roll & unagi roll. 4
This place is a total rip off! The guys there are completely dishonest. I got new brakes and rotors from these guys a month ago. This week my car started making a horrible grinding and knocking sound. When I called them, the manager told me that there was nothing he could do for me. So I took my car to the Honda dealership where they had to fix the awful brake job that this place did. I can't believe that they are a AAA approved shop. I have contacted AAA to file a complaint. 1
I had a wonderful experience with everyone at La Bella bridal. Erin was absolutely wonderful! She was very professional and very kind. Very honest as to what looked right and what didn't look right. I felt like she was a part of the family.. Thank you ladies for making my special purchase wonderful! One more thing! Their prices are amazing!! I would give them 10 stars if I could!                                    Lisa w. 5
This was my first time here for my bff's birthday and I have heard great things about this place but my overall experience really was just "meh. I've experienced better." From the very beginning my gf told me they had bad customer services. She booked 2 tables but not all of the party had arrived yet and the manager kept threatening that they will give away our tables. Terrible customer service, not very happy with how management deals with group parties. They wanted 16 people to sit at table that really fits no more than 10. Food is okay here, best dish that we ordered was the smoked meat poutine that was quite good. 2
I hate this airport!! The security lines are consistently the worst I've ever experienced.  They have TWO tsa lines for the ENTIRE airport.  That's right, TWO!  I once missed a flight because it took me 45 minutes to get through.  And the parking is terrible, too.  The lots are usually near full, forcing me to plan an extra half hour just for parking and walking.  And the tram is such a pain...they are understandable in larger airports, but PIT can find a way around it.  I fly out of Cleveland whenever possible.  They have security lines for each airline, parking is WAY easier, and the airport is much quicker and easier to navigate. 2
I used to enjoy Blazin Bills.  But the last couple of times we have gone we got slow service, high prices an the food is lacking. 3
So, based on my prior review, the district manager sent me a few complimentary meal vouchers.  I was hesitant to even go back . . . and I shouldn't have.  I got a cheddar, bacon burger that was so full of grissle and bone that I nearly pucked on the second bite.  I ordered a steak for my mother.  It was smothered with  . . . oh heck, I don't know . . but it tasted awful.  The steak was ordered medium, received well done, but did have good taste.  Sadly, and 85 year old woman couldn't chew the well done lump of a steak.  The chips and dip were as nasty as before.  The oil is old and tastes rancid.  The only good part of the meal was the dessert.  The brownie and ice cream were delicious, and about the only decent part of a $40 meal.  I'll never go there again, comp or no comp.  Not good food. 1
I highly recommend this place.  Dropped off a floor lamp this morning with the intention of leaving it there for a few days and willing to pay a certain amount.  He fixed it in 20mins, while I waited for a fraction of what I was thinking it would cost.  Great guy.  Really recommend him 5
First let me say, we ended up here after leaving another resort that did not meet our expectations. One step inside the front doors of this place and you know it's going to be a wonderful stay. All I have to say is you get what you pay for. Resort has absolutely stunning grounds and 10 pools! How can you not love that. Very nice Adult only pool with bar and grotto. The other pools with kids were still very nice and I found all of the kids to be well behaved. There were not tons of them as this is mostly an adult place anyway. Did I mention the grounds were stunning...we paid for a room with a garden view and it was worth it. I just loved sitting on our balcony taking in the view. Only weird part is that you share a balcony with the room next door which I did not like and proved to be a problem later on. Ate at SWB, food was good, prices were in line with resort fare I guess. Enjoyed the martinis at Cafe Due. Didn't have a chance to try Alto, though I hear it's out of this world. Live music was wonderful, I really enjoyed the Falmenco on Saturday night. Staff was always very polite, although poolside service is incredibly slow and the drinks are not that strong. For $9 solo cup pina colada I'd like a little rum please....I'm just saying. Back to the balcony issue. Our neighbors decide to have a large get together with their patio door open....this meant I could hear everything...I'd had fantasies about smothering the loud cackling woman who was keeping me awake with a pillow. By 1:15 am I had had enough and had to call the front desk. They said they had a "no tolerance" policy and would send security up. 30 minutes later no relief and no security in sight...I think I just finally passed out. The only other downside were the beds. Very uncomfortable and had a spring in my back all night. For the life of me I don't understand why hotels have to be this way. You pay a high price, you offer 5-star dining, you have the word "resort" in your name..lets find a way to put in comfortable matresses....mkay? Would have given them 5-stars if not for the issues listed above. 4
I'm never impressed by quantity over quality but I really wanted to like this place. The wait was 90 minutes for breakfast so we went and gambled and returned in 75 minutes $150 richer. Score!  So, we're all riding a jackpot high ready for some good food. I was drawn to the Benedict menu, while my dining partners had sage chicken and corn beef and cocktails. Maybe it was the alcohol -- they loved their food but I was greatly disappointed (drinking coffee).  I had the HH original that was supposed to have tomato cream sauce. I was unpleasantly surprised to receive a plate covered in marinara sauce; eggs, mash, biscuit covered in marinara. The biscuit on it's own-delicious. The mash-yum. The combination?  An utter failure. Where was the cream sauce?  My recommendation, drink heavily or win the price of the meal and you won't care so much. 3
My first time going there. The service was great,  Tracy is amazing nail artist. I would recommended to everyone. Love my nails.... 5
This is another place I'd never have stumbled upon had it not been for the Indie Coffee Passport. I'm never in the George Brown area. We dropped in on a Saturday morning and it was mostly empty.  Walking by, it looks like an old antique furniture store with a random assortment of unmatched pieces.No, but really, I like random, and I like the atmosphere, it's weird but well lit. I'll call it... cozy. I liked the big wooden table by the window I didn't have any luck connecting to their wifi with my ipod but I saw other people on laptops tapping away. Minimal plug ins, but they exist.It was a beautiful looking cup of coffee, but it may have also been the worst almond latte I've ever drank. I think it's great that they offer almond milk, but I'm not convinced they knew how to use it that day. Overall... my problem was that the coffee was very bitter. Way too bitter. Although it didn't effect me, this place is cash only. No Debit Cards Allowed! 3
Not really to go there !! I ordered a " Pork Chop Cutlet with Salad" ..... U know what ... thap Pork Chop Cutlet in dark color .... I think there oil was very old !! I didnt eat the Pork Chop .... For Salad is OK !! 2
Good food but my god the drive thru is so slow. Ive sat there for 10 minutes waiting for a basic order. 3
I ordered a vongole and a fettuccini Alfredo here. Even though they were able to pull off the flavors right something was just lacking in their dishes. Texture of the was ok as well. Just so so. The portion of the food though, vs the price was a bit on the pricey side. This Italian restaurant doesn't try to exceed expectations. Would rate this realistically 3 stars but I may think they would deserve 2 based on portions compared to other authentic Italian restaurants in town. 3
Used to be one of my favorite places till the pulled pork sandwich got smaller and the price got higher. As if this place wasn't already expensive enough. 3
food is so so ...We went there since we read some reviews. A little bit disappointed. The food selection is really too few compared with other buffet. But the service is great. We spent 95 dollar for two people there. Not highly recommended. 3
Slow service all while the front staff was flirting and chatting with each other.  Good food, just hard to come back when service is so poor and your paying a decent cent for the food. 1
I reunited with two high school friends in Phoenix, Arizona last Spring! Thank goodness not in the extreme summer heat! The other girlfriend flew in from Maryland and we both met up with our friend who gave birth to a baby girl who now lives in Phoenix. Phoenix girl suggested dim sum and to go to this decent chinese restaurant across town. I was hesitant since coming from bay area, we have really good dim sum in the area but nevertheless Maryland girl was craving some chinese food hence dim sum was it. We arrived at 11am and secured a table for 3. As we started indulging in our food, we noticed the stream of people coming in....suprisingly the food was fresh, tasty and decently priced. It was a memorable reunion nonetheless. :) 4
I was very disappointed with my visit here. I was here to make  3 copies of legal documents, I was here for less than an hour. I am not savvy with computers so my page kept turning off on me.. To make the story short I was charged a total of $2.79 ( the break down for these charges are as follows: 4 sessions @ .30 each time,  printed document @ .49 each .. hence total of $2.79).  I know $2.79 is not really much but its the principle .. honesty towards everyone.  I was here before and it didn't cost me $.49 each copy .. .. 1
My friend and I were bored one late late night, and quite famished, so we decided to google a 24hour restaurant; alas we stumbled upon this quaint little cafe. It wasn't ANYTHING like the pictures and website described it to look like. I was quite disappointed with the false advertising I received. It's not as nice as they make it out to be...AT ALL. It's anything but nice (in terms of what you're promised)...but it's got character, and its 24-HOURS. You can't beat 24/7...ESPECIALLY when they make desserts as deliciously as they do here. I inhaled some 4 slices of cake in one sitting! It was so moist and soft, it sort of just melted in my mouth. I barely had to chew.Oh yes, another thing I didn't find to my liking was the TERRIBLE SEATING! In every direction, there are people just an arm's length away. I'm VERY seat picky, they really took the terms 'close&cozy' to the next level. It was uneasy, and uncomfortable, I could hear my neighbour table's entire conversation. TMI lol. 3
So good. Just try it, you'll understand. From what I've tried, the Cream Of Leek Soup is the best item on the menu. 5
The dentists are good but they try to push extras.  After reading the reviews, I would agree that they are trying to make as much money per patient as possible.  The final straw for me was when they estimated the charges on a procedure they said I needed and it didn't match what the insurance company told me over the phone.  I even called to confirmed this with the insurance company three times ensure I didn't get an incorrect response from them.Buyer beware of this office. 1
I'm new to the city and finally took the plunge to committing to a new hairdresser. I also saw they did nails and was wanting to treat myself. So I booked both on the same day, one after the other. Booked the hair appointment online which was confirmed via email and I replied adding on the manicure. No problem. Effortless. Nails: I'm quite new to having manicures. Last time I went somewhere which was rated 4 star on Yelp and it was ok. But here was miles better. Good customer service. Had little chats now and then. The nails were prepares nicely, and my torn nail repairs perfectly! The drying process well executed. Polished and finished really well too. Lovely shiny nails that I'm getting many compliments on already and I only had them done this afternoon! It feels like excellent quality and have full confidence this will last (better than the other place's manicure). Also I was told to call up if I had any problems or mishaps with them! Great service!Hair: I had Franca I believe. She asked what I wanted, and she full understood. She even suggested an extra touch just to help my fine hair not look so flat. My hair looks just how I wanted it. Spot on! On top of all this the prices are great! Value for money! Will be using as a regular. 5
I bought the Groupon for 3 gel manis/pedis. The first experience was was terrible as I had Danielle, the same person Michelle C. had and I felt the same way about the quality. I was told that Danielle is the manager, so maybe doing the mani/pedi is not her area of expertise. This was the worst/mani pedi I have ever had. She didn't paint the edges of the nails, which left a really bizarre look with the whites of my nails showing all around the edges. My gel manicure lasted about two days and gel is suppose to last two weeks! I am giving this review 3 stars because of my second experience, which really redeemed this place for me. I had Gaylee (sp?) and she was fantastic! She did one of the best gel mani/pedis I have ever had. My gel manicure lasted 3 weeks! She was professional, friendly and very competent. My advice to the owner is - don't torch your reputation as a new salon by selling inexpensive services on Groupon and then have incompetent people like Danielle perform services in which they are clearly not  trained. I would have happily given a 5 star review if I would have had someone as adept as Gaylee on my first visit. 3
So, I have to start my review by saying that I am a BIG fan of Babbo's and have been frequenting their restaurant in Surprise since they opened. However, since they changed locations, I have been disappointed multiple times, yet...i keep going back thinking this will get better! Nope, wrong! My husband and I went in a few months ago,  45 min wait, so we approached the bar. There were 3 seats open, we went to sit at 2 of them, and were told they were reserved???? I'm sorry, I thought bar seats were for patrons waiting for a table??? Manager tells us otherwise ...she must have been expecting friends??? Ok, so we like the food, so we now resolve to only order takeout. So....tonight  ( Thurs nite in July...not a busy nite) we order takeout at 6:02. Then receive an email that order will be ready in 20 min. Show up 20 min later only to wait for Another 45 min for my order. In the meantime, the poor girl who has to deal with all of the disgruntled takeout orders...because I am clearly not the only one...decides to be bitchy back to us. Never an "I'm sorry for the wait..." Good food, but awful service and management at this location...bigger isn't always better 1
I walked in here to try it and had a Greenhouse Juicery bottle in my hand and I was asked to put it away.  Please.  I was immediately irritated.  In no way was my juice going to take away from the business I gave to you - until you said that.  Then I ordered less simply because of the rudeness.  Your food is nowhere in the same league so you should take whatever business you can get and be glad anyone stops in. 1
We were very disappointed dining here.Minestrone soup tasted like dirty water, had a meatball appetizer that were just okay and the pizza was terrible but the Pellegrino was good. 2
So I was at the Bier Markt tonite. It is definitely a packed place but I think they dont like coloured folks going over there. In this day and age that is so sad especially in a city as diverse as Toronto with all its diversity. The waitress was awesome but the patrons are just crazy. There is this small dance floor. I was dancing on the dance floor and for no apparent reason, this guy just kicked me on my chest. Usually when I go out for the weekend, I spend about a 100 bucks. I guess I will be taking my business else where. Sorry Bier Markt, if you cant treat your patrons nice, they will move else where. 1
I decided to try this Salon based on the reviews and I was disappointed. The salon was very nice inside and clean.  However I was disappointed in my stylist who I felt had no idea what she was doing.  I went in for a simple trim and my hair came out uneven.  I also noticed they l'oreal hair products, that doesn't exactly scream high class salon to me. 2
This small Pizza Restaurant in Parkdale is one of the favorites amongst my friends.  I have only had the pizza there and it is delicious.  It is served on a raised pizza serving tray and is cheesey and authentic.  In the summer the back patio is great. Be sure to check out the photos of the staff from 30 years ago! 4
I don't know what happened to this place. I went with my girlfriends on a Saturday night around 9 and the place was dead. Like no one there. The main floor just had the hostesses, same with the patio. The music was all over the place...country then hip hop then rock etc etc it was just kinda weird. I'm not sure if they changed their menus or if menus are different between weekdays and weekends but a lot of it wasn't on the menu (I got the Goat Cheese Bake during my first visit but it wasn't on the menu) and for the price that was paid for each dish, we really didn't get that much food. I got the perogies and although they were scrumptious, it wasn't enough to fill an appetite. The flatbeard is fine and fills you up. The fried shrimp and calamari is basically half an appetizer, even with the side of asparagus. And the Mediterranean chicken kebob is three baby skewers of dry chicken. I can understand if this is one of those places where you pay a bit more for higher quality but we barely got that. We were told by our waitress that there was a burlesque show later on in the night so we finished our food and went downstairs to watch. When nothing happened for about 25 mins we ended up leaving and going to a fest at celebration square. On the patio the waitresses were nice enough to provide our table with a heater and warm blankets. I really hope &co steps it up a bit, I really enjoyed my first time there and I would like to again in the future. 2
We ate at Fiamma before going to see Cirque de Soleil's Ka at MGM.  We made reservations for 6:45 p.m. and they were able to seat us right away.The table was right by the entrance and my seat was right behind the menu where people walking by could check it out.  I didn't really like that table b/c a lot of people were walking by and then they were right next to the table looking at the menu.Other than, that the food was excellent!  They gave us bread and olive oil, which was so good b/c we had two basket-fulls.  I ordered the sea bass and a side of potatoes and was completely stuffed.  I also had a glass of wine, which was great!  The restaurant is definitely pricey and it would have been nice if it was a bit cheaper. 4
After all the hype from other people talking about Farmer Boys I decided to give it a try. I am glad they finally opened the location in Centennial. I decided to go inside and order to go since it was my first time and I wanted to take my time checking out the menu. I read the reviews for the Farmer Boys location just to give me some feedback on what to order. I decided to just go for the Cheeseburger with grilled onions and I ordered the side of zucchini since that was what everyone was talking about on their reviews. The burger was okay, my bread got soggy real quick because of the sauce. The fried zucchini was huge, they were just okay to me I prefer my fried zucchini to be smaller. Overall, I would probably come back since the staff was friendly and I'd like to try some other things on their menu. 3
Christmas Eve / Morning. Only place open in town. Understaffed, extremely slow service. The ladies room smells of sick so profusely that it can be smelled strongly in the vestibule. The hostess is oblivious as to why they are so busy (not even half full). One egg over cooked and the other under. 2
Okay, this review is long overdue, but I just had the worst experience at Pandora Queens Centre Mall in NYC that I remember the verrrrry nice lady at Pandora Fashion Strip Mall Las Vegas who helped me select my first ever set of charm bracelets in 2012. Until now, I remember her kindness and patience in helping me select my charms. She was very positive and never pressured me. She convinced me, though, to take the Vegas dice because they are limited edition, and it was a good decision. She was a single mom to a teen-age boy who moved to Vegas to start a new life. If ever Pandora is reading this, please promote her to Staff Development Leader...then let her teach the ones at Queens Centre Mall how to do it right. She knows what she is doing and she doing it from her heart. When I return to Vegas, I will sure go back to her and experience a magical purchase again ( one I was robbed of here at Queens Mall NYC).j 5
I walked around the building 3 times before figuring out the entrance was in the back. Then figuring out where to order was a challenge as there are 2 areas that look like they could be ordering stations. Terrible service. The people that work there have an attitude. I ordered a coffee with whipped cream. They put maybe less than a tablespoon on top. So I asked for more. The woman looked at me and disappeared. I assumed she was getting more whip, she comes back and calls my name for my coffee. I'm already standing in front of her and I ask again for more and she leaves again this time comes back with the whip and puts less than a teaspoon on. Needless to say the whip was amazing but why be stingey with it?! The coffee tasted watered down. 2
We went in for Restaurant Week and it was fantastic. We were both happy with the caesar and the mixed green salads. The steak and lobster was a really good deal plus you get a sizable loaded baked potato to go with it. The lobster tail was also larger than either of us anticipated. Our server was extremely helpful and as good as it gets. The bar service was very good as well as we had a couple drinks there first during happy hour ($7 off regular price). I'm sure we'll return. 5
This place is awesome! Just moved to Vegas on Sunday. I've had 3 separate occasions when I bought e-juice from a local smoke shop and they were TERRIBLE.. One actually gave me a headache ( never ever buy a juice from the company called 'Dolce Vapes'). Anyways, I went into Vapor Bombz and it was great. Edgar recommended some great liquids for me and my taste and the prices were very fair. They have a rewards program so after 9 bottles you get the 10th free! If you Vape like me, that adds up pretty quickly. I definitely recommended this shop it's amazing. 5
This place is fantastic for Sonora style fried fish and shrimp tacos. The toppings bar is awesome for making your tacos the way you want, and the staff is very friendly. My only knock would be the ventilation isn't amazing and it is a smaller space, so it can get a little stuffy and you'll leave with a full belly but clothes that smell like fried fish. 5
I used to really like this store. They have neat little trinkets and just all kinds of fun items you won't find everywhere.  I go and browse fairly regularly and try to buy something every visit, because I like to support local businesses. However, after my last visit, I don't plan on going back. An employee there was so rude that I put back my items and left.  If you want to shop somewhere where the cashiers have that snobby, mean girl attitude, go here. If not, go elsewhere. 2
Seemed completely over staffed. While that's fine, someone in that staff should be competent, associates seem fine, but even manager/lead seemed incompetent. Employees should be trained better, and that does not exclude the manager. Don't tell customers false information, if you don't know, just admit it. 2
Beer = good. Sliders = burnt meat nuggets on cold stale bread. Nice servers. Nice atmosphere. 2
Some stores have great prices, others are absurdly, insanely, high. The food court is terrible. There is a highly entertaining place for the kids to play, including an interactive screen on the floor. Not much fun when there's too many kids though. And the enclosed play area is only for very small children. My kids were too big at age 3, which I think is highly absurd, especially since it's usually quite empty. 3
Love love love it..... Al pastor is bomb not huge on the ground beef empanadas are life.... Over all great 4
Worst customer service ever we received. Me and my friends were pretty disappointed. My friend's glass had lipstick stains and when we told our server, instead of apologizing, she claimed its because of dishwasher. We asked for forks and knives and we were giving just one fork and one knife for 5 girls to share. Our server was giving our weird stares. Worst customer service ever! Would never go back again. 1
I guess this place is OK if you live nearby but there is no reason to go out of your way and this place is definitely out of the way.. Dark, depressing atmosphere. Usually dead inside.Food is just OK and actually overpriced. I ordered a Tuna Melt for I believe $8,95. I got the smallest tuna melt I'd ever seen. Seriously, I left still hungry. And oh yeah... this place has the TIGHTEST VIDEO POKER MACHINES IN ALL LAS VEGAS! 2
Great customer service from this location. Food was descent and dining area was clean. 3
So over priced for what you get. Portions are small and average tasting. Yet another over hyped downtown Toronto restaurant. The decor and patio are beautiful so save yourself some money and just go for a glass of wine after work. 2
I was visiting from California and after seeing other reviews and pictures I decided to try this place. The service and food was AMAZING! There were 3 people in my party and we were pretty hungry after traveling all day so we ordered quite a bit of food at first and our waitress asked if we were pretty hungry and even though I said very hungry, she suggested that we wait on a couple of the rolls we originally ordered because their rolls were quite large. She was right! We had the perfect amount of food and left very full and happy! Their prices are very reasonable, the food was quick and the staff was very friendly. I highly recommend this place!! 5
I've taken a pair of Jimmy Choo's and just took a pair of Tory Burch wedges to JR and they both came back perfect! Service is always great! Very fast and reliable! Thank you! 5
Senior's!  I ,was walking in the Strip Sat 2.45pm March 16th, past Stan's Market ,there was a Senior Around 70 yrs old. Playing his Guitar i stopped to listen,  on the west side of Stan's Market! a person told the Senior to move, that he can not play there. That he owned the Property. "Sidewalk " this person Happen's to be the owner of "Trader Jack's"so he say's! Bridgeville Pa.,Mr Jack! became loud and was Swearing at the senior, Mr JACK picked up his Music Equipment  Amp, Battery ,which he get;s power for his Mike & Guitar, and throw it at the senior while he was packing up.  the Battery landed in the Guitar Case,  the Senior was Very, Very Upset. All this Man was trying to do was make enough Money, for him &his wife to Pay the Bill's. and have Food!! Is this how we treat our Senior's??? this even made me upset to witness this! i thought ,Mr Trader Jack was going to hit This Old Man.  "The Space is a "Public Side walk" free to walk ,and Stand! 1
SO much fun!! The show was about an hour and a half long and filled with great music, comedy, and, of course, awesome dancing. A lot of the music is geared for a younger crowd so some people may not care for it. But it was a blast! 5
Loved it!  We were looking for good Japanese off the strip (way cheaper) and found this jem...  Great selection and quality!  The tapas menu format is a little confusing given that some things are not really to be shared ...  Some more guidance on the menu could prove beneficial to future guests.... 4
Very serviceable the few times I've been. Won't blow you away but the food is good. The Las Vegas roll is delicious. Tootsie rolls are good too. A bit pricey if you really get in a sushi mood. Atmosphere is good and service is generally good. Decor is a bit weird especially if you get seated in the awkward area in the back near the rest rooms. 3
This cute little breakfast spot was a great find on our recent trip to Montreal. The little old man stirring the milk in a pot at the front of the restaurant to make the perfect cafe au lait was a great touch! We had the cheese croissant, pain au chocolat, and butter croissant, and all were delicious! We will definitely be stopping back in this place on our next trip to Montreal. It was quaint, nothing fancy, but you can tell it has seen many years of grateful patronage. The tables in the back are mostly antique sewing tables with push pedals for old sewing machines! 5
Pros: Environment, waitress serviceNot so con: Asian Chicken Sesame SaladCons: Not know their Wi-Fi password Is it a good restaurant for kids? NoIs it good choice for big groups? NoIs the parking lot enough to accommodate the customers? No parking lotAround 12:00pm after I found that the St Lawrence market does not open on Mondays, I started to find a good place to have lunch on Old Toronto and I discover the The Corner Place. When we arrived, we could sit on any place because the place was not crowded.The service was friendly and nice and the salad did not take so much time to arrive. But, at least, for me, when I arrive at place where the Wi-Fi is available I like to have access. I tried all the variations provided by the waitress and none worked. On the end, she asked me to look for one of the customers and ask him how they connect. Very bad negative point for me.Overall, the salad was okay. To be true, I prefer the Asian Chicken Sesame salad from Panera Bread. The dried noodle was very hard to eat and most of the salad components were cut in chunks instead of niece pieces to eat with a fork. What makes a mess while you are eating. Well... I did not get excited with the food this time. But I intend to come back here again next time that I visit Toronto, I notice other dishes on the menu that called my attention. 3
A friend and I discovered this spot after trying unsuccessfully to secure reservations at several Distillery District restaurants. We were looking for a nice meal before attending a play at Soulpepper. The entrance to the restaurant is actually inside the entrance to a commercial building. Our wait staff was friendly and efficient. We shared a large roasted beet salad which easily could feed three and a zucchini pizza. Both were tasty although the beets were a tad on the mushy side and the pizza crust was somewhat soggy, not crisp. We also split a 1/2 bottle of wine. The washrooms are outside the restaurant itself and are available to anyone in the building in general. All in all a reasonably priced, good meal within an easy walking distance (10 minutes) of the theatre. 3
The food was so bland. My wife got shrimp fried rice and I've had better at the food court in the mall. And I had a seafood soup that lacked a lot of seafood... both of our shrimps in our meals were dehydrated flavorless  not fresh shrimp ...we will not eat there again .. not sure what all the stars were about 1
1st time dining here on Friday. With friends. Nice cozy place. Ordered many appetizers and  entrees and tried them all. Fish was fresh and appts were unique and tasty. Fish stew was excellent dish. Bartender Brandi was a delight and Server Dottie made for  a perfect evening with friends. We'll be back. 4
Pros: Right next to Chase, they have beer.Cons: Atmosphere is super lame, not as hip as Slider's was. It's more like going to a Chili's rather than a cool sports bar, hard to get pumped for the game there. The beer selection is limited, that's fine I usually drink domestics at sporting events. Wont find a IPA or a STOUT here though.  Staff is friendly but lacking enthusiasm. The old school Slider's Shot Girls and Beer Girls were much quicker and easier to order from (no waiting for you drink to arrive). Live music is okay but might be better post-game. The crowd seems to respond better to newer music to get pumped/ excited.  Food is fine, I had the nachoes there once, a lil' over priced but that's cause of the location. I save my money for $1.50 dogs inside Chase.my summary: I would give GAME 7 one star but the fact that it's close to the Field and they serve beer is the only thing saving them. BRING BACK SLIDER'S 2
This is a pretty good Metro. (and Yes, 3 stars is good for a Metro... it's not like we're talking Longo's!)Highlights:- Huge store- Fresh seafood with a wide variety- Excellent meat department- Bakery- Deli- Decent size produce usually well-stocked and fresh fruits and vegetables- Wine rack- Private parking lot- Close to the Beer Store and a gas stationTips:- Stay away from the hot food section and "The Creeper" (see Anton K's Review) 3
Waitstaff completely ignored us after being seated on the patio.  After asking the clueless hostess if she could find a manager she told us that she could not find him anywhere.  We ended up leaving the restaurant.  This used to be a go-to location, but we will not be visiting here again. 1
We "dined" at Eddies this past Saturday evening and I can tell you...WHAT A DISSAPOINTMENT!  First, we made a reservation and showed about 15 minutes early.  Even though there were plenty of empty tables, we were told that our table would not be ready and that we could go to the bar and have some drinks until it was.  OK, we did just that.  Just after ordering our drinks at the bar the hostess came to us and said that our table was now ready.  Not having our beverages in hand we thought it prudent to wait for the beverages (half price at the bar) but hostess said that we would then have to forfeit our table.  OK, so we went to our table without beverages ("no problem" says bartender,  she hasn't yet mixed drinks. )  No problem because the hostess will reorder our drinks at twice the price!  THIS IS A SCAM!  IT LEFT ME WITH A SHITTY TASTE IN MY MOUTH.  On to the food, the inglorious food....  ANOTHER SCAM! Ordered Eddies version of crab rangoon with some kind of sauce, very ordinary (had better in Chinese restaurants.)  After receiving appetizers our server disappeared for about 30 minutes before taking our dinner orders.  Girlfriend ordered East Meets west which she let me sample.  She said it was good.... Im not so sure. Bland and not at all interesting.   I ordered the burger which came with wilted lettuce and mustard so old it had a crust on it.... no kidding!  IF this were my restaurant I would be ashamed to serve food like this.    Also ran out of water during dinner and no one came by to refill or ask how we were doing.  SERVICE?  MEDIOCRE AT BEST!  I have worked in many restaurants in my 46 years and I can tell you there are much better to be had.  Celebrity....if thats what you want, thats what you get.  In all, I won't be giving Eddie's a second chance.  The food is overpriced, mediocre at best and the sales tactics are disgusting.  What an (intentional) ripoff!  Thanks but, NO THANKS! 1
Fun after-school stop for me and my daughter. Iced Coffee was so good and she got a chocolate muffin which looked good. I'm happy to see they also carry gluten free baked goods. The guy working was really sweet and let us stay and hang out past 4(closing time) and didn't rush us at all. They almost should stay open until 5 though since it was so busy right around closing time.I've been here twice before and both those times were great too. Friendly staff, cozy seating and great coffee and treats! 5
5 star.Perfect service, food amazing.They have the Truffle of Alba... That s awesome. The best restaurant in Vegas for quality of service, food and it s very quite.There isn t the Music. ( FINALLY a place where you can talk)Highly reccomended. 5
Won't be back, oily hand prints on steering wheel , shifter, radio knob, door handle inside and out, oily foot prints. No consideration for peoples vehicles 1
Unless you can get this hotel for under $100 skip it. The staff is nothing short of arrogant.  They should skip on over to the Wynn and learn about customer service.  Undeniably the rudest hotel front desk I have ever encountered.Rooms and carpet could use a expert cleaning.  Everything is looking and feeling old.  I think you could do better for the price. 1
My husband and I were victims of theft/robbery during the day while at the pool.  Someone came into our room and stole several belongings.  The privacy sign was on the door and someone came in anyway.  The door was shut, someone had another key.  We are currently waiting for our investigation to go through however, beware of your valuables!  Put them away. I thought at a five star hotel we would be safe of such theft.  My husband and I were wrong! 1
Love this place!!! From the staff to the coffee the whole experience always makes me happy. If ever you're having a bad day, head over and grab yourself a coffee or heck even when your having a great day! Thanks for putting a smile on my face! You guys rock!!!!! 5
I used to enjoy the paradise bakery that was at this location. The food was fresh and they made it right in front of you. This place just seems so automated from the get-go that I wonder who or what is making my food. Walking in the door: the flow of the restaurant is very congested. You have to struggle past the people "avoiding the line" by using kiosks just to get to the line. Then, after you place your order, you have to squeeze past them again to the beverage station. It's just a stupid design. The food:  I ordered a sandwich, which I have no complaints about, and when asked what side I wanted, I chose apples instead of chips. When my sandwich came, I was surprised and appalled to see an entire un-sliced apple on my plate next to my sandwich. Not only is this poor plate presentation, it just seems lazy. I most likely won't be back. The food is mediocre, the chairs uncomfortable, the awkward traffic at the front door is annoying, and they are too darn busy doing whatever else to core and slice an apple. 2
Neither service or food was worth the price. Our table was forgotten for over 20 minutes and server returned to table irritated because we asked for her. Expected much more since Tom is such a ball buster on the food shows - perhaps he should dine in his own place more often. 2
Highly not recommended.1. Sushi rice was as thick as a pillow2. The sashimi on top of the rice pillow was poorly sliced with rips and tears on it3. Sushi was warm4. Waitress didn't even know what they were serving..reminded her our eel sushi hadn't come yet. . And she pointed to a random sushi already on the table and claimed that to be the eel5. The only thing to compliment was the mango pudding dessertOverall, ranked lowest of the ayce Japanese restaurants I've been to. 1
The views are fabulous down at Harbourfront and this place tops it when it comes to views.  We waited 15-20 min on a Sat which isn't bad. But they sat us at a really dirty (filthy) table. They came to clean it but it was still dirty. We moved inside. The menu is rather simple. Very very little in terms of vegetarian or vegan options. Add a gluten free or vegan option and this place would come up a notch. Coffee selections poor. Bathrooms not quite up to what they should be. Staff friendly. We preferred the IL fornello by far.  This place could be great and I hope they give attention to a few finer details. Some of the nicest summer views in the city! 2
I was pulled in by the sample, watched how it was made in disgust. Little to no meat. And when I asked the cook why was is so small he said you ordered the special!...way over priced.at least my fries where good. 1
My fav place for 2 reasons 1 Butter Brew!2 Luke!  one of the nicest baristas I have encountered 4
I purchased a car from here and continue to have minimal service done here.  I do my own oil changes and other small service since I don't trust dealers to do it right.  I have had warranty work and things like tire mounting and balancing done here.  The tire mounting and balancing has always been fine, but the warranty service has left a little to be desired.  After replacing a shock in my car, the car now sits lower at that point where the shock was replaced by about a quarter of an inch.  However, this is within the generous factory specifications for the car so they won't do anything.  For things you can't do on your own like a tire mount or balance, they're fine with a coupon.  However, anything else I wouldn't really trust them to do it right. 3
Don't get me wrong- the food is great! Fresh and tasty and better than any Greek place around. But the service sucks! In all the times we have come here, we have never gotten our food in less than an hour and our order has never been right. Not even once. This place needs some decent wait staff and  to get organized. If it did it could be one of the best restaurants in town. 3
The food was ok.  The mushroom appetizer was good, and so were the sushi.  The major complaint is the service.  When we are sitting down, a woman was complaining already that the server took a long time to come around.  But her english was bad, and I don't think the hostess took it seriously.  Unless my wife and I experience the same thing.  We order a bottle of decent saki, and our waiter had to be reminding twice to refill our drinks.  And he got two of orders wrong.  He made some excuse about the system, but one order was wrong after I reminded him of my hamachi order after getting the yamato roll.  We told this to the manager, not sure if he will do anything.  I think we was just going to calm the customer, I told him it was one of the worst services in Vegas, and we have been to many places (including cafes and Joel Robuchon's place) of wide range.  I strongly recommend you complain quickly if you see a skinny waiter with glasses and goatee comes over.  A true disappointment. 1
I had a very good experience with Dr. Griego and his staff and am pleased with the results of my Mohs Surgery.  I would recommend him to my family and friends 5
This place is amazing! The staff is always friendly and the prices for the services are pretty fair. The products are a little on the pricey end but they may be cheaper than other places. When I got my member ship I was given 9 free week passes for my friends. Also they sent me an unexpected hand written card with a 5$ gift card in it. I like all of the services a lot but I swear by the red light therapy! I just had a baby and it is healing up my stretch marks like magic :) 5
I ordered rangoons and Pad Thai for delivery through grub hub. My order arrived in about half the predicted time--score! The rangoons were a bit too cream cheesy for my taste, but the Pad Thai was mmm-mmm good. The only thing is that I'd probably order the spiciest rather than medium-spicy, since I'm a chili head. Overall, two thumbs up: the feel-good restaurant of the year. 4
I was with citizens Bank of Massachusetts for 10 years. We  relocated to Squirrel hill and I thought that the service would be just as good. Unfortunately the service got worse. Extremely long lines at the squirrel Hill branch and managers that have their hands tied and can't do anything to help fix problems. Any issues you may have you have to call the 800 number and you have long hold times. I like a bank where I can go in and talk to somebody and I can get something done. I am not a fan of citizens Bank. 2
To start the service was terrible. Total dining experience took 2.5 hours when it should have taken and hour or hour and a half. Not only did it take forever to get our food ordered, to come out and even longer to get the check when we were more than ready to go. Food was okay however later that night I discovered something was very bad. I got food poisoning from the salmon Caesar salad and was sick for almost a good 24 hours. Bad experience all around. 1
I would have to agree with the first gentleman on this review site, we worked with the employee Mortgage planner from January of 2012 until June 2012 trying to get as the first man said our dream home, we however did not get the home, due to the negligence of the planner and the underwriter, which to my understanding was fired.  They had no clue as to how to figure out disability income, or what to ask for when it comes to how long the disability income would last, the FHA inspector they used was an idiot, and cost us 400 for the appraisal which was lost, they denied us verbally over the phone after they demanded we provide documents the government does not issue, again and again, they told us it was going to be approved on a Friday and by Monday the incompetent staff there had decided they would not approve it, because they over looked something else.  I heard for 6-7 month we just need one more document, so for 6-7 months my family and I were in the house then out of the house.  My suggestion to you would be get a loan fro the Devil before even calling these incompetent lenders.  Not really sure how they are in business.  GO SOME PLACE ELSE AND GET A LOAN.  THEY WILL STRING YOU ALONG AND NOT GIVE YOU A LOAN, ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE NON-TRADITIONAL INCOME, like I have. 1
The food is good, perhaps great, but the service is so piss-poor, that I feel offended every single time that I dine there.  Yet, I still keep coming back for the good food.  If I try to place an order over the phone, no one EVER picks up the line.  When we go there to dine, there is always an unbelievable wait, and the apathy on the part of the staff is offensive.  Often, certain items that are on the menu simply aren't available.  I have a love-hate relationship with Lolo's.  All soul food restaurants in Phoenix suffer from this same lack of professionalism.  It's a disgrace to our race and impedes us from entering into the mainstream. 3
We bring our Miller pack whenever we go away and love that we can watch them on the camera. . They take good care of our little furbabies! 5
Recpetionists and  waiter assigned to our table deserve 5 stars. Very accomodating, warm, and service-oriented. We came for a Thursday lunch, slow day for the restaurant. Price was reasonable. Food selection  limited. Food presentation appeals to your senses. However, the taste was more of on the salty side.I thought that the "so-so" menu selection and food quality was going to be compensated by the excellent service of the staff. However, our dining experience felt disappointing towards the end.I was making my way back to my table after using from the restroom.  After walking by one of the servers (her name is pronounced A-chi), who was at that time bussing dishes, I heard her say "Hi!" with a high tone of voice, somewhat arrogant, not friendly at all. She asked if I was looking for something. She kinda mellowed down with the tone of voice after she found out that I was a customer at the restaurant. That was really so disappointing!!! I just felt discriminated. Not a good experience. 3
We order from here a lot. Very consistent and good. I really like the Italian meals. Although, they stopped putting mozzarella on top of the meals, which I liked. Never had a problem with delivery or pickup. It won't knock your socks off, but it is good and cheap and quick. Pizza is good too. So are the hoagies. 4
Heaven....that is the only way to describe Tien Wong Hot Pot. I have never written a review before, but had to after eating here last week. Hubby and I moved to AZ a few years back from CA, and the thing we missed most were our nights out for Shabu. When I discovered this place via Localdines, we knew we had to try it. After our meal, I wanted to jump out of my chair and hug Chef Johnny Chu!! He visited each table that night making sure everyone was enjoying the experience. I have been dreaming of the beef tongue, wagyu beef, razor clams....and well, everything... ever since! I was so happy to see a long line forming as we were leaving. I want this place to stick around!! 5
Pro tip: be prepared to wait. The restaurant is located near the entrance of the Planet Hollywood Casino. I went for dinner at around 6 and was seated at about 7:30 pm, BE PREPARED TO WAIT! Especially for dinner, I had a party of 3. If it's just a couple they will most likely have you wait in line in front of the restaurant. The hostess were very snotty and I was not told any party that's isn't for two must check in with the hostess and they will text you when your table is ready. I waited for about 20 mins before a hostess came to get information for each couple. At that point I was told to give them my information. There was a huge misunderstanding. Be various of the line, it is best to check in with the hostess first.Once we were seated, I started off with the sweet potato fries which where delicious. The food overall was probably one of the best gourmet burgers I had. Although I am not a huge fan of over easy egg, the duck bacon was spot on and the combination of both gave it a great pazzaz.Overall the is a must if your in Vegas. Defiantly worth the wait, it may be pricey for what you are getting but the burger was a mouthful. I would recommend to be spontaneous in what you order because Gordon Ramsey special designed each dish. A job well done! 5
Went here Thursday for a bday. Got the lobster shrimp combo. One word..amazing! 6 lobster tails, dozen jumbo shrimp with that crunch and sauce! It says feed 2-4,  but it can feed 4-5. The cold spicey noodles were really good. The cucumber app were also really good. Had a great time here. Everyone were really nice. Kind of pricey, but for a special occasion like this, it was worth it. 4
The food was god but really could not enjoy it to the fullest because of all the flies..there were so many flies inside and outside.landing on the uncooked food.. The guy sitting next to the meat made no effort to get the flies off the raw meat ... they really need to get that under control.. 2
Just came by to check the menu!  But as soon as I walked in; it presented a great atmosphere!  All were kind! They gave me a all day breakfast menu, along with the Lunch Menu.  I had the steak and eggs, it was made just the way I like it!I'll be back to try some more! 5
There Isn't one thing about this shop that I don't love. The staff, the beautiful, organic, & unique jewelry, the sultry atmosphere, and the service. I finally walked into a piercing studio where the employees didn't act all stuck up & blow me off (which sadly has happened to me at some other studio's, I will leave out names for their sake). I have so far got my neck pierced & ears gauged from both HTC locations, and I have always been 110% satisfied with the results. I now have my designated piercing place to go to for anything I may need. 5
Pretty reasonablly priced crepe and fondue place.  Had the Flamenkuche at the waitress' recommendation which was a soure creame, cheese, bacon, onion tart which was nice. The chocolate fondue was pretty run of the mill but it had some creme puffs as a dipping options which I liked.   Date liked the cholocate ganache dessert crepe.   $10-$15 per plate. 4
An interesting mix if Indian and Nepalese food.  It's a small place in a strip mall but worth trying.  The service is friendly and we met one of the owners (or managers?) who was from the Bay Area and chatted about Indian restaurants back home.  Tikka Masala and Butter chicken are tasty but not at the level of my favorite in SF (Mehfil).  Best I've had in Vegas so far. 4
Best steak in Vegas. Best mashed potatoes in Vegas. Best French restaurant in Vegas.MAKE MAKE MAKE RESERVATIONS!Decided to leave this place as our last meal in Vegas and I wouldn't want to have it any other way. Our server made our experience 10x times better. He was extremely attentive and friendly. He knew when to stop by and when not to. He knew what to recommend and to describe how everything was prepared. I will never forget asking him what the special of the night was and how well he described it that I had to ordered it. Beef Wellington. Unfortunately, they had run out of it. So he recommended I got the filet mignon, as this is what the restaurant is well known for. I do not regret listening to him. The steak was cooked perfectly. Medium never tasted so good. My brother had the filet mignon as well but his was with mashed potatoes and mine with fries. I ended up leaving him without mashed potatoes because they were too good for me not to eat them off his plate. They were creamy, fluffy and soft at the same time. No wonder this place is always packed. They will definitely be seeing me again. 5
I don't get it regarding the Lamars reputation. The donuts are so average. The coffee is nothing special either. It may sound snobby but I have high standards because I have had donuts from bakeries in New York. Now those are a real treat to look forward to. I'm glad LaMar's has their fans but I will not be going back.I'm done trying them and each time hoping it will be better than the last visit. The Bell and 23rd Ave location is clean and comfortable. The service is friendly. I don't care for the twenty something music playing overhead and it is too loud. 2
I have never had a bad experience at this nail salon until today.  The tech I requested was busy so I unfortunately had to go with a different tech.  My pedicure went fine, that was just fine.  As for my manicure...this is the first time I have ever recieved a manicure that the tech did not soak my hands in soapy warm water..  Instead used a squirt bottle.  She barely wet my finger tips and then proceeded to barely push back the cuticles.  Needless to say there was not much cuticle to snip off.  Granted, it had only been 4 weeks since my last manicure, but I could see that there was plenty she missed!  I was irritated and told her that I had never had a manicure like this and she gave me some lame answer.  She had been talking and talking to the other techs the whole time until I questioned her about the job she was doing.  Then she got real quiet.  She didn't even put lotion on my hands and massage them like the techs always do there.  She painted my nails and by then I just wanted to get the hell out of there.  I was there an hour before closing time so my guess is she just wanted to get the hell out of there too.  It was the lamest most unprofessional manicure I have ever had.  I can't believe I paid for it.  I should have complained to the girl at the desk but instead I'm on yelp.  Her name starts with an H and ends with a N.  Good luck to you if you are unlucky to get her.  I'll go back to the salon and make sure I stick to the techs I know do a great and professional job.  Again it's the first bad experience I've ever had here.  I have been a customer there for the last two years. 2
It unfortunate that this is so close and convenient to me. The food is fresh, which is the only reasom I go. The employees have such an attitude EVERY time I go. I have never been there and had a good experience with the workers. They are incredibly rude. Also during times that are busy, especially lunch, they only have one employee in the building. So the line will go to the door. I was in there when that has happened and 3 people came in and waited for a minute then walked right out. Something needs to be done on how rude they are. 1
Oh my Oh my...the prices are really not bad at all. I would say it's a great place to hang out with friends to grab a few drinks and watch the football games considering the fact that there's lots of TVs. Food was great and the service was excellent! I ordered the seafood medley $13.99, one word can describe this pasta DELICIOUS. My bf ordered the seafood platter (sorry I don't know the actual name) but it came with crab, 2 corns, potatoes, shrimp, clams, mussels, lobster, and clam chowder soup for $16.99. Doesn't it just make your mouth water just thinking about it? As for the starters we ordered the crab mozzarella, it was yummy. The best for last dessert....Captain Jack's is a total must try! 4
The noodles may be good but the kung pao chicken was a total dud. Wildly expensive at $18.95 and not nearly as good as airport fast-food Chinese. The dish was sweet (not spicy) and gloopy. The chicken had no saute marks. I think it was boiled. 1
First time ordering from this location...and most likely my last. This review is based on the delivery and customer service, not the food. I use to deliver pizza when I was younger (before everyone had GPS on there phone) and if I was lost, I either called my boss or the customer to get directions so I could get there on time...no excuses for a cold pizza nowadays in my opinion. Well, to start things out...the driver took an hour and 20 minutes to deliver, didn't have my credit card receipt, then wanted to copy down my whole credit card number! I wasn't ok with that...(I started calling the store to confirm that policy and then she changed her story and said she only needed the last 4 digits!) and to top it off...she didn't even have a pen for me to sign her delivery receipt! So I was left with a cold pizza, cold chicken poppers, no receipt for my transaction and a bad taste in my mouth about Papa John's. I use to love this pizza, but today made me reconsider that. There's way too many choices in pizza to have to put up with this kind of service. I called the store after the driver left and the manager was apologetic and offered a free pizza on my next order but it didn't make up for the fact that my dinner was ruined. I gave it two stars because I'm sure the food would have been fine had it been hot. Customer service can make or break a business. I hope they figure that out soon over there. 2
Awesome bright interior, fantastic service, vegetarian friendly and good atmosphere. I came with a friend for dinner and was definitely impressed. There was even a man playing guitar and singing Spanish love songs. The margs have real fruit and are definitely worth trying. Will be back. 5
We had a party of eight on the 27th of July. It was well over 80 degF in the dining area where we were located. The entire party complained they were hot and two in our party ended up with migraine headaches. I asked for the manager who acknowledged there was a problem with the A/C. When I asked if contacting corporate would help expedite correcting the problem, he advised "it might". I don't know about anyone else out there but I don't appreciate paying over $100 for a meal to have 2 out of 8 in our party needing to medicate themselves because of migraines induced by the excessive heat in the dining area. 1
We have been Vanessa's clients for nearly 8 years. Our two fur babies just love her!  She also grooms our sisters pup when he comes to town. She is amazing in her craft - always goes above and beyond. I don't trust my fur babies anyone else. We strongly recommend Vanessa and her amazing grooming skills. Look no further and contact Classic Tails for your pet grooming needs. She will not disappoint. 5
Great service but the sashimi was bad. I'm not even kidding when I say I've had fresher sashimi, maki and nigiri from Giant Eagle GetGo's prepared foods. Next time I'll try some Korean fare. 2
The beef empanada , Chocolate mousse cake and cheese sticks were average at best.Haven't tried their bagels but I doubt they compare to the  bagel shops in toronto.Service was friendly. Decor was non-existent and the food was overpriced.Unfortunately I don't have any childhood memories associated with the place nor am I a fan of overpriced average food to give it more than a star. 1
The sushi is good (7-10) but service is horrible. It took the waiter at least 5 to ask us for drinks and then it took over 20 min to take our order (they had forgotten whether we had ordered or not). If you do the all you can eat they take longer to ask if you want more, since you get an hour and a half to eat. Service is decent only if you sit at the sushi bar. 2
Went here during lunch, just to check out the hype of this location but it was a huge disappointment.Ordered the Miyagi and kiki burger with truffle fries.  Truffle fries were a big let down, a bit soft and the aroma was not there.  The ones at Noras was way better, it was the type of fries that you didn't want to stop eating.The Miyagi burger suppose to be wagyu Kobe beef, cooked medium rare, but the tempura battered onion rings were luke warm to cold, and with a burger that is the last thing I was expecting.  Drenched in sauces which was not necessary.  Took a bite of just the beef patty alone, flavorless... It didn't have the sweetness in wagyu beef that melts in your mouth.  The Kiki burger Kobe beef, medium rare, too much sauce, flavorless beef...  At the end I talked to the manager about some of the issues because the server did not believe my comments, realized I was correct and,manager apologized... Good save by the manager... Overall drenching a burger in Japanese sauces doesn't constitute Japanese style burgers when the most important beef is not promoted as the main flavor of the burger... 2
I really wanted to like this place.  The Fox group does a great job of creating a great dining experience with the theme, decor and menus at their restaurants.  However, the sliders and ice cream sandwiches at Modern Burger were not winners.  The fries were fantastic, the service was great and I really like the idea.  Maybe the food is better at Modern Steak?  I hope so! 3
I brought my dad here during his visit.  This is now my favorite restaurant in Charlotte.  We both got oysters during the Happy Hour.... 46 of them. Lol. We also got their dark and stormy drink.  It's made from rum, ginger beer, and lime.  Yum !  I had 2.  We both got their NC Trout.  Amazing.  I got the sofrito sauce which was excellent.  He got the lemon aoli.  We both agreed the sofrito was better.  Definately will be back ! 5
I really like Cost Plus! The staff are helpful and friendly. So many unique items. Bought a few items for my home and am waiting on an item that was out of stock. 5
Pizza is terrific, perfect combination of sauce, cheese and toppings. Beer is real cheap and bar is non smoking. Haven't eaten much other than pizza. Not impressed with hoagies, but i'll stick with getting their pizza and beer. Defiantly will return/ 4
This restaurant is right by my house, so I decided to try it out since I love sushi! The restaurant itself is very nice and modern and the service was good. I got a variety of different rolls, gyoza, and some udon soup. They don't have all you can eat here, so it can get a bit pricey! The rolls however were very big, so they fill you up! I like my gyoza pretty crispy and the server told me they couldn't do that, so that was a little disappointing! The food though was all good with fresh tasting ingredients. I would come back since it's so close to home! 3
Ok, so service isn't always the best. The workers can often be clueless and even rude. Luckily, I know Target very well, so I don't need these workers! I can find it myself! The cashiers are hit and miss. Sometimes they don't even mutter "hello", but whatever, I'm at Target. Yeah, it's my happy place. They always have fun stuff and great prices. Things are always well stocked (at least the workers have that part figured out). I can easily drop $100 here even though I just went in for toothpaste. How? It's one of the mysteries of the world, I suppose. So when I'm trying to save money, I don't go here! If I really need something, I do not, repeat, do not get a cart, but a basket! That way I can't fit much in my basket. I think Target is a girl thing. Guys don't really get it. But if you are a girl, you get it. It's Target. 4
Both hair & make up artists Jojo & Andrea did a great job on us ladies. Highly recommend them! They were prompt & best they come to you! Thank you for taking good care of us! 5
Was very impressed with decor and even the food the first few days after it opened. However, the last 2 times i have visited the quality of food has clearly deteriorated. I really hope they can maintain a consistent level of quality and the taste of the food. Their menu is quite limited and feel it is extremely important to maintain quality and consistency to succeed. 2
Not worth the money. 30 dollars a person. The wait staff was very attentive but the food got cold before you got back to your table. If you don't mind sushi it's not bad. Wide variety of sushi but nothing else. Overall I would skip this buffet if we'll ever go back. 3
Not just noodles!  Stomach discomfort and gas that could kill a small child, too! (presumably from the greasy, MSG-laden food). 2
Went for a foot massage, the masseuse spent about 10 mins on the foot basically putting lotion and rubbing it in. The rest was spent giving me a basic body rub/massage. It was a half hearted massage (maybe just that masseuse as my friends had a better massage than me)I was like ok whatever but there was more to come. When the time came to pay, the base rate was 22$/hr but tips are fixed: 10$ 15$ 20$. They would not budge on this. I felt like I was coerced to paying this tip. That's a 50% tip. A classic case of "bait n switch". Not cool. Avoid this place. A business should accurately communicate the terms and rates, not advertise one and surprise you with another. 2
Deseret Marketing Group produced a professional and engaging video that highlights a review from one of our satisfied clients. The process was quick and Derk was very easy to work with. Thank you for the video and the great service! 5
Nak Won!!Food was not the best. I ordered bulgogi and it was super dry. Service on the other hand was TERRIBLE!! I have to press the service button 9262515391836 times to get their attention. They aren't really friendly either. The only thing that may have been decent were the cold appetizer dishes you get at the beginning. I rather go next door and eat at Minerva Owl! 2
I didn't make a reservation but they still have a table for me (party of three). The dishes taste good and the waiters are friendly. It's noisy only because there were so many people inside, not because someone was shouting. We ate a lot of bread and pickle (taste good!) while waiting for the entree. 5
Weekly I stop by Trader Joe's and it comes to mind when I think of a good piece of baguette bread.  Their Garlic & Thyme bread has my name on it...I usually put it in the oven until it's crispy then spread my cream cheese over it or Trader Joe's garlic butter. At least 3 times a week I am strolling their store for either my polenta or garlic bread, kale or turkey meatballs. I keep telling myself to stop shopping but I go for quality when it comes to my food and that's the best quality so far especially if you are into organic or good quality. 5
Breakfast served 24 hours, waitstaff is efficient and friendly, drinks are a good pour, what more do you need? 5
Very pushy, "buy today" atmosphere. Was not impressed. It is interesting that the salesperson only attempted to communicate with me when I was looking at the more expensive beds... Thankfully, I found another mattress company that was more helpful than pushy. 1
Great waitress. Fast. Knew her stuff.  Pleasant. And fun to talk to. Great place for a late night drink or a much needed burger. 4
The rice to fish/meat/topping ratio is amazing!  You definitely get your money's worth.  Lunch specials are always cheap and filling.  This place is a hidden gem. 4
I would give this negative stars if possible. This was one of the absolutely worst nail salons I've ever been too. Yes, the inside is pretty and well put together but that does not make up for the horrible service. I went in on a Tuesday night and they were decently busy, no one was at the counter to me but the workers  were all running around busy. It was my first time here and no really showed me what to do or where to go. I had to wait to get them done and there is no seating at the front. VERY confusing layout.  I was waiting in the middle of the store. Finally, I start to get my nails done. They made me pay before hand and thinking that they were gonna do a good job I tipped them. They finish my nails and I can say that they have never looked worse! I got acrylics put on and they were different lengths and also requested the coffin shape. Needless to say the nails were not coffin shape and instead were all titled is what it looked like. I will never be returning to this establishment. You can get your money's worth elsewhere. 1
Had breakfast there this morning. Will not go back. Prices to high. Pancakes just OK . Bacon very greasy. 2
Thank you Wayne and Shannon! They did such an amazing job cleaning my tile and grout at a great price. I am so pleased, highly recommend! 5
It's been a long time since I have been here and now I remember why. Seriously the food is just not good. Items missing on the dish, rotting vegetables in the salad. There was no seasoning in the pasta. There was not one spring of fresh herbs anywhere.  Not worth the money. 2
I visited this Capriotti's location at Fort Apache & Tropicana on July 21 around 1pm.  I chose to dine in.  The restaurant was very hot so I don't think a/c was working or it was not turned on.  The workers were sweating.  One kept opening the large refrigerator to fan herself.  The time to receive my meal took way too long.  Looked like they may have been short staffed.  What really blew my mind though was the fact that when I finished my meal I needed to use the restroom & to wash my hands from having a messy sandwich.  I was told that this location does not offer restrooms & that I would have to walk over to KFC to use their restroom.  I said What?!!!!  I am a paying customer & just ate in your restaurant & you cannot offer a restroom?  The worker said no & that's the way it is.  I asked for the manager & was told the same thing.  They do not have restrooms for customers.  I have never heard of such a thing!  I watched as another customer had to walk over to KFC to use their restroom after placing their order.  I was appalled!  There is absolutely no excuse not to offer restroom facilities to paying customers at the very least to wash hands since you are eating a meal there!  I could understand a little if restroom was out of order for a particular reason, but that was not the case.  Needless to say, I will not be back to this location as they obviously do not value their customers.  Bit of advice, if you do visit here, make sure you go to restroom somewhere else beforehand & bring some sanitary hand wipes with you as you will not be able to wash your hands unless you walk over to the KFC which a customer should not have to do. 1
My family used to come here quite a number of times when I was little. I recently came back here since I remember my family talking about how good the food here is. The decor is gorgeous they put a lot of effort into it. Can't say the same for the quality of the food. The prices of the food is reasonable and it looks really good. It also tasted very good especially the lo mein. However, the first time I came back here, my tummy felt a little queasy after eating the food. I thought it might have to do with something else and not the food here, but then I came here a second time. I ended up having very bad food poisoning the second time and I'm positive it's because of the food here. I have no idea what their sanitary rating is but God I am never coming back here. 1
First time here. Walked into the restaurant and half the tables I saw were piled with dirty dished with half eaten food on them (I have no idea how long they've been sitting there for). Waited 10minutes for servers to clean a table for us to sit. They used a dirty cloth to clean the table with!! I know this because the table smelt horrible after!! This definetly made me lose my apetite. I had to call the server 3 times to take down my order cause evertime i said "excuse me" she would brush me off and say "wait a moment" then go to the back to chat with her friends. (what the hell?!") After the third time i was finally able to order, but had to wait another 30minutes for the food!! Service was sooooo SLOW!When i got my food, I tasted the curry and I thought it was okay but was really chunky compared to other places I've had. I know malaysian curry and this was definetly not worth a 45min drive to try. I dont think I'll be going back. The only thing i really really enjoyed was the Coconut Shrimp. 2
Stayed here because it's one of the lesser expensive places on the strip.We booked online a couple of months in advance.  When we go to check in (which was a zoo, but the lines moved along fairly quickly) we were told that the room was paid for but that they needed our credit card for the $8 resort fee (!!!!??)  I knew some of the resorts had fees but it said so on their site!  I never saw anything about a resort fee when we booked so that ticked me off.  We were famished by the time we got in (flew in from oakland) and had met up with some friends so we went over to Rock & Ritas for a bite to eat.  Decent margaritas, food was so so, definitely not worth what they charged for it, but it was ok.  Checked into our room. I was pleased to find that it had a large bathroom, but our view was terrible.  We were on the 3rd floor of the Skyrise Tower and had a view of the roof.  Meh, get what you pay for I spose.  The bed was surprisingly comfy, but smelled slightly of cigarettes.  Thanks to the very loud A/C, I didn't get but 2 hours of sleep that night.  Only blew air about 30% of the time and it wasn't even cold air so our room was not only noisy, but muggy the entire night.  We tried turning it off but then it got even hotter so we just dealt with the noise. (not good when I had to fly home and be to work the next day!)The Adventuredome was not what I remembered it 10 years ago during my first trip to Vegas.  The sign said open til midnight and we got there around 4 and when we went to get the wristbands we were told they were only open until 6 and if we wanted to stay til midnight it's an extra $10 (some sort of halloween fest).  We said forget it and used our free ride coupons we got upon checkin to ride the rollercoaster and left. The midway was the typical Circus Circus midway, with the games and shows.  I was disappointed to see that the carousel bar was out of service.We didn't gamble here (we went down the strip) so I can't review their games.For the price and how little we stayed in the rooms it was ok.  I will definitly try other places next time I'm in town. 2
3 1/2Good food and cocktail. But sometimes their food take too long to come out, waited almost 20 mins for the wings today :( but i love the happy hour, great price and good food. 3
I ordered some more take out last week (UGH midterms). I was not pleased with the guy on the phone.I called for the late night special and asked for a Chicken fried rice, medium hot and sour soup and a fried calamari. He wanted to charge me 34$ for it! I asked him to repeat the individual prices back to me and asked why I didn't get the late night special. He told me to hold on and changed my new total to 24$ after tax.WTF. They never used to bullshit prices. (Then again, they also used to give out the late-night menu.) The only reason why I'm a repeat customer (for the past 3 years) is because of how fast and how late they deliver.  Mediocre food at best but great for a desperate and stressed college student. Take precaution and do the math!!(Edit: I forgot. Portions have also decreased dramatically. If you look at my delivery food photos you can see holes where food should have been. They used to pack everything in. Not anymore apparently....) 3
Very satisfied.  Try to stay in the renovated section of the hotel.  If you play your cards right you will have a great time at the Luxor! 4
I've ordered from Rosatis for over 10 years.  Tonight's pizza was absolutely terrible.  No taste, cheese dry and yellow instead of white. Sauce tasted like tomato sauce out of a can.  I also had chicken tenders.  Had to use 3 paper towels to blot the oil out of them.  If the weather wasn't so bad I would have returned the food and demanded a refund.  WHAT HAPPENED?  C'MON GUYS 1
This place has a great selection. My husband and I had been searching for a light fixture for the dining room all over the city and finally found something we liked here.This place loses stars because of a) pricing, and b) service.The light fixture we found was "on sale" for $50. ("On sale" is in brackets because we saw something very similar at Rona for the same price which was not on sale, however they did not have the brushed nickel finish we were seeking.) When we asked the salesperson if they had a new one in stock, she said that on that particular model, the floor model was all that was left. When we asked her and her manager if they could discount it at all since it had been sitting out (and there were other "sale" items which did come new), the woman in charge rudely said "No. It's already on clearance. Clearance items can't be discounted. It was originally eighty dollars so it's already on sale." We were unsure, but very tired from an entire day of light-hunting. We ended up buying it--but as it turns out, there was also no original box, warranty, or instructions with it. They literally pulled the fixture from the display wall, wrapped it in bubble wrap, stuck it in a random box and handed it to us. Now this might be expected at a flea market or someplace a little shoddier, but definitely was not acceptable for a corner store in the Beaches which normally charges 2-3 times what big-box hardware stores charge. Even big-box hardware stores will give you all the contents of the original box AND a 5-10% discount if you buy their display models (at least in my experience in the past).I guess the bit of consolation Living Lighting could offer us was that they said we had 10 days to return the fixture for a store credit. "Normally clearance items are final sale," the salesperson said. "You can use that credit towards anything else we carry" (but the average wall mount light fixture there is a couple hundred dollars, which was not in our ideal budget range).Overall, even though I'm glad we found what we were looking for, I would never  ever shop here again unless it was as a last resort, and I was very desperate. Even then, I would probably go to a different location and spend the extra $$ there in hopes of getting better service. 2
The pizza and spaghetti are very yummy. The calzones and meatball sub is amazing. The staff here is incredibly friendly, and their prices are very reasonable for the quality of food. Definitely worth your time. 4
The pizza was okay. Not the best I've had. I prefer Biaggio's on Flamingo / Fort Apache. The chef there can make a MUCH better NY style pizza. The pizzeria @ Cosmo was over priced for the quality and lack of personality in the food. Biaggio's is a much better pick if youre going for italian - family owned, home made recipes, people that actually CARE if you like their food. You dont get that at a pizzeria in a casino. I dont care what you say... 2
Never ever will I come back here. Everyone here is so rude. Yesterday, I booked a afternoon reservation for today at 3:00pm. I found their number on their hotel website, 416 -971-9666. When I called, whoever received the call tell me that I called the wrong number, and asked me to call the tearoom. That's rude. Again, I can't find the tearoom number, so I called back hotel number, thank god this time they "kindly" transferred me to tearoom. I got confirmed that booked for time. I went there today, here is the worst part. When I do travel 35km to the hotel today, I was told that I wasn't book a reservation. I asked them to double checked, then they typed my phone number saying that I booked 27th, Jan. Lol! What the hell! That's no where near my reservation. Then they told me there is no way they can put me in. I was so angry and tell them that's not my mistake. But they don't care. I swear I will never ever go back here. So rude and disrespectful! 1
Julia helped me gain back my self confidence!  For years I have been struggling with the embarrassment of adult and hormonal acne.  It was getting to the point where I was ashamed to look people in the eye when having conversations for fear that they were only focusing on the blackheads on my forehead.  I had tried everything that you could name from countless products to facials elsewhere.  Nothing worked!I had been going to see Julia for a few years for eyebrow waxing (which she also does amazingly well), and in her very nice tactful way she would mention how a facial might be helpful for me, but always stressed the fact that she was not trying to sell me anything.  I admit I was reluctant at first because nothing had worked.....I am writing this review so other women who also suffer from the frustration of adult acne can be comforted in knowing that there is help out there!  Julia is simply a miracle worker......I have been going to her for facials for the last seven months and the improvements noted in my skin have been remarkable.  Friends and family have been commenting on how clear my skin has been looking.  Julia is also very gentle and extremely knowledgeable in her line of work.  The products that she has recommended to me have also helped maintain the improvements in my skin in between appointments.I always look forward to going to Julia's because of the calming, relaxing atmosphere she has created as well as for her pleasant personality and skillful hands.I have already recommended Julia to some friends and will continue to do so! 5
You can get a free meal on your birthday if you sign up for it beforehand. It's been hit or miss the few times I've gone. But whenever they've had the Kaya Fest the food is always sooo much better and tastier than what they usually serve in the resturant so just go to that! 3
They have awesome beers and that is the best thing about this place. It is also a more relaxed option for eating in the area. The price-quality balance with the food is not the best. But it is mainly a busy pub. With the beers you can't go wrong. Have been here a couple of times and usually find my way back every now and then. 3
They either have a terribly system going or they're overbooking themselves. I've been at this office for over an hour and a half. 40 minutes of it has been sitting in the room waiting for my doctor to even come see me. I wouldn't recommend this place. 1
Wasn't thrilled with the place! Very hard to find. And no lasagna!!  What the heck. We won't be back. 2
Our group of 4 was seated 40 minutes later than our reservation without an apology from anyone. After the meal we found the service was so slow it was no wonder why we were seated so late. Food was cold and quite bland. I ordered the chef's sampler menu and only the bananas foster was above average. The worst part of the night was having to ask for the manager after never receiving so much as an apology for having to wait so long for a reserved table. The manager (Tony) had no idea and could not have cared less. One of the worst dining experiences I've had in Pittsburgh. If you are looking for a nice place on Mount Washington, Monterey Bay is about the same price point with much better food and vastly superior service. Although your local Applebees would have better service. 1
Ugghh. The service makes for an unpleasant experience. Delivered food with no silverware. We had to ask for drink refills, butter, mustard. You name it.. Server was nice enough but just not at all present, so everything was very, very slow.On the good side, my kid liked the gravy. 1
Employees make the business and in this case Mark Guilfoile takes the cake. He is the reason myself and anyone I know with a Toyota product go to this dealer.  What's wonderful asset to the company. Great job Mark! 5
Hit or miss. I've had some good hair cuts in the past here and always felt that the value was great for the service. My last visit I was dissapointed with the cut. I hate to give a bad review since my stylist Yuna was very nice and gentle with my hair. I asked for a simple cut straight across. What i got instead was uneven and not like the photo I brought with me. The shape of my hair is now rounder than when I came in with a chunk taken out of it :/ 2
DO NOT BUY FEOM THIS DEALERSHIP!!!! I've had issues with them since the first day I drove the car. Their "ASE CERTIFIED MECHANICS" don't know what their doing. I had to tell them what was wrong with the car. Save your money go to different dealership. I promise you that if you buy a car with them u will have issues with it down the line and their going to give you the run around every time you call. 1
Tried the new Famoso in McKenzie Towne this evening - extremely disappointing.  My salad was very small, the dressing very oily and for the quality expensive.  My husband and I each ordered a pizza - they were both very, very soggy - my pizza lacked flavour as well (artichoke, cheeses, red onion, roasted red pepper)...my husband's pizza had more flavour, but was also very wet in the centre.  Disappointing as we live in the area and were hoping for a restaurant we could enjoy in the neighborhood.  Also disappointing that the chef, although he checked on us after our server told him we were not enjoying the food, did not adjust the bill at all.  Unfortunately we will not be back. 2
Orange Pest Control, always on time, always a friendly face. Jack does a great job, very through and deals wonderfully with the family hoard of pets. We are new to having pest control but from the first service where we had a call back, not a pest to be seen. I would recommend them to my friends and neighbors. 5
2 of us ate breakfast there this morning. The food was good, just a few dollars overpriced. The portions are over-sized. There was no wait at 8:45. The servers and staff were mostly friendly, if a bit inattentive. I take 1 star away for the needless drama provided by Marissa while paying the check. Probably will go again. 3
I came here yesterday for my first time after wanting to try it out for months. The decor is too die for, so adorable! We got seated right away, I would of preferred the patio, but since it was Valentines Day I was happy we got seated at all without a wait. Our cute and bubbly comes in to greet us and we immediately ask to order the guacamole and she apologizes and says they are out and she should mention they're also out of flour tortillas?! Um, what? Mexican restaurant that doesn't have guac... you would think that would be simple to remake. But, of course maybe they didn't think they'd as busy this weekend being Valentines day and all. The great thing is they have happy hour all day on Sundays and the drinks were amazing and delicious and pretty and anything else you can think of. The food on the other hand was nothing spectacular. I will definitely be back to give them another try when they might be more prepared and not so busy. The place was too cute and I've heard too many great things to not try them out again. 3
Why can't a simple order for eggs over easy result in eggs over easy : semi-hard yokes are not that.Once a year I re-try this place and once a year it's a fail. Otherwise this place is fine. 2
Quickly became a staple and the go to place for half of my office. Simple, fast, flavourful and Good for you! If this was the standard for fast food the world would be a better place. 5
My husband and I were originally going to dinner at the Southside, but ended up at Bac as a last minute decision. We were told that there was going to be a wait for a table, but as we sat down at the bar, the staff hurried and cleared a table for us in the dining area. The food was really good, and the portions were also very generous (we both took home leftovers). The service was a little chaotic. The bartender began to serve us in the dining area, but then we were served by two other staff throughout our time there. We have also eaten at Charm Thai in Seven Hills recently, and my husband hands down recommends Bac over Charm Thai....he especially recommends their Pad Thai! 4
Their menu is pretty diverse and their appetizers are my favourite that I've tried so far. Must-trys are the Green Mango Salad (sweet slices of green mango topped with fish sauce) and the Calamari (fried to crispy perfection without being overly oily). For the entrees, I tried 2 different curry dishes (lamb and duck) and 2 noodle dishes (pad thai and glass noodles). Wasn't a big fan of the curry, I found it to be overly sweet with too much coconut sauce so it overpowered the meaty flavour. But i think in general I'm more of a Malaysian Curry lover than Thai anyways. But what won me over were their Pad Thai and the Pad Woon Sen dishes. They were sooo yummy and flavourful - i loved it.The waitstaff was super friendly but service was a bit on the slow side but I didn't mind too much since it was pretty packed. Overall , it was good meal. 3
I highly recommend Zooks. I drove by Zooks for months always wanting to try it and now I regret waiting so long! The staff was excellent and gave us some great recommendations since it was our first time. I had the Turkey, bacon, avocado (sorry, I can't remember the number!) and my boyfriend had the #22 breakfast sandwich. Both were delicious. I wish we would have split our sandwiches instead of both eating our own! For sides, we had the potato salad and garbanzo bean salad, both were great. They had a slight lemon zest flavor which was a nice touch. The owner stopped by to check on us and she was very friendly. The lack of parking doesn't bother me because we walked from my apartment and it is walking distance from the light rail. Overall, we will be returning and recommending Zooks! 5
Best Mother's Day Ever! My wonderful children treated me to Phoenix Public Market Cafe for Brunch. What a treat! We shared the Del Real sandwich, the breakfast sandwich, the amazing peanut butter & jelly, and the hamburger. Every bite was a flavor experience, and I washed it down with one of their delicious cocktails. The cafe was walking distance to the Diamondback's game, so we swung back by after the game for more drinks and food. Atmosphere is casual and the place smells wonderful (like fresh vegetables, and wood smoked chicken...Yummo!). I love all the local merchandize for sale, and even bought one of their aprons. I will be back on market day to just hang out on the wonderful patio and enjoy a Farmer's cup or two.Bravo St. Francis group, another successful restaurant ! 5
My most favourite Italian restuarant in the Vaughan area - and this area is full of Italian restaurant.  This is definitely not a typical Italian though - they have eastern twists in various dishes - which make it different in a great way.  The dishes are simply more flavourful.  I love the various pasta sauces and seasoning that use saffron.  The chicken pastas, steak pastas and seafood pastas are all awesome.  I am not a big steak person and have also heard that their steaks are not their strong point.  The two poutines are really great as well - which again also are different from regular poutines as they have hints of eastern flavours.  Awesome restaurant.  If you feel like having Italian, and want to try something different, this is definitely the place. 5
My friend and I were visiting from out of town and decided to try this place out when we saw their groupon. The first thing we noticed was an empty parking lot at 7:30 pm on a holiday weekend. Awful location?Upon entering we felt a little relieved with the warm reception from the young host. He found us a booth quickly and was kind enough to turn off the fan that was blowing our paper table cloth everywhere. Although delivered quickly, after one sip of our Diet "COKE", it was obvious that it was RC Diet Cola and right from a flat 2-liter bottle. The salad bar, if that's what you would call it, was slim pickens and only offered hearts of romaine and three dressings. They had some other Italian appetizers as well, ie. rolled deli ham and cheese cubes. The hot plate section was not labeled and it took an explanation from the young host in order for us to know what the dishes were. The Chicken Cacciatore and Cheese Balls were incredible :) Main course: As the first round of meats arrived, you can tell that they were made very recently. We received italian sausage, grilled pineapple, garlic bread, pork rib, grilled chicken, and top sirloin. They were up to par in taste and served from a hot skewer and the portions were fair.  We never received any tri-tip, leg of lamb, or filet mignon - all of which are advertised on their groupon/website! The highlight of our underwhelming experience was the warm smile and friendly attitude from the head chef and his staff. In all honesty, the groupon price we paid ($65 incl tip) is still a pretty high for what we received. 1
20 minutes late on my pick up, all they had to do was make the pizza I was myOwn delivery boy. I should have got a tip for waiting so long and so patiently. 1
This is one of my favorite places to eat in the Phoenix area, period.A small place, doing it right. Making their own fresh bread, their own hummus. I had the ajja merguez and hummus, and the flavors were bold and bright. The bread comes out hot, and it's so soft but with a satisfying chew. Go here if you enjoy awesome food. 5
I am unable to rate the cleaning that this company provides because they no-showed on me two days in a row. I purchased through Buytopia (which has a terrible refund policy, btw) and I am definitely regretting it. Apparently, the first no show is due to me not answering a confirmation call the day prior to my scheduled cleaning. The housekeeper's daughter called and didn't think it was necessary to leave a voicemail explaining that she was calling to confirm. Since I didn't answer, I didn't confirm and no one showed up. Apparently it didn't matter that I had an email reminder from the company itself.I rescheduled for the following day. This time I called to confirm. The company called the housekeeper to confirm and then advised me that the housekeeper couldn't make it because it was raining.I asked for some compensation and was given a non-committal response: "I'll check with management." and no one  bothered getting back to me. This company is highly irresponsible. I'd suggest dealing with someone else, especially if you have a busy schedule. 1
So...I got a groupon for this restaurant and I couldn't wait to go and try it out, but I was utterly disappointed.   We arrived @6:45 for our 7pm reservations...finally got seated at 7:30.    The drink I ordered at 7:20 didn't arrive to my table until 7:55pm.  I ordered the pork chops, which weren't cooked to my specifications.  My partner order the mussels but couldn't eat them because they were too salty.  We decided to go on a limb and order the preach cobbler which was very doughy and obvious that canned peaches were used...I paid $29 for the groupon that would cover $50 worth of food...my total bill was $27 (after all the deductions for sub par service and food) :( lost $2.  Wouldnt recommend 1
This is really more of a 3.5 kind of place food wise but the service was excellent. I got the pad thai and my friend got the drunken noodle. They were about $12 each which is a bit expensive but the portions they gave were more than enough to last two or three meals. It wasn't the best pad thai I've had but it definitely wasn't the worse.  If you're a student you get 20% off so don't forget to tell your waiter! 4
We opted to try the place despite some of the bad reviews. The place is very quaint and sets the mood. The tv didn't bother me as I had my back to it. We had the lasagne and squash ravioli. Both were amazing!  Best food since we've been in Italy! Good size portions. The brusetta was fresh tasting and the bread crispy. The waitress was from Venice and only in the country for three weeks. She was attentive and the service was great. Worth a visit. 5
Eyebrows are done well.  Pedicures ok, nothing that makes you want to tip. (Which I always do) Every time I get my nails done,  they break within the week. Definately need a makeover and might attract a lil less ghetto.  I've seen a fight, and yes they kicked them out,  but I still was annoyed by the yelling. Salon overall needs maintenance and cleaning.  I go because they are a family owned business,  but starting to make the drive just a couple miles away.  Much happier with my busy schedule, and attention in just remembering my name. Customer service is probably the least happiest with in this place. 3
Chill place. Many e-juices to choose from. The attractive woman working helped me to pick a couple of new flavors I really like. Very helpful, extremely courteous. Their mods looked cool as well but I didn't take the time to browse those. Inexpensive tanks and up to the higher quality is there. I like that the juice is all natural and it tastes great, vaps great as well. I'll be back. 5
Fantastic food & drink. Great selection of lunch and dinner foods. The patio seating and bar are fantastic. 4
This was our third time to this restaurant and the 3rd new owner. Based on how empty the place was I'm sure next time it will be the 4th owner. The daily seafood was lobster risotto and salmon. Its not 5 stars, but with real pieces of lobster it was well worth $19.Server was nice but sucked. When asked what is "this" (pointing), he said sauce. When asked what kind of bread came with a sandwich, he said it changes. Nice Guy but probably stoned. By the way the restaurant is beautiful. 3
This was the worst restaurant experience I've had in a long time.  I looked the breakfast menu up online it looked limited but when we got there half the items online weren't even on the menu. I got an egg sandwich and a cappuccino. The coffee was awful! Tasted chalky and the sandwich was ok. With a Starbucks right across the street they should step up their coffee. Worst of all the staff was not welcoming or friendly at all. This was our first time and most certainly our last. 1
Such delicious and wholesome ingredients. The most satisfying meal(s) we've had in Vegas all week! 5
Been on an exhausting hunt to find a place to get a great facial where you aren't paying for the location/decor & where you aren't pummelled with selling while trying to relax and enjoy.  Finally found it here.  Janina was gracious and welcoming, even though I showed up an hour early, my mistake.  Felt immediately like my business was appreciated.  I was paired with one of her newer employees who did a wonderful job but with a guided oversee by Janina which shows a great deal of care and attention on her part.  She patted my hand and told me a joke.  It was a really pleasant experience.  I was upsold on a moisturizing treatment but she was right, I needed it and it wasn't done in an aggressive way but more a recommendation.  Saw a huge difference in my face, especially the yucky frown line in between my eyebrows.  I now trust her recommendations and will be open to hear about her products in the future.  Because she is charging a reasonable price for her services I will go more often rather than treating a facial like a luxury.  You would think spa owners would understand that.  It's not a luxury environment so if that's your thing, probably not the place for you.  I'm okay with a few less leather couches and water features to get a quality experience.  Really happy to have found her. 5
This is the worst hairdresser I've ever met! He was rude, clearly arrogant and ended up messing up my daughter's hair! When I told him that she had a side longer than the other, he barely replied that that's her hair! Totally incompetent he shouldn't hold a scissor ever again! 1
I've hesitated writing my review hoping I could write a more positive one...The hotel and the Statehouse are beautiful with excellent views.  The food is hit or miss. That being said, we have had some excellent meals there.  The service is very disappointing and hasn't improved with time.  From the bartenders to the servers no one seems to own their position or seem comfortable. A few of our experiences...We were at the Statehouse for our anniversary and my parents had called to send over a couple glasses of champagne to us.  The host told them that they couldn't seem to find us.  We were one of two tables seated in the restaurant that night. They could have found us if they had tried.  Also, my husbands steak was horrible, shouldn't have been served. We were in the bar another night with 5 bartenders behind the bar discussing who should go home since it was a slow night.  As the only two in the bar we sat listening with empty drinks.A couple friends and I stopped in for drinks and appetizers after the homecoming game.  Yes, it was busy and yes, they knew they would have a huge crowd due to the after party they were hosting. But, they all seemed flustered and irritated. It took at least 20 minutes for someone to acknowledge us.  We asked about the wine and she said she didn't know because it was her first week.  I knew for a fact it wasn't her first week. I hope the  assumption isn't that everyone is a one time customer due to the fact that it's a hotel and people come and go. But, that's how we felt.  I could go on...It's such a beautiful hotel and restaurant but the service does not live up the standards that you should expect to experience in a place like this.  I really do hope they can figure it out and turn things around.  Not sure how many more chances we will give. 2
Don't go there. Ive been there because of groupon and they stole my money. They charge u for tip on the full price before the groupon so imagine. The full price is 100$ = 15$ tip but i had a groupon of 50% off so i would tip them 7.5$ big difference when ur a student. Plus the dancer is a douche bag on cocaine. The servers also kept serving us the last pieces of meat and ananas. Dont waste your time and money there. 1
Come here at shift change to watch every staff member hug and talk about all of the weed they just smoked and ignore you for 20 minutes to get a mediocre cocktail. Worst service in Ohio city. 1
Does anyone else find the price outrageous and the service mediocre at this restaurant? The food is great but the servers act like you are begging them for food! LOL.. the portions are so small and unlike most restaurants, the choices are so limited and unaccomodating 4
Get the cheese! Get the cheese! Get the cheese! I could come here just for that! Otherwise the wine selection is great (obviously a lot of French wines). The salmon and lentil dish I've had was prepared really well. The service could use a smidge of help though- I feel like it could be better or maybe the two servers I've had at different times were having off days. Otherwise it's not just a perfect date spot, it's a perfect any occasion spot! 4
Everytime I order through their mobile app my drink is never prepared in the "estimated time". Many times I arrive and after the 8-12 minutes and they still haven't collected my order from the printer  . Today I arrived 15 minutes after placing a mobile order for an iced flat white, once again my drink wasn't ready. After I enquired about it the barista went to check the printer and my order sticker was still sitting there. Instead of making my drink first she proceeded to make 3 more drinks before mine. The service here is always slow, what is the point of preordering something if you still have to wait a while for it. 2
One of the best vanilla lattes I have ever tasted! It has a pure vanilla flavour without the excessive sweetness that flavoured lattes tend to possess. The brewed coffee was also delicious; dark and strong without being bitter.  They have a full menu of fair trade coffee and tea options to choose from and the staff will adjust the drink to suit your preference. The baked goods didn't really appeal to me for breakfast but the brownies would make a great late night treat along with your delicious latte!The inside is clean and comfortable. Not exactly cozy, but I agree with the reviews calling it sleek. Its a really nice place to go for a relaxing chat.I will definitely go back! I'm looking forward to trying more things from their menu including the Macadamia nut latte.**update: I changed the rating to 3.5 after trying some other lattes. They're really sweet even at half the original sweetness, Its still a nice place to meet up with someone for a relaxing brew. 3
I go here because they offer a gluten free crust and vegan cheese. I usually get the arugula and pear Pizza, as well as the quinoa salad.  Both are delicious. I am subtracting one star because their servers don't always know what Vegan means. Also, the water they serve is absolutely disgusting. I've never tasted anything quite as bad. They say it goes thru a filter but I don't know. It seems so dirty. 4
By far the worse service! The one in Henderson is way better! Don't get me wrong they do have great sushi it's just their service was terrible. I went here 3 times just to give it another chance but I am not going here anymore. They even forgot to bring out our drinks so that's when I had the last of it. The only good thing I can say about this place is they have a variety of rolls to pick from and if you like all you can eat they have it! 1
Filthy dirty. Terribly slow service. Drink dispenser has been broken for years. Every time I eat here I worry I'll get food poisoning. If keeping the restaurant clean is not a priority then the kitchen much be filthy too. Yuck! 1
Came here for lunch excited for some bbq. Saw the reviews and thought I was worth a shot. Ordered the wing and onion rings as an app. The wings were great with good flavor and no extra fat. The blue cheese was so watered down I ate the wings without it. The onion rings were good but nothing extra special.My fiancee ordered the pulled pork plater with Mac and cheese and baked beans. The pulled pork was cold with no flavor. The sweet bbq sauce we added on was watered down with now spice. The hot bbq sauce wasn't hot at all and again no flavor. The mac and cheese was more like soup and feel like they forgot to bake it. It was very bland and needed tons of salt to even eat. The baked beans also had zero flavor but had large pieces of pork in them. Wish they were warm and had salt because it had potential. Overall we were not impressed with the bbq and would recommend going to Mac's instead. I would come back for the wings but even then I would take them home and use my own blue cheese. 2
For the price, very reasonable... I laughed, I was entertained and I had fun!!! xxx 4
Zack and the staff at Rad Air are top notch. I had my vehicle at a dealer where they dismissed my issues because there was no "code". Rad Air listened to me, investigated and were able to diagnose the problem - they went the extra mile. I am very grateful to Rad Air and would recommend it to anyone. 5
this place is great. came here about twice now. food is exceptional. i got the nachos and some friends got very different entrees. i am a nacho fan and these nacho were really good. not to mention the size of these things. i love the rainbow sugar they have. i think i consumed a bit too much. the second time i tried this place. it seemed like the prices went up and the portion size got smaller. probably the only reason why i have not gone back. oh wells, this place is good. would recommend for first timers. its a fun place to be. 4
I did what I could to keep it short for my review of Joel Robuchon, the exalted chef's fine-dining boite at the MGM Grand. I will make no such attempts in conveying my feelings about Chef Robuchon's small-plates restaurant, L'Atelier.Robuchon (the restaurant) could be well personified by Grace Kelly, regal, elegant, breathtaking perfection... L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon might then be personified by Catherine Deneuve... coquettish, modern, a little more casual but no less enthralling. If Grace Kelly belongs on a pedestal to be quite rightly worshipped, then Ms. Deneuve seems a better fit between the sheets on an extended stay at the Hotel Georges V.It would be far simpler a task for me to juggle two Buicks than it would to choose between Kelly and Deneuve. A similar quandary, it follows, to what I face when attempting to choose between Joel Robuchon and L'Atelier. Sometimes, though, these choices must be made and to be quite frank, courting a real Princess for more than a day might grow tiresome in the balance. Reluctantly then, I admit that if forced to, I cast my long-term lot with the fair Ms. Deneuve. In the same light, I would have to confess a slight preference for L'Atelier, a spot at which I would quickly agree to eat every single night. Here's a few reasons why...Le Cocotte- Parsley puree at the bottom of a martini glass, topped with mushroom cream, and a raw egg (stay with me) and then more mushroom cream and a couple of sauteed mushrooms on top. Then they put the whole thing in a steamer until the egg whites *just* set. Creamy, yolky, mushroom-ey.. the richness of it all cut perfectly by the bracing green-ness of the parsley puree.Le Langoustine- the sweetest langoustine you've ever tasted, wrapped with a basil leaf in a thin sheet of brik dough and quickly deep fried. Plated with a micro greens salad and basil pesto. Seriously, I could eat 50 of these.Le Thon Rouge- Thin slices of tuna arranged on a plate with tomato-infused oil and sea salt. You can really taste the tomato in the oil and I don't know how they do that. Perfectly salted and the texture of the tuna is as magical as a first kiss. Le Saumon- A healthy portion of house-smoked salmon, plated with a potato waffle (with really deep wells, more surface area, more CRUNCH) and dill cream. The creamy crunchy potato, the smoky salty salmon, and the cool and herbaceous cream all conspire to create what might just be a perfect plate. 10 out of 10.Le Caille- Quail stuffed with foie gras and coated in a citrus glaze. I am careful, as a gentleman, to confine my profanity to special cases. That said... holy fucking shit this is good. Served with a small pot of truffled potato puree prepared to the following ratio - 1 part potato to 1 part butter. It is not uncommon for a fight to break out over the last spoonful.Le Foie Gras- Raviolis of foie gras in a chicken broth with Thai basil and herb cream. The ravioli are quite salty at first, but then it becomes apparent that they are a perfect foil for the rich chicken broth in which they float. The basil and cream add top notes and bottom notes and once again you are transported by a mere food item to some magical place where the London Philharmonic plays neighborhood concerts and hundred dollar bills rain from the sky.Ris de Veau- Here's where we get to what might be the defining characteristic of a restaurant of this caliber. I wouldn't dare order sweetbreads at just about any other establishment. No thanks. But at L'Atelier? Mais bien sur! Seared on the outside, creamy on the inside, stuck through with a sprig of holly and plated with a lettuce leaf stuffed with onions and butter. One of the best things I've ever eaten and I almost let my prejudice prevent me from ordering it. Shameful.Le Chartreuse- A souffle made with green chartreuse liqueur and topped with pistachio ice cream. Words cannot express how good this is. Eggy, Sweet, and a little flowery. Suffice it to say that it tastes like heaven in a ramekin.Chocolate Sensation- Let's see if I can remember this right... melting Aragani chocolate on the bottom, then a disc of chocolate on top of that, then white chocolate ice cream on top of that, and then oreo cookie crumbs on top of the whole thing. Rob a bank if you have to. Kidnap a rich kid. Sue McDonalds for scorching your naughty bits. It will all be worth the effort to secure a bowl of this.Look, I know I go a little overboard sometimes. I am well aware of my bias. But if you are looking to sample cuisine that is executed at the highest possible level... trust me, if you've got a steady job you can well afford the tariff of a visit here. My precious L'Atelier... that haunts me in my sleep and in my troubled mind weaves daydream tapestries of earthly abandon. Soon, my dear. Soon I will return to your loving arms and we will write epics to make Chaucer blush, and Shakespeare jealous. I am already counting the days. 5
I had a very negative experience today with Dr. Conway from Martin Vet who was unprofessional, rude, and hostile - someone that I certainly would never trust to care for my pets. I wanted to have my dog have comprehensive dental care completed under her care after my regular vet provided me with a full work up and referral for dental work. When I contacted Martin Vet to set up the procedure and provided them with his medical records no one responded to set up an appointment for over a week. After calling back and speaking with multiple staff, I finally heard back from Dr. Conway herself at 7 pm on New Year's Eve.She called me on the verge of hysterics insisting that despite the referral from my general vet from a dental visit completed a week ago, and the urgent needs of my dog she needed to first examine the dog and charge for a consultation before scheduling an actual appointment. When I asked if any dental diagnostics could be completed at the consultation, she stated my dog would need to be sedated for that. So, I would have to wait another two weeks to treat my dogs dental needs.Since my dog recently just had a wellness exam, and the medical records were provided to the office, I asked if the consultation fee could be waived once I paid for the dental procedures and sedation. To my knowledge all medical professionals are expected to examine a patient prior to sedating them when asked regarding this issue, Dr. Conway angrily stated "No, the day of the procedure we just check their temperature." This was very concerning to me and I would not seek care from an establishment that sedates dogs without doing a thorough work up the day of the procedure. As a dentist for humans, I can tell you that without radiographs a dental diagnosis/consultation cannot be given, so billing for a dental consult without radiographs and then billing again another separate fee for a dental exam under sedation, is unethical. No dental diagnosis can be obtained without radiographs. As well, it goes without saying that if anyone sedates your pet - a thorough exam should be conducted by the anesthesiologist performing the sedation, all medical records reviewed the day of the procedure rendering the consult performed by Dr. Conway unnecessary and inhumane as it delays the ability for a pet to be treated in a timely and compassionate manner. There are many options for vet care in Toronto, and this is not a place I would trust with my pets. 1
When our waitress was bringing out the food, the plate tilted and grease spilled all over my bag and hat. Needless to say food was overly greasy and salty. They also charged me a few bucks extra for choosing bbq pork as one of the options for the dish but the menu made no mention of extra charge. On top of all that, they placed a mandatory tip of 15% on my bill even when service was crap. 1
The staff over at Big Frog was very helpful. They were able to design a custom logo for me from a picture I had on my phone. I stopped over at the store and was able to have an order placed within 20 minutes. This was a last minute idea that I had and Big Frog was able  to  turn around my order within 2 days. I wanted to have something special for my out of town guests that attended our party. The shirts were a big hit. 5
Came to Oakville to meet up with a friend and we came to this restaurant, and I have to say I was disappointed. Ordered the crispy beef for myself, and the dish had about 7 pieces of beef and the other 90% of the dish was vegetables. The portion size itself is already small and there was not enough beef in a dish that focuses on mainly beef. It was definitely overpriced, and compared to asian restaurants in Toronto, I've had much better crispy beefs that were cheaper and better portioned. 1
I have tried this place several times. Sadly, the only thing I have ever enjoyed here was the Round Salad. The last time I went I was extremely hesitant because of previous visits, however, I figured one more time couldn't hurt. I was so wrong. The she crab soup was decent but barely warm, my chicken was way overcooked, and a person in our group of 8 found a large piece of plastic in his jambalaya. The service was decent so I cant fault her for the over hour wait for the food. I definitely will not be going back. The manager came over (maybe the owner?) on a Saturday night with a toboggan on his head, which I found a little odd for a place that is supposed to be a little more "upscale". (Especially with the price point) I wish I could say maybe it was an "off night" but with the two previous experiences I don't think that is the case. 1
We have taken several trips this year and AnnetteWas MOST helpful and resourceful in doingThe research and planning for us and several other friends !  We just returned from London and severalSide trips arranged by Annette were extremelySuccessful and educational for us !Annette is SO knowledgeable about various citiesOf the World and how best to enjoy themAt a reasonable price !Annette is the BEST !  Thank you for doing all thatYou do for us ! 5
I took our 2011 S550 here for a regular service and to have the backup alarm checked out. The backup alarm was not as loud as it had been before. It essentially was not audible and non functional...UNSAFE!  I had it to MB of Scottsdale twice and was told: "That's how it is.  It can't be adjusted."  The guys at Auto Haus actually checked it out on their computer, and found it was set at only 40%. They turned it up, and what do you know, I can hear it like  it used to be. Huh! So if you actually do the work, you can fix things. I guess some shops don't think this small repair is worth their time. Auto Haus is a professional shop. Chris and Travis made my car right and care about what they do . They have earned my business. 5 stars. Score: Auto Haus 1; Dealer 0 5
I stood at the counter for 20 minutes being completely ignored. Then the employees said "everyone there is no line, please just crowd around the counter and try as many samples as you want." Every person then proceeded to crowd around and the employees only served the newest customers. I continued to be ignored. I then left without gelato extremely frustrated. What a waste. I will never go back. 1
Don't ignore the reviews:  this is some of the worst food at the most ridiculous prices you'll ever find.  In fact, it belongs on the restaurant equivalent of the list of movies so bad, you have to see them for their hilarity.  I ordered a New York strip with tempura and got back one of the worst cuts of meat I've ever been served.  Fatty, possibly old.  I mean, this "steak" was more suitable for your dog.  The tempura was unremarkable.  The salad was lettuce with some dressing.  Miso soup tasted like it had a non-fish base.  (Touch of beef broth?  I don't know).  All this for $36.  I'm still trying to decide which was worse, this, or Estiatorio Milos.  At least I could eat the food at Milos, even though it was mediocre and I had to arrange financing.  This stuff . . . this stuff was plain BAD.The service was equally bad.  I wanted for a refill many times.  The ambiance was tomb-like.  Should have been a tip-off, but I wasn't thinking.  Oh, the regret . . .Terrible, just . . . terrible.  Don't eat here.  Go to Chipotle or something.  You might at least walk away satisfied. 1
First time here. Service was horrible. Seemed like no one was happy except the manager. Took forever to get the food. Order was wrong. Would not recommend this place save your money. 1
Food here is ok but overpriced.  Server asks for our drink order and my wife and I ordered apple juice as it was breakfast time.  Our drinks were brought out immediately and the food 20 minutes later.  While we sat of course we sipped and by the time the food arrived my juice was gone.  I asked for a refill to which I was then told oh no refills on that.  1. How do you bring me a drink 20 minutes before my food and then tell me no refills?  2.  Is there a juice shortage?  It's not expensive for juice quit being greedy.  And 3.  If there are no refills tell us, up front and ask if we want something else or juice when the meal comes.  Very shady and I will not be coming here again 1
Very mixed feelings about this hotel.Location is very close to ASU's tempe campus, so it's convenient if you're visiting ASU. The surrounding city of the hotel is fillllled with methamphetamine addicts. And yes, it is very creepy- and that is coming from a 24 year old male.The customer service INSIDE the hotel was great. The breakfast buffet also tasted good. The hotel rooms are nice, although they only have $5 water available which is annoying and the fridge is LOCKED so you can't store any of your drinks.The reason why I docked 2 stars was not so much the tweakers, as it was the LOUD clunk sound whenever the AC turns off. From what I've heard, this happens in every room.So, if you need to sleep with AC at night (and you will, in the summer) - be SURE to buy or bring ear plugs. It's the only way to get through the night - trust me.... 3
I wouldn't rent again from them!  They try to scare you into buying their insurance when you have insurance. I've never had to give them my insurance info and deductible info, yet Payless asked for it all.  Not sure why!  The car I was given was banged up pretty good, but they don't check it. I had to check the car all out myself. Return was fast and painless, but won't rent again from them. I was nervous driving the darn car all weekend cause of the agent at the desk! 2
5 stars. The restaurant looked a little mis-leading, almost furnished like a smitty's but the food was insane. Honestly one of the best meals I have had from start to finish. I was blown away. Fantastic service as well. Just amazing. The rooms were different from your average hotel. Nice fixtures on everything. Wine glasses. Hot water kettle. Nice steam room and hot tub in the basement. I'll be holding all hotels to this standard now! 5
Just Baked Cupcakes & Coffee House has the most creative variety of cupcakes I've ever seen. The cupcakes are delicious, and have an artistic and creative presentation. The first thing I noticed when I came into the shop, however, was the hospitality of the owners and how happy the customers were who were sitting at the tables. It's actually a two-story house that they've refurbished, and there's nice art on the walls, along with antique furniture everywhere. The rooms have comfortable seating and the atmosphere is very relaxed. The owner is great at making creative designs in the coffee, and the cupcakes are the best I've ever tasted. (I think they're good enough to go on the show "Cupcake Wars.") This has turned into one of my favorite places to go to for a real treat. In fact, I work at the nearby college, and my co-workers and I sometimes come here to conduct business meetings, we love it so much.  Their wireless is free, and we've had no problem with our computers and iPads working during our meetings. To sum up:  great food, great drinks, great service.  Love it! 5
i ordered a 5$ pepperoni and a hawaiin pizza...thin. the bill was 18$!!! the dough was gross,the toppings bunched in the middle,and who forgets ham on a hawaiin pizza?! next time will be little caesars...more for  less $! i do not recommend this place at all. 1
The staff was excellent across the board.  Helpful and knowledgeable with none of the grumpiness you might expect from people who sit behind bullet-proof glass and help people navigate through complicated exercises in paperwork.I am American and was going to file a Consular Report of Birth Abroad.  Your experience may be different if you are going to apply for a visa to visit the U.S. The line was definitely longer for visas, and as one reviewer notes, if it's busy you may very well spend time waiting outside.A couple of things could be improved:1. The list of things you can't bring inside that's posted on the web site is different from the one posted outside the building where you get in line.  The web site specifically says no cell phones, but in fact they will allow you to check a cell phone at security and pick it up when you're done.  The web site doesn't say anything about large purses or backpacks, but the sign outside says they are prohibited (although they did let me bring in my backpack full of art supplies to keep my five year old occupied while we waited).  I should have snapped a photo of the poster outside that lists prohibited items.  It's plainly visible from the street if you want to have a look in advance.2. They have an interesting interpretation of the word "appointment."  It doesn't mean come at a certain pre-agreed time and someone will see you at that time give or take a few minutes like it does in the rest of the world.  It means come at that time, take a number, and depending on how busy we are we will call you in 1-2 hours. Tip: don't kill yourself getting your Express Post envelope before your appointment.  You can duck out to the Staples across the street to get it while you're waiting for your number to be called.  Just make sure you get a slip of paper giving you permission to re-enter without waiting in line again. 4
I would give Glenda 0 stars if I could.  Me and a friend decided to get groupons to get our nails done and picked this place. What a mistake! I called and called and left a message and didn't receive a call back for almost 2 weeks. I should have know to get my $ back then. We did get an appointment about a month in advance. When my friend and I went to the very small salon station she had from the moment we stopped in she was rude. She couldn't accommodate any of my requests which weren't much. She was mad because I had acrylics and was acting like she had never seen them before and just couldn't accommodate painting on them or filling them. So I told her I could do the gel on my toes. I tried to work with her but she looked at my toes and said oh but you have sparkles on your toes (not sure why that matters as it was just regular polish)and said it would take too long to bring the gel uv light all the way over to the toes section. Keep in mind that's about 1 foot away from the nails station. I told her I would just get my $ back and she didn't try at all to make things better. The whole point of a groupon is to drum up business but all she did was guarantee a terrible review on yelp, groupon and word of mouth to all of my friends. Please save your self the worst customer service and go ANYWHERE else. 1
Bento box lunch - Grilled salmonI need to try the hot pot/fondue set next time. The bento box was okay, nothing too special. I loved the fruit the most because they were fresh and sweet. The salmon was pretty dry and seemed like it was cooked for a bit too long. The seaweed salad was abnormally green (food dye?), even the sesame seeds were green :/Service was good though :) 3
Wanted BBQ. low-and-behold two joints right next to eat other. The only reason we chose Rudy's was because it was busier, we assumed because it was better of the two....Scanned the restaurant; picnic tables, clean and open. OK., awesome I can bring my toddler and not worry about her ruining other peoples' meals.Greeted right away by a lady at the "country store". She asked us if have been before which we hadn't, I replied that we needed help (I have a20mo and a 4mo infant in a carrier). She came over to show us the menu, the line to place our orders and let us know that the cashier can give us samples of the meats. Fan-frickin-tabulous.We figured out our order then went to the counter. ALL DOWNHILL FROM HERE. Miss boring-as-all-get-out brunette. She didn't even look at us. HELLooooo.She wasn't even up at the register, but back about a foot. I asked if they had a kid's menu, she mumbled something incoherent. What??? So 2 registers down was a young man so we passed on miss head in the clouds. As we head to the other register the cashier left. ARGGGGGG! Back to the brunette.I start the order..... turkey sandwich and brisket sandwich..... to which she yells back and a man starts carving. Sandwiches were brought FAST. Then we ordered potato salad (get it yourself from the fridge), corn and new potatoes. She turns and gets the corn and potatoes, meanwhile my sandwiches are getting cold. COLD.She tap-types on her register and then says our total. Excuse me, can I order drinks????? Her bubbly reply (add sarcasm) "oh yeah".We grab napkins and a table, apply the bbq sauce and dig in..... to ice COLD meat sandwiches.Quick back track to the menu...NO KID's MENU?No mac and cheese?No fries?No cornbread?No green beans?No salad?The goodTurkey was moist and had a good flavor, would have been excellent if warm.Husband said brisket was really really good, but cold.The bad-Sause sucks, worse sauce I ever tasted. Like water and pepper. They have 2 sauces and both taste the same. One has a ton of pepper, the other has more.-Potato salad, really is potato salad so difficult?-Corn was soggy and had no flavor.-Red potatoes (called NEW POTATOES here) are water logged gross.The ugly-Napkins on the other side of the restaurant in a dispenser on the wall (bathroom 3-fold paper towel dispenser).-STYROFOAM- THE DEVIL OF THE PLANET.One star for the country store greeting gal.One star for the turkey.I'll be back for the turkey and a soda, skip the sides and bring my own sauce. 2
Great tea selection in a coffeehouse that's unique 'cause it's in a converted gas station. 4
First time went there the decor good! Design, the color very appealing sense of calm. Assorted chairs to choose from . Outside patio rated good love the fountains! Coffee gr8! Internet made it a plus. Now going be routine spot to go ! 4
i really like this place....nice ambiance.  The food is well seasoned and the seafood is fresh.  The wait staff is particularly good. 4
Super cool idea and I love the elevaotr... but the regular rooms are meh. For how much I wanted to spend it would have been nice to have something nicer... Still a really pretty hotel and the Titanic meuseum was really cool. 3
This review is STRICTLY for the nightclub at Lavo.  I've been to Lavo a few times.  I was not impressed at all the first time I was there and have only grudgingly gone back for friends birthdays/bachelorette parties.  I'm a local and I just cant understand the hype about Lavo.  The decoration is cool and its a very sexy vibe but for as much as you expect from their reputation, Lavo is TINY!!!! There's really only one square cut out for a dance floor and the stairs that lead up to it are always wet.  I don't personally think there should be stairs leading on and off a dance floor anyway.  Nevermind the few flights you have to walk up and down to get in and out of the club from the restaurant as is. The music was average. Not really much variety. Just all house music.  And it's so crowded in such a tiny space I've been burned by smokers' cigarettes on more than one occasion.  I'm not even a smoker.  Like I said, I understand the Vegas nightlife and I've seen smaller clubs than Lavo but for how many people rave about this place I think it's way over-hyped. 2
For our Vegas getaway we stayed at New York New York. Every time we passed by this place there were tons of people and the place seemed nice, so on our last morning we decided to give it a try. And here starts the reasons for just 2 stars:1. We walked up to the podium a min after the couple ahead of us. Instead of greeting the two of us as well and the host COMPLETELY ignored us! He just acknowledged the first couple and took them to their table, not so much as a smile in our direction. I would have been willing to overlook this if the meal hadn't continued in the wrong direction.Before I go on, a kudos to the management: My bf ordered waffles and I ordered an omelette. About 5 min after our order was taken the manager headed over with a beautiful plate of waffles. He explained that their waffle machine had been broken all morning and it just started working again. The manager didn't want to take the chance that his client wouldn't get the requested order and so decided to let the order go out early. Nicely done.2. My bf didn't want to start eating before me and we figured an egg couldn't take too long, so we kept chatting and waited. The table that was seated after us received their eggs and I was still foodless (this was 20 min after the waffles arrived). Just as I was about to say something I saw our waiter realize the mistake and turn a 180 on his heels back to the kitchen. However, he did not see that I had witnessed his mistake and was expecting him to head over to our table to give a small apology for the wait. Not so. When my omelette finally arrived I expected that to be his opportunity to give a small 'I'm sorry'. Not so. The mistake was never acknowledged, quite the contrary, our waiter ignored us through the whole meal!That should teach me not to expect. 2
Great food! Excellent service and food was made fresh! Must try calzones and pasta. Went close to closing time waitress was still friendly and professional. 4
I have been looking for a new studio since I left New York. I haven't been tattooed outside of that shop in years. I searched and searched until I walked into Alternative Arts. When I met the staff there I knew I found a new home. Thomas specifically has tattooed me a few times and it has been nothing but a pleasure to walk in those doors. The whole staff is great John, Billy, Vic, Thomas keep up the great work. Looking forward to many more good times. By the way my boys in NY are jealous now. 5
Excellent food, expertly prepared, specially the Ris de Veau (sweetbread). Everything we ordered tasted great, (onglet, the fish of the day, beef tongue, gnocchi Poutine, octopus appetizer) and they were all presented with fresh accompaniments and delicate combinations. Service was also excellent. My husband and I went twice to this restaurant and it's becoming one of our favorites in Montreal. 5
If you're looking for a location in the downtown that's close to the Eaton Centre, Ryerson Campus etc. you can't do much better. It's ideal. As well, if you're looking to pay as little as possible and still be in a hotel this close to the action, the Bond Place is your place. That said, the rooms are very very small, the TV is incredibly tiny, the bed and pillows are probably some of the most uncomfortable in recent memory (but if you like your mattress VERY hard, you might not mind it too much), and the bathroom is clean but basic (no fancy amenities in there).Can't say much about the restaurant. Ate breakfast in there one morning and the service was good. Not sure what the food is like overall, as what I ate would be pretty tough to make poorly.Overall, like another reviewer said, you get what you pay for. No surprises there. 2
As someone who works for Lisa, I see first hand the hard work she puts in for her clients. Contact Lisa for your next renting, buying or selling need! 5
Nice neighbourhood restaurant that maintains its standards.Food is good but not great. Recommendations:muscles to startsalmon for mainspinach salad 3
Though I can't say I've taken advantage of all it has to offer, I really like the idea of a co-op. It's been in the community for years and I feel good knowing I'm shopping somewhere local and cooperatively owned. They aren't the biggest grocer around, but they do have a nice selection and it's good quality food and it's definitely clean too. The produce is fresh and the variety is nice too. They also have a salad bar and hot food selection that are very tasty. They have a cooler section that has prepared food as well that is pretty great. They have a lemon pepper tofu sandwich that is absolutely amazing! The prices are decent... they're slightly higher for some things (but not all!) compared to a commercial grocery store, but they're cheaper than whole foods and I believe the quality is worth the tiny bit extra. They also offer lose (not prepackaged) goods such as nuts, granola, beans, teas, herbs, etc... that I really like. It's a fantastic place to go if you are vegan or vegetarian, but even if you are neither and just enjoy high quality and local food it's a place I certainly recommend. The parking lot and street parking gets a bit full at time and it can be a little tricky getting a spot at certain times, but I don't think that should hold anyone back form going. 4
I've been to Combs a number of times and I've always been satisfied with their service.  I also recently recommended them to a friend after the Mini dealer told her she needed $5000 worth of repairs, and Combs took care of her for $1500. But you never really get to know a place until a problem arises.  That's the trial by fire.It seems like I've been to a number of shops over the years where they'll fix a problem and then a week or two later another problem pops up in the same general area and they *never* admit to even the possibility that they were responsible.Combs was different.  They had replaced my fuel pump and a couple weeks later the Check Engine light came on with a code 'evap system leak'.  I guessed it was likely it had something to do with the previous repair since they had had to drop the tank and reinstall it to replace the pump.  To my surprise the service manager volunteered the same guess.  He thought a seal maybe hadn't gotten seated properly and asked me to leave the car with them so they could drop the tank again and check it out.  They ended up finding a hose that had come loose and fixed it.  No argument, no hassle, no charge!Combs is a long way from my house but they're my first choice when it comes to auto repair.  They're an honest shop. 4
do not eat if your diet lately has been healthy. your stomach gonna hurt real bad. other then that classic drunk food. mini burgers fries and a cherry coke. 3
ABSOLUTELY SICKENING! They are the most disgusting staff in existence. Abusers and losers.... zero percent worth your cover or insane amount per drink. STAY AWAY. 1
I really want to like this place! We keep trying (because of the madison.com deals) and enjoy the donuts for the madison.com price, but there's a lot left to be desired. The interior feels cold and unwelcoming and the food is fine but not particularly memorable. Free refills should be a thing (booths and layout say "diner"). And the service is not particularly warm. Still hoping this place can turn it around. 2
Very nice new interior. The booths are large and comfy, and we had a great server. 30 once beer specials are thirst quenching, but I wouldnt drive after one. The chickpea soup only had 7 peas, but nice flavour. Burger with bacon and egg added was awesome. 4
Izzy gave me a great haircut at a very fair price. I was a first timer in his shop and he gave me the exact haircut I asked for and also provided some thoughtful suggestions.  I got to watch The Sopranos on my personal TV which was another plus! I will certainly come back! 5
Moved to Scottsdale recently and I have found a great place to eat and drink.  The staff and owner always go out of their way to make me feel welcome.  Highly recommend. 5
Though the food is good but they have The most pathetic service ever!!!! They have no idea how to handle service in rush hours 1
I came in and bought a coffee, tipped the bartender and sat down and was told that I was not allowed to sit down if I was not ordering food. I've never seen such a thing in a coffee shop before. 1
d) we had better wine at home for 1/3 the price :-) 4
Tried their chicken shawerma today and its by far the best shawerma in Toronto specialllly the chicken !!!! 5
Been there several times and they serve the best steak I've had in Madison.  A good place to have a conversation or a special night.  You do have to like their ambiance. For my wife and I though it was too pretentious.  Too artificial.  Too stiff.  Too self aware.  They need to pull it back and relax just a bit.  This is Madison.  But again, the food, though pricey is outstanding. 3
The worst dining experience that I have ever had. Made a reservation for 15 since it was the only place in the area that took reservations. The service was unbelievably poor. 15 minutes after the only mixed drink was ordered, we went up to the bar to re-order it and bring it back to the table. The water glasses were empty the whole time until someone at our table thought to just ask for pitchers of water. The waitress acted annoyed with us the whole time. When the food was finally brought out, the waitress told us that one person at our table's food was not available and asked what he would like instead. This was 30 minutes after we had placed our orders! Another meal was never made, so the two steaks came out about 15 minutes later, but they were horribly cooked. The management almost didn't compensate us for both meals, but eventually did. We went up to the bar multiple times for forks, napkins, etc that the waitress never brought out to us, including a pen to fill out the check with. I am usually patient when it comes to slow or poor service, but this was outrageous. When we paid our bill, they cranked up the music so we would leave which we did, happily, and will never return. 1
Attorney Jake Smith and his assistant, Leanne, handled my case with diligence. They were both easy to get ahold of when I needed them and I was very happy with my settlement. :) 5
Absolutely terrible. No NOT order from this place. I was going to call it a restaurant, but restaurants actually cook food properly and know how to show they appreciate their customers. No, this place is awful. First of all, our food arrived looking like someone dropped a bowling ball on it. The containers were crushed. The chicken dinner we ordered was all legs and far too overcooked that it did not get eaten. We also ordered a 12 piece order of wings with medium sauce which came absolutely naked and flavorless. I called their shop to tell them how bad the order arrived and the "owner" who picked up kept claiming our order was right. I explained to him several times, while receiving a lot of attitude from him, what was wrong and he did not seem to even understand. Eventually he handed the phone off to someone else, while he talked loudly about me cursing in the background. I explain to the second person and eventually I'm told they will be doing nothing about this. I just wasted nearly $40 on food that was not eaten. Let this failure of a "restaurant" go out of business like it surely will. Do not order. 1
I tried Thai House after having recently returning from a trip to San Antonio where I was forced to go to a Thai place for lunch.  It was a highly recommended place and I loved it.  I immediately thought "when I return home I am going to Thai House to try it."I had high expectations that this would be a great place, but after one visit my expectations are much lower.  I ordered Tom Yum soup and the Spicy Basil Chicken.Tom Yum soup was tasty and I did enjoy that.  If I had the taste for just that soup, I would order it again.  The Spicy Basil Chicken (same dish I ordered in San Antonio) was not good at all.  It was listed as a "spicy" dish, so to find it bland when it it supposed to be spicy was a major disappointment.  There was also too much of it pilled onto the plate.  You need room to move the food around to let it cool from just being cooked but to also give you room to separate and eat what you like and see the food.I may try other menu items again sometime, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again, would have a backup plan, and would not recommend this to anyone. 2
Stayed here for a couple nights in January and it was just what we needed... a cheap place to drink and rage with friends. All 8 of the rooms booked with our party even came with either random hairs or blood, too! Bonus! That really didn't lessen the appeal for me though because you can't really have expected more for what we were paying. 3
Brought my Mom for Mother's Day dinner. I would actually probably give this a 4 1/2 stars if I could. The food was delicious and the atmosphere is lovely. We started with cocktails, a Gold digger for me and a sparkling Sangria for a couple of others and some wine. They have a nice selection of drinks and wines.  For an appetizer we had the Shrimp Casino Flatbread. At first I thought it was a little pricey for a flatbread appetizer until it arrived at the table. It was huge. Easily the size of a pizza. There were four of us and we had 2 pieces left. It was very good. The shrimp were a nice delicate pink, not overcooked at all and the bacon had a sweet maple flavor that was surprisingly good with the shrimp. They also served soft, warm rolls before dinner with a really nice herb butter. For our entrees we  had two at the table that had the beef tenderloin, one who had the bacon crusted pork chop and I had the sea scallops. I cannot rave enough about the scallops. They were large and perfectly seared with a love char on the outside and a soft center. They were wonderfully sweet and the smoked tomato corn butter was to die for. Really really good. You could smell the wonderful sweet corn aroma when the plate was set down and it paired so well with the scallops. I highly recommend. My companions all enjoyed their meals as well.  For dessert we split the BC Smores. Another hallelujah moment. It's not a traditional smore but instead had a  peanut crust  and peanut mixed with the chocolate. The homemade marshmallow was the a first for me and so much better than traditional store bought marshmallow. Much less sweet. I had only 2 small issues which keep me from giving the experience a fifth star - we sat in the small room adjacent to the bar that is enclosed in glass and the views were so lovely, but the tables are too close together. You really feel like you are dining with the tables on either side of you. The removal of even one table in each row would offer a little more privacy. The chairs are also very low. It was a little jarring when we first sat down. My mom is only 5 feet tall and she found the seat a little low for the table.All in all it was a wonderful experience. The service was top notch. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. I would definitely return and recommend. 4
Went there tonight for the happy hour, excited because it was nearby and looking for another cool wine bar. Asked a number of times about the happy hour and they didn't seem too clear. I tried to confirm a number of times that I wanted happy hour price and looked at the flyer posted on the wall that said five dollar wine until eight. Asked again for happy hour and ordered a drink. When we got our bill each of our glasses were $11 and not five dollars. They said they could take one dollar off each class. That is ridiculous!  I won't be back, bummer. We were talking about having events there with the new area they were opening but I think I will pass. 1
We were in Pittsburgh on a family reunion two weeks ago.  My wife and I wanted to try some of the local restaurants and stumble upon Jimmy Wans.  The restaurant looked interesting with a great decor.  The staff was very responsive and the service was good.Unfortunately, the food missed the mark.  For the starter, I had the wanton soup and my wife had the spring roll.  Tasteless, similar to Glenn C. opinion.  We had already ordered the entrees - kung pao chicken and  szechuan beef  -- They were large portions but again tasteless.  The Staff tried to help, but they were not the problem.  We talked to other at the reunion later, and were total the Fox Chapel restaurant was new in the chain and that it had some growing pains.  Maybe it will get better after they "season"  the chef.    After eating int the Strip District, this just didn't cut it. 3
I've been there as a reunion of friends a couple of weeks ago.Actually it is a very good place for gathering and reunion party.The decoration is fantastic and i really loved it.The good thing for a group is that every one get a card and can order whatever like beverage,different kind of food and every time they charge your card and at the end every one can pay her own bill separately.The verity of food are limited and the quality are medium.The server are not friendly!I had to wait to order a beer in the bar part for 15 min because no one was there.The prices are reasonable but don't look for a very special food there.Just a good place for group. 3
I like this place! Try the kids meal even if your a adult like me. you get a burger, drink and side. I think their food is very good and the daily custard specials are excellent. The place is cleaner then most quick places. I think worth a try. From WI I believe and they seen to never go away. Food is made to order but remember still a hamburger joint. 4
Service was good, drink was good, food was not terrible but disappointing. Wonton tacos are awesome! 3
Have you ever walked into a restaurant and thought to yourself, "Well, this is going to be different"? It's an exciting feeling that doesn't happen all that often; but, walking into Guu Izakaya on Church St., I was definitely overcome by that thought.  Everyone who enters and exits gets a loud greeting and goodbye from the entire staff. A bit overwhelming, but it certainly sets the tone for your evening. The place is an absolute nuthouse in the best possible way.That evening, my two companions and I were lucky enough to get seats within a few minutes upon arriving, a rare feat as I understand it. Guu features communal dining, with long tables that seat around 15 - 20 people, as well as seats at the bar where you can watch the chefs work. There is a two-hour time limit for diners and often a 1-2 hour wait for a seat. If you can, go early or prepare to cool your heels for a while. I promise you that it will be worth it.My friends had been to Guu before so they did the bulk of the ordering. They chose the best dishes they'd had before and also took cues from our tablemates who'd ordered some fascinating fare. The menu is set up tapas-style, a fantastic way to sample all sorts of delicious creations. We ordered eight dishes for the three of us which was just about right and all were quite reasonably priced.The first to arrive was the decidedly (and awesomely) decadent deep-fried brie served with a mango and blueberry sauce.  The four pyramid-shaped morsels were golden and crispy on the outside and gooey, rich deliciousness on the inside. Like, eyes-rolling-in-the-back-of-your-head-good. Next up: the salmon sashimi. Melt in your mouth greatness. It's one of those simple dishes that really sings based on the merits of great, high quality ingredients.On to the bacon-wrapped scallops and enoki mushrooms. Holy. Smokes. Bacon-wrapped anything is a winner in my books but here the contrasting textures played against each other so beautifully. Paired with the salty pork, the sweet scallop and earthy mushrooms, this dish was so good that it was tempting to cancel the rest of our order and have nothing but this for the rest of the night.The beef carpaccio was placed before our wide eyes next and it was a lovely, bright contrast to the richness of the dish before. Served with with ponzu, wasabi, mayo & garlic chips, this rare beef was light and, somehow, refreshing. It was nice to have a lighter bite after the richness of the scallops before.It was at this point in our meal that I noticed a crowd of waiters pause from their constant, frenetic activity. Then I spotted a server with a slice of cake with a candle in it. Guu's birthday celebrations put Chuck E. Cheese to shame. Not only did the wait staff lead the entire restaurant in a rousing rendition of "Happy Birthday", encouraging everyone to clap and sing along, but even the insanely busy chefs joined in. At one point, they had the lights flickering on and off. Utter celebrational pandemonium and it was amazing.Once the place had settled down a little (to be clear, Guu is the least settled place on the planet), the strangest creation of the evening appeared at our table. It was roughly the size of a softball, deep fried and had a wooden knife protruding from the centre. We wracked our brains trying to figure out if we had actually ordered it, decided we hadn't and dug in anyway. What it turned out to be was a Japanese scotch egg with a layer of pureed pumpkin surrounding a hard-boiled egg. While I was skeptical initially - I'm not a big pumpkin fan, much to the horror of many of my friends - the combination of the creamy pumpkin, rich egg, crispy exterior and tangy sauce was downright addictive. We just about scraped the plate without chopsticks long after other dishes had been cleared away.When the spare ribs arrived, it was all I could do to refrain from gobbling them all up myself. The marinated beef was tender and salty, having surely been marinated for quite some time. If you're a fan of spare ribs, these are a can't-miss.The final dishes of the night were the decadent, baked oysters and the light, miso-glazed black cod. We ordered the oysters because we saw them arrive for another group at our table and they looked so unique! Kind of a twist on oysters Rockefeller, they're served with spinach and mushrooms, smothered in a potent mayo-garlic sauce and topped with melted cheese...all in a giant shell. This was a thing of glorious, messy beauty. The mushrooms nestled in there made for an umami bomb of a bite. Definitely give this one a shot, my friends. It's weird and tasty and I've never seen it anywhere else.Not only was this one of the best meals I've had all year, it was by far and away the most fun. Unquestionably, the company helped but the atmosphere at Guu is like none other. It's not the place to go for a quiet, intimate dinner; it's the place to go when you want to try innovative, playful and truly remarkable dishes. 5
I generally eat here 2-3 times a week. By far the best place in Brookpark to get breakfast. Hearty, fresh portions at good prices with good service. I usually go with the western omelet, but they have very good french toast as well. Their hash browns are awesome. They are pan fried red potatoes. You could say I'm a fan. 4
I am often way too lazy to write a review but this place is so amazing that I must do it.  After reading on Yelp! about all the goodness of this place, I gave it a try. I love middle eastern food and grew up in NY where we have very good middle eastern food.  I was greeted very warmly by the owner, Isam.  I told him I heard about their famous lemonade so I will have that and something else he would recommend.  He gave me a sweet smile and told me that the lemonade is on the house as it is my first time.  (how nice!)  I ordered to go the Lebanese chicken (one breast split in halves, rice, tabouli, and one large fluffy, pillowy pita made fresh) and the falafel (smaller than I'm used to but very tasty) that came with tahini sauce that is very very good.  I finished my drink before the food came and he gave me a free refill! I wanted to get a lemonade for my coworker to go, and he gave me that for free too! He was very easy to speak with.  I hate going to places where the food is great but the owner makes you feel like you should beg (think Seinfeld and the soup nazi).  But this guy was very nice.  There was a lady behind me who went for the first time yesterday, and came back today with her friend.  The owner immediately recognized her and apologized to her for something.  It turned out that there was a guy (I think from the store next door) that was bothering her as she walked in yesterday.  She told the owner about it. The owner (after she left) spoke to the guy and he apologized to her for what he did yesterday.  The owner also apologized for the guy's behavior.  What a man!My food was really really good.  And when he packed my food in the bag, he gave me two big slices of bahkalava on the house (again)!!I am definitely coming back and bringing more people. 5
Ichiban's sushi is actually pretty good and their pricing is also great but my beef with this place lies with the wait staff. They have pretty terrible service, I had to get up a couple of time. They are also pretty stingy and cheap. 3
Where to begin...I ordered our food (take-out Hibachi) and told them, extra vegetables, hold the rice. When I got home, it was extra rice and not a vegetable in site. My bad, I should have checked but please explain to me why the chicken, steak and shrimp were so over cooked and dry? When you spend over sixty dollars, you have expectations! Everyone's dinner sucked. Perhaps it was just a crappy night, but I doubt I will be headed back anytime soon. 1
Went there last night and was very pleased with the selection and quality of food. There was a large selection of fancy, small portioned dishes such as gnocchi, mushroom risotto, sushi items, French onion soup, wedge salads, Caesar salads with little anchovies on top, BBQ ribs with a great char flavor (also had chicken and pork shoulder), shrimp flavored rice paper which was fun and tasty, salmon, and sooo many delicious and fun desserts including a gelato selection. The crab legs were just ok, but we had gone near to closing time so I can't complain. Alcohol is not included. Great atmosphere and great food overall and I definitely recommend it! 5
Stayed here for two nights last weekend, room was small but clean with one exception......a fish hook stuck in the carpet that I had the pleasure of stepping on.  Luckily I reacted fast enough to not have to make the emergency room visit to remove said hook.  I do not blame the hotel for this but regardless it wasn't pleasant.All in all a decent stay. 3
Went to dinner with group of friends on Saturday night and the place was jumpin!   First off, this place is really cool, with lots of space but a bit loud.  That's okay though.   The location in downtown Chagrin Falls is great but, as everyone knows, the parking situation can be a challenge.  Definitely use the complimentary valet!   The decor inside is a trendy warehouse chic.  We sat by the open kitchen where all the action is.  Those guys busted their butts all night!  However, there were some snafus!  Cold soup, cold pizza, cold pork chop and an unexpected piece of plastic in a meatball.  The manager was quick to respond to everything but it did delay some of our groups meals and became the talk of the evening!   Once we all received our meals, everyone enjoyed them.  We will return because we've had great experiences before.  I'm chalking it up to an "off night"! 3
First, I downloaded this app and just started using Yelp just for this review. I never write reviews or try and go out of my way to upset people. I got into a motorcycle accident 2 years ago In April. I was out of work for 7 months piles and piles of medical bills and a motorcycle that I still never repaired. I had a really bad experience with Law Tigers and walked away from that. I was really debating on whether I should even try anyone else but I knew I had a case and didn't want to quit when I knew I was a victim. I know a guy named Brian that was talking up a storm about how his buddy "Dan Hogle" is the best lawyer and how he would be the best fit for my case. So, I called, set up an appointment to talk to someone and brought in my textbook full of medical bills, records, and police report. This is all in December when I set this meeting up so I'm not too sure who the lawyer I spoke with was (I only met and talked to him ONCE). So we started talking about my case, drawing pictures of what happened, going over what we could do to move forward, man he sold me so quick. He was energetic, assertive, and seemed wicked smart. I was sold on this guy so I signed the paperwork for him to help me out and gave him my giant file, shook hands, said he would be in touch soon and then go from there. I left feeling wicked confident and happy. Then.... I didn't hear a thing until one day in April I called to see what was going on. I talked to a women and gave her all my info to look me up. She finds me in the system and says to me "So they are still working on your case it just takes a little bit to go to the next step" she then proceeds to tell me that she will have someone contact me. Didn't give me a date or time she just told me someone would call me. So, I trusted her and hung up the phone and went on with my business. It's now June  and I'm not happy at all. I call to see what the hell is going on and of course, no one answers. I left a voicemail and then received a text message from a "Victoria" who asks if I have the right law firm because I'm not in the system. I respond to her stating I'm in there and I would like to talk. She then states she's out of town and she will get back to me on Monday. Monday comes by and I wait and wait until I call them to see if she's working. Well like before, I get the voicemail again and leave ANOTHER message where I'm STILL waiting. I text her yet again telling her I haven't heard back from anyone and 24 hours later, no response. I called one more time and surprise surprise. NO ONE ANSWERED. I thought Law Tigers was bad but NOTHING compares to this type of service. No one should ever have to go through what I've gone through so do yourself a favor and look for another lawyer. Maybe if I was a drunk driver I would have had better service. 1
This is a great place to get something different for lunch or a quick dinner.  I love the chicken masala wrap.  As the other reviewers have said, it is a "Chipotle" type setup, as in, you choose your rice, your protein, veggies, and sauce.  It's really an excellent wrap.  I also love the Bombay spice iced tea - yum!  I can't believe people are sitting next door eating a bland Jimmy Johns sandwich when they could be having one of these exotic concoctions.  I am really sad people are giving this place bad reviews, but I never went to the original location, so I'm not sure what they are comparing it to.  If you are coming in looking for a traditional Indian restaurant, that is not what this is, so set your expectations accordingly. 4
It was a nice exhibit but the price is too high. No lines at all when I went inside. Many people were already inside but still not crowded. Price should be lower for the size. It's a good place to visit as a tourist since it's only one time. 3
I had a nice experience with this salon! Being from out of town i wasn't sure where to go and who to trust. I was in bad need of a hair cut and color. The receptionist was friendly and introduced me to Josie who did a great stylist cut and covered my grays!!! Best of all the hair color products was gentle on my skin. 4
I'm in love with La LaserLV!!! I gave this business a 5 star rating all around! When I first found out about LA LaserLV it was from Instagram. I contacted Amber and she returned my call super quickly! She was very upbeat and super nice. I booked an appointment that week! When I came in for my appointment, their receptionist was extremely sweet and super welcoming. I was introduced with Rita who would be doing my laser treatment. Rita was really knowledgeable and comforting as I was nervous! She educated me on the procedure and let me know I had nothing to worry about and that she would take very good care of me. She was absolutely right! It was PAINLESS!!The day after my treatment, Rita reached out to see how I was doing after my first treatment. I thought that was very PROFESSIONAL of her!!! She is really passionate about her work and has all the answers to make you feel comfortable! Thank God for LA LaserLV thanks for starting my journey on being razor FREE! 5
Got the lap cheung (Chinese sausage) and seaweed egg waffle and matcha ice cream. The soft serve ice cream was very creamy and while it was good, I didn't think it needed to be incorporated with the waffle.The lap cheung waffle was an interesting mix of sweet and savoury. There was no line up when we went at night and the waffle was made well. Not underdone or overdone.Wasn't going to come because of all the hype and most likely won't be back unless I happen to be in the area. 3
I booked this room thinking I got a great rate. But what they do not tell you when you book is that there is a $30 resort fee per night. When I checked out the front desk said it is because they have a pool and a Day Spa. Well I do not go to spas (at least ones that do not have Asian in the name lol jk :) especially overpriced ones. And every hotel I have ever been to includes the pool at no charge. The Marriott Marquis in San Diego did not have this ridiculous fee and it was 10 x cleaner and the pool was 10x bigger.  The room was OK but it was kind of dirty and in need of improvements. Like holes in the couch. The mini fridge was busted. The jacuzzi tub had an oily film in the water that seems to have came from the jets. And the biggest bummer was they lock the patio door so we looked at the ok view of the strip through the dirty glass. Bottom line I could have found a better room probably on the strip for the same price maybe less. 2
Worst spray I have ever recieved...recently moved here the bestfriend swears by you. So of course me and a couple girlfriends decided to try your salon. Worst idea ever. "It's supposed to look like that"... I'm pretty sure my legs aren't supposed to be the only thing semi-tan? Next morning/today. Lools even worse. Still white haha! Well at least me and my girlfriends know where to not waste our money at(; 1
After I finally got the keys to my room at the Flamingo in Las Vegas, I opened the curtains & my mouth hit the floor when a pink sign across the street at Caesars Palace caught my eye. I can't believe Serendipty & the infamous Frozen Hot Chocolate is in Vegas!  I don't have to fly to NYC to get one. 4
The only good thing at this place is the friendly staff... The food however is ...terrible. Save your money. I don't know how someone can over cook rice into a mash! The curry was literally just curry no veggies or anything... And I felt like I was drinking curry soup that was much too creamy and not enough spice. Also had the Tom Yum Shrimp soup... Very disappointing it was literally some powder tasting broth with 3 shrimp and a couple mushroom slices... Not a traditional Tom Yum at all. If they had a -1 star I would have put it. 1
I'm giving marquee 4 stars, because it is a popular club and not necessarily because I had a great experience there. Anyone yelping to find a good club in Vegas, marquee is one of the coolest clubs to date.Kalila and I went for my friend Sam's birthday on a Monday night. "Marquee Monday" is party rock themed. Go dressed in either "party rock" attire or semi-casual."Party Rock" attire involves anything the guys from LMFAO would wear. Giant afros, big framed glasses, anything neon & bright, anything animal print, anything fur.This place was absolutely PACKED. It was hard to walk around and hard to dance, but that doesn't stop people from having themselves a great time. Being bumped into is a normal part of nightlife. Marquee is definitely doing something right if they can fill their entire place up on a MONDAY. They have a great thing going for them with their alliteration.They have 3 different floors. I only got to go to 2 floors. There was a party rock floor with all EDM (electric dance music) and "The Boombox" with all hip-hop music.When I left, I went to Pho Kim Long! ....which I also wrote a review for! ;) 4
We returned the car with a full tank and a receipt from the gas station, and were told "all set, you can just leave the receipt on the dash". Then after coming home I saw a fuel charge on my credit card for $42 plus tax. Now in order to dispute this I'll have to provide proof that we actually refilled the car. Make sure you double check your receipt and charges at drop-off, or just avoid using Hertz which is what I plan to do in future. 1
Overall the atmosphere was fun, service was good, but given the other awesome restaurants across the street on E. 4th, you should eat somewhere else.Giant meatball was okay. Good, not great. It was lacking flavor and the meat was dry.We also ordered the Spicy Pie. Again, good but nothing to rave about. I like that it was oven style pizza. I think I was expecting a little more flavor and WOW. 3
Buying a car can be bitter sweet, dealing with a car salesman is a struggle if you go to the wrong dealership. However, when I came to this dealership Justin listened really well to my wants and needs, very professional and polite. Originally I didn't come in to buy. After speaking with Justin more about the escape that I later purchased he gained my trust with his sincere passion to help me find the best car that fits in my daily life and routine. The process was quick and pain free!  Lastly the final price was exactly as negotiated. Thank you Justin and Bell Ford. 5
I was able to get discount tickets to this show, B section, for only $38 bucks, but even if I had to pay full price, it would have been worth it. I arrived expecting to simply see a bunch of boobs swinging around for an hour or so, but the show ended up being so much more than that. The intimate ampitheater-style venue is perfect for such a performance, as everyone gets a good view. There are a series of dancers, who come out for group or solo performances, but it's supplemented by a woman who has an absolutely amazing voice. I can't recall her name, but I wouldn't be surprised if she one day becomes a recording artist on a major record label, as she hits all kinds of notes, effortlessly! So there I was, enjoying the music, and the dancing, when another element was injected into the show....comedy. I truly wasn't expecting it, but it was a good surprise. The comedian not only told jokes, but also was an impersonator (James Brown, Sammy Davis Jr, Tina Turner, Michael Jackson), and worked his way into one or two of the acts with the dancers. The combination of the music, dancers, costumes (or lack of), and comedy, created a great evening for me. And I'll mention, that I'm a gay man, and I thoroughly enjoyed this topless show, so it's definitely something for all adult audiences! Although the show is sexy, it's not sexual, if that makes sense. Anyway, it's worth checking out. Oh, and one last point, if you sit int he first couple of rows, you'll get a chance to have the singer and dancers come by and shake their boom booms in your face :) 5
Gross gross gross gross. My food tasted as if it were a few days old. The noodles were like spaghetti noodles and waayyy over cooked and the sauce tasted sour. I will never come back here. I am incredibly disappointed. I should have asked for a refund but I really did not want to bother. 1
Great crepes and overall quality. The prices are too high, but hey that Vegas. Good for a group of four but not more than that. 4
Nothing special unfortunately. That didn't come to a surprise though. Tiptoeing the line just like every fredricos.. 3
Love Lisa! She's the best, always does my stiletto nails perfect and I'm super picky! I drive quite a distance to get to her and it's totally worth it every time. She is very talented with nail art and always helps me pick colors when I don't know what I want and some times I even give her full charge and she can do whatever she wants, well worth the drive, totally worth the price! 5
Although a beautiful place and overall I am happy to have my grandfather here I am incredibly displeased with the administration.  From the lack of greeting, the general disorganization and forgetting to schedule the honor guard.... My grieving family was every disappointed both in our experience today and in not providing the the last honorable salute for our loved one that he so richly deserved! 1
AMBIENCE: A little hectic, especially when you first get off the escalator. You walk straight into a crowd and it's not clear where to go to get your name on the list (hint: it's on the right). SERVICE: Friendly and patient while I pored over the tantalizing menu, asking repeatedly for a couple more minutes. Even though the waitress was clearly busy, she kept checking on us. FOOD: I got talked out of ordering the (gigantic) blueberry pancakes and went with the chicken and waffles instead. It comes with 4 big waffle squares and 2 large fried chicken breasts. Definitely too much for one person. If the chicken fried steak is on the menu when you're there, you have to get it. It was enormous. VALUE: Excellent. Especially for being on the strip. You may want to split an entree. DRAWBACK: The wait can be super long. We actually got on the list, went up to our hotel room for 45 min, came back, and then waited another 15 minutes before we were called. Then we waited another 10 minutes before actually being seated. The food/value make this place worth the wait though. 4
Went there for the first time a couple of weeks ago, and have plans to go again tomorrow night :)   Nice, friendly staff, the place was packed and even though we had to wait sometimes, we had plenty of sake to hold us over.  The sushi is great- It's not the BEST ever but it's fabulous enough for me to want to go back.  Last time, we ordered toro (very good, at MP, and he even threw in an extra piece for me) it was soft and creamy and delicious and a bunch of rolls ( The "Pink Lady" roll was fabulous and the "what the heck" roll, is really good, can't remember the other names), 2 orders of sake and 2 beers and our total was $85 (I don't think they have an All You Can Eat option). The sushi chef partook in drinking with us, he had his beer and was cheering everyone, saying "Otoo" or something I couldn't understand, so I just made the noise "Otooo" and drank as told,  with him, haha.  Sake was tasty, had it cold.  All in all, I'm definitely a fan, as it's pretty close to where I live and has a nice atmosphere.  We did have a "pretty folk"  (trendy/fusion places worry me and made me think "Nobu") couple next to us, which worried me, 'cause I'm a very laid back, don't care about being "cool" kinda chick, but they seemed like regulars there, and they were nice enough, even though they ordered Uni (gag)......  We did spend a good amount of time watching the very inebriated chick a few spots down from us eat with her mouth open and slurrily talk, it was awesome, she said she had a bad day; I just liked watching her carelessly chew and shove things in her mouth...haha.  I'm a glutton/fatty so as long as you are enjoying it and you aren't spewing bits of food ON me, I'm cool witcha.  Like I said, good solid place, good, solid sushi and good folk.  Edit:  I'll be there tonight, stuffing myself to the gills, badumtish. 4
The previous reviewer got this spot-on.  I mean, who WOULDN'T want to go to the UN-friendly neighborhood bar?  Oh, wait.  EVERYBODY.  The BF and I are new to the DeFo area, and looking for a local hangout.  Upon entering The Landmark, we immediately learned a helpful tip that I am happy to pass along to you: don't try to start a conversation with the bartender/owner, because his personality seems to be a curious mix of hung-over crocodile and rubber spatula.  My conclusion is that he must be independently wealthy:  I'm guessing that the geriatric regulars are not the highest tipping bunch, but how DARE new people walk through his hallowed doorway?! 1
I had an absolutely wonderful experience at Bridal Beginning. There is such a huge and varied collection of dresses. The ladies there were all so very nice and helpful. I lucked out getting to work with Sam, who after just a few minutes was able to explain my taste and my idea of what I wanted 10 times better than I was able to! We worked our way through a couple dresses, it all started coming together and then there it was! Sam and the other ladies were so warm, helpful and honest and seemed truly happy to have helped me find my dress. Even though I kept them there late! Thanks to you all! Sam, you're wonderful! 5
I'm a student doing a summer internship downtown so I booked this place for the 12 weeks. They offered me a great deal for the long term stay, it was discounted due to the length of my stay. I read the reviews, but still decided to book. The outside is nice looking, but then again, it looks like a hotel. The reception area wasn't spectacular, but I didn't expect much after the price I was quoted. The hallway carpet has stains, but so does the Biltmore. I was given a 2nd floor room, but requested first floor since I would be leaving early in the morning to work and staying awhile. They had no issue with having me look at a couple available first floor rooms and choose one. The rooms were impressive actually. The stove, sink, full fridge, and bathrooms were very nicely set up and in good shape. The bed isn't the most comfortable, but definitely not a deal breaker. There is a HD flat screen TV with free cable, and also free internet available. I've been here a week so far and I am very happy I stayed with this choice. The pool, although I have not been in it, looks nice and I see somebody cleaning it every morning. 4
Terminal 2 is absolutely the worst terminal ever. It took over an hour to get through security. They were making people that were TSA approved still remove their shoes. And there are no places to eat pre security. DONT FLY OUT OF THIS TERMINAL. 1
Not my favorite place in town . Sorry not sorry #brysontiller Go to famous faces across the street . Not bad just not my favorite . 3
If I was a vegetarian, I would probably give it 4-stars because the food is very good for vegetarian, gluten-free. The reason it gets 3-stars is because I do eat meat, and this place is very expensive considering there's no meat involved. I got 2 dishes, which ended up costing me $9 with tax. I was still a little hungry afterwards, but I just couldn't handle paying more than $10 for vegetables and chickpeas. The quinoa salad and chickpea curry with coconut milk I ate were very good. There were a variety of dishes to choose from, and a soup of the day. The soup the day I went, was borscht for the beet lovers out there. There are a lot of tables and large windows, so there's a lot of light. A nice place to eat with pleasant staff. 3
Eli & the rest of the gang here are amazing! Stop in and let them give you a demonstration; you won't regret it! 1
my wife and i went on a saturday afternoon . the place was busy,( always a good sign). The pho I got was good and flavorful But i think that the sandwitches are are the best! yum! Im there for the sandwitches 3
This place is ok at best. Debated on giving it two stars but there are some nice things that I did enjoy about my stay. Bed is ok. No fitted sheets and they don't tuck the flat sheets in so that kinda grossed me out. I liked the color scheme and decorations in the room. The showers are weird, the glass partition covers LESS THAN HALF of the shower. The water pressure is great but since there isn't really a shower door water shoots out like a fricken waterfall getting the floors soaking wet. I used all the towels in the room and still couldn't dry the floors. I talked to housekeeping about this (very sweet woman, the rest of the staff treats you like a second class citizen) and she said all the rooms are like this. You can see the bathroom door is warped on the bottom from water damage. The location is great if you're into Freemont St. Its so close, you can hear the live music/DJ from your room loud and clear at 1am on weekdays, later on weekends. The casino has a kind of steampunk/vintage feel with a touch of modern that I really liked. Parking is in a garage off site(free) valet was 7 bucks(even for guests) Long story short, I would stay on the strip next time, really didn't save much money by staying out here at just an ok hotel. 2
Went to dinner before a 7:30 show at the Ohio theater. There were three of us having dinner. We all started with a romaine salad - a take on a caeser - which was delicious. Two of us ordered the Cod and one had the Giant Pork Shank. The cod was seasoned well and cooked perfectly. It was served with Spinach, Pureed Parsnips and a beurre blanc sauce. The parsnips were good, as was the spinach. The sauce was sweet, which was unexpected  and combined with the natural sweetness of parsnips was a little too sweet.  The pork shank was delicious and my companion loved it. For dessert we split the meringue with salted caramel ice cream. We choose it after reading the reviews on Yelp. This is sooo good it would be worth a trip for this dessert alone.   Overall it was a very enjoyable experience. 4
I have had massages before.  This was the worst and a terrible experience. Regardless of what you pay, it's not worth it to come out feeling cramped and stressed.  They had this woman who couldn't speak nor understand English massage me and used a suction cup to push my muscles. She was uneven in massaging me. She focused on my left side and pushed inward toward my spine to the right.  She pushed ligaments to a knot rather than loosen them.  And they claimed that she was doing pressure points. In fact, the pressure was in the wrong places.  It turned out that I had to go to the hospital days after for numbness on the full right side of my body.  It is a serious situation. I am now testing for partial stroke or pinched nerve.  Either way, it was a result of the massage.  I didn't get a refund for the service back because I paid through Groupon.  I'm not sure if it's too late to get my money back on this.  In any case, I want to warn people that not everyone in this Oasis Spa is a licensed therapist. The results can be life threatening.  Don't go there! 1
Atmosphere is Top Notch Beautiful! Sushi Rolls and Food is one of the best and freshest in town! The only down side was a select few waiters/ waitresses did not have the time of day for us after our orders were taken.. Plus its awkward when another waiter has to check up on your table.. If your not at the Bar or Hibachi I would go somewhere. Great Food Overall. 4
Pizza was ok, mozzarella sticks not too great, tiramisu was partially frozen. I asked for ranch twice (with the pizza and again with the mozzarella sticks) and didn't get any. Probably won't order here again. 3
Yummy food very friendly Lots to chose from won ton Great Spring roll are awesome the ribs are a joke.  I usually like the spicy octopus and that was bad.The dessert selection is Huge. The ice cream comes in personal containers that are delicious! Flavors like vanilla cookies and cream chocolate, green tea , coffee ect.It took 3x to get a high chair that was not broken 4
10-25-2013 Monday 6 PM party of four. We were seated and immediately were approached by a very rude server female. I was clear she didn't want to be there let alone serve us. This was really a shame as the other couple (visitors from Australia) had never been in an Outback but come to the states every year. We ordered drinks, which came one at a time. I asked the server what was the problem, she said bartender had to restock entire bar. Wife ordered salad, no croutons server was snippy. Order steak and lobster steak cook wrong lobster was size of shrimp over cooked. Server was no help what so ever. Bad experience .01 TIP rendered.This outback has been steadily going down hill for Two years. 1
THe service was not the best.  The lady argued that we received the number for our order, when we were the only ones in the restaurant at the time.  The Salmon was bland.  The beef was flavourful.  We had asked for tap water.  We had to ask again.  The lady put the pitcher down and gave 3 cups without saying anything.  We will not come again. 3
A few of us went here for lunch on a Friday and while the food was very good the service was very slow and inattentive.   I had the Blue Petit Mignon and the portion size was just right for lunch. 2
First time eating there the food was good but the atmosphere and service was lacking.  Was not busy, dining area had trays with dirty dishes laying around. We had to ask for silverware.  Some tables were set up others were half set up. This place is opened 24 hours maybe it should have business hours like other restaurants of this type.  We felt like we were at Denny's at 4 in the morning.  Don't go there on purpose. Ok place if your hungry and you happen to be by it. 3
So, whenever you have a California gurl in a Mexican Restaurant, it has to be good.  My weary tummy has not had anything substantial all day, and having read the best of the best about the amazing La Tolteca, I decided to let me feet hit the street & check out this local flor in the rough.  Well, I have to say the reviews are all TRUTH.  The green enchilada's were my choice as I've not ever been huge fan of the red sauce, in addition to a full range of all that one could feast your immediate appetite too, there is also fresh tortillas, candy, the bakery which is a temptation I did avoid (thank you P90X) and yes, I did say it, the temptation is the BAKERY,  the smells hit your nose before you even step in, yeast, sugar and spices, La Raza!  Enjoy your time, don't rush, I wandered around and grabbed my favorite Fanta to connect the true flavors of home, Cali and my youth, thanks for the great time La Tolteca, and you'd better be sure that I'll be stopping in again with re-inforcements.   Gracias & Happy Eating 5
I've been wanting to try this restaurant for a while now and finally made it out for Arizona Restaurant Week. Unfortunately I did not have a good experience. The waiter my partner and I had was so unattentive. After we were seated we had to specifically ask for the restaurant week menus since they weren't provided to us to make sure we were only charged the special price for Restaurant Week. Not once throughout our entire meal did our waiter come by to refill our drinks and we were never offered a bread basket that all of our surrounding tables were provided by other waiters. It took forever to get our food while parties that were seated after us were receiving their meals before us. We both ordered the pina colada cake dessert it took over twenty minutes for us to receive our cake slices. Food was okay, service was horrible. 2
Fantastic little Ma & Pa's place!  I've been here many times and have never been disappointed.  The meals are a great portion size, and not expensive.  The pizza's are probably the biggest hit and definitely better than franchised businesses like Dominoes or Pizza Pizza.I've taken out-of-town friends here too, and now when I see them again they always want to go back to MK's!Cheers! 5
Very tasty quick stop. Carne asada tacos were delicious. Portion sizes were huge, so go there hungry. 5
Still rest as ever.  Same great food st the new ( any only) location at Campbell and 16th Str.  In a sea of change this place never disappoints me since the 70's st Christown Mall.  Can't go wrong with the Pastrami with Swiss on Onion roll. 5
I got right in and it took me only 15 minutes for my oil change, on a Saturday.  It is a little overpriced in my opinion, but what oil specialty shop isn't. What bugs me about these places is they try to vet sell you on stuff even when you want just an oil change. Theses guys weren't too pushy. Super nice and friendly. Gave me $7 off for being a new customer! Don't forget to ask if your new 4
May 27, 2010What a TERRIBLE experience.  One of the boys that worked there sold me the wrong part - after a while, a pool guy sent me back to get the right part. I went back and was told the boy doesn't work there anymore and "what's in the past is in the past". Unbelievable. So, they slapped some old parts on my Hayward pool vac that the guy got out of his garage.  (I kid you not) And to rub salt in the wound, I had to pay $60 for more replacement parts.  As I was paying I asked "so no apology? - no discount?".  The guy said nope.So, those of you living in Morrison Ranch - you have been warned!(Looks like someone jumped back into Yelp with a GLOWING review to offset my real review.  Pretty obvious when it shows up the same morning.) 1
Nice patio and deck.  Ok wine.  I was hoping for a wine tasting experience but it wasn't offered.   Expensive food.  I had planned to get a glass of wine and asked for a taste.  It was a little more than a sip - I ended up ordering the glass and was still charged for the tasting.   Only $.50 but still annoying. 3
After spending a summer vacay in Brazil I came home hopelessly nostalgic for all things Brazilian: steak, caipirinhas, beans, farofa, telenovelas, and futbol.  Going to Rio 40 is a great way to get a Brazil fix.Vintage pics of Rio hang everywhere, while TVs are constantly broadcasting Brazilian soaps and soccer games.  It's not one of those design concept restos, so don't expect any of that either! They are experts in grilling their steak, it's not the best cut-- but how they manage to cook it so tenderly is beyond me.  Prices are not cheap but they really go all out for portions in the Brazilian way: tons of yucca or fries, beans, farofa (powdery stuff that adds texture and taste to beans), and meat.  They make a pretty good caipirinha too, if a little on the sweet side.  One time I went on a Friday and they had live Bossa Nova, which was wonderful.I highly reccommend! 4
First time in this place and the food was pretty good. Started with the chicken lollipops and mac and cheese. I must say the mac and cheese is on point. My 3 star rating is for the sub par cocktails. We tried a few drinks and have yet to be pleased. Dinner was good we had the Chipotle salmon salad which was surprisingly good. Not sure that we will go back but hope that they step up the drink menu. 3

Avoid at all costs if you are coming here for food. Coming from a mexican household, my dad was disgraced by what they call authentic Mexican cuisine. I got the steak tacos that were dry and bland, while my sister got a burrito that was cold dry and tasteless, you could tell that the meat they use is frozen. My dad got enchiladas that were a soggy depressing mess. Will not return unless they fix the food quality. 2
The whole process can be confusing for a first timer. Be sure to grab a ticket on your right as soon as you walk through the door. I missed this crucial step on my first visit, and spent 10 minutes standing in front of the sandwich meats like an idiot.Once you do get a ticket, it can be hard to communicate with the employees over the loudness of the ever-present crowd, so be prepared to shout.Those problems aside, the meat is of decent quality at an excellent price. Any place where I can get a whole chicken, a pound of ground beef and a pound of bacon for $10 and not get food poisoning gets my stamp of approval. 4
As soon as you walk in you know that you are in a different kind of coffee shop from all of the cookie cutter reclaimed wood edison bulb places. The smell of freshly roasted Ethiopian coffee beans fills the space. Walls are lined with specialty Ethiopian foods like spicy Berbere paste and Teff Injera is made fresh on select days. Delicious! You can have a typical machiatto/latte or go full on for the Coffee Ceremony. Croissants from Fantail bakery on Roncesvalles are also brought in daily. This is a great new spot for the Beaconsfield, Parkdale neighbourhood. 4
The doctors are great, amazing actually, but their staff and scheduling is horrible. You get disconnected all the time on the phone and when you do talk to someone, they say they will call back and don't. They don't get prescriptions correctly called in, may be pharmacy issue. You have an appointment they get you back to the room and you wait an average of thirty minutes to an hour. 2
Absolutely the worst experience of my life. Waited over 40 minutes for my food. Watched four people who ordered AFTER me get their food first. Was told "sorry dont know why yours is taking so long" Well its taking so long because you keep doing other orders before mine. Finally got food and fries were soggy, burger was horrible. If you like punishment i recommend this place. Otherwise next time you are at the "footd truck" friday AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COST. 1
After reading the previous reviews, I feel very fortunate because I rented a very nice apartment in Shadyside for one year and had no problems with the landlord. 3
Excellent food, lost a star because wait staff left us hanging without follow up after meal served. Nobody came around again.Had to hover over register to get, and pay tab.Ice tea is instant, not fresh. 4
I can only fairly apply this review to delivery I haven't eat in the restaurant in years but have noticed a lot of locations have closed down compared to back in its prime.  Two delivery orders in the past couple of months after not eating here for a good 3 years.  Both occasions I received cold and flavorless food.   Won't be wasting my money again.  Sorry and to add both times almost TWO HOURS for delivery. 1
I started to write a good review but I am glad I waited.  I went into the store to just pay my bill and of course they try to up sale and I took the bait.  However, 5 days later I still have no new phone and no response from my sales rep.  He was so attentive and as soon as he knew he made the sale.....screw me......was told I would have a phone today and I even called before going and they said they had it but when I got to the store I could not get not 1 person, not even the manager, to acknowledge me.  Granted I was on my lunch break, however, I was in that store for 30 mins. and on the way out I get from my sales rep, who is trying to make another sale, that he has my phone if I can just wait....I don't know about most people but I have a job and can't spend 6 more hours at that store.  I spent 6 hours at that store Monday and I should not have to continue to wait when all I want is my new phone.  Jeez, thanks Jermaine... 1
Horrible horrible service. Customers are asking questions and getting ignored so they can chat themselves. Went to sit down ALL tables are dirty. Just went to 5 different dirty tables. Had to clean our own to sit. We are getting to go hopefully not as dirty in kitchen as dining room 1
Definitely the absolute worst experience ever in a restaurant. We made reservations on 2/13. A day before Valentine's Day. We come to find out that the restaurant is have a preset menu. To begin, the server does not even put out what the pre-mixed menu is. We find out woth the table next to us that 2 of the few dishes on the testing menu is Abalone and Uni. 2 dishes my girlfriend and I don't eat. So before we order anything we nicely tell the server that we are not interested in dining and that we would pay the cancellation fee for the reservation.She comes back n demands the whole dinner price of $250 and says you have to pay even if you don't eat. On top of that the manager becomes argumentative! Bottom line he was so mad because they only had 3 sets of clients eating there. Please refer to all the negative reviews. They all had the same thing about the staff and management and basically trying to force you to pa for food that you can not eat. 1
This location is the best in Charlotte!  Of course the food is perfect, it's the staff that makes this location stellar.  Everyone spoke clearly and politely.  Everything was clean and neat.  And most amazingly, they keep the drive-thru moving smoothly.  If it was closer, I would go every week.Way to go Woodlawn Chick-fil-a! 5
I've given this place WAY too many chances.  I always think "this is the time they impress me".  My food has been meh to terrible.  The best part is the cookie dough and the ambiance.  In the summer, it is really fun to pull up on a boat, sit outside, or listen to a band.  I am only going back for drinks and music in the future.  The food has failed me too many times! 2
I went to Queen Margherita as a corporate outing and was very excited to try out this pizza spot (HUGE PIZZA LOVER). I was starving and still had quite a few people to wait for before ordering so I asked the male waiter if there were any appetizers available as there weren't any on the menu. Very rudely he snaps at me and says "let me tell you how this menu works so you understand!" .. I was taken back by this as to me it was a simple question. He then points to a chalk board BEHIND ME and explains the prix fix menu with the choice of appetizers on the chalk board.. BEHIND ME... As if I can see behind me or even know the chalk board is a menu. I then asked for water, and I had asked for a straw.. Apparently that is too much since he snarled at me "YOU NEED A STRAW FOR YOUR WATER?!" .. I thought yes, that's why I asked for one but simply replied "yes, please." By this time I was still very hungry and not impressed with this location but it was a corporate event and the option of leaving was not realistic. Aside from the unnecessary attitude the food was really good and I absolutely loved the Vegetarian Pizza. The Citrus Salad they offered at the time was incredible and the Caramel Funnel Cake as dessert.. opted for Ice cream with it (additional 3$) which was half a scoop.. no point in asking the staff for anything else since they were unpleasant. Nonetheless the food was really good and I recommend you order ice cream with your funnel cake.. wasn't as pleasant when the half scoop was gone.. When it came to the bill, our waitress started to complain to my manager that she's been waiting on tables all day and is too "crazy" and the system is "too much" for her to separate the bills when this was requested at reservations.. All in all I just wish I had a better experience at this location since I love pizza, the food was incredible and the environment was indeed cozy. Because of this horrible service I probably won't return nor send people I know there. Food good, service unacceptable. 2
So, yeah....I actually got food poisoning the last time I ate here.  It's probably my fault, having grabbed a late lunch, ordering soup and sandwich around 3:30pm, which I'm guessing meant the food stayed out quite a while after the lunch rush.  But, um, that'll do it for me!  So if you do go here, go when it's busy. I guess. 1
My mom is disabled & last night her garbage disposal & kitchen sink started filling w/ nasty water & her dryer broke at that time as well.She called at 6am today & left a message on the "emergency" line giving more than enough time for them to start contacting the people needed to fix the problems. She called 4 times w/ no response. Called again when the water started coming back up & shockingly,  the phone was finally answered. The woman got on her case for not using drain-o & wouldn't let her explain that it's not clogged but working in reverse. While that was going on, I was using a pot & lid to bail water out to throw outside because there was about an inch of space left before it would overflow. Had I not done that, it would have overflowed when it started filling up again not 5 minutes after I'd finished dumping. I have pics of it after the water went back down this morning & left the sink full of crap & a few videos showing how high up it got before I started bailing. The woman claimed to have tried reaching the owner of the condo because they can't do anything w/o approval & of course, they couldn't be reached.How something that can easily ruin the floors if not taken care of, isn't considered emergency enough to just fix w/o first getting the owners ok is beyond me. My mom was told to call back at 9:10 tomorrow morning & someone will answer. She did that several times today & no one ever picked up or returned her calls. I'll be stunned if someone actually picks up or returns her call.TO ANYONE LOOKING TO RENT & THE OWNER USES THIS PROPERTY MANAGEMENT COMPANY, DON'T DO IT. GO FIND ANY OTHER COMPANY THAT'S NOT THIS ONE!She's lucky because she only has a few more days in that dump. Her disability has escalated to the point that it's not safe for her to live alone anymore so she's moving in w/ me & my husband. I really hope this review will help anyone looking for a place to rent or just a reliable management company, because this is not one of them. 1
I really liked this place! You go in and the server is exceptionally nice. He suggested a dish he said would be spicy but it was slightly mild but very flavorful. They use Lemon Grass sticks as the "bone". This place actually rivals my favorite vegetarian restaurant in Portland. The price is right and the food is great! If you're considering not going...GO! Don't be scared off by the ghetto neighborhood and trashy strip mall. This place is a diamond in the rough. 5
I definitely recommend this place for parents to bring their kids. My daughter loved it!!! They have several activities for them to enjoy. Price wasn't bad, environment was clean. 5
Not sure what the hype is all about. Pizza was really nothing special. The tomato topping is just tiny little diced cubes of tomato, you can barely see them. Prices are very expensive. Service was poor- we were never once asked if we wanted a refill on our water. Took forever to get the cheque. The one positive I can say is that portion sizes here are very generous. Still, won't be returning, unfortunately. 2
Service was poor - waiter brought us a check that was double the amount ours should be and seemed totally confused when we pointed it outFood was only ok - nothing special enough to warrant the price - the nachos were cold and the tuna and salmon were hardly seasoned Worst part - valet returned our car to us after a rain shower during our meal. Got out and handed us the keys only for us to discover the front leather console and seats were drenched with water. Valet admitted to opening the sunroof and letting the water in. Managers response was "well what do you want me to do about it?"We won't go there again 1
The first day we were there, the down elevator from the garage walkway to the casino didn't work.  On the day we left, the up elevator from the casino to the garage walkway didn't work.  The room itself was very clean, but the decor was....  Let me just describe it.  The color theme of the room is white.  There is a vinyl headboard which covers the entire part of the wall behind the bed...what era is that??  There are 9 round fluorescent bulbs above the bed which generates white light...from the 80's??  The bathroom has a frosted sliding door that has no lock.  Another wall of the bathroom next to the shower is also frosted glass.  This glass wall is mounted to the wall (of course) with a gap between the wall and the glass, so you can actually look inside and see the entire toilet from that gap.  The sink is a small round bowl sink on top of the counter which has no place to place the soap.  There is a TV inside the bathroom though.  The drapes are controlled by switches next to the bed.  Overall, we didn't like the room because it was weird. 2
Cheapest prices in Vegas and they do a great job every time! My go to place for any electronic repairs. 5
I was a patient here during 2016. I never received a bill during the time I was receiving care but then received a bill for the entire year at a cost of over $1000. I spoke to the billing to inquire why this had occurred and apparently they had entered my insurance info incorrectly into their system. Never in the multiple visits when I was in office did someone ask me for my card to correct it. The billing department was not able or willing to make adjustments to the amount and I attempted to reach the office manager by leaving 2 messages, neither of these calls were returned. I have since changed providers. 1
We went here for lunch.  Other than the flan (which why I didn't give it one star) everything else was just bland.  Not worth the money. 3
I do like the Bellagio buffet. Its a toss up between Mandalay Bay and Bellagio. French food is what they say this place is about. Although I do not eat any kind of seafood I have to say they have the best selection of crab. They had the Alaskan King crab and the snow crab in buckets! This place is like crab heaven if you like crab. They have melted butter that you can scoop up to your hearts content and they have champagne in a glass now not in those cheapy plastic containers they do in other casinos. I like the salad selection and of course the choices in bread. I do not eat bread although I love bread because of the high carb content but enough about that. The bread had to be tried! It was delicious, and they had real butter on the side. Soft butter, not the frozen kind. The butter was at room temperature so it was easy to spread it on your bread. Yum! Alright downside to this place is you have to be ready to wait. It felt like a line at Disneyland to get into one of those rides! The line was long! We waited 75 minutes to be seated and we stayed for 2 hours inside. Prepare to wait folks. It is worth the wait but do not come here starving hungry because you will wait and you will end up grouchy and impatient by the time you get to the cashier. Eat enough for about an hour wait and then be ready to feast! Happy eating1 4
Best place ever for a pedicure. Ask for Holly she is so good. Very friendly place. Very clean. And best prices out there! 5
Came here for bubble tea. Big mistake. The lychee tea was particulate and tastes like sugar, no tea, no lychee. When I mentioned this to the owner he took a sip and said it was normal. Then proceeded to charge me for it. Would never go there again. 1
Wow, this place was so good!! My parents and I stopped by around 11:15am on a Sunday for brunch and even though we were told the wait might be 45min-1 hr, we were seated in 30min. We all really liked our orders. Our server was very friendly and even the other workers that ran out the food were very accommodating. My dad got the jambalaya omelet ($11) which comes with Cajun home fries and toast... he loved the unique combo of jambalaya in an omelet and raved about the Cajun home fries. My mom got the cinnamon apple walnut French toast ($11) which also comes with home fries. She also loved her meal. I got the carminator ($12) and enjoyed it very much however the mixed veggies in it were cut into very large chunks that overpowered the other ingredients if you bit into the wrap the wrong way. Overall we had an awesome experience and delightful meal and will definitely be back again!! 5
Definitely has the cheapest fruits and vegetables you will find in the valley. Only problem, is that most are within a day or two of rotting. I'll pass.  I find price matching Food City or Sunflower prices at Walmart is a much better deal overall. 2
Food is good, but does the sushi chef have to drink red wine while making the rolls?  Cleanliness and observation = 5 out of 10.  I left my purse by accident and they didn't see it.  I first called to make sure, and they said "no."  I then go to the restaurant physically, and they say they "still don't see it."  I'm driving back home and a I get a call from them.  They find it under the sushi bar.  Staff is nice, yet I still can't trust them. 3
Memo to self - there are a million hotels in Vegas so don't waste time staying at a hotel that lacks customer service. Been waiting in a check in line for 45 minutes - next time skip Mandalay and stay at Caesars or any of the other truly excellent hotels Vegas has to offer! 2
I love this place! Front desk is always friendly and never hesitate to start up a nice conversation. Rachel is an absolute saint! She's helped me so much by ridding bad make up in my collection, recommending better regimens and routines for my mild acne, and teaching me new things about my own skin! It's a bonus that they remember you and your concerns from the last visits! 5
As a pizza lover, Salvatore's Tomato Pies are unique and flavorful. We ordered the bacon and fig pizza which was the perfect melding of savory and sweet.  The menu offered a variety of choices, making it hard to decide what type of pie we wanted to order. The venue is pretty small, so it would be smart to order takeout on the busier nights or try and beat the dinner rush. Due to the small size of then venue it is a little loud when crowded. We are definitely planning to go back to try some of the other menu options! 5
I ate here for the first time last Friday, so 2 days ago.Pros: - Food.  Decent fare with some rather interesting items.  I enjoyed my beef tartare and my mussels.  However, Point (and Park) Brugge's mussels are leagues better.  Nothing wrong with these ones though.- Beer.  They have some nice choices in terms of quality, although it seemed like the number of choices was a bit limited.  Cons:- Service.  The first person I encountered was an incredibly rude hostess.  If you're the girl with the very curly, red hair and you're reading this, get out of the service industry.  It obviously doesn't suit you.  She ignored me, then was rude to me, then told me it'd be a 45 minute wait, then ignored me again.  On the other hand, the other hostess was congenial.  She was able to seat us right away.  Our server was also nice as was our food runner.  Nevertheless, the hostess is the first person you see and helps set the tone for the whole experience and my started off poorly.- Food.  While my food was fine, my friends' was not.  They each got a sandwich that consisted of a breaded pork cutlet, ham, bacon and topped with a fried egg.  The problem is that the cook put a copious amount of salt on top of the egg.  Let's go over this.  You have a sandwich with ham and bacon and you're dousing it in salt?  No.- Decor/theme.  I know almost everyone on here enjoys the look/feel of this place, but I feel it is just all over the place.  In some ways they make it feel like a western style saloon.  But then they have the servers in mechanics' uniforms.  Additionally, mason jars are being done to death.  Verdict:A decent enough place, and I wouldn't mind going back, but I'd rather go to other new places or ones I consider better before returning.  Not a bad choice if you need a place to eat before/after going to one of the theaters. 3
It took a couple tries for me to warm up to Carmon's. Spouse got it quicker, and finally convinced me to go back. I did and have returned again and again. It has become one of the go-to places for Spouse and I.What was different? For starters, I came for dinner. That's important, I think. Carmon's has a distinct French bistro vibe that really shines at dinner but doesn't at lunch. Lunches can feel...odd. A little precious. A little cold. But at dinner, with a stemless glass of delicious red wine, lower lights, darkness outside, the preciousness becomes cozy while the cool allows for privacy that spurs conversation (it helps immeasurably that this is a restaurant where you can actually hear and don't need to shout to be heard across the table.) Second, I branched out from crepes. The fish specials here are uniformly good - never dry, never over-fussed, never over-salted or otherwise over-seasoned. They're fresh, simple, perfectly cooked - extremely hard to do for most restaurants. The fish is usually served over pommes frites that, again, are well-executed: simple, straight, delicious.  We've since had other specials here, too -all of which are straight outta bistro. And good. I haven't left crepes behind, mind. The Nutella crepe is a wonder of richness that must be ordered at least once (and then good luck not ordering it again.) It can't be entirely explained by either the crepe or the nutella. It is more than the sum of its parts - which, I guess, applies to Carmon's itself. I still don't go here for lunch, tho. 4
Check the VIN number on AutoCheck or Carfax BEFORE buying. The cars that I was interested in buying have body and frame damaged. 1
Tehran is a wonderful establishment.I've been an infrequent visitor for the past 10 years. I always wish I'd go more often.The menu doesn't have too many options. But the choices you have are so flavourful that you won't feel lacking.The plate sizes are quite large, though I have noticed that portions decreased a bit recently, and prices went up. Worry not, you'll still be stuffed and not spend too much.Everyone should give Tehran a try. The food is delicious and the service is quick. And shame on someone rating a restaurant they've never been to and making a judgment based on hearsay. 5
I got an email for a free mascara on my birthday.  I made a trip to the store to pick up the item but they were out of stock.  I was told they were getting a large shipment in a couple of weeks but it's been a month and a half and they don't have it, don't know when it will come in, and won't give a substitute.  I've run into this problem with rain checks too.  I've been waiting over a year for a rain-check product.  I might have to switch over to Sephora as Ulta is not a well-run company in my opinion. 2
Not happy with the service and value of laser hair removal at Ideal Image. Not worth the money. Save your money. I regret getting hair removal. The advertised sales (50%) is still incredibly expensive compared to other places. I could have gone on 4 vacations with the price I paid for stupid hair removal. So mad at myself. Also the nurses and the assistant staff have poor communication with each other like the other review states. I scheduled an appointment 6 weeks after sun exposure from my honeymoon. I called the office and asked when can I come in after sun exposure and they said 4 weeks so I thought 6 weeks would be plenty. Well I came in and the nurse could not treat me that day. She said it is really 8 weeks out and said don't listen to the assistants at the front desk and to ask for a nurse on the phone next time. Wasted a part of my day on my day off work .  Regret doing this and wish I could stop. I am 2/9 treatments in. Wish I could just stop and have my money back for the remaining 7 treatments. 1
Worse service ever. Never going back. Was told pizza would be ready in 35 minutes for pickup. Was actually 1 hour. The staff rolled their eyes when I inquired how much longer, and seemed to take their time in spite of my inquiry. The pizza was quite bland. I had to add salt to the pizza, which is weird because I've never had to do that with pizza. Never going back. 1
How fortunate to have such a great indian cusine in monroville and owner is quite gracious.Food is outstanding 4
I have been to the Strip location of the Pittsburgh Popcorn Company and I would give that location 4.5 stars. Today I ran into the Oakland location which I hadn't visited prior. When I entered the location was a mess. It looked like behind the counter had not been cleaned in a while. I am assuming that this was because of the business of the location, but the Strip location appears to be much cleaner. I purchased two bags, one of the chocolate caramel and the rice krispy. Both were good. My only concern about the product itself was my bag of rice krispy was had other types of popcorn in it. When I ordered rice krispy, I wasn't hoping to get cheddar or dill pickle. I would suggest that if only is coming to Pittsburgh Popcorn Company for the first time, go to the Strip location. I 2
I used to be regular at the Burrito Boyz franchises in Mississauga and raved about the epic meal that followed a visit.The particular visit at this location left me disappointed. Last Tuesday I ordered a small chicken and shrimp burrito with all the fixings. I was excited to bite into the hot cheesy goodness. Instead the burrito was room temperature at best and the chicken lacked flavour and was missing the crispy bits that usually followed cooking on the flat top.After struggling through a few bites, I asked to have the food reheated. Instead the supervisor was nice enough to have the burrito remade for me, and offered a free drink while I waited. The remade burrito was definitely hot (temperature wise) but overall still lacked flavour. Will I return? Probably not.Two stars is for the service alone. 2
Three stars! One star each for: SERVICE, FOOD and "WILL I COME BACK?"No stars for AMBIENCE and PRICE.Service was fast, and there was no line at about 11pm. The walk there was exciting. A couple of cops was in the midst of arresting a very drunk, very high, half naked man. So, yup, hot dogs to-go, please.The hot dogs were good, crisp skin and juicy dogs. I ordered a naked dog ($4.79)  and a naked dog with two extra toppings (fried mushrooms + guacamole) for $8.07. The naked dog for almost $5 is too expensive!I will come back. The walk there is exciting but the fancy dogs are worth it. 3
Not cool. I have been here several times now and decided to take my daughter here for breakfast. Apparently they don't allow kids in here before 4pm because of some health code?? That's a little concerning... So I guess the only time to bring my 4 year old here is later in the day when it's full of drunks and smokers? I've only came here for drinks because the one time I ordered food, my burger didn't taste right and made me sick. Service has never impressed me, and I will Not be coming back!! 1
We found the food to be just ok. We had a pizza and a risotto. Frankly, I have had far better italian food. They seem to be charging for the ambience. I am a big fan of pizza and their pizza was mediocre. A few other italian places down the road in davisville are far better. I dont recommend this place for a 2nd visit. 2
I have been going to Bark Place for years and seeing Leslie .  I wouldn't go anywhere else .  My little Pomeranian is not the most cooperative and Leslie makes her look amazing everytime .  Also great customer service as well !! 5
I got the Rawitch and it was surprisingly good. Ive never had vegan food so i really didnt know what to expect. The onion bread that sandwiches the Rawitch tastes AMAZING but the cole slaw on the side was a little underwhelming with little to no taste. The service was also great, the person who served us had a very sweet personality :) 4
I want to write the review for the entire city of Montreal but unfortunately I can't do that. Instead I'll just have to write about each location I went to. Let's just say this is one of my favorites! The sphere is beautiful and I really loved learning about the environment and biodiversity.  The little park across from it is peaceful and beautiful too. Montreal is the best city i've ever been to!!!! 5
Food is great; service is not-so-great.  The food came out quickly; however, the wait staff was not the nicest. 3
Nacho Daddy...I've tried you again and again and you have not let me down.In my initial review I was sad for the poor starving children and the wastefulness of the portions you serve.  I've now learned "how" to order off of your menu so I don't leave feeling less like a human because of my gluttonous ways.  Your bloody Mary's are amazing, but the Medium gave me enough kick without adding the habanero.  Half medium half mild suits my tastes (even though I always thought I could handle a kick).We love everything your restaurant has to offer for a quick bite after a long day wrangling cats (I mean kids), from the brunch menu (huevos nachos LOVE...but share), fajitas, mahi mahi tacos, ceviche, chips and salsa...oh and yes my margarita is always amazing. 4
Went to Dr. Rochlin for a consult on a Tummy tuck. She said I "had to let her do it " and I would look fabulous. 2 mo later scheduled the appt and very excited.  Post surgery,   I have an incision scar that looks like an emergency c-section.  Then the necrosis started and she had to cut away part of my stomach to the point where it looked like I had a cannonball thru my stomach and had to pack it with gauze and saline.  Round 2 she promised to fix this and wanted to share a patients name so I am reassured. I let her do this to me again and result horrible scar where I am mortified to look at myself.  DO NOT GO TO HER , she is a BUTCHER.     UPDATE :                                                                                                                                       Went to see her to review status of my treatment and request my files.  She was rude and condensending in her conversation.  She seemed like she definatley had something to hide.  I am a FORMER patient of Dr. Rochlins, contrary to her comment.                                                                                                                                        She may be good at BOTOX and Juvederm injections, but stay away from the scapel. 1
I live within walking distance of Park Rd Shopping Ctr... and love the shops and restaurant options.  I want to enjoy Charlotte Cafe but seem to always catch it on an "off" day.  I'm now thinking it's just normal procedure for them. In general it's over-priced for what you get.  I was in with my folks this past Friday for a 9:30am breakfast.  The service was painfully slow.  She told us immediately upon seating they hadn't planned to be "busy today".  Really... on black Friday... at Park Rd Shopping Ctr.?? You didn't expect to be busy??  To be honest I don't blame her.  I think it's just poor management and she was left to deal with the consequences as were the rest of us patrons. When our breakfast finally arrived it wasn't room temperature.  It was cold.  Nothing says good morning like cold eggs. grits, and bacon.    And to top it off... when my dad when to pay the bill it took him 10 minutes and 3 three employees to ring him up.  He was the only person in line at the time and they had no idea what to do.  Quite honestly... I do not understand how they stay in business. 2
Very odd location for a dollar store, but convienent none the less. I always pop in here when I want to grab a quick snack after coming out of the subway. Store is a lot larger than it looks from the outside. Some of the expiration dates are the products are a little questionable, but overall good place if you're looking to grab something quick and be on your way. The store setup is like a disorganized dollarama. 3
The sushi is good. I crave the shrimp cracker at least once a week and I've never even heard of it before coming here. The service from the women always sucks but the guy who works there is on top of it. I'm in the service industry and if the sushi wasn't so good, I wouldn't come back. 3
Arrived to check in for a reserved room at 9:00 pm in September. AC was not on in the room so the room temperature was 89 degrees. Called front desk to get bedding for the sleeper sofa for our kids and were told that we would have to come down to the front desk to get the bedding. Really inconvenient when you check in to a room expecting it ready so you can put children to bed. 2
Stopped here for dinner when passing through the area. Very good, Authentic, home-made Italian Food by local owners. Prices were reasonable, too.... 4
A very interesting little diner. Not much to see from outside, but a very nice busy atmosphere. The service was very good (no complaints) and the food was simple but tasty. Their "homemade" chilli sauce wasa particularly nice (comes with the omelettes). 4
The pros: they have a lot of technicians on-site so I rarely have to wait for an appointment. The shellac colour selection is good. And the clientele are all young, urban professionals so you feel OK about going here. They do an ok to good job on your manicure - it's not perfect, but it's way better than I can do at home and it's quick (approx. 25 minutes) so you're in/out. Bonus points for the shoulder massage with shellac. Hey, sometimes you might even want to splurge an extra $10 for an additional 10 minute massage. The cons: you get what you pay for. It's by no means luxurious. They churn you in and out. Sometimes there's a lot of yelling, and if you're coming off a stressful day, it can grate on your nerves. Overall, they do a good enough job that I find myself coming back frequently because it's near my office. For the price you pay, it'll do. 4
Sat for 20 minutes and never got served. Crabby Don's should be Crappy Don's. Left for Mexican restaurant across the street. 1
This is the absolute worst excuse for a repair company as I have ever seen. They come and tell YOU they will get the part. I asked the office idiot what the  total price would be parts labor and taxes. She quoted a price then when the repair was finished the price went up $20.00. The head moron mechanic tried to say it was because  they did not know what the taxes would be the next day. Now come on taxes don't change over night they were are and will be the same for the foreseeable future.  Then when i got yo my offgrid location the repairs failed and i called in twice but they never had the professional courtesy to return my call. Great customer service. NOT!!! In short these jackasses are morons and crooks. STEER CLEAR OF THEM.  Don't waste your money with their company 1
only gets 1 star, because I can't given them 0.  ordered a chicken salad to go and to be nice, it sucked.  awful.  lack of chicken and brown, mushy lettuce.  better off getting a salad from some fast food joint.  I see why this place is hurting for business. 1
Why oh why can these people not make a latte that takes 6 layers of skin off your tongue? Seriously people, hot drinks should be just that. HOT. Not lukewarm by the time I've made the 5 minute dash through the Path back to work! 2
One word.....AMAZING!!!! This place far exceeded expectations.  To start, the waitstaff was incredible, courteous, attentive, and knowledgable of the5 menu and wine list.  For 2 of us,  We started with the 60g cheese course, paired with chenin blanc.  All locally sourced cheeses and enough that we could each have a satiable portion and truly  enjoy each cheese.  They offer wines by the half and whole glaseses, so you can easily pair wines with your course selection. From there, we moved on to the braised leeks with truffle and duck confit with arugula.  Both were out of this world, wonderfully balanced, and again perfectly portioned. The waitress brought us multiple samples of wines to taste to find the perfect pairing.  For entrees, we had the half lobster,and the veal with manchego. Both beautifully cooked and presented.   This was one of the best restaurants, meals,culinary experience ive had in a long time. I would highly recommend to anyone eating out in montreal. 5
Exposed brick, checkBad local art, checkRock and roll tunes, checkSpeedy wifi, checkDelicious Mistos, checkCool crowd reading magazines and working away on macbooks, checkPLENTY of outlets, sweet!This place seems pretty swell. Exactly what you'd want for a cafe work sesh or a man date. 5
It was my first time here and left very happy with my nails.  Alexis did exactly what I wanted, I'm definitely coming back to her, she's super friendly and understanding. She took her time, and listen to the concerns I've had in the past with different people.  I recommend coming to her, she knows what she's doing... Thanks again 5
I just went to the Friday night gourmet buffet last week, and that's the 3rd time for me and my husband to be in a bellagio buffet. We had very great food the last 2 times we visited the buffet, so we went again this time we visited vegas. However, we felt disappointed this time as we think the food quality overall was not as good this time.The desserts are all great, but the meat and entree were just ok. And we are meat eaters......so that's why we were disappointed. They did have more variety and meat choices for the gourmet buffet (Fri and Sat only), they had kobe sirloin, grilled quail, prime rib, beef wellington, lamb rack, ostrich, duck breast, etc for the gourmet buffet. However, they are all too bloody raw except beef wellington and ostrich. In the past, usually there would be options to choose from medium rare to medium well, but this time everything is medium rare except beef wellington and ostrich. The chef who was serving lamb rack was nice enough to grill the lamb to the degree that the customer requested, however, the one who served kobe sirloin and prime rib was probably too busy to cater people's requests, so everyone got a piece of raw meat. I passed by many people's table and noticed that they gave up on the raw meat after the rim (usually is more cooked) has been eaten. It's just a big waste of food when they serve meat that is too raw. So in a sense, I like Wynn better for the meat, but the dessert at bellagio buffet is un-beatable. I think if someone is going for a really nice piece of meat, then Wynn is better. If you are all for the desserts, then bellagio is the place to go. But I do feel disappointed at the bellagio buffet when comparing with our past bellagio buffet experience. I've heard that some restaurants quality goes down due to recession....I don't know if bellagio buffet would be one of them....... well....it makes me to think twice whether I wanted to revisit bellagio buffet for future. 3
I would love a window seat during a thunder storm!! I wasn't sure if validated parking was available for lunch... The website only mentioned dinner and weekends.The prices were decent! A bottle of wine will run you up quite a bit. I made reservations online last week but wouldn't get a window table since it's made a month in advance. We started with the crab and tuna salad and the raw oysters. Both were great! Our entrees were probably less than ideal, my lobster clubhouse fell apart. The land and sea was a very small portion and was unfavoured. I would probably want to see the dinner menu myself. I would be unwilling to go during summer or winterlicious as you don't get to see the classic menu.For dessert, I shared the chocolate torte and it was delicious!! I would definitely get that again :)Hope this helps!-jT 3
I noticed that the shopping carts seem to be smaller than other Fry's? Not a single person that worked there acknowledged me other than the check out lady who seemed very unhappy with her job. Won't be coming here again unless it's an emergency. 2
Prepare to wait. They blame everything on other companies, they don't keep in contact to keep the customer updated. Waited twice as long as a friend who went solar with another company! 2
Good luck trying to get in contact with someone here. It's next to impossible. The phone only goes to a voice message, and I'm pretty sure any emails you send go straight to the trash folder. 1
Walked in- insta impressed by service/ambiance.Looked at the menu chalkboard, first the drinks (ok $9 for a glass of sangria what is this world coming to?? Not to mention $6 for a Pilsner which is hilarious since it is on par w/ PBR cheapness but I guess that's what's to be expected at such a ~hipster~ and ~high scale~ place)Aaanyways food time: vegan-wise, food was measly. Literally only vegan thing on the menu was the guac and chips. There was a cauliflower taco but after asking the waitress she confirmed that the "sauce wasn't vegan". Well fuck. There went my hope for taco deliciousness. The guac was amazin though, cilantro city! My friend esentially got every taco on the menu and chowed down, she was lovin it. So yeah. Left a little bit depressed from the lack of food I could eat but I can totally see the appeal of the holy grail of Toronto tacos (apparently). Ehh, I'll just stick to Sneaks or Rancho. 3
The service here sucks.  We waited over 24 mins for food.  Our waitress was oblivious. Once she got our order we didn't see her again.  I finally had to flag someone down.  Then once we got our food she asked how everything was and then she was gone again.  I had to flag her down for boxes and check.  The food here is not worth the horrible service. 1
They offer 20% discount via text yet when you attempt to get it they've I it after tax has been added..... that is not right. It should be before tax and the lady at the window says her boss says it has to be after tax because he has to pay tax on the whole bill so it needs to be paid by the customer. How is that good customer service or a discount? Yes it covers the sales tax plus 11 percent... but don't lie and say 20 percent. Food is amazing though and that is why I come back. 3
Not sure what management is doing but it seems like this location is always understaffed and they are super slow with orders. 3
Great smoothie but super slow service. Seems they don't have good organization of who doing what? The cashier went back to the counter to make smoothie but no one attends the new customers, who ended up leaving. I wait probably 10 mins for a smoothie. 3
Me and my lady used to come to this spot at least once a month for the amazing sushi. This all changed as of last night as we are currently looking for a new spot. Owner and sushi chef were a little hmmmm let's just say messed up from a tiny bit to much drinking, along comes customer to my left ( we sat in the middle of two different groups at the sushi bar ) drinking and having shots with the head chef, some conversation about where they are from is exchanged and then escalates to the head chef cussing him out taking his shirt off to show his tattoos, which ended up in customer to my right coming out of no where and playing referee for customer and Mr Head Chef who has been in jail and is from LA. Now I'm from LA myself and don't need to hear your story about what part your from or what gang you rolled with when you were younger, years in jail etc.  I don't normally go out of my way to write many reviews and I loved this place for years but if you are thinking about going here I would say try somewhere else ! 1
I just can't figure out how this place got so many stars by so many people. My sis and I picked up our friend at the airport on friday night and we were hungry. So we looked up a good restaurant on trusty Yelp to help us decide. We fell on this place which got great reviews and seemed like it would be fun and delicious. We found the place pretty quickly and stepped right in. We were quickly seated, but service was slow throughout. After about 10-15 min we finally got our drinks...OUR DRINKS. My companions got drinks and they tasted bitter. Not worth $10 in my opinion.The food itself was a disappointment. We ordered their Korean short ribs, ginger mint duck salad, beach mushrooms, and chicken lollipops.My issue is not the size of the dishes, we all knew what tapas are so we were already expecting small portions, but with those small portions and the amount of money we were paying we expected good food. Instead we got pretentious food with unbalanced flavor. If you're going to dress up my food, make sure it tastes as good as it looks.1. The Korean short ribs were okay except for the fact that it was drowned in a very sweet sauce. If the ribs were DRIZZLED with the sauce I think it would have been very successful.2. Ginger mint duck salad, I thought the duck was well cooked, but the sauce was overpowering and bitter.3. Chicken lollipops were way too salty. I had to drink water with every bite of the chicken.4. The only saving grace was the beach mushrooms. It was balanced and just plain delicious. It was a little awkward to eat, but I could easily get over that since the dish was such a treat. If all of my other dishes were as good as this one, I'd be raving about this place.     So after all of this, we didn't even want dessert, which is a shame because I love dessert and it was my birthday. Poor excuse of a meal for the price. I expected more. Not sure if it's the prettiness of the place that people fall in love with, but for me, the food was not up to par. 2
It's not a waste of time - but I expected more.  There are a lot of Belgian beers, some craft beers and not much else. I've never tried the food so I can't comment on that. 3
Have driven by this place several times and finally decided to give it a try.  Got a hamburger with cheese, clive style toppings with jalapenos and onion.  Quite honestly I've had better burgers, was expecting a juicy burger but the patty was thin and well blah.  Did order fries though and must admit it was the best part of the meal.  Also ordered a chocolate milkshake, it was good but not good enough to be $5 bucks. 2
Should be rated zero order the shrimp meal got a few pieces of shrimp and a hair with my order wtf .... wouldn't go there again .... plus the girl working the drive through had a little attitude ..... 1
Service is good, staff is friendly and knowledgeable. Beer and cocktails are good as well. Food...not so much.  My boyfriend and I shared the Jalapeno Pretzel appetizer which was pretty good, but our entrees.... disappointing.  I got the Baja chicken sandwich and he got the bison burger.   both were super dry. i could not even finish half of mine. He had to drench his in ketchup to be able to get the bison burger down. If i were to go back, it certainly would not be to eat. 2
Great old fashioned food except for the OWNER'S audacity to request a tip for his service.. Completely taken aback Makes you NOT want to return and kinda turns you off 3
Went for the first time this weekend.  Amazing looking women.  The cocktails were good too. Great looking female bartenders. A must do if you're single and attractive. 5
Meat portions were a tad on the small side but all and all we enjoyed it. Staff was super friendly and the place was clean! We are definately putting this on the list for dinner outtings. And theres options for kids! Cant wait to come back and try something else. 4
This place is great if you don't like acidic coffee. Personally, I can't take caffeine very well because it literally hurts my stomach when I drink too acidic coffee, so Nespresso is a good fit for me except for the large price tag... But I tend to go once in awhile to let myself indulge. The classic espresso that my hubby always gets is superb. I say this because the crema in the espresso is phenomenal. Their indulgent coffee creations are great even though it's really expensive - the cup is actually really big, almost the size of a grande/venti at Starbucks. You can pair your indulgent creation with 2 macarons/pastry for an extra $2, adding up to ~$10. The foam on top of your indulgent creation/cappuccino is really like no other at Nespresso. It's legit foam; it holds its shape very well but it's still very delicate at the same time. If you're on the fence about buying a Nespresso machine, give their boutique cafes a shot before making your purchase! You won't regret it. 4
My mom and I wanted to do a girls pamper and chose this spa as it had a special groupon. They were unprepared for two people even though we'd made an appointment, and the cd skipped during our 'relaxing' time . The facial was ok, the wraps good, and the massage average. I'd choose another spa if you're really looking for elite treatment, although for basic upkeep, this one is worth a shot. 3
I wish i could tell you all about the food but there was problem. My friend and went there for dinner we were seated quickly unfortunately it was in middle of the empty dinning room so we asked to be moved to the side which we were. Upon sitting down we were told we could only have one of the very small table tops there were two together so the hostess told us the manager said we couldn't use two table tops in the empty restaurant. So we got up and left. With the manager chasing us blaming the hostess for the the ridiculous action. Needles to say we will never return. 1
My wife just brought home a fish taco, pretty good.  Not amazing but one of the best I have had in a while.  I don't want to set expectations too high but worth a try! 4
Why would an obviously great diagnostic internist with a fantastic radio show and a terrific bedside manner and a caring attitude not be able to find the time to answer a written correspondence from a patient with a problem? 3
Pretty good. We thought to go check out a place up the block, because it had great yelp reviews. Apparently, so did 500 other people, but they thought quicker. The line was down the block and around the corner, so we walked around and saw an empty table here. Glad we did.I had a salad and juice, boy friend had the special - huevos rancheros with chili verde. I was happy, he liked his but said it wasn't worth what I paid for it. Saw a ton of people with french toast that looked unbelievably good, and the breakfast sandwich croissants looked great too. I won't drive across town for it, but any time I'm in the strip won't mind stopping in for a bite. 3
Came here with 3 friends on a Saturday night. Slight wait for a table.. maybe 15 minutes, the place was busy, but that was expected. They have a very very very extensive drink list, which includes beer, cider, meade and other tasty beverages! A definite go just for the drinks alone! We all ordered food, I had the burger on special - a twist on a Thanksgiving sandwich... that slightly reminded me of Melt's turkey bomb sandwich. Came with sweet potato fries - which were good! While the food might not blow you out of the water, having a good bar with a good selection of choices and decent food is nice. Will be back! 4
I always make sure to stop at the good egg whenever I'm in Phoenix it's my favorite place to eat breakfast or lunch they have the best biscuits and gravy in town. The place is always clean and the staff is very helpful and friendly keep it up good egg! 5
This place is amazing, the food was the best quick serve Mediterranean I have had. Cant wait to go back! :) 5
Food was OK. They prepare food based on Vegan style. Food was not very authentic as i had hoped it to be. It's a good place if you are looking for simple indian food and not for spicy, masala food. 3
Decent pizza for the price.  Probably great for kids party to feed a lot of people without spending a lot of money. 4
The quintessential French bistro in Montreal. Still buzzing and still serving up classic french bistro fare.   As all the new restaurants in Montreal delight in serving ever more exotic dishes, L'Express stands out as a bastion of what a classic dinner in Montreal can be. 5
Please do use this practice. I've had such a terrible experience. I would not wish on my worst enemy. 1
If you want to ruin your day, stop in at P & W BMW, if you want to ruin your year, buy a car there. They are great at putting on a good show of being overly courteous but when it comes down to standing behind their product and following through with service, they scurry away like mice. I continue to be completely unhappy with the car and especially with the dealership. 1
I stayed at the Aria for three days and it was like Heaven.  The hotel is gigantic and beautiful to look at- lots of massive, dramatic art, giant chunks of granite and walls of glass, etc.  In one restaurant the dividers between the banquettes were made of cross sections of huge wasps' nests.  Difficult to describe, but so cool in person.  I was there for work, so I didn't have to pay for anything (except gambling, where it took me about 20 minutes to wipe out my checking account), which is extremely fortunate, since breakfast for three came to about $125 one morning.  The linens were unbelievable, and the bed was amazing.  I spent most of the last day by the pool, where the crowd was so friendly- everyone was so glad to be at such a fabulous place!  Everyone that worked there was ultra hot and genuinely warm and friendly.  I highly recommend the Aria for anybody with a lot of money to spend on unbridled luxury for a few days.  There's really no reason to leave the hotel once you get there- it has everything, and a LOT of it.  One of our waiters told us that the hotel has over 10,000 employees.   My one complaint is the horrible cell service, but then that's probably my own fault (AT&T). 4
I get it... It's a cool concept and hipster-ish place that is trending. The food is good if you are able to stomach an entire sandwich I think you should get an award, the sandwiches are huge! People rave about this place, I just does not send me over the top. I am not into huge portioned meals.I give it a 3 because it works for everyone. They really do need to consider a bigger location though, apparaently the wait is always long at this place. Wish I had more details to share.. try it out is all I have to say, be prepared to wait for a table! 3
A bunch of us were in town all at the same time and we decided to grab a quick bite and Shibuya was able to fit us in on short notice AND they had a pretty decent tasting menu to boot!  We were very pleased with everything, the kitchen substituted soy wrappers for seaweed without a peep OR a charge(!) and the wait staff was very helpful and friendly.  Definitely loved the kampachi sashimi but the beef on the winter tasting menu was not very tender and also cold when it came out but we still enjoyed everything else. 3
The experience of eating out of a plastic bag with plastic gloves is just too weird and unappetizing. Its also messy.  Ordered the clams.  Ok portion for the money but the Captain's Boils sauce was way too garlicky.  Would go again and try other offerings if they served food on proper dishware. 2
There are a few vegan options here, and they are labelled clearly on the chalkboard near the cashier (though they don't always write everything they're serving on the board). Service was friendly and quick, I ordered the sweet potato and rapini pie, which wasn't as tasty as the dish my friends ordered (the cauliflower and soy protein pie). They have a vegan cheesecake that is phenomenal.It's a cozy little space, and there were a few other folks there when we walked in on Saturday, but it didn't feel too crowded.I'll have to try their coffee next time. 3
STAY AWAY  I am only giving this place one star because it is not possible to give zero. This was the last restaurant I ate at during our vacation and had to be the worst one we went to in 5 days in Vegas.The food was substandard. We had a large group. The server acted like he was doing us a favor by taking our orders. 40 minutes to get a check and then it wasn't divided like we asked before he started taking any orders. My soda was empty more than it was full. 3 times in a row the server told me he was bringing me a drink and showed back up at the table with out it. Just to be clear the restaurant was less than 1/2 full so they were not busy the staff just didn't seem to care. 1
If I could I would give this gym a zero. Stay far away from this place. Apollo sued me for 2,985.00 dollars because I could pay the last 3 months of my contract. I reach to them and ask them if I could pay the late fee instead but they say no that i had to pay the 2,985 for fees. I asked what fees and they didn't say anything and sued me. Be careful and read the fine prints on the contract or you will be scam. 1
RA sushi is wonderful. Every waiter/waitress that has ever served me at RA (any of their phoenix metro locations) has been wonderful. They're fantastic at making recommendations on sushi that you might like based on your taste and the drinks there are also great. I have never had anything there that I didn't enjoy. It has a hip and fun atmosphere and it's a great place to go with a group of friends so you can get different flavors of sushi and just split them. The only thing that bothers me sometimes when I'm there is the volume of the music. It could be a little bit quieter just so conversation is easier, but other than that I have no complaints. 4
i have been here a few times. it is not the prettiest laundromat, but there were a lot of open machines, the inside is clean, and the people that work there are very nice and helpful.  And super capacity washers, great for cleaning beddings. Oh and automatic doors! they are also a dry cleaners. i have noticed they have a drive up window for your dry cleaning. 3
This place, which lacks a name on the outside is actually amazing. I stumbled upon it on a rain soaked Sunday while disappointed by the line at A&Us. I stumbled in to this place and was greeted by delicious smelling coffee and a very simple menu. With only 3 items it was surprisingly hard to pick which sounded the best. I ended up settling on the Croque Madame while my partner got the bacon pancakes.Now... Let me tell you something about these brunch plates. They were simply put together but tasted so fresh and so delicious! The downside: the place is small so get there early (I feel like this place will get very popular, soon) and the service was a bit slow. So grab a coffee, take a seat and make sure you have some good company! 4
I can't actually comment on the food. I would rate the service as lousy. I waited 20+ minutes for a burrito i had already paid for. I got tired of waiting so I left. There were only two people in front of me and they each ordered a burrito to go. They left in 5-8 minutes so I thought mine should be read pretty soon. I waited another 10-12 minutes. Food never materialized so I split. Maybe I'm  just used to Chipotle 1
The only reason I am giving this two stars is because my daughter had fun.  I would never visit this location again. First my pizza came out looking like it was drop on he floor. It was crowd with birthday parties but Chuck never came out on the 30 while I was there from 5pm until 9:30pm. The games were broken or not working. When someone did come to reprogram the games . He didn't put a sign on the games to let people know the game was broken. Let's talk about the unprofessional young staff. While I stood with my five year old daughter. Two stuff member were touching each other. Really. Their uniform was dirty. One girl had holes in her shirt. At the end it was time to check out, so we about 500 tickets. We stood there for 10 min until she count our tickets and they didn't have any toys my daughter wanted. It's a Saturday night but I will be calling corporate come Monday Mornings. 2
It's a nice little sushi place. Actually it's not so small but just medium sized. The quality of their food is good and the overall value is good. Not too expensive or cheap. They have some good deals for $1 sushi. Service is a bit slow sometimes and you could get frustrated if there is a phone call coming when they are trying to use your card for payment. Same telephone line does everything. I have seen other better places to eat sushi nearby however I would still recommend this one for an emergency. 3
Price - 3 stars. This is a steakhouse. So the price is what you would expectService - 4 stars. Absolutely great service!! Our drinks was always refilled promptly and the food came out fast. However, I never knew my server name!! He never said his name!! So when I needed extra sauce....I would actually like to call a person by their name.Food - 2 stars. I ordered the Tomahawk steak, I ordered it medium but came out med rare. Also the French onion soup was VERY salty, and the halibut was bland.Atmosphere - 3 stars. The view was beautiful; however, the place was busy and it was small, the server and customers was constantly "bumping" into my guest seat, which made her uncomfortable. 3
Took a large group here last night and everyone enjoyed the pizzas.  Or was it the super friendly waitress shelly. Just about the friendliest I've ver seen. Dessert were amazing as well starting with the tiramisu. 5
It seems we got taken in by similar things as other yelpers.  The idea sounded really good and the menu is very inventive.  While the salt air margarita was tasty, the twenty vegetable fried rice was average, and for average way over priced.  I don't know which food network chef thought this was the best thing he ever ate, but that chef should get out more.Noodle dish was weak(ocean's nest) but the pork buns were tastey.  And at the end all was extremely over priced. 2
I must be missing something.  People on here giving this 4 and 5 stars?  I have been eating Mushy Peas my whole life and these are the first I couldn't get down. There is a peculiar taste to them that I can't identify. The chips have a funny taste also.  The pies are average at best.  Service is shaky at best.  I have tried this place at least three times and I am a regular next door at Pipers so it's not like I haven't given it a chance..The people giving this multiple stars have never been to England apparently. Although one night I heard some people talking about Downton Abbey......maybe that counts. 1
Friendly staff. I wish they had more chicken and vegetarian options. Everything I've had there has been really good. I think it's really cute inside the restaurant too. I wish they had outdoor seating too (maybe they do and I didn't know). 4
I don't know what was going on there yesterday, but...what restaurant doesn't have available clean silverware at 7:00 p.m.??!!  How do you bring the food and leave the table without delivering the tools to eat the food??!!...and then, I had to go look for not only some silverware, but the server, ANY server, a hostess...they all looked at me like I was crazy when I asked for silverware!!!  This was unbelievable.And the servers on duty at that time were walking around like zombies!  Every time we asked for silverware, the server would leave and never come back...THEN, we were given plastic TO GO knives and forks.  Seriously?! My hubs asked for medium well steak and got well done.  He didn't bother sending back.Employees socializing more amongst themselves instead of focusing on quality of service to customers.Very bad experience! 1
I came here to paddleboard with Outdoor Afro group. We learned how to paddle board and enjoy the beautiful weather. They had an opening tonight with free food and drinks. 5
It makes me sad to give Red Square a poor review, because in the past, this was my absolute favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. The atmosphere is fantastic, and the food used to be stellar. Sadly, I'm not sure if they changed owners/management, but the last time I was there, the vibe was completely different. For one, they no longer had my favorite menu item - the steak tartare, which was one of the best I've had. I was barely getting over that disappointment when I realized that their signature item, the beef stroganoff, was completely changed as well. I ordered it anyway, and while the new version was a perfectly fine braised short rib and noodles, it was nothing like the rich, creamy deliciousness with thick homemade noodles and crispy potatoes that made the old version so special. Their drink menu was also presented to me in an iPad, which completely clashed with the old school Russian atmosphere. Finally, the service was terribly slow due to a large demanding party that our server was dealing with. However, they comped us a very nice bottle of Cabernet when I complained, so props to them for that. All in all, I guess if you haven't been before, it might be ok, but personally I feel like the recent changes were completely off the mark and very disappointing. It seems way too kitschy and touristy now, and I doubt I will go back. 2
After my last visit, I have to wonder why anyone would spend their money at this restaurant.  With the many FINE quality burger joints In the area, this by far is sub par.  Once a nice place to take the family is now run by a crew of misfits starting at the top.  When taking one step in this eatery it's painfully obvious there is tension among the staff, making for an uncomfortable experience from the get go.  I over heard fowl language from "Savana"?  I believe her name was.  When I have a small child with me this is not what I want them to hear.  I asked another employee who was tending to the condiment station who was the manager and they pointed to a short blond young woman who's appearance left something to be desired.  I decided then & there I would observe before speaking with her...just as I thought.  She too conducted herself like a child & not like a leader. I have spent the better of 30 years in a profession where I was required to notice small details. These details tell a lot about a person, situation or environment. Fuddruckers fell short in all areas. If the "feel" is off when u enter a place the meal is less enjoyable. I hardly noticed the quality of food because i was so put off by the first 10 minutes. The food was somewhat enjoyable, but nothing like it used to be. I feel as though if I'm going to pay 12 bucks for a burger meal, it should be served to me. (I can go across the street & get a nice steak dinner for 10 bucks!) With that being said, if everything is spectacular, these are the little things I'd over look. The charm of the place, if u will...I can get a cheaper, better tasting burger in 5 other places with in a mile of Fudds.  Overall this place need a complete makeover from management to menu.  If u don't care about your restaurant then why should I?  I sure hope this place can be saved,  it once was a great fun family spot! 1
The latte is one of the best I've had in the city.  The tables out front offer a great view of 17th Ave. 5
Bottom line: Don't go this place, you will regret it. There are many good, at least better, restaurants around, with the same or even lower price range.If someone tells you the food here is good, that person is either lying or s/he really needs to explore Toronto more.But the worst thing there is the service.One of us ordered a sushi roll dinner set. She waited until the rest of us have finished ours. Then asked a waitress when her order will be brought. We waited for another 5 - 10 minutes and asked another waitress the same thing. After 3 times we were irritated and just asked for the bill. (Yes, we placed our order at the same time, there is no misunderstanding or anything)Guess what? The sushi roll came!Then it was the final surprise Yutaka prepared for us: we asked to split the bill and the waitress there literally divided the total by 4. And we all ordered different things with different priceSo, respect yourself, don't be fooled by the declaration like we did. 1
This is the only place we can get our fix for Maryland style blue crabs.  We always order large females with extra oldbay seasoning and we take it to go. The staff is ok and the place is a bit small.  I tried their Ahi salad and was not too happy with it. The only other things we didn't like is when we call to put our order in they are already out of large females and its pricey.  The only reason we come here is because this is the only place that serves blue crabs Maryland style. 3
So I'm obviously very much a latecomer to the Marigold scene, but I do have to comment on a couple of this cute restaurant's offerings.  The red cabbage slaw is maybe the best substitute for a side of chips to go with your sandwich like, really, forever.  It's a tangy vinegar slaw, rather than mayonaissey sweet.  A perfect sprinkling of caraway, and hmm... is that cumin?  Crisp, crunchy, savory & sour.The open-faced tuna melt was also brilliant.  Bread-&-butter pickles instead of relish -- so simple, yet so good.  But God, I love that slaw! 4
I was involved in a car accident and the insurance company was giving me the run-around. I was referred to Bimal Merchant's law firm by my chiropractor and I have been very pleased with my experience. He is extremely knowledgeable & took the time to explain everything thoroughly making this the easiest and least stressful legal process I've been through. For any more required legal assistance in the future I will definitely return, hopefully I don't need it too soon though! Thank you Merchant Law Firm! 5
You can tell this is an upscale mall from the fancy decorator granite washrooms - individual rooms per toilet each with its own handwash station and modern immersion hand dryer. The washrooms are stocked with everything including hand lotion and has a separate sitting area from the common space that leads to the individual booths. Security is visible and so are cleaning staff. The mall's higher end chain stores and designer boutiques that are less common to regular malls in town offer a better selection of goods with accompanying higher prices. However if you have eagle eyes and are lucky, you might find the rare deal on shoes, clothing, gadgets, etc. This mall has everything including a couple of banks, eateries (including oliver & bonacini resto), gourmet grocers, bakeries, LCBO, coffee outlets, salon...check the website. To me, it is a sort of tourist destination if you are one of the working poor. I don't go there for my regular shopping, but it's a nice place to window shop for that fancy gift trinket when you need to impress. Or get some ideas anyway. The Sheppard/Bayview subway station is  right across the street . Worth a visit. 3
I was here February 2013 was a long wait. Food wasn't that bad was following Adam of Man vs Food. 3
The room was large and luxurious but I would rate it low due to the following reasons:They force you to pay a resort fee which is only disclosed after you book and provide your cc on their website. You cannot not pay even if you don't use the services offered.Secondly this place is not kid friendly at all, to get to the room one has to walk the whole    building. Also due to the free alcohol offered there are very rowdy people all around, we found a few on the elevator, that were using very filthy language and talking inappropriately for a public place. 2
Great place for a traditional fresh french bistro meal. Wine list was good - great service too. The duck was a little overdone so I'd say head over for an earlier meal. They cater to an older crowd who dines earlier it seemed. 3
I am very disappointed as I purchased a Titan Security Screen Door in 2007 with a lifetime warranty on the door itself and limited warranty on the working components like the door handle and lock and screen itself.   I had to have the door handle and lock replaced once in 2009 and they charged me $75 to do so, which I wasnt happy with, but paid.   Now in 2015 I called again as the handle and lock need to be replaced again.   Not only did it take forever to even get thru to their customer service, but now they say they no longer install nor replace door handles and locks, nor screens and do not warranty them any more.   How can you change a warranty????  They didn't even try and help me.   They just told me they only manufacture the doors now and do not install anymore so they do not warranty any of the installation nor working components and that was that.   Not very good customer service.   You would think they would at least direct me on what to do now. 1
I used to love Magpie but the last two times I've been there it just hasn't been the same. The pizza is way too salty. Most of my party agreed but that wasn't the worst of it. The service was so bad, it really put a damper on the evening. Our waitress brought us our food and then we never saw her again. She never once came by to check on us. It took way too much time and effort to wave her over so we could order some dessert. Once again she brought the dessert and left us never to return. We finally had it, put on our coats and went to the cash to pay. This has happened to us twice now. Don't think I'll be going back. 2
We had the short ribs with polenta and green beans and they were outstanding.  Service was okay - nothing to brag about. 4
They have the lowest rates around Peoria and Sun City for manis and pedis but I can't stand to patronize any business that has Fox News on TV's for customers 3
We had the Shrimp Burrito & the Carne Asada Chimichanga special. The special came with rice, re-fried beans and a drink. The food was really good, the chimichanga & the burrito were both large. The rice and re-fried beans are very average so don't get your hopes up. The decor is a combo of cafeteria and take out style, kinda like a "Baja Fresh" remix, but not many people go there for the ambiance. However I will repeat , the main entrees were good. A great value when compared to taco bell or dell taco, we had more than we could eat with drinks and spent less than $17.        :-) 4
Fabulous. I absolutely love this place. I have been going here for years, and I am never disappointed in my order. They are busy, so be prepared to wait in line for a few minutes. But it is well worth the wait. Love Liberty! 5
Waffles, sandwiches, and beer! Who ever thought of that!? Really random, but it works! The interior is more appealing than the exterior. I came in for a light dessert, and what I ordered was perfect. I love how light and fluffy these waffles were. I will have to go back to try the chicken and waffle sandwich. 5
I don't really know why but i expected to not quite enjoy Honey Bear's BBQ. Most of that is because when i think of BBQ anything i don't think of buying it more someone outside cooking it for me. Yet when i went in I can say I enjoyed. I ate the shredded chicken sandwich and was super happy with it. Though not a go to place if i get the craving I will pop back in again. 3
Nearly 2 weeks ago we had a 2nd technician to come out and fix our Samsung washer for a balance issue.1st technician said the problem was from the drain hose being too long. Next day- washer was displaying same error code, balance issue.2nd technician said the washer needed new springs. He replaced it with Samsung springs but then said they are not for this model because they are too short and "we could use the washer" and "it may work."  The basket is now rubbing on the washer frame.The 2nd technician said he will seek an approval from warranty company and order new springs. That has been 2weeks this Wednesday.We have been without a washer for nearly a month.I have taken over 10 hours off of work for the window the technicians give.The first technician arrived at nearly 6pm, second technician arrived approximately 5:15-5:20.The window I was provided for both appointments was 1:00-5:00.This company was only used through Lowes warranty. 1
Four stars for being a godsend. I was so sick of paying $3-5 for a bottle of soda or water. I got my drinks, my snacks, a big Icee, and the $40 limit in cash back (take that, $4.99 ATM fees!), all right in my hotel. Lots of cheap souvenirs, which I might be back for. I can also see this being awesome if you didn't bring enough lotion to avoid skin lizardification from the desert and hotel showers, or maybe some Tums after a night at the buffet. 4
I rarely write reviews but maybe this will help some readers... Two positives-- the good selection of dresses and the very sweet and understanding head of alterations. Other than that, Missy was patient with me... to a point. I'm very indecisive so I was there for a long time trying dresses. I was apologetic for not being able to make up my mind, but at the same time I realize that it is her job to help me. I also work in the customer service industry and understand the importance of making sure the guest has a great experience and feels comfortable, even if it's not ideal for the employee. Missy told me that if I purchased within 24 hours of trying on I could get a 20% off the dress to apply towards alterations or a veil. Because of that alone I "said yes to the dress" and picked out a veil. At checkout my mind was all over the place thinking "Did I make the right choice?! There's no going back now! Oh no! What did I do?!? Blah blah blah..." and I did not realize that they didn't apply the credit towards the veil until later. I figured that it wasn't a big deal thigh because I could still apply that credit towards alterations, but when I went in a few months later the price they quoted me was crazy so we said "no way!" We tried explaining to one of the employees that back in May we were told we would be able to apply the credit to the veil but they made an error on their end and did not apply it. This employee said that she couldn't do anything for us but would have the manager call us. We waited a few weeks to hear back (they were in the process of changing locations so we understood the delay), but when no one ever called us my mom had to call them. She spoke to the manager who still refused, even though giving us this credit on the veil would only take a little bit of work on her end. So much for customer service!! Now we are stuck with a hefty store credit that I don't know if we'll ever get the chance to use, and honestly, I would prefer to not ever return to the store to use it... Moral of the story, if they tell you that you will receive a discount, make sure they apply it!!! 1
Pretty darn good and you can tell there is a frequent regular crowd there, which is always a good sign. It's small, and has a nice Chicago theme, probably best for weekdays vs. crowded weekends. 4
My first time and there was no wait, so plus. Wait staff are friendly & accommodating; the menu is simple and easy to read; price is reasonable less than $10 for a regular size bowl of ramen. i would come back here. 4
Nice West-Island bar. Great patio with lots of TVs in the summer. Cheap beer. Food is decent but could be better. Good for sports events. Definitely better than bar hymus across the street. 3
All in all, very classy place in the heart of all that's good about Vegas! Rooms are clean, modern and hi-tech! The resort offers multiple restaurants so there is something for everybody, and most spots are open to at least midnight. You will indeed pay a premium for anything purchased at this resort, whether it is a bottle of water, a burger or a beer - not that this is anything different from the other higher end resorts on the strip. The staff is all EXTREMELY friendly and attentive, but I recommend if you are interested in gaming you head to one of the other close spots - maybe Monte Carlo?? Aria only offered continuous shuffle blackjack and 90% of the tables open on a Wednesday night were $100 per hand - okay if you are winning, but we had absolutely no luck at the Aria with gaming! In spite of this, I would totally stay here again! :-) 4
I try not to shop at this payless because of the consistency of poor customer service. But this was the one place that had the boots my disabled mom wanted for Christmas.  So I went, dealt with the inexperienced cashier who originally told me that she didn't know how to apply the coupon and finally purchased the boots. They were originally $39.99 I got them for $25. Fast forward to today, my mom went to put the boots on for the first time and the heal was broken inside. My mom took them to exchange (as she had 90 days I was told when I purchased them) and they refused. She didn't have the receipt,  and was not asking for cash, she just wanted a pair of boots that werent broken. The person in charge Jamie lied and said the boots were on clearance before Christmas and that they were only worth $19.99 and she would have to pay the difference. This was a bold face lie as I said above I only got them cheaper because of an online coupon. She was extremely rude to my mother who had to drive all the way to my work to pick up the receipt and go back to the store to return (because at this point she was tired and disgusted by the way she was treated). The lady had to admit she lied and give her what I paid. I will never, ever shop here again and may think twice about shopping at payless period. Jamie is disgusting and should not be in customer service or deal with people period. Don't shop here, go next door to DSW were they treat you with respect! 1
I honestly don't understand how and why people could find so many complains from this place, if this place is so bed then why is it that they are the only hotel who hosts miss USA and American idol among so many other venues. Where in the world can you find top of the line hotel 4 1/2 stars for 90 $ per night in a hotel less then few years old. i had my family there for 7 days for New Years and there was not one time that they did not deliver anything we had asked for. My friend who booked the room in UK and who owns the share had nothing but great things to say. So if you have a problem with a view then move up and pay the 360 $ a night on a Friday. I have stayed there before when it was PH and I did pay a lot less through Priceline ( 65$ ) and for the room you get I don't care if my shower thing is loose or anything else. this lady who complained about not getting her bill ready, are you serious, couldn't she just check her bank statement or is it the hotels fault cause she had no time to check out at the front desk, not just that, complaining about housekeeping picking up trash, whatever, when is it enough. 5
I have visited the lunch buffet here at The Host a few times, it's great... for the price. Can you really complain about a $12 All-You-Can-Eat?You are not going to get the top of the line fine dining you may expect going our for a fancy dinner, but for a quick lunch buffet you really can't complain. I especially liked the chance to try ALL the items, then go back for more of what I enjoyed the most. I would definitely recommend The Host for the Indian Food Newbie (like me) who wants to try new things, but doesn't want to leave a plate full of something leftover that you didn't like.I also noticed some lack of interest from the wait staff, but in the end the overall experience was good enough to come back to. 3
I dropped by Madison's for a late dinner before going out this past week.  The restaurant was split into two sections - one with a traditional bar feel (much louder and starting to get busier as the evening progressed) and the other with more of a traditional restaurant feel to it.  I choose to sit on the quieter, restaurant half.The service was good - attentive and friendly.  They had a good beer selection including my favorite - Bells, so no complaints on that front.  For dinner I ordered the turkey pesto sandwich and my friend got the mac and cheese.  We both ordered sweet potato tots.  The food was better than expected given some of the prior reviews I had read and the tots were excellent.  I love pesto and melted goat cheese added the perfect touch.  The mac and cheese - made with local Hook's cheese -  was also very good. 4
Pho Hung has been going downhill in their food/service, so I've been searching for a replacement pho place. (I felt like a cheater for walking in...)I really don't understand the low ratings for Pho Orchid. I had great service and great food. The pho was nice and hot when it arrived and the beansprouts were fresh. The soup was definitely more flavorful than the watered down stuff Pho Hung's been serving. I didn't think the meat was microwaved or old like others did. Springrolls were crispy and perfectly cooked, but I wish they gave me more sauce. They had orange slices in the water (which was a little strange), but it was a hot day so I didn't mind. The food came quickly (under 10 minutes) and the waiter got me extra limes when I requested it. He came back to check on me once and got my my bill when I needed it. Pricing is similar to other pho places, but more expensive than Pho Hung. I don't mind though; enen the small is a huge portion.Sure, this place is in the basement and the windows face the street, but it is definitely not a dump. Everything at least feels clean and the atmosphere is nice (didn't smell a whiff of cigarette smoke) They have their namesake orchids all around too. I've been here twice now and I enjoyed it both times. It's not the best pho ever, but it does a good job. 4
Average food. They changed their name but service was poor. I think the owner lady kept shouting at the servers.. Really big place but very few people. Servers were not good- they did not know what to do - seemed lost! 2
Came out looking for lunch and found this place and they have all day buffet. No one greeted my friend and I. The tables didn't have utensil or cups. There was a mess across from our table and no one cleaned it until we were leave. The food was average. They offer veg and non veg. One steam rice and noodle option. Few dessert options. Rasmalai was among salad I found cucumber piece in mine. Butter chicken was salty. One reason I would not come back because they made us wait long period of time for one naan! I mean they were serving one Naan at a time and I timed them and it took the staff 8-13 mins to bring out another naan. We were not the only one deprived from being served with naan. There were other tables that were too waited for naan! By the time our naan came out dishes were all cold. They should work on customer services skills and professionalism. 2
"Native" is your average pub food. Pretty good especially after a few beers. If you are adventurous I recommend trying the Ghost Pepper wings. Holy cow those are hot! Eating one of those is like getting a tattoo, you'll never forget the experience. 3
This is the worst McDonalds in all of the ones I have visited in my entire 47 years alive.  I have sent my comments to McDonalds Corp and to their district office and yet no improvement.  The service is terrible here along with the management.  I have history with McDonalds as I worked at one in Northern California for 4 years.  We had the best service, and when we messed up an order, we immediately made it right no questions asked.  This McDonalds treat you like they are doing you a favor for serving you when it should be they should be thanking me for visiting.  I have lived in the neighborhood for 13 years and this McDonalds has never improved.  Maybe it's not the management but the owner who does not care.  He or she should have their franchise license revoke for poor service. 1
I found this place by accident while trying to find a different Thai restaurant, but I'm sure glad I wound up here. I stopped in for a lunch special which came with soup, rice, small fried spring roll, and entree. The soup was rather plain and unimpressive  the stir fried beef on the other hand was quite tasty. The sauce they used was delicious. And when I said I wanted it spicy, they sure made it spicy! Good on them. The employees were all very nice and accommodating as well. Highly recommended. 4
nice restaurant, all you can eat but it is not a buffet so you have to order.  Foods are good however, the rolls are very big.  only 3 pieces will make you full already.  you can't enjoy much if they make too big. 2
I'd never get a car from here. Suppose they had fix my husband's car.n its worse. He hasn't  had so much issues ever .I told him to give it back .n will go some place else for a car. For someone that's making monthly payments it ain't worth all this . 1
Pretty much perfect. Unless you want low carb or gluten free. Great food, great service, great atmosphere. Also perfect for mothers day! Ask someone in the hotel for directions if you get lost. 5
This place changed so drastically since last year that I don't really recognize it anymore. It's become disappointing, sad to say. The chefs, managemant, and even the waitresses. They are filled with waitresses now where before there was only 2 which was appropriate for a small business area. The rolls have become small and the taste is different. Not bad different, but not great either. I chose the all-you-can-eat again. Apparently, their new policy is that if you don't finish anything, you pay extra for the left overs. In a business perspective, I understand. However, this place is not my go-to sushi place anymore mainly for that. Their services is good I suppose, but they constantly come around, not lettihn us enjoy ourselves. Like I said earlier, too much waitresses now. Felt like I was being rushed....The atmosphere changed now that they have Korean music videos in the background. It's not as...personal or intimate anymore sad to say. So all in all, I can't give this place more than a 2-star. 2
Fell short of my expectations.  I was choosing between several of the newer hotels on the strip and chose Aria based on its reviews.  I liked some aspects, but just expected more and for the service to be more seamless.When my boyfriend and I checked in, we were given a low level floor that looked directly into other rooms.  We asked if they had anything else and they said they could move us to another floor with two queens instead of a king.  We went for it and as soon as we stepped into the new room I had to hold my breath because it reeked so badly of smoke.  I should have never made the first simple request.  The front desk rep on the phone told me to call back later and also that there were no smoking rooms in the hotel, yet they had just switched to non-smoking the day before (and we were asking if we wanted a smoking room when we checked in).  A few hours later we called back and after being on hold for 45 min and eventually going back and forth between the front desk and calling from our our room we finally got our room changed.  Management did give us a food/drink credit, but I would much rather have not had two hours of hassle when I was looking forward to relaxing.Then the TV in the room was broken and we had to call service again and needed a new cable box.Housekeeping did not come by to clean the room the first day.  The second day I had the service sign illuminated for over 4 hours in the afternoon while we were out and it still wasn't made up by 4 pm.  I had to eventually call to schedule housekeeping.  Once they came they did do a good job.I've stayed at Encore by Wynn and the rooms and technology are nicer.  I will say the beds at Aria are comfortable and the dinner reservation help was good.  I will probably go back to the Wynn or got to the Cosmopolitan next time. 2
I visited this restaurant only a few weeks after returning from Rome, Italy. I was very surprised to find authentic Italian tastes in Old Montreal! Their mushroom risotto was very delicious and and recommended. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful when we were making our dinner decisions. I'd definitely go back for a romantic dinner or when I crave authentic Italian! 4
Been here at pickup area for 45 minutes after spending 480 bucks on a mattress. I guess it would be helpful if these people didnt have heads so far up asses. 1
Came on a Saturday for lunch before going to the Lion King.  Got in right after a large group on the patio outside and before another large group was arriving.  Probably 1 of only 2 parties eaching inside (2-4 people).  Place was pretty empty.Service was good.  Bread/crackers good.  Water stayed full.  We ordered a burger, an asian chicken dish (good, but nothing too special), bbq chicken pita (decent, with homemade potato chips, again, nothing special), and crab cakes (appetizer, came with 5 about the size of golf balls, again, decent).  I had the burger and it was quite tasty.  Came with cheese (said gouda but I got cheddar, without knowing it), (awesome) bacon, tomato (salsa-like, nice touch), and a garlic aeole (couldn't taste).  Very tasty burger- would definitely get this again.  Got a really nice side of fruit with berries and mango.Menu is mostly sandwiches/burgers, with a couple of asian dishes and some salads.  Kind of random I thought.  Great spot for a quite, though slightly spendy, lunch outing.  Total was around $70 (tip included) for the above mentioned items. 4
The Nutella crepe with bananas and strawberries was great!  My husband got the bagel sandwich with egg and cheese.  I was a little disappointed in the lack of vegetarian options if you weren't in the mood for something sweet.  They had tons of combo options that looked delicious but not a single one was veggie - boo. We enjoyed our breakfast. 5
Ate here earlier this week and ordered a shio ramen with corn. I love ramen but this place didn't impress me. It's just alright. Have had better ramen in Japan and Mitsuwa marketplace. I don't really like the soupbase. I prefer tonkotsu soup base. It's not bad but nothing special either. I prefer monta ramen over ramen sora. 3
The only place where I get yummy red bean or green sesame balls.  Also their steamed pork buns are my favorite.  This is where I order birthday cakes - mocha cake with coconut filling is a must-have! 4
Lack of attention to detail.  Called them to replace a Wayne Dalton garage door opener that that no longer is in production. They were not able to service it, ok, I understand it's an aged opener.My issue starts with the quoting process that happened on site.  Was quoted on a brand name garage door opener and was told that it was wireless so there would be no need to bury the line in the walls.  Also was quoted a price on a 7' door, when in actuality it's an 8' door, (I have a tape measure if you needed to borrow it). As well as told that it connects to the internet so that a smart phone can be used to open door remotely.Day of installation, find out that it's an 8' door so there is an up charge for additional rail. As for the wireless, that was a false statement as there is now a wire stapled diagonally across the ceiling.  The standard wire is also only x number of feet long, so now the open button is not near the interior door.....but 18 feet from the interior door where the existing wireless button was located.  Lastly, the internet connectivity mentioned would come with an additional purchase of hardware so is not native to the garage door opener itself.At the end of the day it was a low ball quote to win the business with none of the proposed features delivered.  I didn't stay in the garage to micromanage installation so the end result was a lack luster completed job.There has to be a better service out there. Should have went with the referral from a friend instead of the manufacturer's contractor. 2
Several in my party ordered steaks some 6oz and 2 9oz. All came out with 6oz steaks and the manager states "trust" me it's 9oz. Never asking if I wanted something else and stated she couldn't cook me another because it will come out the same. THE WORST RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE I've had. Horrible customer service. 1
Found this great spot on yelp. Traveling and needed a quick pedi. Probably one of the best pedicures I have had. Skilled technician and nice people. Worth every dime. 5
The buffet has a beautiful selection.  It is visually impressive.  The food was just OK.  We ate about half of what we put on our plate and then went back to try other things.  There were a few nice meat selections, side dishes, and shrimp that the whole family liked.  The desserts were great.  The endless alcohol option had nasty watery wine.  If you choose that option go with bottled beer, then it is a good deal.  $33.99 for age 11 and up and $19.99 for age 10 and under seemed a bit steep especially with all of the trial and error we went through to find tasty food.  The service with clearing plates and replenishing beverages was just OK.  Don't tip when you check in, wait to see if your server is attentive and tip at the end.  The kids enjoyed experience.  I think my husband and I would have rather been at a steakhouse spending $33.99 on a steak and getting a nice bottle of wine. 3
Nice small place. Great tacos and had a comfortable seat outdoors. Friendly server. Will go back. 4
This place is like an old flame. You know why you swore to never go back but you end up returning because, while not good, it's also not totally horrible. The service is meh, the food is edible, and the prices are decent but there's really nothing that keeps me coming back except for the fact that it's close, so its got that going for it. 2
Horrible guest service . Word of advice : Please have them take out your banner & display before taking it home . The manager Pong needs to have more passion in his job and title . 1
I walked a mile to Mr. Sammich, and it was so worth it. The banh-mi sammiches are kinda compact, so you can easily eat several different ones.  I had #45, the tofu version.  Something about the sauce plus the cilantro plus the perfect french bread unified to rule my universe like a gakked-up unicorn with a laser horn.  I had a coconut drink to wash it down, you know, the coconut with the lobotomy hole in the top, and a spoon to scrape out the white brains.  So back to the bread.  Let me tell you how perfect it was.  I went to the Mr Sammich bathroom facility (clean, totally ok).  I walked in 3 circles, doubled over with headache pain, and resurrected half the #45.  What a waste of a tasty sammich.  Before you get all grossed out and close this browser tab, let me say this: "the bread was just as awesome on the way out".  I'm not a regular puker, so don't think I have experience tasting food twice.  I don't.  But that doesn't change the fact that I noticed how tasty it was, twice.  Mr Sammich, you rule. 4
Below Average food. We went to the restaurant after reading the previous reviews. But were disappointed. Atleast the vegetarian options were not good. I don't think we will return to this restaurant again. 2
I had high hopes for this buffet after reading the reviews but I don't think I'll ever return. There was a strange odor in the air, and a majority of the food was cold and tasteless. The king crabs were good, but cold, and the desserts were surprisingly tasty. 2
This gym is awesome!!! They keep it so clean and it's big enough that people aren't on top of you. Like any gym though there are those people who are just rude but it's NOT the staff. The staff is friendly and willing to answer questions quickly. This is my favorite gym of the LVACs not just because it's new but the layout is awesome. The pool is still under construction but I will love this place even more when it's finished. They also have fun group classes!! Brandy who teaches some of the Les Mills classes is awesome!!! BEST GYM! 5
I had actually read the reviews before I went so my expectations were super low but they still managed to disappoint.I waited so long for someone to take my drink order that I ended up ordering at the bar. The food was dropped off so quickly that we didn't have a chance to ask for cutlery (and no one noticed we didn't have any). We ended up taking it from another table. When the mains came, they didn't clear the appetizer plates. Then when the desserts came, they didn't remove ANY of the dinner or appetizer plates. Seriously? We also didn't get cutlery for dessert and had to once again pillage another table.  And don't even bother trying to get a glass of water... Bottom line: mediocre food, terrible service. 1
Eating a whataburger. It's fantastic. Haven't had one in years. It's a perfect compliment to a football game that may be a blowout. My burger had no less that 8 pickles on it. I'm sick of this one pickle bullshit. The bacon could have been thicker, but this burger was easily 1.8x larger than a McDonald's burger. French fries could have been crispier but the had a good flavor. And they offer spicy ketchup. What a burger 5
Delicious, clean and the conveyor belt was a hit with the kids.   Lots of different types of sushi, salads and dessert items to choose from.  Regular/kids menu available for the anti-sushi appetite.   We will be back.   Such a fun experience! 5
We've been to Tokoyo lobby twice. Both times were great. I'll start by saying I gave it four stars instead of five because it is small, small, small inside and the ambiance isn't fantastic. But the things you must do for good sushi! I can't recall for certain the name of our favorite roll, but I believe it was the Glendale roll. Deep fried goodness is all I can say! I know, it isn't traditional sushi, but I just can't do raw fish! Nuff said. We tried two other kinds which were good as well, but the deep fried goodness overshadowed the other ones and I have erased them from my memory. The pot stickers were ok, not fabulous. The green tea was great and came in cute little tea pots. I haven't had sake here and I don't know why, since I usually get sake. Guess I'd better head back for some more sake and sushi! 4
If you are college student trying to use the discount coupons, don't go here they don't accept coupons. Just walk across to Yonge street. Thank me for saving your time. :) 1
**3.5 Stars**YOGI NOODLE!! Okay, so yogi noodles is not just your average chinese cafe. They offer a wide variety of all sorts including BBQ duck, pork and stuff. The food I would say is pretty decent and cheap. I had a satay beef vermicelli for lunch the other day and it was only $5.99 which includes a hot drink! But i normally order cold drinks for extra $0.70.  I would not reccomend the cold milk tea or coffee, as it is always really off.Overall, pretty decent place to eat for lunch or afternoon tea for its price. I would've gave 4 stars, but that milk tea is preventing me to do so. 3
Food is good (not amazing), service is inconsistent and at one point deceptive.  The food is a less fancy version of the main restaurant next door, so if you like "new" French cuisine, you'll enjoy this place.  I like traditional French cuisine with big, rich, and deep flavors, so I was not amazed by the food.  On the food end there isn't much to complain about except that the foie gras course was lost in the soup.  That course needs to be reworked.The service at this place needs retraining. When you pay a certain amount for a meal, you expect a minimum level of service which was not met in the following ways.1. The foie gras course was described as ravioli to me and then as tortellini to the couple next to me.2. My turbot course was visually smaller than the portion recieved by the couple next to me.  The server assured me that it was the same portion because everything gets weighed out, but even if this were the case, why would you serve a visually inconsistent dish to to someone sitting next to a couple eating 2 visually standard portions?  Since I sat at the bar area I observed several turbot courses being plated and mine was the only ine that was nonstandard.  The couple to my left got 2 standard portions and I ordered before them!3. The couple to my right was served salmon with a different preparation instead of turbot without being informed that they ran out of turbot.  Apparently my nonstandard piece was the last one.  The chef did provide them with an extra dish of dover sole as compensation though.  4. They made me wait about 10 minutes after I finished my last course (dessert) before asking if I received the dessert yet, then the server asked if wanted coffee or the check.  They even set a spoon in front of me to make me believe that something was coming.  The waiter then played it off like he made me wait because he didn't want to make a mistake since he almost served the wrong dish before.  If you screwed up and forgot about me just own up to it!Bottom line 3.5/5 for food 2/5 for service. 3
Great food and drinks. Hate that I always have to make a reservation to eat there, but other than that, great place. 4
Let's get this out of the way: I am Italian born and bred so I have more than a passing knowledge of what Italian food should be and taste like.My daughter and her family were in town and having read of Piazza al Forno we decided to stop at the Phoenix location for lunch after a morning spent at the Science Center. What a mistake! There were six of us and most of us ordered the pizza. The dough was undercooked or should I say chewy and almost raw, The tomato sauce was a poor imitation of Italian tomato sauce, watery and awful, and the little bitty pieces of mozzarella on the pizza were pitiful! What a disappointment! To add insult to injury the water they served had a metallic taste that made it undrinkable.Overall I wish I could give a -2 review. It was that bad! 1
Everytime I'm in town to visit, this is a MUST stop for lunch/ dinner. Everything here is fresh from the oysters, clams, shrimp, lobster, etc.  The pan roast and seafood chiapp. is my favorite. The chef packs the pasta with big pieces of shrimp, crab, and lobster. I don't know why they have low ratings, but you'll be surprised to taste such amazing dishes from this casino. Come try it out and you won't regret it!! 5
Had to switch barbers because I moved and the place I used to go to didn't take appointments. Great old school barber shop that does the straight razor finish. You can make appointments online which is really convenient especially since I work a lot and don't have a lot of free time. Boris always cuts my hair and is great at what he does and also consistent. I never have to worry if it's going to be a good haircut and I'm kind of ocd about haircuts. I would definitely recommend this place. 5
One of our favourite places to order from when we are feeling lazy. We usually get the jerk chicken and the roti because they are so good!! Not only is the food delicious, the delivery is always quick and courteous. 4
Pretty alright. We went in with a buy one get one coupon, and we might return if we had another. Ordered fish & chips, and a turkey burger. The fish & chips turned out nice, the turkey burger was not nice.Turkey burger's meat was spicy for some reason, and came with house-made thousand island which was also spicy for some reason. I don't mean an eye-wateringly powerful spice, or an interesting spice that added to the flavor profile, just an unadvertised "I wouldn't have ordered this had I known in advance" kind of spice. Beyond that, the flavors and textures didn't mesh or impress. And I'm sorry to not be sorry here, but I've grown tired of eleven dollar burgers that are so huge that you can't eat them without a knife and fork. I ended up taking half of this thing home, and then couldn't bring myself to eat it because it was so unimpressive.Otherwise, service was nice enough, and ambiance was okay (construction going on in another part of the building, so there was loud beeping and drilling that echoed around the open floor plan). The five-starry reviews around Yelp are speaking of their regular burgers, so maybe if we ever return we will split one of those between two people. Maybe with another coupon... 3
Looking for a good caterer for our wedding was harder than I expected until we ran into this amazing caterer with a wide range of food options.  The owner, Nik, hosted us for a great dinner to try out his southwestern cuisine and it was seriously amazing! We ended up booking him right away (and at a fraction of the cost of the more expensive ones we were considering).  People loved the food!  It was spicy and full of flavor but not too spicy for the old gringos.  The ingredients were fresh and packed with flavor.  My only complaint was that the pork dried out a tiny bit, but every other bite was fantastic.  People also loved the southwestern corn side dish.  We would DEFINITELY recommend these guys and would use them again if the need arose. 5
I've had cats all my life, so I've seen my fair share of vets. Dr. Smith is by far the best veterinarian I have ever found. He's very knowledgeable and always takes the time to explain everything thoroughly. He's also very mellow, not a high-pressure vet, which I appreciate. The office staff is always friendly and caring. I love that this is a cats-only clinic which means far less stress for the cats. My cats are my kids and I wouldn't trust anyone else to take care of them. 5
Swell farmacy on Central Avenue is best dispensary in Phoenix great customer service fast and friendly Service Great strains and concentrates! 5
Fantastic food, good prices, great portions. Went there on a whim when visiting downtown Phoenix. Sauces for all the meats are great. Green beans, collards, and corn breads were our favorite sides!The guys running the joint went out of their way to be helpful. 5
Moved into 1055 Bloor in May, 2014. Management bent over backwards to convince us to move in, but once we moved in, it appeared as though their priorities shifted to luring other suckers into moving in. Several advertisements for 1055 Bloor highlight the beautiful indoor pool, which was our main reason for moving in. We had full use of the pool for two days, after which the heat was turned off without notice. Then it was closed for "major repairs" according to Almira, the building manager. The pool was, however, permanently closed without noticed in favour of a "gym" which required little to no maintenance. No reduction in rent was offered when this amenity was taken away. Management reasoned this was fair, because they were opening the new gym, which was also advertised to attract renters. The "secure" garage we pay to park in is anything but secure. When we moved in, the door knob was on the floor for several days. Then, when it became obvious that the antiquated locking mechanism was too difficult to open for too many people, someone jammed the lock open permanently. This was not remedied until the building switched to an electronic FOB system months later. How our vehicle was never broken into, damaged or stolen is beyond me. The fire department is located nearby, which is convenient, because it's not uncommon for the fire alarm to go off several times over the course of a day, or late at night. These are often false alarms. At least one of which went on for 30 minutes, because the fire department was not notified, and residents were treated to the loud disruption well after 11pm while the inept superintendent attempted to disable the alarm himself to prevent the fire department from charging the company for the fourth false alarm of the day. Repairs are done on a when-we-feel-like-it basis. It took THREE MONTHS to fix a hole in the ceiling above our bathtub, and the ceiling wasn't replaced, it was only given a poor patch job. Apartments are poorly ventilated. If you're unfortunate enough to have a neighbour who smokes, you can look forward to inhaling plenty of second-hand smoke. The peace and quiet is also often destroyed by neighbours fighting over trivial domestic issues, like who's turn it is to do household chores. Laundry facility was 24 hours when we moved in, but vandalism caused it to be limited to 7am - 11pm. 1
I was very excited to be staying at Luxor when my friends and I booked here for 4 nights but left wishing I had stayed somewhere else.First when we got to Luxor the check-in line was ridiculous. I swear of everywhere i've stayed in Vegas this has got to have the longest/slowest lines. After about 45 minutes waiting in line we finally got our room on the very top and we were dissappointed. The room was plain and very uninviting & I didn't dig the slanted wall at all.I really didn't like the layout or the feel of the casino floor so I didn't end up playing that much there.Spent some time at the pool and did like that because it was a decent pool and was not crazy busy.Nobody at the casino was mean or rude to us just didn't like the vibe.On a high note my friends and I ran into Criss Angel 3 times while there. Once we were in the elevator (inclinator) and I didnt even notice until a friend poked me and said something. The next time was right outside of the elevator and I was going to go ask for an autograph but his bodyguard looked like if I came close he was going to tackle me and he was on his cell phone yelling at someone so I declined to get near him. The last time was once again at the elevator.I dont hate this place but until their rooms are more inviting and the vibe is better I wont be booking a room there...I might come for a short visit though. 3
If you like music, bands, dancing this is for you.  If you like food and drinks, it is okay if you can get past poor service and staff that do not seem to like to work there.  We enjoyed for the music and dancing, so it was okay for us, but service really needs to be improved. 3
I went to le bremner for my birthday back in december 2015 and I was disapointed with my experience. We told the waiter to surprise us all the way through and I will never do this again we weren't happy with their choices and felt that the dishes they served us really weren't their best dishes. The oysters were fantastic and the trout gravlax as well. We also had a buratta entree which was good but nothing to rave about. The main dish they served us was a whole fish with the spine and all and was not impressed. The other main was mushroom risotto which is usually my favorite but it was way too salty very hard to eat. Lasty was the pancakes for dessert which were very good. Overall my experience was not good enough to say id go back especially considering the price. 3
This is the best restaurant  and bar on the strip that makes you feel like you are not in Las Vegas. Having 3 different floors great food and reasonable prices for drinks. Especially for being in Las Vegas. The staff is always really friendly and fast service. 4
The staff here is extremely snooty and unhelpful. I came here looking for a retirement gift for my dad from my family and was pretty put off by the pretentiousness that I just left without getting what I was looking for. I mean you are goddamn sales people! Not CEOs. Don't act like you don't have time to talk to me because I'm not wearing a three piece suit. While I was there I asked if they do repair work on lower end watches and their staff said "NO. you go to SEARS!" Yeah, that actually happened. 1
Food City is a "Meeh-he-co" experience in itself. The deli is good for cerviche, burritos and the like. The bakery has those great empanadas, try the pineapple. The fruit and vegetable section is par none, with great variety and prices. Lets just say, their are always mexicans and asian folks buying fruits and vegetables there. They know this stuff. To top it all off, on somedays, they BBQ whole chicken outside on real wood coals, not that charcoal bullshit and not gringo gas, but real bonafide wood. This yardbird is good, and if your real nice, buy some green chiles and ask the person to roast them for you outside and slip them a few dollars ;) Like I said, Meeh-he-co experience. 4
Maybe the "Kid Friendly" should be updated to say NO. FYI I used to love this place, I would go here all the time when I was at university. I grew up...and I had a baby. Now I came back with the stroller on a not so busy Saturday afternoon, only to come in and be told that strollers were not allowed...and it wasn't like I had some gigantic stroller either. There were a few empty tables.Would you have turned away someone in a wheel chair? I don't think so. Absurd. I was so insulted. Way to stick it to your loyal customers. Never going back, and if you have small children I advise you not to go there either. 1
Taste is alright, coming from LA this spot is def not on par with what we got out there. First thing that I thought was how come the fishes aren't put into a separate bowl and mixed with the sauces and certain toppings. Instead it was just thrown on top of the rice along with everything else. Overall is just okay moving great would not come again. On top of that is $11 I think is def overpriced for two scoops of protein. The fish is def not fresh Does not have a good vibe, no music, and needs friendlier customer service....the guy seemed like he hated his life. 2
Was searching for a new restaurant and decided to try this place out. Not my best decision. They have a pretty limited menu. I ended up ordering a small Oahu bowl. It's supposed to be chicken breast with their teriyaki sauce. I substituted the rice that it normally comes with for vegetables. The bowl I got was vegetables with cubed pieces of check on top. Unfortunately, it was absolutely drenched with sauce. Like swimming in sauce. I was even given an extra container container of sauce in case I wanted to put more. Maybe they forgot that there was no rice to absorb some of the sauce, but it was just way too much. Also, if the sauce was super good, I probably wouldn't have minded, but the sauce was average, at best, and wasn't really unique. I know there's only so many ways to prepare teriyaki sauce, but this felt like it was a recipe pulled off the internet instead of someone's unique creation. The staff was friendly though (hence the 2 stars), but I doubt I will go back there. 2
Decided to try after many friends recommended. Portabello fries amazing! And unfortunately that's was the best part of the meal. Very disappointed with the rest. Porterhouse steak was ordered medium, came out almost well done & over salted. No one checked on how our steak was prepared. Brussels sprouts were very bitter and not properly prepared. Didn't even want to chance desert. 3
Are you kidding me with the 4 star reviews?! This place lacks quality fresh fish and is very expensive for the type of food they serve. We got a small roll combo, and legit half of it was California rolls and rolls with sweet potato in the middle. If you want better sushi, head to north York. Better prices, better fish. 1
I go there for breakfast sometimes, but the last couple of times they've not had the muffins to make their breakfast sandwiches, which is odd because I go into work earlier than most.  Location is near the Clinic, so I imagine it would attract a lot of customers, but whoever is running this place seems to have no interest in actually managing the place.  There's a Burger King nearby and you can just go there. 2
Great location, good deal, and not too shabby accommodations! The staff was very nice and helpful as well. Check out the entertainment room in the basement while you are there! 4
I was told about a possible brake issue around 200.00. I said go ahead and fix it. When I arrived, he found that the actual problem was something minor and only charged me 40.00!!! No mechanic has ever been this honest with me before. Oh yeah, be sure you talk to Gary. 5
A two star rating for poor service and bland food. We ordered - cappuccino $4 - chicken pot pie $21- mac & cheese with ham $22The good thing is the portions are very large (considering the money you'll spend here). The bad thing is both the pot pie, and mac & cheese taste exactly like cream. If it wasn't for the texture difference, I would think my friend and I ordered the exact same thing. The service was awful. The servers didn't make any effort to explain the specials of the day. We had our glasses filled once, and only because we asked. It wasn't even busy (lots of vacant tables around us) and we were handed our bill as soon as we finished eating. I noticed all the waiters just stand by the front talking with one another, and texting on their phone. It's a cute, small place but it's just another overpriced Bay Street restaurant. I might come back to give it one more chance, but only if a friend insists. 2
WOW! This place is awesome! My girlfriends and I came to Atlas Bistro on a Saturday night and we couldn't stop talking about how amazing it was. The food was delicious. Seriously, some of the best food I've ever had. The atmosphere was quaint and fun, and the service was terrific. I loved the somewhat unique dishes. They were different than your normal menu, but not so different that you didn't really want to try much. They also accommodated the various allergies at our table of 9 lades. I just wish I had taken a to-go bag of my scallops! 5
Worst pedicure I have ever had. Took her 15 minutes and was already sitting under the dryer. Never coming back. 1
True disappointment. Bland food and long wait for it. The service was the only positive part. 1
We arranged a shoot with Townsley to get some family portraits done of our 3-member family. We selected the Union Station locale as we felt it matched well with our love of travel. It also happens to be the closest offered location to where we live in SE LA County :)  Stuart was pretty much on time and we got right down to photo shooting. We did not use the interior of Union Station, rather we went into the courtyard between the station and the next-door MWD building. This is a nice enough area but it doesn't really have any travel connection. I suppose lighting would be a real problem inside the station.The shoot was pretty quick and painless, even with a 15 month old along. You do need to go to the Townsley office in Beverly Hills to review proofs and order your pictures, so be prepared for that. We haven't gone yet, so we don't know what the finished product will look like. Will update the review when we get our portraits. 4
Normal buffet....Nothing special except the dessert.I think i expected too much.Great service but it didnt worth the price. 3
This place is right down the street from my house. It's close and in a great location (small shopping mall with a Zipps).I really, really want to like this place, but for some reason the Barista's cannot get my order right! I do not like 3 pumps of any flavor in my latte, it's frankly too much flavor. Especially vanilla, it is already strong on it's own. Not sure why all these places claim to have the best coffee and espresso yet mask if with all the sugary flavors! All I ask for is a one pump vanilla latte, that's it! By the time I get to my car to take my first sip, it's ALWAYS WRONG. Guess I should drink it at the table to make sure it's right. I even see the barista write it down on the cup. Hmm not sure the disconnect here.If you are looking for free wifi and a decent selection, check this place out. Just make sure you bring enough $$ so they don't charge the ridiculous .50 charge for using a card! 3
My husband & I were in Vegas last week (9/8-9/11) and we had dinner at this restaurant Friday night. This is one of the restaurants inside Wynnhttp://www.wynnlasvegas.com/#dining/bartolotta/The staff was really nice and we were seated right away even though we did not have a reservation. Their specialty is seafood - most of which flown in daily, majority from Italy and the mediterranean.  They show you the fish cart (fresh of course on ice)-explain where it came from, how they cook it, etc. They also have very good bread - 5 kinds that they serve you prior to your meal order.  If you want a sommelier to help you select your wine, he's there also.  We ordered a pretty good size fish (from Italy) white meat, tender and when it arrived, served table-side:  removed the bones and served it with the richest and smoothest mashed potatoes and fresh, sauteed vegetables.  We had appetizers also prior our meal and both fantastic. The dessert was equally wonderful! I should have taken photos with my iphone so you can see how beautiful they present their food.This is definitely a place we will go back to when in Vegas - the prices are reasonable.Great food and great service - that's a winner in my book! 4
This was probably the most unforgettable cds show cause it was my very first show! I liked the show but i cant say that it is my favorite! I got to enjoy a free upgrade almost next to the stage tho! 4
I would give 3 stars for food and 4 stars for the atmosphere. We had the linguine calamarti and risotto mare. Linguine was a bit bland but the risotto was good. Not a bad place to drop by if you are in the area (but no parking). Great date spot. 3
Sometimes I feel like I am almost defending neighborhood, independent establishments in my reviews.  It's a bit unfair to hold small, focused shops to the same standards as full-blown restaurants.  They are not quite fast-food, but they aren't always bastions of fine dining either.With that said, Gyros Palace delivers a decent gyro at a decent price without a whole lot of waiting around.  Whenever my family is in the mood for a quick lunch that's not fast-food, this is one of the places we choose.  The last time we got take out at Gyro Palace was on the way to a Phoenix Coyotes game, and it was great. 4
I decided to try this place again... Service is amazing and food got somewhat better but still not that great.. 3
Love the great home decor and housewares section! Almost too many racks of clothes to sort through, high quality brands but usually a little out dated. Prices can be a little high but do go down the longer the item has been there. Staff is friendly and helpful. They have a rewards program to earn store credit and send emails with special discount days! 3
Tastes similar to the original without the wait. The hot dog was too much for me to handle. Just too big. But a good option on the strip for cheap fast food. 3
I'm a regular here however I received a pedicure and a gel manicure but the older gal stepped on my toe and ruined the polish while giving me a manicure. She then cut me 3 times drawing blood and totally skipped the hand massage at the end bc 4 women walked in. She also insisted i pay before helping to re-pain the toe she ruined. Service is huge and she rushed the best part and caused me pain. 3
Wow! Jennaya is a sassy little number with the skills to  pay dem bills. She rocks my cuts. I'm 35 and she is beyond a doubt, the best I've had. Doesn't matter if I got time to shot the breeze or if I'm running behind. Jennaya gives me the same service in no time at all..... She doesn't know if she'll ever understand the man's mind, but she understands how his hair is suppose to lay on it.... Thanks Neya. This one's for you!!! 5
I have been a member here since it opened the first 2 yrs were great but by the 3rd year it starting going down, it get way 2 crowded because they offer all those low prices for tickets, the food line used to be organized and quick now I'm in line for an hr and no one has a clue what they are doing. We used to be able to find seating now its a joke.  My kids can care less if we join or not , I do it so they can at least stay busy and cool off but they are never thrilled to go. I would highly suggest you get a locker as there are serious thieves here, a friend of ours had her whole bag stolen and I know a few people who have had their Nike sandals stolen as well .  Get the locker trust me because wet n wild doesn't do anything for you if yr belongings are stolen. 2
French onion soup was watery with little taste.  We sent it back and were refunded the cost.  The wait staff also forgot that we were there for a birthday and didn't bring out a candle for dessert.  On the plus side my trout was wonderful and my wife enjoyed her scallops.  We've been a number of times but this last meal has tarnished that "must visit" image.  Pricing is reasonable for Vegas and reservations can usual be booked same day. 3
Good haddock, nicely crisp batter, but not the best around. Portions are impressively large. Fries are thickly-cut and quite moist.The place is full of people who look like they've been eating here for decades, and Duckworth's doesn't look like its changed much in that time. Service is brisk, but friendly enough. 3
For the price that I paid, it was definitely not worth it.  I would understand if it was a school, where stylists are still learning, then you get what you paid for, but that is not true here.  When I got home I noticed an area on my scalp that had dye and melted saran wrap stuck to it, which was super awkward to get out of my hair & now the area is very sensitive.  I also noticed there was a huge bleach stain on my t-shirt as well.  For such an expensive hair cut and dye I don't think I should have had to suffer through peeling dye off my scalp at home or a ruined t-shirt. 1
This DR office does not even deserve the 1 star which was the lowest option. I saw Shelley on a Friday and she rushed me out because she didnt wanna deal with me. I called and left a message on Monday and no call back. Left a message on Tuesday morning no call back, left a message on Tuesday afternoon no call back. Called and talked to the lady at the front and asked her if they got me message and she told me "hold on" then transfered me to the voicemail again. I called Wednesday and they set up an appointment so I went in. While sitting in the waiting room I overheard the lady put several people on hold while she continued to talk about her personal life. I finally got to see the so called DR Shelley and she YELLED at me and told me she will not help me. Bottom line, don't go to this so called DR office. 1
Yummmmmy, a little pricy folks but the toppings on the burger, the bun, those fry things, etc all very very good. Still mayhem with the new store in town but wow yum!!! I tried Carl's in Idaho a  few years ago & Penticton a couple years ago and very good burgers. You order your burger exactly how you like it including toppings and then find a place to sit if you can and they bring it out to you - it's as fresh as fresh can get, no sitting under a heat lamp here! Yummy :) 5
These guys are great.  Very professional, prompt and hard working. Mirko, Mooke, Victor and Ryan worked well as a team and got the job done.  Highly recommend to anyone who needs a local move.  Excellent service at a very fair price. 5
I started going to LA Fitness a few years ago when they bought out Ballys.  The only reason I keep going there is because I have a low rate locked in.  I've been to 2 other locations in Pittsburgh (North Hills and East Liberty) and this is definitely my least favorite.  The equipment is nice and they will validate your parking in the garages--I can't really think of anything else positive.  The gym is packed with college age kids. I have no idea why they choose to pay $35 a month here instead of going to the free university gym.   The first floor smells OK.  Try to breathe through your mouth if you're on the 2nd floor in the summer.  The locker rooms are pretty dirty and usually packed.    If you're not comfortable around  crowds definitely stay away in peak hours.  LA Fitness corporate really pushes their sales people  to keep their gyms at maximum capacity.  They know how cheap Pittsburghers are so they will deal with it.   I also would advise some noise-canceling headphones because the music (Katy Perry, Bruno Mars, etc.) is really loud.  It's not a terrible place, but they do deserve all these bad reviews. 2
I really expected something more refined. The entrance is so grand with its own elevator and lobby area. They use universal wine glasses for water glasses, which I found quite off. I ordered the flat iron steak special, it was bland. Thankfully there was bacon on the side to the rescue  my husband ordered the lamb sausage hash. It very tasty but wasn't balanced. They sausage was overwhelming and needed more potatoes to level the dish. The brio he bread was really good. For some reason, the waitrons have table cloths wrapped around their waist. Service was just like their food, bland, nothing special. If you want a fancy breakfast with good food, go to tableau at the Wynn. 2
Dropped my MAC pro and expected the worst... In my fortune no cracked screen or anything that looked out of the ordinary until I turned it on and realized it made a weird whizzing noise seemingly coming from a fan or the hard drive.. It work perfectly but now just emitted a really annoying buzzing/whizzing noise.Found these guys on Yelp! And decided to give it a shot. I'm not sure about other people's experience with "poor customer" service but I felt like these guys were great! Came in made our introductions described the problem and after they asked permission to look at it they took it out back to work on it. I barely finished a free arcade game that's provided in the waiting area where they came out and said they cleaned and adjusted the fan which looked like it was knocked loose. It was like a 10 minute turnaround!I asked how much for their time and work they simply replied don't worry about, if it starts making the noise again or it malfunctions just bring it back and we'll take care of it. These guys were professional, courteous and prompt. Two thumbs up or in this case 5 stars! These guys definitely earned my business. 5
Vitner Grille is the go to place to get a good meal and have a few drinks with friends when in Summerlin.  The appetizers are unique and delicious.  I attended a special event when a friends mother passed away and they did an excellent job of taking care of our group of about 25 people.  One of my favorite things about Vitner is the decore which is hip, comfortable and elegant. 4
Very slow service which is not ideal for an airport setting. It took the waiter 10 minutes to even take my drink order. Then, when I was in the middle of ordering... he walked away mid sentence. The food was decent but it was overpriced for one margarita and a plate of chicken nachos. My total was $28. Too much for terrible service and sub par service. Pass! 2
I was excited to try this place based on the reviews.  We were greeted promptly and seated a few minutes later.  My first observation was how outrageously loud the music was.  The server basically had to lean in and yell to explain the menu.  Forget about any conversation with my girlfriend, we couldn't hear each other in the booth we were in.  The main course came out before the appetizer which was annoying.  Five small wings for $6 wasn't worth it.  I ordered the spicy chile wings and received the bbq wings, I didn't say anything since I torn on which type to get in the first place.  The only reason I would come back is to try the pretzel bites, which they ran out of.  Also the parking lot was large so you don't have to worry about finding a space.  2.5 stars for being disappointed, but I will round up to 3 for ambience of the brewery. I might come back for a beer, not food. 3
Disgusting!  Avoid!  Unless you enjoy a roach in your cup of water.  Told the waiter and he took the glass away and brought us back another cup of water. 1
We tried this place last night.  I'll get right to the point...  The tots had good flavor but were cold in the center.  The wings were not good at all.  I appreciate the effort on the smoke, but you HAVE TO drop the wings in the fryer to crisp up the skin.  The sauce was not spicy either.  I would have preferred a traditional buffalo sauce like Franks.  The fish and chips were ok.  No lemon with them.  The fries were soggy/soft.  The beer was OK.  About as good as Four Peaks.  The service was good.  I am always amazed at these Scottsdale bars/breweries that have nothing to do but stare at a TV.  Pool tables, shuffle board, darts would be nice... We actually cashed out and went to Fate for a pizza cuz we didn't finish the food at SBC.  We may try it again.  Maybe not.... 3
Last week our Zoe passed and I used Good Shepherd Pet Services to handle her remains.  I called basically incoherent with grief on Thur., and Colleen was very patient and kind.  They were able to pick Zoe up the next day, and Monday her remains were back home.  This is unfortunately the 4th time we have used Good Shepherd Svcs., but we have had as good an experience as possible with them considering the losses of our pets.  Thank you 5
We tried this place for the first time today after reading the reviews on Yelp and it did not disappoint. They were slammed when we walked in, but they were so friendly and attentive that the wait didn't seem as long. There were so many tantalizing options on the menu, but we decided on the Huevos Rancheros, Chilaquiles and the Bacon Burger. I am a Chilaquiles connoisseur and for not being a Mexican restaurant, these were delicious! My family thoroughly enjoyed their dishes as well. The attentiveness and service was great even though it did take a little more time than normal to get our food. It was definitely worth the wait. We will be back soon and we are happy to have found our new go-to brunch spot!Highly recommend!! 5
These people overbook and are unprofessional. The stylists are working on two other people's hair while doing yours, which causes lack of concentration and poor results. One stylist I was passed off to for my blow-out because my stylist was too busy working on someone else, burned my head with the blow dryer! Beware!! 1
The water is shut off again this morning. At this point I don't know what else could go wrong. Rise on Apache is a joke. 1
I should have read the review prior to getting a hair cut at this place. I specifically told the lady "I'm trying to grow my hair long so do not touch the top" what she heard was" as soon as I look away please chop it in half". If you do end up going here please take a friend who could look over your shoulder. 1
Awesome for a quick bite downtown. Tiny spot, sometimes there's a lineup, but as of late the lineups are smaller. 4
Hey I wouldn't recommend that you have your honeymoon here, but for a last minute room when every casino is booked cuz of queen madonna, the worlds series of poker, and the air show... I'll give it a whirl since I still have fond memories of spending a whole day trying to win stuffed animals and walking 12 miles going around and around considering what to play.  (And i didn't want to stay off the strip)  For nostalgia, memories, or trying to be 12 again, I went upstairs to see if I still had the stuffed animal winning touch.  I was surprised to see that most of the same games were still there!  I concentrated on the Tic-tac-toe since it had the cutest and best price for a first win.  I'm not playing a game where you have to trade 15X to get something decent!  Hint, if you have a room they give you a book of coupons that let you play 2 for 1!  I played a total of 6x or $3.  I won twice!  I guess I still have it.  Hint #2 if your asian and your nice, the gamekeeper might let you lean over the table to float the ball in the right hole.  I got a blue bear and a pink bear that wears a "Property of circus circus hoodie".  Awww how cute!Regarding the rooms... Like I said it's no honeymoon suite, but my room was clean.  I'm a guy, as long as it's clean, i'm straight.  Strangely the lock on my room was broken and I only  realized it when I was leaving for Madonna.  Luckily I didn't have any valuables.  I called the front desk and they said they would send someone to fix it.  No one came and in the morning I called to bitch again.  I ended up talking to a sup and she sent a housekeeper to verify.  She thought I was one of those freeloading leeches that just bitches to get a free room.  Apparently there are alot of freeloading leeching customers.  The housekeeper opened the door while i was completely nekked trying to put my clothes on.  Apparently she didn't mind and just kept on messing with the door.  Finally I got my boxers on.  She left, the sup called me back and I got a free room.  Comped baby! 3
Just had lunch there. Ordered beef noodles and pork gamo. As a person coming from northern china, I found the gamo made here was barely a decent gamo, more or less just some leaven dough with very little pork stuffed. And it took about 20 mins for them to serve the gamo, when I have almost finished my noodles. And what's with the waiters' cold attitude to their customers? I hardly felt I was welcomed.An average place to have a bite of Chinese food with reasonable price. Far from a place to have a decent meal. 2
The fish is fresh and the portions are generous, but as is common with Chinese run sushi restaurants, they tend to put more rice in the rolls than the fish itself. The all-you-can-eat buffet menu has about 40 different types of rolls which are good, many of which have interesting made up names to them. The hot foods are also tasty too! The tempuras are crunchy and the variety of teppanyakis are scrumptious! The service was fast and the servers are all smiles and patient. Not bad indeed. 3
pros:love the bang bang shirmp!I love the mango salsa sauce on grilled fish. service was good.cons:the quantity is small. 4
Not quite A-OK, more like B-OK. Two and a half stars.  This is the worst store for selling products after the best-before date.  I slipped up yesterday (June 30/15) and brought home yogurt from there that was best before May 30/15.  Normally I am very careful because of the many, many times I've seen (and removed and/or pointed out) past due products on their shelves.  I've shopped here almost every day since 1996 because of the convenient location, the GREAT staff, and the pretty fairly priced, well stocked products.  I know they'd give me a refund if I'd kept my receipt but who needs the hassle of bringing stuff back ,,, and because of a perfectly avoidable error on their part? 3
It's an ok place to eat with good pricing but the food can be hit and miss.  Don't ask for variations of food they have on the menu because you will be disappointed. 3
Horrible service and over priced "gelato"All of the employees sit on their butt texting on their phone. Sometimes the guy that's mainly there that is tall and balding is usually not there when he's supposed to be. He's always messing around with the taco bell guys"Only 6 more dollars for one more scoop.." ya ok 1
Great food and fun vibe. But the service wasn't the best. The waitress could have been a little more attentive... I would have understand had she had a ton of tables but she had one other and much of the time she was sitting in a booth doing nothing. 4
The atmosphere is faux irish pub. The beers are slightly overpriced. All this could be forgiven if not for the terrible service. The waitresses were rude. Apparently serving customers was not part of their job description. Requests for service were repeatedly ignored and this cannot be blamed on a full crowd because the bar was half full at best.  Choose another spot for a truly friendly irish pub where the beers are cheap and everyone has to sing a song :) 2
I didn't know whether it would be fair to review THEhotel when they were ambushed by hordes of pre-teens attending back-to-back One Direction concerts. Being surrounded by "I love 1D" and "1D 4 Lyfe" shirts would be enough to drive anyone batty. So, I've tried my best to take these extenuating circumstances into account when thinking about my recent stay there.I hate to say that the first (bad) thing that hits you right as you step into the lobby is this...stench (which a previous reviewer delicately coined "STANK"). Now I know that a lot of Vegas hotels like to perfume their lobbies, but this took it to a whole other level. A friend summed it up best as "sewage mixed with cheap air freshener to cover the sewage". Another thing we encountered was a 1+ hour check-in line. Never have I had to deal with such a wait, anywhere - the line was at a standstill for most of the time. Now whether you work at a grocery store, a movie theatre, or a hotel, if you see a long line of customers growing steadily...wouldn't you call for reinforcements to help expedite? No? Maybe it's just me.The rooms were fine, and more spacious than what you get at a lot of other hotels. Each room has a separate bedroom and living area, a large washroom and a smaller powder room. However (and this may be the handiwork of the One Directioners), THEhotel was woefully understaffed and lacking supplies the weekend we were there. Not once were we able to get in touch with the front desk for anything. They also ran out of extra bedding, meaning the poor soul sleeping on the sofa had to use bathrobes and towels as blankets. One huge selling point of the Mandalay Bay / THEhotel complex is the huge pool area, complete with wave pool and lazy river. I suspect this is what gives it a much more "kid-friendly" vibe than other hotels, as there was very few adults-only areas available. That being said, I was happy to note that even on such a busy weekend, there were still empty chairs to be had and easy access to the bar, free water, and food. If given the choice, I definitely would not stay here again - unless I had kids. It wasn't the worst, but I'd rather stay at the Palazzo, Venetian, Wynn, or Encore any day, or Paris, MGM or Planet Hollywood for comparable pricing. 2
This place seriously needs to get its crap together! This is the second time that we have waited for over an hour for our sandwiches. Jimmy John's is directly across the street from my place of business. The tardiness is unacceptable. Please get new management. Or please get some delivery drivers that can make trips over to our office. I am seriously considering telling everyone I know here to not order from this place at all costs 1
A friend of mine invited me out for brunch to Jim's Coney Island Cafe.  I must have passed it a million times, but never really noticed.  The location is on the West side of Scottsdale road, just north of the freeway.  It's tucked beside an apartment complex and is a freestanding little restaurant.You seat yourself with choices ranging from seats at the bar to cozy two-seater booths to your more typical larger booths.  There is even room in the back for private parties.  Once I found an open booth, I was quickly greeted and supplied with beverages.We stopped in for brunch at about 10am on a Monday holiday, but judging by the depth of the menu, you can pretty much enjoy some good items at reasonable prices for lunch and dinner as well.  The cuisine offers Mexican, Greek and Polish influences.  I had to get the Greek Omelette.  It was a three egg omelette with large mushrooms, chopped tomatoes, gyro meat and crumbled feta cheese.  Side options vary from something healthy like cottage cheese to skillet cooked potatoes ("house fries"), which were nice.  My eggs were not quite warm enough for my taste, which I think had to do with the fact that we waited quite some time for the food to arrive.  The service was super friendly but not super fast, so I would come to this establishment when you have some time to kill. Nice ambiance, thumbs up :) 4
I usually love Chompie's, not today.. Service was bad, food was cold, when I order a HOT pastrami I like it HOT.. Fry's were cold too.. Had an appointment to get to or I would have had them warm my meal but the server was hard to track down and when she ask me how my meal was I told her it was not very hot and she told me its just suppose to be warm... Really this was not my first Hot Pastrami here... I don't like to complain but every thing about my $13.00 HALF  sandwich meal was terrible including the service.... 2
Headed here after a night at the movies after spotting it on the drive by.The prices are pretty standard for an asian dessert place, so when the total came to more than $30 it wasn't much of a surprise.Ordered the Matcha Sago with Red Bean and Mochi (~$6.45), Black Glutinous Rice with Mochi, Mango, and Coconut Milk (~$6.45), Mango Sago with Coconut Jelly and Mango (~$5.45), Mango Slush (~$5), Curry Fish/Beef Balls- 6 pcs (~$5), and Glutinous Rice Balls with Peanut and Syrup- 5 or 6 pcs (~$3.45).The taste overall for each of these items wasn't bad; was pretty good and not too the sweet. The matcha sago was a little bland, but oh well just won't order it next time. The mochi could have been a little better, because with these desserts I was expecting the boiled kind of mochi but they use the mochi you find at the toppings bar at frozen yogurt self-serve places. A little disappointed about that, but will also know to not order stuff with mochi in it next time.But the problem with each of them (minus the fish balls and the rice balls with peanut of course) was that they WEREN'T COLD ENOUGH. They were honestly only a little under room temperature, and that made them a lot less enjoyable than they could have been.But other than that, not bad at all! They don't seat many people but I go a seat right away on a weeknight. May come back again. 3
Wow, one must seriously wonder why Britney Spears or Nicky Hilton or the likes of them would want to hang out here? Perhaps celebs get better treatment or perhaps this is a new spot? The space was not much of an expansion from the previous Ra Club although they changed the entrance walkway and we were certainly not wow'ed by the interior or the music. For a Thurs evening with a rather full crowd, the DJ was playing old Usher, Michael Jackson and Madonna's Like a Virgin. We were glad not to have to pay the cover charge since we had free passes, thank gawd! Certainly not impressed, perhaps it's better on Fridays or Saturdays but I would certainly check out Mix or Pure or Tryst which are supposedly some hotter clubs... 2
Have been to the Garage twice now and they are batting 1 for 2.   Went there on a Saturday for lunch and the food and service was excellent.  I had the pulled pork sandwich with sweet potatoe fries which was original for pulled pork served on a pizza crust bun.  My girlfriend had the buffalo chicken salad which was really good, grilled chicken in buffalo sauce on top of baby greens.  Excellent beer selection.Went there on a Friday for happy hour and got there a little before 6, there was a 30 min wait for a indoor table or immediate seating on the patio, so we decided to sit on the patio.  Hostess sat us and said a server will be by shortly, normal procedure.  About 10 minutes later no server had come by and the hostess returned and asked us if we ave been helped yet, we said no so the hostess said she will get someone.  Another 10 minutes and no server.  It wasn't busy on the patio about 5 tables occupied, all with food and drink.  We decided that they must not want our business, so we went next door to Sushi Eye.Will try again, just won't sit on the patio. 2
We recently moved into the area, and when looking to order Chinese food our friend recommended this place. Let me tell you we Love it!! Food is delicious, we've ordered from them twice already and will continue to. The best part is they deliver to your home which is perfect when you don't want to drive in this AZ heat. lol 5
I was here while the owner was working. This random drunk girl clearly needed a ride home and I flagged the owner and asked him to help her get a safe ride home. He said "I've been here 16 hours, and I don't care. Find someone else." He should be shut down. 1
I wanted to treat myself to a fun gel manicure and decided to give this place a try. I looked through the photos posted on yelp by other customers and even on Nail Candy's Facebook and Instagram, and noticed that most of the beautiful designs were done by a technician named Hope. I called on a Friday asking for a same day appointment with Hope, but the receptionist curtly informed me that Hope was booked all day, and that the next available appointment would be on Saturday. I came in on Saturday early for my appointment, but still had to wait 20 minutes past my appointment time, even though the salon was empty. Furthermore, my appointment was not with Hope (she went out to get food), but with a technician named Felicia. During my nail appointment, the techs were all chatting about their love interests and were using vulgar language. I would not recommend bringing a child here. Beyond this, my actual nail art was STUNNING. I've received so many compliments on my nails. Felicia helped me choose the exact shape and design I wanted, right down to the colors. She seemed very excited to do the design I chose and was extremely friendly throughout the process. Although it took about an hour to complete, my nails looked gorgeous, AND they've lasted an absurd amount of time (FIVE WEEKS -- They even lasted through all the heavy lifting involved in moving into a new apartment. They're very grown out, but at this point I just want to see how long they'll last before starting to chip.) I did end up paying a pretty penny for them: $48 without tip. Overall, the customer service and price leaves something to be desired, but the finished product is everything you could ask for. 4
I usually love Panda Express but I won't be coming back to this one! The two ladies working were really rude to both me and my husband and were slamming our food and drinks down on the counter. One lady barely  put any chicken on my plate. I asked if she could put a little more. She said "I can for $1.50!". To top it off they barely spoke English. Ive never had an experience like this at a panda express. I won't be back here that's for sure! 1
Boyd's been putting blinds and shutters in my home and investment properties for over 10 years.  He has established a very solid customer-centric business.  I've never had any issues.  He communicates well, his pricing is competitive, and his turn time is always quick.  Let's go for another 10 years Boyd! 5
My daughter called to tell me her car will turn over but won't start at 4:30pm on a Friday. Problem, I live in Asheville she's going to college in Charlotte. Call AAA have the vehicle towed to this AAA service center. Then I see the reviews. I went into worry mode. I've managed auto part stores and have heard of horror stories. But I can't do anything being so far away, so I wait. Next morning I call them to hear the bad news, guess what Shane says the technicians started the car right up. Checked it out to make sure nothing else going on. He assumes that since the car was on an incline and had low gas that it wasn't getting enough fuel but everything was good. When I asked if I could give him payment over the phone, surprised again, he said not necessary that there was no charge. Thanks for letting a distant dad not have to worry. 5
I always pass by Strawberry Fields going to a nice Urbana restaurant or Schnucks, but I've only been inside a handful of times in over 5 years being in the area. Every time I go in, I never come out with anything because it's simply priced too high. It's not economical for a lot of people to purchase daily/weekly needs from this store.The selection of times is vast and it even has an extensive health food section which I didn't expect. However, due to my recent love affair with fresh baked breads, I decided to purchase a baguette from its bakery to see if I like it. The baguette was big and it only costed $2.45. I thought it would taste pretty good since it was fresh baked and all, but I was pretty disappointed after biting into a bland, thick and dry baguette. It was not crunchy but, rather, just very hard after I baked it. I needed to drink something while munching on it because it pulls all of the moisture out of my mouth and makes it hard to swallow. I tried eating it for the next few days with my boyfriend who also shared the same opinion on the bread and just ended up tossing half of it away. Not worth it even at just a few bucks.There are better places for fresh baked bread and more affordable places for organic foods. 2
I would actually want to give this place a 3.5, but am leaning more towards a 3 because we weren't wowed by this place and there are limited options on the menu.The menu is kind of small in my opinion, but it seems that most people go there for the mussels.  We started with Soup of the Day (which at this moment I can not remember, but was it was good!) and House Salad.  Both were slightly above average.  The main thing I liked about the House Salad was the dressing!Then we got the mussels in the Lobster sauce and braised short ribs.  Mussels were yummy and definitely be my choice if we came back.  The braised short ribs were a little disappointing.  It was cooked pretty well, tender and moist, but I didn't think the flavor was that good.They also carry Anchor Steam beer here, in case you're a fan of the San Francisco brew. 3
I'm sorry the food was so good I forgot to share before I eat! Hahaha,... #Anondo has one of the best #indianfood in town ever! #food #yyz #foodporn #tasty #nomnom #hungry #goodeats #letseat #silentsuspekts #ssmedia #yyz #toronto #lifestyle #design #fashion #media #socials #events 4
My favorite Mexican restaurant in the Valley, and there are a bunch of good ones here.  The atmosphere is a little schlocky but still cool.  The service is usually top notch, and the food is terrific.My wife gets the Salad Carbon - see the previous review.  I usually get the Pollo con Cheso - a chimi-style enchilada with a spicy white cream sauce.  Heaping portions with rice and beans that actually taste good.  5 Stars. 5
This used to be my favorite nail salon in Surprise.  But I think they changed ownership (in fact I saw that they changed ownership-- at least that's what they're advertising in the Surprise weekly).  Anyway, I received a white tip pedi from a new tech (female).  She did not paint even  lines.  And when I looked at my toes the lines were a mess and did not match one another.  Some were lower, some were shorter.  It's hard to explain but  my toes did not resemble one another.  I asked if she could fix the lines.  And she had to redo the lines and still couldn't get it right.Look, getting a pedicure is a service and I want it to look nice.  And the fact I'm paying extra for the white tip... I feel like they should get it right.I've been getting pedicures for years and have never complained.  Anyway, it was obvious I wasn't happy, the manager(?) Kevin came and looked at my pedi and told me it looked fine to him.  They know me at this salon.  I think even if they thought I was imagining the concerns (which I was not) I think they should have had another tech redraw the lines or comp something to make me feel valued.  Instead they made me feel worthless as a customer by telling me there was nothing wrong.So I got upset, passed on the manicure, paid for the pedicure and left.I've been going to this nail salon for years, I think 2 years.  They know me at this salon.  And to question me when I'm upset about something just doesn't make me happy.  I'm not going back to this salon. 1
I don't know why I come here. Their buy 1 get 1 promo is misleading. Buying toppings on top make it more expensive than Chatime and their staff have zero personality.  Chatime is busier for a reason. 1
Got a great deal through Amazon Local and Luxury Suites International. Stayed in Tower 2, made the trek to the MGM Grand many times via moving sidewalks. The nice thing is that the walkway ends up right at the MGM pool entrance, adjacent to the spa.The Signature vibe is very relaxing, with a gated entrance and valet parking. Funny thing, you can head towards the casino via the walkway OR exit through the front door of any tower...into the hot sun, down a lonely walkway, to a side street with no amenities. Very clever. Always steer the customer towards the gaming tables!!You should stay at the Signature for a relaxing change of pace. 4
I wish I could give this place 0 stars because it's not even worth 1 star.First off.....look them up to see their health inspections (http://www.maricopa.gov) and click on "Restaurant Ratings" under "Quick Links"  I don't know how this place hasn't been shut down! Look at the things the health inspector writes: black slime, black & orange mold, etc. Disgusting. This place should be closed down as it's a threat to public health.This is the 2nd time I have been there due to a birthday party being held there and I will never, ever again go. It's the most ghetto place I have ever been to. The employees are all kids who don't care, not one employee looked like they wanted to be there. All they did was grunt and look miserable.3 machines took my tokens. More then half the machines were out of tickets. The token machine was out of tokens and several other people were waiting as I was for tokens for at least 15 min. We were told the employees had to go empty out the machines first because they didn't have any other tokens. My son wanted to go on the train and carousel but there was no operator there. Other people were going up to ask to have someone come over and operate the carousel but no one ever came.This has to be the dirtiest, most disgusting place I have ever seen in my life. Trash was everywhere, you can tell they don't clean their equipment on a regular basis. When I took my son up on the carousel, it was wobbly which made me wonder how safe it was and how often it was checked for safety. I saw several employees actually wearing dirty, wrinkled up shirts.This place looks like it's literally falling apart. I simply cannot believe how dirty and disgusting it was there. Even the air felt stale. You couldn't pay me enough money to ever go back there again!! 1
My first experience was better here, now that I came back to check it out, I can't say the same. The place still looks the same but they changed chefs again. I would say that this time they need to change the cook or something if they want the business to be successful. I ordered the baby back ribs that comes with two sides. The ribs came in half slab, it was dry and salty. The mac and cheese tasted like it was the ones you microwave and the fried okra was blah (needs more seasoning). I have to say that the banana bread pudding was probably the only thing worth coming here for. But one of the items that caught my eyes was the frychos which is nachos and french fries. It sounds really yummy! As for the prices I think it is a bit too much since the food isn't that great. $20.99 for baby back ribs with two sides that isn't even that tasty. I don't think I'll be coming here again, if I do it's probably only going to be for the banana bread pudding and if they change the cook to a better one that knows what they are doing. 2
One of the best philly cheese steaks I've had.  Have not really had anything else from them, but when I order this is pretty much what I get.  They deliver and that is awesome!  Really great if you are looking for a philly cheesesteak.  They chop the meat up very small and diced though. 4
After seeing the reviews here, I'm really surprised, so I had to write my own! I went here for the first time a few weeks ago -  and WOW - sooo much variety!! Especially some of the more rare fruit trees... no way you could find those at Home Depot. Plus, they are grown IN Arizona. We purchased 4 plants - watermelon, 2 bell peppers (1 black, 1 blue), and one more (can't remember... possibly cantaloupe). Planted them when we got home that day, and they're doing fantastic. I'd say about 2.5 times the size as when we got them!! Admittedly, I was a bit worried because they looked almost half dead... maybe that's hence the other reviews, but they truly are doing great. They also have the most awesome playhouses, sheds, barns, even doggie houses (so freaking cute), and lots of garden accessories, like statues and fountains. The thing I loved MOST about this place was how much I learned just talking to one of the guys there! I asked a question about my dying lemon tree, and he gave me TONS of advice!! Extremely knowledgeable and honest... I can't wait to go back. And I WILL go back... I've got my eye on one or two of their fruit trees :D 5
That is correct. That was the first time I personally had to wait, but once in... all was forgiven. My go to Sushi is always the Caterpillar roll. 4
This place consistently has good deals on seasonal fruits and veggies. Pay for your fruits quickly at the fruit cashier in the north upper corner of the store, and everything else (including fruit) in their proper downstairs cash area if you are shopping for a bigger variety of food. They got everything - lots of seafood in the back centre aisle, meats in the back corner, vegetables on the left side (recently reorganized - much fresher space) and everything in between in the middle aisles. With the price of dried goods and other shelf stable stuff par for the area, I never go to Chinatown without going to this store. I don't want to miss a deal! 4
Not a South Indian style. If you are looking for some spicy food in the buffet, then this is not the place. Apart from mango custard, Idly and sambar nothing else is good as part of the buffet 2
Waitress was adorable and service good, but Sunday brunch took an hour to be served!  Perhaps they were short-staffed in the kitchen, but you would at least expect a manager to be out to apologize.  Everyone in the place looked unhappy and....hungry.  When the food did arrive it was decent breakfast food, but after so long of a wait, I'm not sure it really mattered.  Perhaps it was an isolated incident, but the lack of any managerial contact suggests a lack of professional management, or maybe they were so short staffed that the manager was busy cooking! 1
Convenience.  Convenience. Convenience.  Location, Location, Location... right in Birkdale.  Staff is helpful and friendly.  Store is clean.  Works for me. 4
The dinner buffet was disappointing. The meats at the carving station were okay, the sushi was sparse, and empty most of the time. Fried chicken was cold. We dined at 5pm and was expecting way more food.The selection was surprisingly small, not what you would expect for a high-end buffet. Definitely better off going to Bellagio or Caesars 2
First of all, I had a nice time swimming in the pool with no people around. The water was perfect temperature for me, so it was very relaxing. BUT the reason there was no people, is I am guessing because of the construction that was going on in the spa (on the upper level - didnt affect the pool area). I did not expect the construction and wasnt told on the phone when I was booking an appointment there. So here are the cons & pros:Pros: warm nice water, good steam room (even though very tiny - again because there were no people, it was perfect), very friendly personnel (EXCEPT for the manager - very rude!!!), nice rob and slippers, tea area with nice teas that you can make yourself, cookies, water, apples.Cons: RUDE manager who didnt want to address our concerns and was talking back at us. The clock is not working in the pool area, so there is no way of knowing what time it is (especially inconvenient if you have an appointment booked), construction on the upper level where I was doing my pedicure, a bit cold on the upper level, steam room is very small, and no water anywhere near the pool/steam room area. When we used the towels and wanted new ones, we had to ask personnel to bring them to us (wasnt enough in the pool area, an no one came by to check), water has a lot of chlorine, even though not supposed to. When we addressed our concerns with the manager, she didnt really want to do anything about it or give us a discount. For that price will not be coming back, which is unfortunate, because the personnel there is really nice and did a good job with my manicure. 3
One of the worst pho i ever eaten.. And its twice as expensive. Anyone wants pho, go six min to the one up the street. Cheaper and way more flavorful! 1
Order Ahi Tuna burger, cooked to perfection, switch coleslaw instead of fry, no problem w// staff, everything was excellent, service was great, had fry during last visit those were excellent as well 5
Fun but most games are 2.00 dollars to play and hard to win anything but penny toys with tickets. 2
What an outstanding group of cleaners. I am pleased every time. And the price is GREAT too! 5
Great food and very affordable prices!  Had the carnitas burrito and rolled tacos.  Everything was fresh and flavorful. 5
Love this little gem.  Great place to get top of the line meat and it's fresh.  I usually call in and pick up fillets.  That steak just melts in your mouth. 5
To be fair, the restaurant apparently has a new owner and is presumably under new management. So I do not know if things have changed but hopefully they have. 1
My stylist, Danielle, not only gave me a modern pixie- she taught me how to eliminate cow licks (sp?). She gave advice on the best products and hair dye solutions. I'll be back. I've been in Vegas 12 years and have finally found a stylist worth returning to. And the money? About $55 for a cut. Reasonable and excellence are a great combination. 5
Great food but I've gone 3 times in the past few weeks and they never have anything in stock. I tried to go yesterday but there was no rice left (white or brown), no chicken, and only 1 person working both food line and register. I'm going to give them another chance because I love the food but it's a bit ridiculous to never have any to serve. 3
Rooms were clean, and well accommodated, but the free internet was spotty at best; you could check your email, but streaming movies or videos was hit or miss.They had great shuttle service to/from airport, and nearby malls, but the places you can go are limited.Great staff, very helpful when dealing with requests. 3
Drive thru for hash browns and OJ. The lady was super efficient, which I loved.I noticed the drive thru line was quickly conquered by the morning team. Great job! 4
Have taken several cars to this place.  Always one time and it is fixed.  Recently had a noise issue.  It wasn't my transmission but they fixed it anyway and did not charge me because it was a simple fix.  Great service. 5
Deseret carpet cleaning- horrible dishonest company!!!!Everyone please stay away from this company.  They promise to clean my custom made curtain took money and returned curtain in even worse shape that was given to them! Refused to give refund, refused to give company address and supervisors name.  Unbelievable.   I don't know where to go or speak with.   Tel # they provided calling center #.   They steal your money and run. 1
I normally don't review, but the service here was superb! We came here for a birthday celebration and the service was amazing, food was excellent (sashimi platter was gorgeous) and the atmosphere was terrific. I highly recommend this resto. Good job guys. 5
For high quality and good selection of vinyl, this store certainly has plenty to offer for audiophiles and novices alike. 4
Happened to walk past this place and thought we'd give it try after seeing the beautiful patio. My boyfriend and I each had a margarita and split queso. It took FOREVER for someone to take our drink order. Once our food and drinks arrived we didn't see our waiter again for another 45 minutes. When he dropped off our check it took nearly 20 minutes for him to pick it back up (we timed it). Our incredibly mediocre food cost over $40. I can't imagine the cost or time it would have taken if we ordered a full meal. An absolutely underwhelming experience. 2
Commercials sound great. Can't even tell you whether they live up to their service standards because I couldn't get anyone to show up! Made an appointment and took time off work to be here. They never showed. When it got close to end of appointment window, I called and got an answering service who couldn't find any record and proceeded to ask me 3000 questions as if I had never spoken to anyone before...do you have a home warranty? etc etc. She said someone would call me back. They didn't. I gave them one more shot the following week and left my phone number for someone to call me back to reschedule. They didn't.  Don't fall for the friendly Duncan Goodrich ads...your customer service stinks, Duncan. You can keep the flashlight! 1
A nice cappucino with beautiful design. Breakfast food selection is limited with just croissants or strudel. Seating is limited with a few chairs and stools for the location. The chairs they do have are nice. Staff was very friendly. The aesthetic is rustic with distressed wood and ceramic tub to place used dishes in. A nice place to pop in for a few. 3
Visited The Highwood for the first time understanding it was a teaching restaurant. The price for a 5 course meal is very reasonable and the food is well presented/plated and of great quality. Our favourite courses were the butternut squash soup and the entrees (lingcod and gnocchi). Our only area of improvement would be that we would love to see the waitstaff explain what's on the dish a little upon arrival to the table. During our salad courses we were not sure the sauces being used and would have enjoyed an explanation. If you go here you need to be patient with the students and encouraging and remember we were all new to our roles once too. Will go back for sure! 4
I was hopeful for this restaurant because it is close, but I was extremely disappointed at the service. The waitress (who appeared to be an owner) seemed very rude as though she was rushing to get my party of two out of the restaurant. As we were standing up and leaving, she was already clearing our table. Keep in mind the restaurant was very slow and we were one table out of a total of three occupied tables in the restaurant. When I tipped the waitress and thanked her, she just replied "bye".  We were only there for less than 30 minutes and business was slow so I didn't understand her curt behavior. The sushi itself was unremarkable. The rolls tasted quite dry, which I am not used to. 1
Food was Good - that is where they get the two star rating. Everything else, a lack of communication and caring. First off, I understand that this a business, I get that. I really do. But when a company puts in a large order online, one would think that there will be checks and double checks prior to someone coming to pick up the order. This was not done. A part of the order was incorrect, some of it was missing. (I know that I am not entirely blameless, but before I left the restaurant, I asked and was reassured that I had a complete order.) Called the restaurant back with my issue, wait time was long (but I was calling at the end of a peak time, no fault there) and it will be delivered.  Ok, cool. 2 hours and 4 calls later, I found out that they did try to deliver the missing order, wrote the number down wrong to contact me. The Rep on the phone told me that the missing order was the left at the front desk - that was a lie, The Delivery Driver took it and left.  When I called, I was told that there was a shift change; they have no idea what is going on and hung up. At that point, I believe that we will not be ordering from this establishment in the future. TL:DR - If you place a large order from this restaurant, don't. Save yourself the trouble and go elsewhere. 2
I love finding places like this, and I loved what I saw when I walked in. They have a HUGE selection. Chocolates, doughnuts, all kinds of pastries, cookies, cakes, pies, cupcakes. It all looked amazing. I got some chocolates, a piece of cake, an eclair, lots of stuff to try. It just wasn't good. I really wanted it to be. But it wasn't. The piece of toffee I got crumbled apart, and tasted like pure sugar with no flavor. A Heath bar tastes better. The eclair was actually pretty good, but not great. The cookie was okay; it tasted like something you'd get in a crappy supermarket. The cake was terrible, covered in that gloppy, gritty Crisco-and-sugar icing, filled with a custard that tasted artificially flavored and waxy. I don't think it was a matter of a bad batch of goodies; it just tasted like they use sub-par ingredients to make them. Really sad. 2
Joso's definitely offers a unique dining experience. We always drove past it's beautiful patio and always wanted to try it. On our visit we were seated inside, very interesting decor all around will entertain you until your food comes. The menu is pricey but I would say worth the experience. You can pick and chose different things on the menu as you like. Staff is very helpful in making suggestions and extremely professional. The only negative for me was the smell of seafood. I know its asking for too much since this is a seafood restaurant but I hate the smell of fish while waiting to eat, it's kinda unappetizing for me. 5
Went to Joyride again tonight. Had the chicken burrito. ***AMAZING** That is one fine burrito. My wife and I each ordered a margarita. OOPS!!! Delicious, YES, but small and $9.00 each. NOT WORTH IT AT ALL!!!!! I will not order that again. WOW!~!! This is a 4.75 - 5.00 drink and it is really good but MASSIVE OVERPRICE. The service was excellent again. Definitely go to this place but, watch those drink prices. WHEW!!!! 4
For a five dollar car wash it's exactly what I expected. Does a good enough job and you can vacuum your car on site. Staff is nice and it's quick and painless. I recommend to everyone in the area for a quick, easy cleaning. 4
Please read full review before eating there. Food is great! No doubt about that and the price is excellent as well. You will have no server problems until the end when you're about ready to leave. & this is the reason I give it 1 star... Is because of the service from the "manager" and "cashier" that was received from them. The manager's name is Debbie I think and the cashier's name is Cathy. Debbie is just a rude manager but Cathy is something else! I've dealt with her 2 times already and 2 of the 2 times; I've never had someone give me such terrible attitude. I mean you do get terrible customers but I've never had such a bad vibe and attitude that Cathy has given. She needs to be retrained as an "employee." 1
I will be recommending Michelle to everyone I know with a newborn! The pictures she took came out better than I could have imagined. She had such patience with my daughter while waiting for her to fall asleep for the shoot, and seemed like she knew every trick in the book to calm her down. I don't think there would have been a situation that Michelle could not handle and still get amazing photos from. She truly exceeded my expectations. 5
Won't go back to this greenhouse either, the problem begins with parking and ends with service. You go inside and try to find something and finally seek some help and nobody knows anything. They will give you a pamphlet at customer service, offer no assistance and leave you on your own to find whatever it is you came there for, I've had better greenhouse service from stores that sell plants and aren't even greenhouses!  They think they're a conglomerate and have a bunch of 16 year olds looking pretty who don't know anything. 1
After standing and waiting for the hostess for 5 minutes as servers ignored us, the hostess finally arrived only to take the name of the group standing behind us.  Did not acknowledge our presence.  We left immediately after. 1
All I have to say is I changed my daughters dentist. First off they forget to call me when my daughters retainer arrived, they said I should be expecting a call 3 to 4 weeks. Okay 2 months past and still no call. I finally called and asked them about it so they but me on hold, umm yeah they couldn't find it. They call me back and asked if I wanted to set an appointment, of course I do since my daughter needed it to get her teeth pulled. That was the very last time she went there. Tips for finding the right dentist for your child: Make sure the place is kid friendly (Names will get you) Clean Staff is friendly Your child feels welcomed (there is nothing more important then finding the right dentist that makes your child feel comfortable) 1
Overall: Unless I was in the area, I wouldn't go out of my way to go back. Service: Our food took a while to arrive but they all came around the same time. Food: I liked the dosa and curries. My mango lassi was room temperature. 2
If I could give negative stars I would. I will NEVER, EVER go back to Danny's Family again!! For years my husband and I have been going to Francis & sons, but I was in a time pinch so decided to go to Danny's. I was unhappy w/ my one previous experience but decided to give them a second try. Next time, I'll drive the extra 7 miles to Francis and Sons!!First, when you pull up, they really push hard on their sales pitch. To the point of where you can't even get a word in to say no. And when you do say no, they don't take that for an answer! No should mean NO! This was the 2nd time I got an attitude when I didnt' want to upgrade to their BS services. I asked them to vacuum out my car seat because there were crumbs and was told they would. Lo and behold, the car seat was full of crumbs when they told me my car was ready. After telling the guy about it and him barely understanding my english, it literally took 5 minutes to try to get someone to come and vacuum the crumbs. If I was blind I could have cleaned the inside of my car better. My passenger window was spotted and the middle counsel where my gear shift is was so dirty that I had to wipe it off with my Huggies wipe. Finally a guy came back and instead of vacuuming the car seat, sprayed it with those high pressure air sprays they use to get the excess water off the exterior of your car. So the crumbs just basically flew everywhere in the back seat after that.These people are pathetic there, a complete waste of money. Soon, this will catch up to Danny's Family.....the way the treat their customers. I hope they all go out of business soon. 1
Came in Saturday around 1120, was told they were a bit busy and to come back at noon. No big deal, ran another errand. Came back at noon and waited 40 minutes for them to even take my car in for work. Lucky for them an oil change takes ~20min and we were able to get out about an hour after we arrived. Great customer service as always but not impressed today with the time it took. 3
Place is funny, bartender was telling this guys wife some very crazy things he was going to do to her....not for the light hearted. 3
Food was relatively tasteless, some was served cold, some overcooked so it was tough. I won't be back. 2
Teriyaki chicken tasted like rubber. Water tasted like kerosene. Very expensive for a buffet..more expensive than Golden Corral.. and mostly seafood. 2
I was not impressed with this place.  My mother had the shrimp which was pretty good, but I had a bruschetta pizza, and it was insanely salty.  I actually put a lot of salt on my food and it was too much even for me.  We did not get bread with our meal although everyone else seemed to.  I ordered a glass of wine and I could tell that the bottle had been open for too long.  The waiter that was serving us went home half way through the meal.  The pie was from a freezer and cold.  We ordered regular coffee but it was made with an espresso machine and was far too strong! 2
I ordered online for pick up and it was ready before i arrived 13 minutes later.  That's great considering I've waited almost 30 minutes in drive thru at a fast food resturant before having to be to work. I ordered a complete meal for my fiance and i, & it was very good. The only reason i am not giving a 5 star is because the woman i dealt with when i ordered an extra pastry upon my arrival, was very ride,  & seemed irritated with the fact that i wanted more food. . In turn spending more money. But whatever. My steak & cheese panini was amazing, along with my chicken & rice soup. Of course i got a blueberry muffin as well. 4
No matter how many times I've been here or called - the front end staff are completely incompetent, disinterested and downright rude. This actually stops me from booking appointments with my favorite massage therapist. 1
Worst customer service ever!!! There was a bald man at the counter who was so rude, that I swear that I will never go here again! Even the people in the kitchen are so rude!! 1
Very clean gym with LOTS of equipment! The staff is great, especially Sarah! Happy to be a member. 5
Brandon is one cool cat, and will take the time to learn about what you intend to play and then assist you in finding the right axe for your style. On request, he'll even put down some solos to your chord progressions to hear the groove of two pieces at once. Great guy, working hard at a real good guitar shop. They're much more about moving big gear versus little gear but that's no big whoop to me; the six-string and bass selection is not to be outdone by any shop in town. If you want a big name gitbox: Do some light research online, check each one of them out by noodling at Guitar Center, and then take some cash and go get a sweet deal on that same instrument from Brandon at Bizarre. 4
I just wanted to write an update because I finally stopped in for lunch and I was very underwhelmed. Portions seem to be much smaller for sandwich and salad items, which is disappointing. Our turkey sandwich had very little meat (but lots of lettuce) and the country potatoes were cold when they arrived. (I knew the potatoes would be a mistake!) And the San Fransisco Spinach Salad, while served on a giant plate, is very small when you realize that the plate only has a very thin layer of spinach and very few toppings. At $8.95 it would be nice if it came with a few pieces of meat as well. Oh and even the fruit cup you can add for $1 was smaller today at lunch than it was last week at breakfast!  I'll stick with breakfast at The Good Egg. 2
This smoke shop is a rip off place! Bought a G5 pen but was given the wrong defective one. Did not want to give a refund and insist  no return on any purchase on the store even though there no sign about the policy.The owner took the product and just told me to dispute the charge on my credit card. Total jerk and asshole!!!! 1
First time and it's very delicious the service is nice and the overall theme reminds me of the old days 4
I placed an online order. The sauce was out for my jerk chicken bowl. Instead of calling like their website advises they will, they made it and asked if I wanted ranch instead? I was also missing two sides from my order. The food itself was tiny for the high price and generic tasting. The chicken was obviously frozen and nuked. 1
Disguising! Flys all over the place including on the food they were trying to serve customers, dirty floors and tables rude manager. Asked for my money back, I almost threw up. I have never seen a more filthy restaurant! 1
We used them for some electric work, not only was the cost outrageous the work was not done properly.  I also felt they treated us very rudely. I would not recommend this company 1
Service sucked!!! They take your order right away and then disappear. They reappear a year later with the bill in hand. Never checked in on us to see if we needed anything. When flagged down and asked them for something they make it seem like you just asked them for their first born child. Food 5 stars service 2 stars. 3
Dooooo NOT go here. They will LITERALLY take your money. I went with a group of friends on taco tuesday/final basketball game, which i understand gets super busy but a good server doesn't make excuses. My server was very nice but never refilled my ONE glass of water and took her THREE times to bring me a lemon wedge (by the time she brought it I was 2 tacos in of my 3). Finally, my total came to $8.20. I was the only one of my 6 friends paying in cash so i put a $10 bill and .80 cents down. She came back and gave everyone else their cards and walked away! She still owed me $2 and she just took them! I honestly wasnt even going to tip her but LUCKILY FOR HER she got to STEAL my $2, way to go Kenadee! 1
We've been going to Dr. AUTO for years with all of our auto needs. They are extremely "Honest" which is of utmost importance If something is not to my satisfaction, they will do whatever they need to do to make it right.Josh, Marti, and the entire crew have our trust. They will have our continued business. 5
This place is great! Very delicious food with very great service. Some of the best Indian food I have found in Toronto!! I would do take out though, not a lot of seating and it seems to be where cab drivers hang out. 4
Brought a flash drive to have them make copies.  Simple single sided copies.  I was told it would be .15 per copy because they had to go in and pull the files off the flash drive....  I arrived and they charged me .20 per copy because they had to "manipulate" the copies (no phone call to get my approval) and then they charged another $37 plus for the manipulation.  Seriously?  I had over 1600 copies.  She told me some were turned upside down.  I didn't ask they be all right side up.  We go through the documents when we do a review.  Some how it went from .15 a copy to well over .20 cents a copy without my approval or consent.  The additional charge of $37...still don't know what that was for.I have had this company do all my copies and business printing work for over 8 years.  A call and approval was in order.  I'll be now taking my business elsewhere.  Greed seems to have set in with them. 1
Perfect on the drop off of rented tables and chairs but when it came to pick up on the Monday morning absolutely useless. My wife and I took a day off work with the plan that we would go out for the day once these people had picked up but when I hadn't heard from them by 11.40 I decided to call. The response was we are running behind schedule because Monday's are always busy but we should be there in another couple of hours so there goes our vacation day wasted. I would not recommend this company. 1
Finding good pizza in the south is a tough task. Though i dont think this is it. I do think that they make a pretty good pizza. Their sauce is something to be desired. But overall a decent pizza. They also have some standard amricanized italian dishes that are tastey and hit the spot but again nothing special. Depending on the time and day families are rampant, and can be tough to be seated on weekends. Prices are right above that borderline cheap but good range. 3
Just finished a floor install for my entire house, Rustin and the crew were awesome, very professional. My floors look great. 5
Drove all the way from the NW at the recommendation of a friend. Maybe the only Roberto's in town that has Carne Asada Onion Rings. Someone needs to tell the owners they should have that at ALL locations so I dont have to drive so far next time. Came around 3 in the afternoon on Monday and the placed was packed with kids so I ended up taking order to go. Other than that, same great late night eats as other locations! 3
The Span ish was one of the most amazing things I have ever tasted. The patty add egg was also next level deliciousness. This place is a pure gem! 5
We had a terrible experience at smelly dog. We take our dog to get groomed regularly. This was our first time trying smelly dog and they completely butchered our dog. We have specific directions for how we would like her to groomed. They said it would not be a problem. When we returned to pick up our dog she was groomed in a completely different manner than we requested. The woman at the front desk said she "didn't think the groomer cut her as we requested." When we asked for the groomer to fix it they refused. I am absolutely disappointed that groomer refused to cut her as we had asked. Not to mention the total cost was 100 dollars. Needless to say this was not a good experience and wouldn't recommend anyone taking their beloved dog there to be groomed. I do have to add that when we contacted management about the grooming the management did refund us out money. And therefore I am change the rating from one star to two stars. 2
Been to this store twice. First time was to check out selection. Didn't really find anything too great or worth buying for myself or my 2 daughters. Second time was to sell... Now that was a huge joke!  Had almost new and new high end clothing and shoes and after an hour of waiting they only offered to buy one shirt.. Now the whole time I was waiting I was checking out the clothing they had. I can tell you they had no idea what to buy and sale. Joke..just a joke.. Just go to Ross and sales etc to buy and don't bother to bring in items to sale to them. 1
Such a cozy and cute coffeehouse! For my first time here some regulars behind me suggested a Dirty Chai, half sweet/half spicy. AMAZING! I've had chai tea lattes at many coffeehouses but never a spicy one. The heat is just the right amount. It comes up unexpectedly too. I think it's cayenne, among other spices. GREAT SERVICE. Michelle is so friendly and chatty. I'm so happy with my experience. I can't wait to be back. I wish it were closer to me!! 5
Just like a regular theater nice service, clean, and previews are 15mins long. So if you're running late or even if you wanted to grab some snacks before hand: you got 15 mins. 4
I had an amazing time here. They were very busy but service was GREAT. ALL EMPLOYEES were making a team effort to acknowledge every guest, and were very engaging. We ate at the bar which I feel gave us a better experience as first timers. We ordered about 7 items and I absolutely loved every single one of them. The fish (entree) and oyster rockefellers were my favorite. The food came out one after the other and on time. I love when I don't have to wait too long for my food on a busy night and still have it come out presentable and taste amazing. I didn't get a chance to try their sushi BUT I'm coming back here with my girlfriends after they saw my post! See you again, soon! 5
WOW just WOW! What an incredible staff this place has. I am a first time buyer and this place couldn't of made me feel anymore comfortable and secure in the purchase I made today. My car salesman was Stuart Wilfer and he worked with what I wanted in a car and with how much I was able to spend. He treated me as if I were his own daughter making sure I got the best that I could. I then moved onto the financing dept. to meet with Ron which is probably one of the best human beings I've met in a long time. He has such an inspiring outlook on life and I am truly blessed to have gotten the chance to meet him. He also took care of me as if I were his own. I'm pretty good at reading people and getting an understanding of what people's intentions are and these two men's  intentions was to only give me the absolute best and to see me happy with my first big purchase. They didn't look at me as if I were just another buyer, but they really took the time to break it down and gave me as many options as they could. These men have integrity and are amazing human beings, but most importantly they have good hearts. So thank you again Stuart and Ron, you made me one blessed lady. 5
We order 2 plates chilly chicken, but it is so hard to find chicken in it.  They cooked it with 75% of onions,  capsicum and 25% of chicken.  They should change dish name, it should be "chilly capsicum" instead of "chilly chicken".  Worst dish!!! Don't ever order chilly chicken here. 1
Totally looked up car washes on a whim and this was the closest. Super cheap, super fast which is just what I was looking for. Felt like I got a great deal for the wash at 13.99 plus tip. While I went thru the car wash in the vehicle they then cleaned the inside while I went into pay. Great service and great job 4
I went here for lunch on a business trip at a customers request, and while it wasn't disappointing, compared to the other amazing food in Vegas, it was just ok. I had the burger (French Restaurants make the best burgers) and it was delicious. The fryer was broken so it came with breakfast-type roasted potatoes, which weren't very complementary. For dessert I had a scoop of vanilla ice cream with my french press coffee over the top, which was amazing. My primary gripe with this place is how old it feels. The dining room we ate in felt like someone's Grandma's house, and not in a good way. The formalities like table scrapping were nice, but seemed forced and awkward. Especially because the only other table had kids and they were running and screaming everywhere.If you're desperate for French food, go for it.  Otherwise, there are way better restaurants in Vegas. 3
I called this company.  They were friendly & scheduled an assessment with us.  I took the day off of work to meet them only to have them not show up.  When I called to find out where they were, they said their corporate office was down so they "lost" all their appointments.  We rescheduled and my husband took the day off only to have a 2nd no show.  They then sent us an email thanking us for our business.  The experience was very disorganized, and I wouldn't rely on them to actually show up!  No thanks.... 1
You say "fried potatoes" and I'm interested! While I've not been to Belgium, I do consider myself pretty knowledgeable when it comes to fries, frites, and chips, and I've got to say these are different from any I've had here in town.Thick-cut, almost meaty, skin on frites tossed in seasoned salt, served hot and fresh. Could it get better? Add some "game day garlic" sauce or malt vinegar, and yes, it can. I loved the garlic sauce-- thick and flavorful. Also tried the beer cheese dip made with PBR, served warm, which was good. You could really taste the beer!My friend and I thought picking up an order of frites would be a good side to our lunch, but really they could be a meal in themselves.The atmosphere is nice and clean. The tables have holes for you to set your paper frite cone in, which is awesome. And they're working on implementing an automated ordering system which is pretty cool.We met the owner (and her mom) and they were both so very nice! I am excited to go back soon! 4
This is not a sushi joint so don't go expecting sushi though they do serve some.  Nagasaki Grill is about as close to a Japanese Ramen/Udon/Soba shop as you'll find in Arizona.  The owners are friendly and they even have the summer seasonal cold Saimin noodle dishes I like.  My favorite dish is the Champon, it's a huge bowl of rich broth w/ ramen like noodles, napa cabage, and pork belly slices. It reminds me of my dads cooking. 4
Nice place.  Reasonable price.  Some of the staff might not have the most perfect English.  But mostly understandable.  As most guys probably don't need anything super elaborate this should be fine.Cheers, 3
Ok, so we were trying to go to overeasy and didnt realize that the hours were different in Scottsdale and Phoenix.  Soooo, we just wanted anyplace to eat and since this was next door, we settled.  BUT, I gotta say, we were surprised.  Both of us were happy with our sandwiches and the sides (I had roasted potatoes, he had green chile mac n cheese) were GREAT!  I was pretty happy that we made the mistake on hours and ended up here.  If I lived in Scottsdale, Im sure I would come here lots to watch hockey and have a good bite. 4
Say the word lobster and I'm sold! Lobster Me you had me at Lobster ice cream...I know it sounds kinda weird that lobster can be mixed with ice cream but the crazy part is that it tasted pretty good. My cousins and I were walking the mall and I noticed the words Lobster ice cream free sample. So hey why not take a crazy chance and try something different. We ended up ordering it and we all shared. Of course it was $8.50 for a small ice cream but it was worth the try. The second time I came was to try the food; my bf and I decided to get the Lobster Mac n Cheese and the Lobster Bisque. Yum! The Lobster Mac n Cheese was not bad it could use a little bit more sauce. The Lobster Bisque was delicious especially in a bread bowl. I definitely want to come back here and try everything! Especially the lobster shooters, yes I said lobster shooters with Vodka! 4
Upon my husband's and my arrival we were met with a hostess with an attitude.  We could sit outside immediately or wait for 25 min. to be seated inside. Which would have been fine but we asked about the empty table right behind her and she said, "oh, I didn't know it was available and showed us to the patio while we waited 10 min for the empty table inside. Why? it was already ready? After being seated we waited at least 10 min before we were acknowledged at our table.  Finally, we were asked what drinks we would like and that took another 10 min. And, then, my husband asked for bread and olive oil which also took another 10 min and had a "dollop" of olive oil. Our waitress never asked us if we had any questions re: the menu, once we ordered she never came back to ask if we needed anything else or if the food was to our liking.  Food is fresh and tastes good.  The portions are smaller than most restaurants but we did not find that a problem.  We shared the fennel salad, both had a main course, a glass of wine each and our bill was $70! Now that is expensive, especially when the restaurant's service is way below expectations for this chef's restaurant. The food is not worth the price, the service is awful and there too many other options in the valley to choose from. We won't be back and will not recommend it to anyone. 3
Had a bad feeling. Wife keeps commenting on the bad cut. Oh wells. Lesson learned. Don't matter if the twenties keep coming in. Save yourself, go find a real barber shop after the hair grows back a bit. 1
Great sashimi.  Thought I'd test the so called "world class" tuna melt, like there really is such a thing, but if one wants to use great tuna then possibly,  but otherwise not world class by any  means except the tuna, which great, but then really just a great piece of tuna between 2 sliced of bread.... Hard to beat a "real" tuna melt folks!  Especially for the price! 1
Cheap and right down the street, but they don't take appointments. Ann is great for eyelashes though, the best in central Phoenix. 3
Decided to take the family for a late Saturday breakfast .  The waffles were quite tasty, and the fruit toppings were fresh.  Great selections and variety.  The place had a "local" moms/pops feel to it which was nice.  The breakfast waffle came with eggs and choice of meat...and unlimited coffee.  My daughter ordered the Yooni special which was so yummy- strawberries, bananas topped with chocolate sauce and a large scoop of vanilla ice cream, almost too pretty to eat!  My son devoured a plain waffle topped with powdered sugar and whipped cream (we added bananas for a small add'l charge).  Pros:  Variety, taste, fresh fruit, price and friendliness of staff. Cons:  Waffles were kind of cold, no refills on soda (cans)Overall, it was a good experience. 3
I have been here three separate times since the opening less than two weeks ago, specifically for two different loaves of bread that had been recommended by friends, and I was excited to try each. Every time the service is extremely slow, but I understand the process is a little slower for better quality food from scratch. I've been satisfied with the food itself but each time I have been, the customer service has progressively been worse. Today was the breaking point and I have already contacted management. I went through the drive through today for the first time and someone named Vesta (even though my receipt says Kaydon, so I am assuming she lied to me?) was absolutely horrible. I got to the window and started to ask what the loyalty card was that I had been given my previous trip (no one ever explained it to me). She rolled her eyes and stuck up her pointer finger without saying a word apparently to shush me? Then took my cards out of my hand and closed the window without a word. I was frustrated by this but held my tongue. When she gave me back my cards I started to ask again, and AGAIN she simply closed the window without even an acknowledgement that I had spoken. When she finally brought out my food almost a full 5 minutes later, I was fed up and told her that I had tried to ask her a question twice and I don't appreciate being ignored. I asked her what her name was and she hesitated, then told me it was "Vesta". I told her I would be contacting her manager and she laughed, said "thanks" sarcastically, and proceeded to close the window and refused to open it again. Long story short, the food is pretty good when they haven't run out of certain breads half way through the day, BUT the service is horrible. "Vesta", you need to learn that your customers are your most valuable asset. Without them you wouldn't be working. So try a littler harder next time, because you never know who the next person may be that you mistreat! 1
I must say that I'm disappointed with Alexander Michael's. For the most part, each time I've dined there I've enjoyed the food. I'm a huge fan of the veggie burger and fries, and the prices are reasonable. The space is great, and I adore the 4th Ward neighborhood. In fact, I live there. That said, I've been consistently underwhelmed with the quality of service that Al Mike's delivers to its patrons. On a couple of occasions I've felt as though the server did not really care much about my dining experience. As an example, recently I went with a friend who explained to the server that she was gluten intolerant and order the GF pasta. Despite that, her pasta came with two slices of bread on top. To me, that seems like something that should have been considered, and if it was an honest mistake, that would have been ok. However, the server acted as though it was preposterous that she asked for another plate. She was extremely disrespectful despite the fact that my party was respectful towards her. I really want to like and enjoy this spot and I think the food is great, but the experience of eating out is 100 percent framed by your service and on a couple of occasions it's been subpar to horrible at Al Mike's. 2
I get take-out 3x a week as I work close by - it's so fresh and healthy (they even offer low fat sour cream).    I've tried every burrito place in the downtown core and this is my favorite as it's always fresh and fast.    Line ups are long but move fast ....longer wait for the burritos but super fast if you get an inside-out burrito (no fajita) or a salad (same but with more lettuce and dressing on side) 4
Bland, boring, slightly overpriced food - how perfectly fitting for the Yonge/St. Clair corridor.  Harsh, maybe, but I have given Freshii many chances and have never failed to be underwhelmed.    It's healthy, I suppose, but just not very good. 2
The food is good in general.  More of the Americanized version of Mexican food.  On the heavier side for food.   While the food is good, the restaurant lacks ambience - a few American movie posters in Spanish.   The service was very, very slow. 3
Local, friendly, tasty and community minded! This place is very low key and welcoming with a great selection of caffeinated beverages. The staff and the owners are also very cool with supporting their local community charities and go above and beyond to help out however they can. Has been a neighborhood favorite for myself, my coworkers, and friends in the Arcadia area. We especially like the punch cards! 5
Brio is one of the nicest places in Town Square, especially when you can seat outside. I was there at  least two times a week but recently they reduced the menu and left out some of my favorite meals. So disappointed... 3
Every time we went in there weren't many people; which was fine for us. You seat yourself and your server will usually come quickly. Nice and clean from what we could see. Friendly staff. Some of the bread was a little hard, but it wasn't the end of the world. We still ate it. We liked the environment so we will likely be back. 4
Had the shrimp cocktail inside the coconut with a Mexican coke. Comes with a side of saltine crackers & some super hot chili sauce- waitress warned me that though delicious one should be cautious with it. It comes with a good amount of shrimp which tasted as fresh as it can get in Arizona. My total bill was about $22. On another note, the restaurant has an old jukebox with a good selection of Mexican music. Don't be shy about asking for the volume to be turned up as the jukebox is somewhat hidden in another room & it's hard to hear. In addition they have a small garden in the back that I love to sit in as it reminds me of my grandma in Mexico. 4
Food was weak and overpriced. The risotto was like soup and the sangria was made with canned fruit. 2
I have 2 parakeets, the staff was very knowledgable and directed me to a great trainer and had great info on parakeets. Even the good and the bad. Plus with your Petperks card you get great discounts it makes the prices very reasonable. And they always have the items I need I stock. 5
I have a love/annoyed relationship with this place.  The love part is it is at the end of my street, about 10 seconds away.  The annoyed part is every time I go in there I end up spending $20 on like 2 or 3 items.  However, as a person with food requirements their selection of organic, vegan, wheat free, dairy free, etc is excellent.  It is always the same friendly guy working there and he is always suggesting new things to try, the last being tofu bacon which now makes a tomato sandwich a real treat!  I wish I could shop here full time but the reality is I just can't afford it.  I do visit occasionally as they stock a few of my dairy free staples and the location is just too convenient for me to ignore. 3
Great pub. Going to check out the Fleetwood Mac tribute on Oct 25. They've had rave reviews and they're based in Mississauga. Band is Fleetwood Mix 4
All depends on when you go.  The course itself speaks for itself ( top notch) however I went Sunday afternoon and it was only $60, then went again Wednesday morning and it was $160.  So I recommend check the times for your price range. 3
Never again.  I went to get a massage to relax- the place was so noisy- what with the reception radio coming thru the walls, a car idling below with hip hop coming thru the window and two ladies who worked there- talked in rapid-fire foreign language outside the door for up to 10 minutes at the top of their lungs- I know it wasn't urgent- cause they laughed in between their non stop talking- so it was pure discourtesy to be doing that outside a door of someone getting a massage.  The receptionist seemed like she never smiled in her life and the masseuse seemed bored and was either too hard or too soft.  Plus there was a heater in the room but she didn't turn it on so it was drafty.  The area of town was all high traffic and concrete and hard to read the number signs so I had to drive around a bit to find it- the oppositte of the relaxing treat I sought to find.  I don''t recommend. 2
Outstanding selection of beers including some local IPA and Double IPA that I strongly recommend if you like high hops and IPAs.  Dawren and the other barkeeps can draw them off for you.  Have eaten meals there many times and the food is always good as well.Have visited there many times over 12 years of annual trips and it's always a good visit. 4
My go to Chinese restaurant. Very convenient location. Food comes very quick.  Just avoid coming on their busy hours. Their steamed whole fish was actually good. I prefer their fried squid tentacles better than in the other congee restaurants. 4
Wish I could give zero stars. This is without a doubt the worst experience I ever had at a nail salon anywhere! I had a 12:00 appointment for a manicure before an afternoon wedding. I was told to wait and after twenty minutes when it became clear I would not have time to wait any longer I politely asked to borrow some polish remover so I could do my own nails back at my hotel. The man who I assume is the owner angrily yelled "No!" WTF? He said "you have to wait. All these people had 12:00 appointments too." Why give so many more appointments than you can accommodate????  TERRIBLE SERVICE! 1
After reviewing Port City Club a few days ago based on an excellent lunch, I had dinner there with my wife on a busy Friday night.  Obviously the place is doing very well, because the restaurant was packed.  But, to accommodate its popularity they have lined tables up ridiculously close to one another.  We had tables on either side of us that were 14-15" away.  We were unable to carry on any kind of private conversation.  The waiters either reach over the person sitting with their back to the room, or squeeze between the tables with their butt hanging over the table.  I have never seen anyplace, even in New York City, put tables this close.  Maybe the crowd indicates that customers are willing to put up with this, but I am not.  I might try a weeknight to see if that is more comfortable, because the food is very good, but this was not a good experience. 3
OMG never again, the quality of food had went down way way down and to top it all of they charge for soft drinks refill?really???i asked for lemon wedges and they brought out lemon that was squeezed and placed back on the plate.  The table was sticky, the new look for the menu is nice well that if it was clean I had dried sainted pages, washing your hands is a must. I'm being generous enough to give them one star, over priced crappy food. 1
Me and my girlfriend went to go eat there for lunch on a Wednesday. We sat down in the bar area. There was maybe 10 customers in the whole place. For about 7 to 10 min no one said hi, or anything. They made eye contact and would walk right by you. Just poor customer service. I could understand if it was busy but it was a ghost town and I could see the workers on there phone. 1
I've spent almost 2 years here and just wanted to give a solid review before I move to another state. I think this is one of the best apartment complexes in the Vegas area. The property is attractive and immaculate. Apartments are modern. It's all set on a golf course with views of the strip. Within 3 minutes you can be to Whole Foods, Starbucks, banks or the Freeway. You can get to strip in a good day in about 10 mins. The one and only downside is you can hear your neighbors pipes and stuff, but isn't that every apartment. Yes, your rent might go up after your lease, but again, that's typical. 5
When i get home, and say to myself "I could've done better" and then go get my cuticle clipper to clip spots they missed, it is not a good manicure. I have been to Rainbow Nails twice. It's in a convenient location for me, so i really wanted to like it... But the manicure is simply not very good. I gave them 3 stars because the staff is nice. 3
Man, this place is the bomb. The fact that it exists in Solon and not one of the other 'burbs makes it even better, as that town's ample workforce can definitely use a good healthy lunchtime alternative to the droves of chain restaurants that line Routes 43 and 91. The restaurant occupies a small spot in the Giant Eagle plaza and is surrounded by several storefronts that at the time of this writing are unoccupied. People of Solon: SUPPORT THIS PLACE! It's family-owned and the sweet ladies that work the place will remind you of your one Eastern European aunt that derives bizarre amounts of pleasure from watching you stuff your soup hole with spoonful after spoonful of steaming hot goodness.The homemade soups rotate in and out seasonally and are divided into hearty and lighter sections on the menu. They also have tons of veggie and gluten-free options. These soups are WAY better than the ones found at the Zoup! down the street. The wraps and sandwiches are pretty good as well, though not as outstanding as the soups. C'mon, what are you waiting for?! Get off your duff already! 4
Four girls squeezed into a booth. Cue a "movie" waiter. My friend named our waiter as someone you would see in a comedy movie or sitcom--talkative, funny-ish, and always popping up at random times for small chat. Needless to say, our server was very attentive (e.g., good at recommending/not recommending dishes, clearing the table). He skated the *annoying* line very closely, never crossed it though so hurrah.Food got thumbs up from us: Med. pizza (really delicious and big for $9), Bison burger (fries were a hit), jambalaya, and dopple chop (it was good, but pricey at $20 for what is received). Drink-wise: Belgian pale ale (ugh, no. a bit of an off-taste), torched cherry caiprissima (too much lime juice for me, but my friend loved it), and don juan (nice). Overall, a good experience.  But not a place I would have cravings for or feel the need to re-visit. It felt like a safe night-out dinner. Plus you can wear what you'd like, I saw fashions of all kinds without much judgment. 3
Just joined this gym a week ago...not impressed at all. The one in Scottsdale seemed to be ran a lot better when I was going to that one. I've come here every day, the spray bottles to wipe the machines and weights have been missing twice, this is unacceptable. I don't pay a fee to come use a machine covered in someone else's sweat. I can understand if a bottle needs to be refilled but to have NO way to clean the machines is unprofessional. I know I would never recommend this gym to anyone else.  I cannot wait until I move...I hope the Walnut Creek location is better than this Tempe one!! They got a star for being open and another for air conditioning. Not much else here. 2
My wedding, the BIG day that I have waited 33 years to say YES to.  My soon to be sister in law introduced me to Kaira's as she had bought her dress here - she raved about it and on first visit we were thrilled!  I found my dress, the price was right and I was a happy bride.The owner was polite and helped me with everything on my first visit, she let me know my dress could be "rushed" to come in three months from then and told me the day to call to follow up.  When I called on them on the designated day I was informed my dress was slated to come in AFTER my wedding and to their credit it was an error and was resolved verbally about 48 hours later.My fitting was a disaster - when I originally tried on the dress I had requested changes be made with the owner (a new sleeve) and she informed me it was "no problem" only when it came time to make the changes it was a problem - the sleeve was never ordered and it was apparently my fault.  After being told it was "very expensive" by the owner (again) it was resolved when I told her plainly that this was what I wanted, spare no expense and let's make it happen.Today I went to pick up my dress - I was so happy! The seamstress who did the alterations is FANTASTIC!  I was simply delighted.  After thinking my balance was pain in full (over $1300 which was reasonable in my mind) an associate asked me if I had PURCHASED a garment bag to take the dress home in!  As a former pageant girl this was so obnoxious that they would not include a $10 bag with a $1300 dress?  Even better - if there is an extra charge let your bride know in the beginning - after all was said and done I ran my credit card THREE TIMES!The resolve I have is that I have my wedding dress, it is splendid although I would save myself the headache and NEVER shop there again. 2
The mall is just ok, typical mall stores. They are doing some remodeling which helps, but our biggest complaint is the only sit down restaurant is pretty much Johnny Rockets which needs a serious visit from the health department. Very sad for being the only mall on the west side. 2
Restaurant was busy for a weeknight and we figured that was a good sign. Checked Yelp and it appeared positive. Had the Manchurian noodle with shrimp, chicken pakoras and chilli chicken. Service was quick. Pakoras came out first... At least that's what we ordered. Not sure if I would call what the hard, round tennis balls, brown, almost black, mostly breading things, pakoras... But okay. Taste? Just like I expected. Not good. I thought maybe the just burned out batch. Nope. That's how they all looked when I looked around the room for other patrons who ordered "pakoras". Manchurian noodles were drenched in oil. A lot of oil. Slippery couldn't hold them on chopsticks oily. The dish as mostly noodles - no veggies and shrimp were tiny. Chilli chicken was also a greasy mess.  The only thing that they didn't mess up was the rice. Oh and the Coke that I ordered. The only "positive" thing was that portions were huge. Enough for us to take home for lunch and dinner the next day. Not that we wanted to eat it again. 2
Guac was amazing!  The charge for their water filtration system is a little off-putting though.  I actually thought about having my wedding reception in their lower level area.  Great food and drinks! 4
I have shopped here since 1998 when I got back into keeping tropical fish in a live plant environment. after a few year's off.I like that incoming livestock are kept in quarantine after arriving, that I can ask to be told when a particular species becomes available, that the staff are so knowledgeable and enjoy discussing the hobby, even though I notice some impatient shoppers just wanting to grab and go. Reminds me of the now closed Pirrhana on Avenue Road that was run by a hobbyist, or Fintastic in the east end run by Mike.Harold the head guy has saved a couple ailing fish with clear advice.Just in case this seems too high a rating, keep in mind that I have seen a lot of fish shops since I began the hobby sixty years ago.And plant and fish prices seem as fair as elsewhere. 5
Great place to stop for a drink or for outdoor eating on the strip! Food is average, nothing special but not bad at all. Service was fast and friendly. 3
Excellent view on the observation deck.  Had a great time, don't miss it. 5
I was hoping to adopt two 10 yo chihuahua's today. My little blind yorkie just lost his 13yo sister last month and was really needing new friends. We were super excited about the possibility of adding new family members. I spoke to both fostering parents the day before to set up a meet and greet play date at my home. I asked about their health and they both said were in good condition and were over weight. I asked what the adoption fee would be and was told they will let me know tomorrow. The morning of their arrival I had missed a call while in the shower and returned it immediately after I became aware. I spoke to Desirea (foster parent). She confirmed they were coming over and said the price would be $300 for both. I accepted the price with hesitation and asked about medical health records. She said they would email those to me and that she would still bring them over. I waited and waited, and after nearly a hour she text me and said after speaking to her adoption manager they would be more comfortable if I simply went to see them at a pet smart. I couldn't believe it! We were at home waiting for their arrival and they CANCELLED WHILE BEING LATE THROUGH A TEXT!!!! I have fostered many dogs and provided a forever for several. Our home is a home of love and this person chose to POORLY REPRESENT their adoption facility and waist potential owner's time. I WOULDN'T recommend them to anyone!! EVER!!!! 1
Great little place on Kingston. We have only been here for brunch but the dinner menu looks good. For brunch I usually go for the Breakfast and those HP potatoes are amazing! Perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Portions are a little small but perfect for if you're not feeling too hungry. 3
We ordered some printable boxes through Wildcat.  They told us they couldn't print for another three weeks, and we put the order in anyway.  A month and a half later, nothing from them.  I called and emailed 3 times trying to get some sort of information about where our order was.  They got back to me a week later and let me know that they were only just printing the boxes...a month and a half late.I would really hesitate to do business here if I were you.  They should have communicated the delay with me instead of completely ignoring my numerous requests. 1
Well since my last visit I must say without Joe behind the service counter the place is changed for the worse Joe is a great guy to work with and it seems to me understands people's problems a lot more than the guys that are at buddy Stubbs service counter now. FYI Joe now works at Chester's Harley Davidson they will get my business. 2
I really expected to give Nellos a good review but its not that great, not sure if they were in a hurry when they made our pizza but it was lacking in a descent quantity of ingredients we ordered on it we ordered a large pizza with mushrooms, onions, green peppers and pepperoni. One piece out of the whole pizza seamed adequately filled with ingredients. Way to much crust. May come back may not. The bottled beer was $3 also sadly not impressed. 2
Best pizza chain around this area. Thin and thick crust are both good. Great sauce and pepperoni. 4
Best vegetarian pizza in town - great ingredients, great tasting, love it. 4
I sure miss this Boba experience! Every trip to Vegas finds me here. Their large is perfect! The Boba is perfect. Their honey milk tea is just the right sweetness! 4
Thank god for good drinks, reasonable prices and amazing service. The menu is simple and the staff is rad- always ready to help you and also great at keeping you entertained while your drinks are being made. This company is awesome and I'm stoked one opened here in Vegas. Im so over pretentious coffee shops with snobby baristas....we get it ur cool, just make me my  drink. It's worth the trip and again, the service is way better than any coffee shop I've been to around town. High five Dutch Bros! 5
It is very cheap to eat there and the service is good, but the food is lacking. If you need a cheap place to go, this is the place. If you want quality Mexican food, go somewhere else. 3
WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!! STAY AWAY FROM THIS SHITTY PLACE!!!This hall has the worst customer service I have ever seen! I made an appointment about a week ago to see this hall as an option for my upcoming wedding. I had let them know that my work schedule is inconsistent and long hours, which might make it hard for me. The lady I spoke to on the phone said it wasn't a problem that she would figure out a time and date for me to come speak to someone. She tells me to come in Saturday at 6:15pm. At first I thought it was a little strange that she would book me in on a Saturday because they usually have events going on. On the other hand it could just of been that it was going to be a dead night. Never the less it was nice of her to fit me in. Saturday finally got here and we went to have a look at the hall. As soon as we got there we realized they did have an event goin on. We asked to speak to Carlos which was the man we had the appointment with. He finally came out to meet us 10 mins later and did not even introduce himself. Not even a hand shake... nothing. He sat us down in his office and made it a point to tell us MANY TIMES how much of a bad time it was to be doing an appointment on a busy Saturday when they have an event going on. Excuse me?! Your staff are the ones who made the appointment!! If they knew they were having an event on that day at that time why the hell would they schedule an appointment!!?? Thats stupid on your part!! That your problem!! Not the customers!! Maybe she made a mistake when booking my appointment. Whatever the case is thats the venues problem!! If anything you should be apologetic to the customer...not making them feel bad. Cosidering we werent even able to see any of the halls as they were being used. The whole rest of the time he was extreamly rude and rushed!! When we tried to ask a question ...He would start his sentence by saying "Well Obviously"....WELL OBVIOUSLY NOTHING! Every hall is different. .they each run things differently!! Stop saying " well obviously" and answer the damn question! If the answer was obvious I wouldn't be asking it!!!! We came here with interest in your hall, to potentially give you money for an event...and this is how you treat us?! Discusting customer service! I do not recommend anyone to go here! I would NEVER give my hard working money to these people. For the same amount of money per plate and A LOT BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE go to Le Treport, Le Dome, Red rose convention centre or Oasis. 1
Scenery is very nice food not so nice ordered bacon wasnt fully cooked ordered toast wasnt toasted ordered sliced tomatoes w basil got a little cup with mostly juice and a few tomato cubes in a cup about 1 oz no basil and unseasoned eggs. maybe just an off day for the cook hopefully it will b bettet next time. 2
French onion soup should be called french onion SALT with a dump truck of cheese on top. Flavour was ok, but salt trucks could have used it to melt a lot of winter snow. U of T burger was alright, beer selection and price is ok, but the pepsi (of all things) was unusually good.. extra syrupy. It's a Uni bar.. what else can I say. 3
This place has been renamed a few times but the good food still remains the same. I wouldn't bring a party more than 4 or 5 the Max. 3
Lone Girl has a great atmosphere with a modern-hip vibe. The hubster and I stopped in on a Friday afternoon to check things out. The place was not yet packed so we found a place at the bar and ordered a couple of beers. I was a fan of the Off the Rails IPA, but not the Goldihops IPA. We had a look at the menu to see if we'd be staying for dinner. I was well aware of the Yelp reviews skewering the food, but I really wasn't very intrigued by the menu anyway. This, combined with the pricey drinks and the fact that it was by now quite busy and loud, prompted us to leave after our second beer and eat dinner elsewhere. LG seems cool, but we probably won't be back. 3
Yum off the charts. I was moaning from their shredded beef  tacos. Some of the best I have ever had and I am surrounded by mexican joints.Prices were reasonable especially for the higher end drinks.The location near the art galleries makes for a perfect date night. It is also super charming inside and on the patio.This will be my Scottsdale go to place.Am so jealous of the locales that they get this place in their hood! 5
"I'm calling from Southwest Airlines..." said the woman who first spoke to me on the phone from Fiore, and she continued that she was inviting me to the "grand open house celebration of our US airline reservation center". I have these things in quotes because I was lucky enough to have my automatic call recorder turned on, so I have reviewed this conversation since. These are the exact words. This was only the start of the lies, as they told me to lie about my income, told me the gift of round-trip airline tickets they promise were for "absolutely no cost". This is the same generic certificate I got from a timeshare presentation a few years ago which requires sending them $100 on faith, which after a year they still kept denying me every date I requested until they finally offered me a fraction of my reward, knowing I was frustrated. They also delivered on a $100 dining card... one of the ones from restaurant.com that they sell for $40 or less and you have to spend $200 to use! What a joke!Instead of getting to exactly how the package worked, the salesman kept talking about "pussy" (suggesting that having this package would help me get it) and took an hour to even start discussing the package at all. Despite talking to several people there trying to get details of the plan (such as seeing exact numbers for how points translate at certain resorts), they kept trying to sell me on ideas without details. Total scam operation from the details on the phone, the gift you get for attending, and the way they try to sell based on emotion rather than facts. The only positive thing I can say is that the staff were all very friendly and gave me free chips and water (the alcoholic drink, however, was not).Some of the positive reviews sound strangely irrelevant to what Fiore Travel actually does, making it sound as if they are a standard travel agency rather than timeshare (though they hate that word there) sales. 1
Amazing customer service, went there with no appointment and they fit myself and 4 of my bridesmaids in to shop for bridesmaids dresses. We had one designer and style in mind that we were hoping for, but unfortunately David's Bridal only carries "David's Bridal" brand gowns/dresses. Beautiful, but slightly disappointing.The bridesmaids dresses and special occasion dresses are all grouped together, so tread lightly before getting attached - as the special occasion frocks are only available as they would be in a retail store, whatever sizes and colours they have, is all they have.Besides those two slight flaws, I would recommend to friends based on the wonderful customer service the ladies working there provided. 3
After reading reviews on Google and here on Yelp I wasn't looking forward to our visit to Central Psychiatry.  But I figured if I did not like it here, I would just get another referral from my sons doctor.  I took my son here about a month ago.  I signed in and checked the box that my son was a 1st time patient.  The girl at the front desk welcomed us. Our appointment was with Kristy Muir.  There was a lot of people in the waiting room and I was hearing from some of them that they were waiting for an hour or over an hour so I expected to wait at least an hour.  And we did.  After an hour they called my son back.  Kristy seemed professional and understanding and I feel that my son had good communication with her.  So our visit with her, I feel, went really well.  She gave us free samples of some meds that would last 30 days.So my sons follow up appointment with Kristy was last Wednesday, April 15th.  We were there on time and again the waiting room was really crowded this time around so I expected to wait at least an hour to an hour and a half.  I signed in, we sat down.  20 minutes later, Kristy called my son...AWESOME!  Only a 20 minute wait.  I had heard others saying they had been there for 2 hours already but they must have been waiting to see one of the other Doctors.  We were out of there in 40 mins.  So that day went really well.  Now today, I am trying to call their offices about the prescription my son received last Wednesday and I get a message saying "the number you are trying to reach is out of service".  So this sucks, because I really need to get a hold of them today.  So I will keep on trying.  Other than trying to contact them by phone, our overall experience was good. 3
This ramen is all oil. Packaged Ramen is even better than this. The chicken karage is horrible Wendy's chicken nuggets is way better also it is way cheaper than this overpriced crap 1
authentic sushi !!!(Edit) ..but didn't seem so fresh on a recent visit  :(. Taking one star off. 3
I've been here a few times now and it's great everytime! The roll portions are huge and the fried rolls are delicious. They give you bottles of eel sauce and spicy mayo so you can decorate the rolls however you like.   The Las Vegas is my favorite, but it's hard to go wrong here. I recommend trying the tortilla soup, it comforting and has nice flavor. The Yakisoba is also a solid choice if you want some noodles. Overall a great place if you want some good mex fusion sushi. 4
The reviews made me nervous, but we ate here anyway because we were hungry and didn't want fast food.  It's nothing fancy, but overall the food was decent.  Our waitress was attentive.  Plus it didn't take long to get our food.  Overall I was glad we decided to take a chance. 4
Good BBQ. OK but not great. Staff is friendly and fun. Atmosphere is always good. The food is real BBQ not the normal boiled and oven cooked fare. I always can go to a Famous Dave's and know I will get good BBQ at fair prices and sides are always good. I have had 5 star BBQ around the county but when a chain tries to make great BBQ they always seem to fall just short. You will get your moneys worth and have a great meal. 4
Busy holiday weekend, but all the staff from the ticket counter, concessions, and rest room attendants we really nice. Smiling without a hint of annoyance due to working on a holiday weekend with heavy traffic. It would have been a 3 due to smelly restroom but before I left, they were already on it. Service counts a lot.Seats were comfortable with good leg room. 4
Pleasantly surprised at how good the food tasted. Asian flavors were spot on with the pad thai and bun. Next time will have to try a burger, it looked real good. Will come back for sure. Lose one star for slow service, not the sole servers fault, i think they only had one cook. Worth the wait though. 4
Alrighty...so I'm Vietnamese and for me to give a high rating for Vietnamese restaurant is a mighty challenge in itself.If I end my meal with out drinking all the broth (for Pho) or throwing back the shot of fish sauce then it's not high on my list.  This place is close to home and we didn't feel like putting on our kevlar to head over to my fav Vietnamese restaurant. Got seated right away, but took a bit for our order to be taken.  I make it a point to order in Vietnamese with hopes they prep the dish with a little bit more of an authentic touch.  Call me crazy but that's how my mind works. For the food, we ordered the lemon grass pork on rice which came with two spring rolls and fried egg.  One large pho sate chicken and also one large pho sate beef.The rice dish, is ok.  I don't know how to explain it, nothing stood out to me and screamed eat me!  It wasn't bad, just ok..The pho sate, I honestly believe they just used the regular broth and added the sate hot sauce to it afterwards and in my humble option that's a no no.  I love pho sate when the broth is specifically made with the intent to be sate, my absolute fav is the sate that has a strong peanut flavour to it.  Unfortunately this wasn't that.Again it was alright.  Next time I get a craving from the motherland, I'll make the trek across town.Oh, and no complementary hot tea, what!? 2
Terrible customer service.  Was looking to buy an Evoque.  The salesman was totally arrogant  and the Sales Manager wouldn't budge on the quoted price even though I could get the same car in Scottsdale Az for 2K less.  I just wanted an extra 500 off - nothing crazy.  I was basically told that they know they are the only game in town - only Land Rover dealer for hundreds of miles and I was just going to have to take it or leave it.  After getting totally pissed and deciding that I'll just buy the car and get screwed on a bad deal they tell me that it is getting late (Saturday 4PM) and that even if I buy the car - right now - they can't delivery it to me today because they don't have enough time.  I'll have to wait till next week to get the car I am standing right in front of.  What!!!  What kind of low budget garbage is that?  I've never tried so hard to give someone 54K.  I'm done with these guys.  Taking my business and money somewhere else. What a joke. 1
My mom went as part of a deal: $30 for wash, cut, style, head and shoulder massage, and a winter hand moisturizing treatment.  There was NO shoulder massage and the head massage was a token 1 minute patting of her scalp.  The moisturizing treatment consisted of a masque applied to the hands and wrapped in plastic. When my mom arrived for her early morning appointment, the stylists from the night before hadn't swept up.  The stylist was nice and they had a good chat, and my mom thought the hair cut was fine.  Still, she won't be back and will likely go back to her regular stylist. 2
Best Middle Eastern Restaurant in town. This is the place to go and eat, the food is excellent the portion is good, The hot bread is out of this world. The most important thing is the food is always the same, Not like other restaurant some times it is good and other times no so good. Try the fattoush salad with chicken shawarma. Don't forget the garlic! and for some of you who likes spicy food, try the sujuk,it's my favorite. we will be back. 5
We thought we would try them through a groupon promotion.  The guy that came out to clean was lucky if he was working on our pool for no more than 5 minutes.  I didn't see him brush the pool and anything on the bottom of the pool stayed on the bottom.  The promotion was for 1 month of cleanings otherwise 4 cleanings.  They called before the 4th cleaning to see if we were going to continue, and when I told them no, they have not been back to do the 4th cleaning.  I called I have been told that they argued with me that my time expired a week earlier, but then after 5 minutes of telling them it hasn't they realized they had the wrong account.  Was told they would be out Monday and now two weeks later have not been out.  I would not recommend this company unless you like giving money away for services not rendered and that you end up doing yourself.  They talk a great game but follow through is horrible. 1
The Roti Canai is a dish I order every time. Really tasty and one of the best I have tasted. Tom Yum soup, Nasi Goreng, the malaysian fried rice as well as Curry Laska are all equally good. The curry laska is an enormous dish that can easily be shared.The Singapore Rice Noodle is okay, not one of my favorite dishes here.The service which is good, fast and efficient. 4
Food was not good.  I had the bacon, eggs and pancakes.  Bacon was cheap.  Eggs were disgusting. Pancakes were bad.   Wife had steak and eggs.  Both were gross.  Also, waiter was in attentive and rude.  Last time I come to place.  Something positive. 2
Today was the first time i went there. The food was special. The crust of the crepe was crunchy, the dressing of the salad was too thick. The service was really disappointing. 2
TERRIBLE SCHEDULERS - The doctors here are warm, welcoming, and knowledgeable. We love going to them. However, the scheduling ladies are rarely able to accommodate requests for appointments (even serious ones!), and are VERY RUDE in the process. The last two times I called to request appointments, the scheduler couldn't get us in for two weeks and refused to make the second appointment at all, respectively. For a child that sees the doctor one or twice a year, that seems a little ridiculous. Even their 'help hotline' respondent was extremely rude and refused to help, only sent us to the hospital- for an ear infection- and then lied saying there were no Saturday appointments! This place is great, but management should really reevaluate who is representing them on the phone and know about how they are refusing business. They have definitely lost ours. 2
The sushi was awesome we tried the Philadelphia, Rainbow, flying Jason, and black jack roll. All were great. The only reason they got a three is halfway through all of the waiters in the entire restaurant disappeared for 15 minutes. The sushi chef finally called them after we looked around several times. Also the waitress was very rushed and pushy when taking/waiting for your order but then never comes back. Go for good sushi, not service. 3
I love this club. Absolutely beautiful. Fun times always had. Music is mostly house but they sneak in a few songs to dance to. The club is indoors and outdoors. People were outside in 30 degree weather. Good times had whether one is freezing or not! The club was stupid packed but it was new years weekend. I wouldn't expect anything less. 5
Had a great waitress and is not to blame for a poorly run restaurant.  We've been here before and love the food. Food still good when you finally get it. When we entered restaurant we were told there would be a 15 minute wait. There were empty tables but they didn't have wait staff to service them. Our service was very slow and we got our entree before the salad. Granted there could be problems but why put it on the wait staff to explain everything.  Where's the manager? Will not return. Lots of other options in Surprise now for Italian. 2
I generally like Majerle's.  I've used the Cotton Room for my birthday celebration a couple of times.   Food is good, it's a good central location and its convenient when we go downtown for a game, D'Backs, Suns or Mercury or shows.   Very disappointed in the service/attitude of the staff tonight.  We were seated in the back section,  we were the second group to be seated back there.  Several other groups came in and were waited on much faster.  Groups that came in after us, had drinks and food before we got drinks.  The groups were leaving when we finally got our food.   NOT happy with today's service and the fact we sat there for sometime without service.  Food was good, no problems with that, I think the waitress was inexperienced or just lazy. 3
We take out from here once in a blue moon. We decided to pick it up and they were ready in about 20 minutes.We ordered a pork souvlaki and chicken souvlaki dinner. It was more than enough food for 3 adults. However, they took the meat off the kebab sticks, so it was really difficult to see how much we were getting. We were supposed to get 3 pork sticks and 2 chicken, but it looks like we got the opposite. There was way more chicken than pork, which kinda sucked for my parents who wanted to share the pork.I will say I love the potatoes. The sauce on them is really tasty. But the rice was pretty boring. We also got the greek salad and pita, which were both tasty.It was nice to have the food, but for the prices they charge, I would expect something nicer and more abundant. 3
We love our new deck cover!  Every part of doing business with Perfect Home Products was excellent.  From the beginning phone conversation with the office for an appointment, through the gentleman who came out and did the measurements and quote, and especially the hard-working and excellent builder who constructed our deck cover, all transactions receive 5 stars.  The finished job is beautiful, and well-worth the reasonable cost. 5
FOOD  above average  - Really enjoyed the seaweed omelette, broccoli shrimp, and octopus wasabi starter. SERVICE below average - they had enough staff just need better training on speed and attentiveness.AMBIANCE average - great noise level perfect for a date or equally a large group VALUE above average - like similar restos in this category good value.  $40 or less for food and drink per person.OVERALL - an average restaurant in the city.  If you are looking for something new, give it a try.  But we are on the fence on whether to give it a second go. 3
I give it a 3 1/2, really. We arrived at 10:30 am, taking the advice that the Monarch would be quieter early in the day. The young lady behind the counter greeted us as soon as we walked in, making us feel comfortable in what was definitely a bar setting. She was very generous in suggesting that, even with our Indie Coffee Passports, we could order whatever we liked from their espresso menu. I'm a big fan of soy lattes but was gently steered toward the 'regular' milk version [I was offered 1% or 2% - a nice touch]. My latte was presented in a large cup, the foam poured to create a swirled heart. It proved to be smooth and mild, foamy and thick, easy to drink.  My Passport companion found a comfy looking upholstered sofa, perhaps a bit too comfy, almost touching the ground when sat upon; so we settled in at a table and pulled up a few chairs for our coats and such.  Since there was only one other patron at the time, we didn't think anyone would mind.The crystal chandeliers hanging over the counter were a nice counterpoint to the dark wood benches, tables and chairs, with a big screen centred at the back of the room and eclectic art on the walls. We stayed long enough for the lunch crowd to start filling up the space, groups of two and more at tables, a few people at the bar. Since we'd spent an hour and a half sipping our lattes and basically having the place to ourselves, we bundled up our gear and headed out.  All in all it was an unexpectedly mellow experience and I enjoyed it. 3
My daughter and I were in Whitby Wednesday afternoon and decided to do sushi for lunch. So we decided on Sushi Today after checking the reviews and was recommended by my son who ate there quite often.We were seated right away and it was not busy maybe a dozen tables were occupied. We were quickly served and got our drinks right away. We placed our order and the food arrived pretty quickly compared to most sushi AYCE (all you can eat) I've been too.The sushi was alright some fell apart when picking them up. The orders kept coming and they were constantly rearranging our table as they placed our orders down. The servers were constantly removing our dishes as they were completed and to a point where our conversation was always being interrupted that we felt we were being rushed.I'm giving three stars for the food but zero for the service which was rushed and rude. The price was good but the service was bad and they rushed you to pay your bill.I'll probably never return because I've been to better sushi places around Durham region. 3
Now called Tu Tierra, this charming restaurant still uses the Chinese style sign of the former tenant on its facade. The food is good and fairly authentic but the prices are high, even for lunch. 3
Great place! Chris (the owner) was rock solid. The store is relatively small, but what it lacks in size it makes up for in product quality and excellent customer service. The mattresses and adjustable frames are top notch and the prices are affordable. My fiance and I looked pretty much everywhere before stepping foot in Mattress 360. I'm glad we waited. Sleeping like a log! 5
The GVR has clean rooms but can use some dusting as with many other parts of the hotel and casino. Definitely need to change their pool hours! Its summer and pools should at least be open till 10:30pm for god sakes it is hot out! Had dinner at the grand cafe.......its basically a Denny's potato was not cook and steak was over done beef jerky. Lucky they did have a fat burger in there that was awesome. The employees canuse a good six months of intense customer service. The casino I would not waste a dime here payouts are scarce. 2
My primary care physician recommended him to me. I am glad that she did. The experience was great. Staff at LEI is very friendly and cooperative. Dr Matthew is experienced expert and highly professional. He understood my husband's problem and took care of it.I would surely recommend him to friends and family.Salma khan 4
Disclaimer: a vegan's viewI often don't bother reviewing restaurants with poor vegan choices, but feel compelled to here because this one couldn't even get me a salad that was sufficient.I thought I'd get pizza with no cheese. Their pizza dough has egg in it.Ok, salad. ALL of their dressings except for one also has egg whites in them. That's odd, but whatever. So I get the chopped vegetable salad with the one dressing they can offer. The salad was mediocre and meager in portion size. So after lunch here I had to go find something to eat. 1
He is the most reliable gardener I ever worked with. Always on time, doing a great job for a great price. I can highly recommend him. 5
If it weren't for the fact that this place is just down the street from my house, I wouldn't bother going.  Appointments are a joke here. I had an appointment with a doctor who left before seeing me.  I ended up seeing a PA 2.5 hours after my appointment time.  At this very moment I am waiting to see that same PA and my appointment time was over an hour ago. I am in one of rooms finally, yet I still have 2 people ahead of me. Seriously? Oh, and I can clearly hear the conversation in the room next to me.  I really need to find another doctor even if it means driving out to Boulder City since I am pretty sure I would have been there and back by now. 1
I lived here from 2009-2010 and loved it! Great pool that is open 24/7 (and in the summer months a party 24/7). Only complaint is same as all others is that they do tow cars that don't have passes--like a friend visiting. Wish management can crack down on this. 4
It is too bad that my review will echo what the majority of others have experienced here. Quick to seat for sure but then it is like you are invisible. Food is so-so for a place that appears nice - decor is great but that is it. By far the best deal is lunch bufffet. I have absolutely given up on evening meals here. Potential is great but falls way short. 3
More of a 3.5/5.Visited Bareburger September 21st with 2 others. I've passed by this place very often as I live in the area, and I thought their decor looked very interesting. After seeing their ratings on Yelp, I was looking forward to trying it out. As a former vegan/vegetarian, and someone who tries to buy organic as much as possible, this place really embodied that wholesome-organic-grassfed vibe.Beverages: Being lactose-intolerant, I was psyched to get a milkshake - something I've never had - as they offer mikshakes with coconut ice-cream and rice milk. The chocolate-banana milkshake was good, thick, and creamy, everything you'd want in a milkshake, at least I assume. My acquaintances both got the (regular) choc-peanut butter option, which was apparently very good as well.Food: We all got the build-a-burger option. I got the quinoa patty on a sprout bun,with my choice of toppings, and the patty was probably one of the better quinoa patties I've had. The size of the burger is decent, probably around the same size as a The Works burger. Unlike most burger joints, sides aren't included here as a meal. The 3 of us shared a side of fries, which were fine and nothing to rave about.Service: This place would get 4 or 5 stars if not for the service. Our server was pretty rude even though we were nothing but pleasant guests. She slammed my milkshake down on the table. When the burgers arrived, I had my hands on the table. Instead of most servers who sort of announce the food before placing it down, she kind of just semi-shoved my hands out of the way to make room for the tray. It also took forever for us to get her attention and get our bills once we were done eating.*Also, for those with celiac or serious gluten allergies: although a lot of the items on the menu are labelled gluten-free, they do state that they don't have strict contamination control when it comes to handling gluten & gluten-free items. 3
I just had Jim from Simple Electric out to trouble shoot a couple of issues - a bad breaker and some faulty wiring.  He was very thorough and tried to find the best way to solve the problem most economically.  I found him to be extremely professional and knowledgeable.  I would highly recommend him and plan to keep Simple Electric on my list for future needs! 5
Sorry about this as I have been here before with good results, nothing fabulous,but good. However, my 2 recent visits were not so.I loved the Rachel Sandwich, but on late Saturday Aft I waited almost 30 minutes ( no,wasn't crowded) and when it arrived,I hardly recognized it. Very dry pastrami,ends leather like and bread so over grilled it hurt my gums. Tuna melt,that same day was not even finished by my friend, just blah. A couple weeks later for lunch,on a weekday,,our burgers were dry and buns not very fresh. Odd when you order at the front, they turn the computer to you and it asks you for a tip amount. For what? Someone brings your plate out? I had get myself a menu,get up to order, and pick out my own drinks. Love the nostalgia of the place and friendly staff. But,Floor is getting pretty gross looking guys. 2
I love this place, one of my favorites in the West end. I like that their noodles a little wider and fresh. They are pretty quick, and the broth is consistent. For those of you who enjoy their soup on the spicier side, they have a couple chilli oil jars kicking around. which is a big bonus for me, seeing as i bring my own sometimes to pho places that don't have them. i'm pretty much a regular there. 4
Saw an outdoor concert there this weekend and had a decent experience. Only recommendation would be for AE stage to have their staff clear the outdoor trash cans. They were overflowing beyond belief and trash ended up all in the walk way - so gross. Additionally - because of the las vegas incident last week - once we were inside on the grass - we looked for all the "exits". Nothing was marked anywhere in sight. Please fix this asap!!!! 2
I was dragged here by my friend, considering the fact that I don't even eat meat, I almost dreaded going but she did say that they had the best shakes so I'm always down for that. So we get there, we have the nicest waiter, Sam, place us inside. The interior is neat. We order shakes and he tells us, there is no ice cream....um ok. So I order lemonade, then he tells us there is no lemonade. UMMM... Ya. I ended up getting a cream soda and a pretzel and the Belgian fries with Sriacha. Delicious!! I will probably come back because I am still curious about these shakes :) 3
Horrible service the employees were rude. When I was going to pay there was four employees at the counter and I asked them a question to see what else they had for baptism...one of them just answered rudley "what ever you see that is all we have"... I stood in line for more than 5min to pay I was literally the only customer in the store and I was not even acknowledge by any of the employees. I just had to just walk out and left my things there. It was my first and last time at that store. 1
Whoever ranked this higher than one star has never been to a decent sports bar. I can appreciate the charm of a good dive, but this place was all dive and no charm, with a dash shitty service to top it all off. 1
McDonald's was always a place of rapid service, reasonable price and decent food.  I must admit  this was from the years they timed service.  Remove the fast from fast food here!  I made the mistake of asking for decaf coffee in my order.  Seems the new menu and directive has no problem leaving someone waiting fifteen minutes on a simple order.  This is not the first time I have experienced bad service at this location.  I feel sorry for the workers.  It is a management issue.  Either under staffed, under trained or poor design.  I didn't even get decaf.  Still buzzing 6 hours later. 2
Friendly faces and good sandwiches. Best place to grab a superquick bite and eat on patio. 4
1. Pad thai- Not ketchup-based or too sweet. Mine was salty but it would've been good if it was less salty. Not spicy. Comes with shrimp and chicken. 2. Vermicelli with spring roll, shrimp on sugar cane- Spring rolls were small and over-fried. Shrimp on sugar cane was bigger than other places. 3
I was hesitant to try a new nail tech, after several years with the same person.  I found Pam on Yelp and she truly does an amazing job.  She takes her time, is very thorough and has a HUGE selection of products.  She works 7 days a week, is very accommodating with her hours.  She is very knowledgeable about nails and products.  I am glad I found her and made the switch.  You won't be disappointed as she is a perfectionist. 5
Writing this review as I'm eating this for lunch and well, I'm highly disappointed. This was my first time trying dirt belly and it looked quite appealing to me as I walked by it so I decided to give it a shot. I ordered two salads, chicken, and one of those 'energy balls'. The salads are mediocre (I feel like Sunterra's are better) and the chicken is just disgusting! I don't really know how its cooked but it has absolutely no flavour and an odd texture. Would not go here again, not to mention that my total was $16! 2
Four friends and myself ate at Alloy for my Birthday dinner last night and I must say I was not overly impressed. The decor is unique and the atmosphere was cool but that just does not make up for average food at an above average price. If it were not for the food I think I would give this place a 4! But in the end that is what tells the real story for me. We all tried a different starter, main and we shared a few salads so I can certainly say I gave it a fair chance. Service was friendly but did not seem overly knowledgeable, no food descriptions or desire created,Dish presentation was quite nice, Food was sub par, I kept expecting to be wowed by one of the 12 + dishes we ordered but in the end the candle burnt out and we were left with a hefty bill and disappointed taste buds. I may go back when the patio is open on a nice day to give it one more shot but that will be long after I try several other places on the bookmark list including some repeats to places like The Muse and Rouge where I would gladly spend my time and money :) 2
I've been to Meatheads twice since they opened. The first time I had their basic 1/3 lb cheeseburger with all the trimmings ("grilled" onion, lettuce, tomato, mayo, ketchup, and pickles). I also shared a mocha shake. The food arrived fast and the burger was great, except I was certain they made a mistake since the onion on my burger was raw (still crunchy and spicy). Still a good, but greasy burger. The shake was the real star; it tasted like it was made with fresh coffee.My second visit I got the same with the addition of fries. The total was about $12, so it's not the cheapest burger joint in town. Biting into my burger I got the same raw onion taste. So, it seems to me they heat the onions on the grill, but don't actually grill them; it was still white. The second go at the mocha shake was just as good as the first with an intense coffee flavor. The small order of fries was huge, and probably more than I should have eaten.As others have said, parking is a mess. The restaurant probably has twice as many tables as parking spaces. 4
I'm beyond disappointed with Anita's complete lack of professionalism or reliability. Anita wasted half of my cooling off period, repeatedly pushing back reviewing my agreement of purchase and sale. I was livid - being screwed around during the biggest purchase most people ever make! The worst part is, she was posting updates on social media about all her social outings all week!Part way through the week she casually announced she would be leaving on vacation a few days later, still not having finished what she promised to do. At the last minute, she wouldn't even cooperate properly with my real estate agent to return the contract (a huge package) in a timely manner in order to have it forwarded to another lawyer for a proper review. 1
Excellent service and excellent baked goods! The staff is so nice! Love everything there including their fabulous sandwich rolls!  I wish they would make a website and also update their facebook page so more people can find out about them! 5
I just went to Bacaro for my girlfriend's birthday and got some mixed feelings about it. Here's what we ordered:Grilled veal chop with red beets and pearl onionsGrilled sirloin with red cabbage, potatoes, and braised oxtail, in a red wine reductionApple cake with creme fraiche ice creamChocolate brownie with graham cracker ice cream and roasted marshmallowsPersimmon and pistachio bread puddingThe entree and wine were splendid, although a bit on the salty side for the sirloin. However, the dessert left a lot to be desired, in particular the persimmon and pistachio bread pudding. It was just plain soggy and tasteless. I recommend not ordering dessert here if you do plan on coming. In regards to the waitress and hostess, they were very helpful and courteous, in contrast to many of the other reviewers who saw them as "snooty" and pretentious. The atmosphere was pleasant and the ambient music was suitable for the occasion. 3
We went here for lunch and I ordered the veal parm . I sent it back cause it was a veal pattie that had been deep fried . No bueno . So instead I had a corned beef sandwich which wasn't bad , a little dry but better then the veal . The fries were good and so was the gravy I poured over them . 2
good happy hour prices. boyfriend had sashimi and tempura....i had a veggie roll...very good. mango cocktail was soooo yummy. 4
I've been going to Tonyc for all my hair needs for 4 years now. Not sure what I would do without Antoinette - so thoughtful and talented! I've referred multiple friends to her and everyone came back with only the best reviews. 5
Have been to Corbeaux for both lunch/brunch and dinner, and for their self serve section and sit-down section. When we went for dinner, it was before they expanded the menu. What we had was good, but the options were limited. On the self serve side, the offerings look delectable, but the prices are on the high side. $9 for a grilled cheese?! May go back for a treat now and then, but I don't think I would make Corbeaux a regular stop. 3
I came here with a group of 10 for appetizers and drinks.The ambiance is fantastic and we spotted multiple notable celebrities, which added to the excitement of our evening.The chicken potstickers were delicious. I found the cucumber salad to be very refreshing. They also make a great old fashioned. 4
Small but good facility.Wewent pretty late on a Saturday , but they still entertained us and kept the facilities open for as long as we needed. 4
El buffet  no posee mucha variedad de  platos el buffet del aria tiene mas , los postres son muy pocos y poca variedad, la calidad es muy buena de la comida igualmente 2
Do not go to this HD,  they suck.  Associates are rude and un-educated about their job.  Customer service desk lady is a Biatch...and will try and deny any type of return, even an exchange with receipt....Wow...who the fck does that.  Lowes is down two blocks on Marks St., go to Lowes better prices anyways. 1
Premium place with premium qualities.best food of my life.So generous,and real lebanese food.Simply the best man'oushe in town.the whole idea is just homey and authentic,from location itself to the smell and taste to the friendly welcoming ,I just love it. 5
Just opened up in our neighborhood.  The food was fresh and pretty good.  They offer a spin on the traditional Vietnamese food with burritos and interesting sounding pot stickers. I really want to try the Sriracha buffalo chicken pot stickers next time. This time I ordered The Great Phoenix King Noodle Bowl with ginger garlic Sriracha braised pork. The pork was delish and I highly recommend it. The noodles were okay. I will definitely be back to try other options. 4
Great spot, with a limited but good menu.  Very hidden, but somehow I have found this place 2 times by accident...so maybe the placement is genius...  Anyhow good beer selection, and great staff. 5
Friendly, fast, $2 discount immediately honored, but gave him $20 anyway. Will give them my business again next time. Thanks, keep it up! 5
highly disappointed....not by the quality of the food, but by the accuracy. i ordered spicy fried rice w/ chicken to go. how one would mistaken "noodles" for "fried rice" i have no idea, but for the price, i'd at least expect my order to be accurate. strike 1. fyi, i never give places a chance for strike 3. hope the next time they get my order right. 2
So one thing that really stands out to me: one of the employees (John I believe) emailed me a copy of my inspection before coming out to talk to me. And the email included pictures! I've never seen this before. Maybe I'm behind, but before coming here I always went to Honda of Concord and Scott Clark Honda (wouldn't recommend either) and I've never seen this. I'm always cautious due to receiving false info regarding needed car repairs. This definitely gave me a peace of mind. This is my third or fourth time coming here and I'll definitely be back. The only downside for me is the business hours of 8-5 but aside from that I love this place. 5
Honestly, I do not understand the hype around this restaurant. I mean unless one is going there for the atmosphere, it just doesn't make sense. The food is sub-par, unimpressive and bland. I had the fish and octopus and I noticed nothing spectacular for the prices they charge. The pasta was just horrible, completely inedible and sloppily plated. The only redeeming quality was that the pasta was al dente. The squid ink pasta smelled like rotting seafood and tasted "off." The server had made this suggestion and failed to mention that this dish is somewhat of an "acquired" taste; to put it mildly. She also failed to mention that this dish would stain one's teeth and lips black. Ultimately, this restaurant is pretentious for no good reason, really. 1
Avoid this place if you can. Although you can find a pretty good gelati the rest of the fair is pretty crap. The coffee is terrible and the service is complete crap. I tried it a few times and it stayed crap. 2
This place is right across from the Westin in downtown Pittsburgh.  First, Music was too loud, with no one in the restaurant, making it difficult to even talk to the person sitting next to you.  Food was almost inedible (fish tacos) and the staff was less than attentive.  The bar/restaurant decor was cold and minimalist, but not good minimalist....cheap in all respects.  If this place hasn't been around long, my suspicion is they wont be here next time I come to Pittsburgh. 1
This is now our go to pizza place. Reasonably priced, delicious pizza and the owners/employees/drivers are super friendly and delivery is quick! Just picked up some pizzas, and the guy at the counter was friendly. Great independent pizza shop.Oh, and try the garlic vegetarian, it's amazing. 5
We saw the Food Network's Diners, Dives, and Drive-Ins when my parents were in town.  So, we decided to try it out but went to the Scottsdale location because it was closer than the Phoenix location.  It was on Bell Road right next to the Ice Den.  I guess normally there is a 30 min wait but we got seated right away.  I ordered Omelette #4 (spinach  with tomato, garlic and feta cheese).  It was DELICIOUS!     My mom had the blueberry pancakes and really enjoyed them.  Prices are a little high ($3 for 3 pieces of bacon), but all in all, I thought the food was tasted very good and was filling.  I would definitely go back. 4
If I could choose a half or quarter of a star,  I would do so. Do not waste your time or money with these people. Management is horrible. 1
This is a family owned business. They are nice people except for the mother who kicked us out badly once because we brought our small Yorkie inside. She was not even polite about it. But we never see her too much anymore. Prices are definitely cheaper But a lot of vitamins are on sale once they are very close to expiry or expired already! I don't like that. Another thing is that the food in the bins - nuts, granola etc are never fresh. Evergreen natural foods on roncesvalles is more expensive but definitely more fresh. But the naturopathic doctor here is helpful. But I wish she would ask if I had pre-existing conditions before recommending anything. Because I did buy something that I later found out is not good for people with autoimmune conditions. 2
I was here the other day for lunch and, as expected, there was a bit of a line.  That's usually a good sign, and in this case it's definitely true. But waiting for a table isn't all bad; there's lots to see in this place: kitchy cute decor and lots of memoribilia that reminded me of my childhood. When I was there, the place was cramped and full of hungry people, but everyone was in good spirits. When I look at the menu, i always find it difficult to make a choice. They've got a big, diverse menu with both savory and sweet items. All of it looks delicious.  First off, I'm a vegetarian, but, like to get the breakfast pocket, sans pemeal bacon of course.  It's chock full of fluffy eggs, caramelized onions, mayo and cheddar cheese on a warm and soft onion bun. Aunties and Uncles encourages you to choose between a few sides, but I've never chose anything but the potato salad. Seriously, this stuff is good. A great combo of chunky red potatoes, dill, Dijon and spices, it's savoury and creamy. Admittedly, my food did and usually does take a bit of time to arrive, so if you go, don't go when you're in a hurry.Fruit juices and iced teas are good choices, but I wouldn't finish off with an espresso as they may suggest. Their espresso is nothing special and just plain weak, and it certainly doesn't stand up to Manic coffee located just a few doors down. If you're craving an after-meal-caffiene-fix, I'd suggest you head over to Manic.Aunties and Uncles loses points in service. The service staff seem a bit cold, sorta aloof, and alot grouchy, but despite if you're willing to overlook that, then this is worth a visit if you're in the College & Bathurst area. 3
Pros: Pool, sauna, steam room, studio, tons of machines, classes. Close to my house in a convenient shopping plaza. All of the employees are nice. Chill clientele.Cons: They need to post signs on every piece of equipment to remind people to wipe down their machines after they use them. I'm a nurse, so I KNOW bodily fluids, and I watch these patrons as they just walk away from the machine after use WITHOUT wiping them down, ew. There are plenty of spray bottles and paper towels around. No towels though. And the steam room and sauna, while nice, is co-ed 3
The sushi here is actually pretty good but in the two times dining in, the service was very slow and the orders were wrong. As for carryout, don't bother. I have ordered 5 carryout orders and all were either wrong or not even submitted to the kitchen when I arrived 30 min later. This is one of the only sushi places in the area but I drive to Sakana instead due to the poor service here. Bummer when the food is pretty good. 2
We always thought the Farm Grill was great, but were very disappointed this trip! Whom ever sold them on the idea of the drinks offered at the fountain, really did them a disservice! The need to go back to offering adult selections like Coke or Dr Pepper again instead of the crappy flavors like "Tractor Cola". It tasted awful, so both my wife and I tried a couple of others. They were all terrible. I settled for water, and my wife drank the root beer, which was tolerable! We liked the do over in tables and atmosphere, but did the burgers shrink, or was our disappointment in the drinks just putting us in a crappy mood! 1
I went in for a cut and color last month. The color turned out okay but the cut is messed up. When I called to make the appointment the owner (recognized the name from the reviews here) answered and I asked for someone experienced because I have very fine hair. I obviously didn't get someone with much experience. Will not be going back. 3
I've been here twice now and both times have been disappointed. Both times it took at least 20 minutes to get our food. That the longest I've ever waited at a Noodles & Company. The staff isn't very friendly or helpful. The first time we went I paid for extra mushrooms and there were 3 mushrooms in my food, my food which was supposed to already had mushrooms and was supposed to have extra added in it. When I said something to one of the staff, she got an attitude and said that they are busy and that's extra mushrooms. Once I showed her and said there are only 3 in there, she reluctantly offered to get me more. She then slammed it down on the table and said "here." Tonight I got my food to go and was very disappointed. I got the Pesto Cavatappi and there was almost no pesto on it. I got a side salad which has the dressing container inside so cutting my salad in about half. The dressing container was less than 1/3 full so it makes it seem like they are just using it to take up space so they don't have to give you as much. I am VERY disappointed in this location. Noodles & Company is one of my favorite places to eat. Even though this one is the closest to my house, I don't think I'll be returning. 1
Had dinner here and nothing really special compared to Louisiana buffets.  King crab and snow crab are on the menu but they are served cold and almost frozen.  Louisiana casino buffets actually steam their crabs which I believe taste better.  Everything else on the buffet was just nasty or below standards in taste.  If it wasn't for the crabs, I'd give this place a 1 star.Seems like all Vegas buffets suffer from the same disease, they are large in square footage but small in selections and high in price.  They are built for flash. 2
Food was awful and overpriced. Carpaccio was smothered in mayo and inedible. Tomatoes in Caprese salad were pale and not flavorful. Fries were pale and flaccid. So disappointed as I support Lakewood businesses. Loved its former incarnation, Players. Second time I've been to Sarnitas and most likely will not return. 2
Not the friendliest service.. I placed my order and the man held out his hand for money. Didn't bother to tell me my total until I asked. Chicken biryani is mostly fat. Samosas nothing special. For 2 samosas and a small biryani to go was just a some change under 20 dollars. Ridiculous. 2
Not the best AYCE sushi joint but not the worst either. Their sushi is pretty fresh... but it's kind of boring. I like my nigiris with different sauces and garnishes. I asked for my squid with shiso leaf on top (which I always get at other sushi places) but the lady didn't know what I was talking about. But I do like the portion sizes of the nigiri... not too much rice and the fish is a perfect size as well. The servers are really nice and friendly. This place is close to my house so I come here occasionally. But again, not my favorite AYCE. 3
Awful. The owners are so rude and the nail specialist are very unprofessional. DO NOT COME HEREI came here because of the great reviews on Yelp but I am extremely disappointed with the customer service and the way my nails came out by Ani. I will never come back here. I would recommend luxury nails or creative nails, they are both nearby. 1
Meh? I don't know, maybe I have had enough of this type of over the top food.  Service was friendly and attentive. The place was mostly empty around 6pm on a Friday. Nice outdoor deck.  Fried green tomatoes were pretty good.  Their namesake dish? It's some ok fried chicken on top of some ok waffles served with watered down maple syrup. Nothing life changing. The menu is more TGI Friday's than soul food.  Beware the "Drank".  Tastes like something you would give to a toddler in a sippy cup but it's got a kick.  I  ended up walking around Gilbert for 90 minutes to sober up after drinking one little 8oz glass of the stuff. 3
Not really my thing and I am an experienced lifter.  If you are someone who super sets,  would not recommend unless you only like using machines.  It's not organized for efficiency but designed for the masses.  Positive note, the club was clean and the staff was friendly. 2
If this place was on on fire i wouldn't reach for a phone to call for help.   The absolute rudest most bitter sour people there and the owner is even worse .  A miserablre environment full of staff that hate being there and dont want to talk to you. Overpriced.  You walk in the door they make you feel like you owe them something for doing so. 1
I had gotten a gel manicure after months of not having anything on my nails.  I saw them on FB and wanted to go there because of all of the sparkle and glitter.  I got pink gel with added glitter and rhinestones, this was on a Friday.  By Saturday, my rhinestones on my right hand came off completely by the afternoon.  On Sunday, my left hand rhinestones were completely gone followed by 2 chipped nails.  Really? I've had gel manicures before and never had this happen before, I wasn't doing anything out the my normal routine.  I emailed them explaining my disappointment, however, not a word was returned.  So with that being said, I will no longer return... 2
We came here on a recommendation from a friend, it was close to my parent's house so we didn't have to travel very far, and we didn't want to wait very long to be seated. In the beginning service was slow. They had a party of 12 that was here before us but they were getting dessert after we sat down for about 10 minutes. Seemed like they were more attentive after I whipped out my yelp coupon for free draft beer for checking in. It Nigiri definitely has way too much rice on it. The fish was pretty fresh but sliced so paper thin I could see through it. Almost like they were trying to ration their fish. When the server delivered our combo tempura a freaking ant came with it!!! They don't do half rolls unless it's your very last roll. The rolls are the standard portion of rice but some looked scaled down. In the end the menu is pretty large with a lot of variety just don't expect large portions. Would I come back? Probably not due to the traveling distance. 2
Blue Agave has a really cool ambiance. I loved the Mexican influenced artwork on the walls and the netted off area when you walk in with all the lights that made me wish it was warm enough to sit outside underneath it. The service, however, was not the best. Service wasn't prompt when we walked in.  We weren't sure if you seat yourself or not, as there is no sign, but eventually someone noticed us and sat us down. Throughout the meal our server was attentive, but lacked enthusiasm. We tried the guacamole as an appetizer. I'm a harsh critic when it comes to my favorite food item so this may be a little brutal. It was fresh, but lacked flavor. It tasted like a mushed up avacado. I added my lime from my margarita to it and some salt and then it was much better. I would never order that again. Also, their house salsa served with their chips seemed a little off to me. I kept tasting a smoke flavor that made me think they actually added liquid smoke to it. I like liquid smoke in my barbecue, but please keep it away from my salsa!The Rio Grande margarita was okay. I really enjoyed it when I made sure to lick the salt first, but on it's own I thought it was a little too sweet. They have a special on their margaritas for $9.  I understand that they have a happy hour also with better deals that would be wise to check out.Intrigued, I tried their Ultimate Chimmichanga that claimed to be the best of the valley at one point in time.  It was huge! The pork was flavorful and I enjoyed the little 'kick' I got from the heat of the chipolte and jalepeno sauce served on it. I would not say it was the best I've ever had, but it had potential. For $15 you should definitely think about splitting this entree.  The prices seemed a little high for Mexican food.  However, you need to keep in mind that the location in general has overpriced restaurants surrounding it. Also, it's right across the street from Whole Foods. Enough said.I agree with some of the other reviews written, that this is not the go to place for Mexican food. I would try it again making sure I hit happy hour and the better deals during those time slots. They do have happy hour every day of the week, which makes it convenient for everyone. That is an ingenious idea. 3
Decent prices, authentic food, SPICYWhatever spice lvl you're used to getting, go down about 2-3. I thought I was manly and got a lvl 8 pad-see-ew... was literally tearing, my friend had a good laugh. It depends on the dish though as my friends chicken was fine (also an 8). Definitely recommend if your into Thai food 4
I am disappointed to see the quality of this place.It used to be one of my favourite hangouts before they had closed a few years ago.I went back for the first time since they reopened, and I was so sad.The interior decor and the food quality deteriorated to standard cafeteria level.I remember before when I used to love trying their new menu items because they offered a good combination of food quality and market experience.  Sadly not anymore.  Let me explain:- fruit flies and insects in the food.  At the pastry corner, while trying to choose which pastry to have, there were insects nesting and flying around the food.  I told the counter lady and she did not even seem surprised, as if this was normal.... so we went to the waffle counter- waffle counter was not any better:1) no whipped cream even though it is part of the deluxe waffle2) came undercooked so it was very soggy- poor customer service1) told the customer service about this experience and was pretty much stared at as if I was overly picky2) in spite of all these shortcomings they went ahead and charged for the gratuities (not sure why if we serve ourselves and the part that they are supposed to be in charge of such as cooking and cleaning up were not properly done)I am also disappointed to see that they automatically include gratuities in the bill.  NOt sure why since:- customers have to line up, pick up and carry our own food and utensils (the only part they are responsible for is cooking and cleaning up)- they don't cook properly (components of the dish are missing and the food is undercooked)- they don't clean up (some tables not cleaned up yet even though the restaurant was not so busy and lots of insects on the food)So needless to say I strongly discourage people from trying what used to be a good spot.For alternatives try other locations (Eaton, Sherway Garden, York Mills)  I will try as soon as I can and post reviews later 1
I came today 10/11/15 and both soda machine had no ice . We told the workers and nobody seemed to care. Bad service 1
I wouldn't come back here. I've visited JM's before, and had a great experience a few years back. However, visiting here for a friend's birthday, we got the privilege of having Jen as our waitress. Not only did we wait over an hour for our food, we had parties around us sit, order bad get our food before us. I ordered a burrito, which used to make Chipotle feel like a poor man's burrito. No, my burrito was a sorry excuse for a Taco Bell soft taco. And it was $11. Jen swapped it out for a Quesadilla, which was much better. However, Jen wanted to charge me an extra $1.50 for rice. At that point in time, there was no excuse to try to charge me another buck for rice. Just make me happy. The quesadilla did come with rice, and it was very good, however the waitress left me with a very bad taste in my mouth about Johnny Mango's. I had very good experiences here in the past, but as long as JM hires and employees people like Jen, I won't be coming back to this place, ever. I'm much better off going to the local liquor store, getting a quart of Jose, and grabbing a few chalupa's say TB. This place is a sorry excuse of Ameri-Mex, especially if you want to drop a couple hundo and have a good night out with some Margaritas. I did not have a good experience, and I only blame Jen half-heartedly. There was no manager asking about our experience, and there was one trying to make our experience better. Heading home, disappointed. 1
It's good pizza. Happy hour from 3-6 has good prices on both food and drinks. However I have to take a star away for the regular menu prices. We both felt our sicilian pizza was good but certainly not worth $32. We will probably return for strictly happy hour food and drinks but I doubt we'd go back at night. 4
Both my mom and I ordered the New slow roasted sliced sirloin and it ended up being tough, chewy, and too rare for us! Our baked potatoes were very over done and we couldn't eat those either. It was difficult to get our servers attention after he brought our food to the table and disappeared so my mom (who is handicapped) flagged down another server who was rude. We then asked to speak to the manager (who was on the phone.) When she finally came out to the hostess station, she said they could cook us something else, but she seemed annoyed and really didn't care, defending her cooks and time potatoes were in the oven. We walked out, without eating or wanting to chance another bad meal. Quality has really gone downhill and my husband and I used to rave about their steaks. And, my mom (who doesn't eat out much) was so disappointed after our experience at this location. 1
Quick service ... Tasty flavourful food... the chicken kabob is great and tender, tandoori special gives you a nice mix and the beef kabob is also very flavourful and tasty. Salad could use a little extra something something but is fresh ingredients at least for now. Great place if you need a quick bite. 4
Most of the food was good, the place is attractive enough mostly because it has that really new feel.I'd say in general though it was pretty blah and the ceviche was way too sour.  Service was pretty slow and uninspired.The one in Santa Monica was way better and i think cheaper too. 3
Worst experience and customer service ever...... Watch carefully bill, there were several surcharge I needed to talk and claim 2 times to fix it.... 1
I had mixed feelings about this place. My wife walked and it was packed, but we were seated right away. We noticed right away that it was really warm. Apparently the A/C was out which I know does happen so not totally knocking them on that. But we trying to escape the heat, so made it much more uncomfortable. I had a beer which was fine. My wife on the other hand tried a couple of their mixed drinks and they were awful. You couldn't taste any of the alcohol which made them super weak. For a $10 drink I would expect them to be much better. She tried two drinks and they were both disappointing. However, the food was really good. We tried the buffalo egg rolls and they were delicious. The dressing it came with was really tasty. We both tried different burgers and they were also good. The meat was perfectly cooked, but just too much bun. I ate half the burger and then just the other half without the bun. I am not a big guy, but I can usually grub. There was nothing wrong with the bun at all, but just be prepared for it. I probably would have been ok if we didn't have the appetizers, but I would take the egg rolls over the bun any day.For an $80 meal with drinks I thought it was just ok. Cooler tempature would have made the experience much more enjoyable. The right thing to do would have been to offer their customers some type of discount since we technically pay for the A/C and we didn't get any of it. However, we will never order any of their mixed drinks again. They seriously need to step that up.Overall this place looks like a cool place to watch a game. 3
this place has legit mexican fare, the burritos were great and tostadas were excellent too, I highly recommened this place over say a chain place like chipotle or taco del mar 4
We went for lunch and got there about 11:30.  No one was there except the owner Dan. Since we were early he was able to tell us about his business and his passion for making great pizza and other pasta dishes. He kept us mesmerized with his story of starting his pizza shop and his passion of making award winning food. Great food and an enjoyable owner. I live in West Newton so it takes awhile to get to Castle Shannon.  I will be back this time on Sunday when his mom makes her  gnocchi. Dan said to me when we're out we're out. So get there early. To bad he is not in Westmoreland county. Love Franco's. 4
Never have I had such a frustrating experience with a restaurant, or food in general.Ordered $40 worth of delivery tonight, which consisted of:1. Green Curry Beef2. Lemon Grass Soup3. Curry Shrimp4. Glass noodles.The delivery time was double that advertised. All in all, we waited for an hour and a half. When the food finally came, we were all so appalled!The curry shrimp, which was $13, consisted of a measly 5-6 shrimps. And they were just the regular supermarket frozen type you can get at Nofrills, not the "tiger shrimp" as advertised.The glass noodles were clumpy and oily. The chicken was dry and tasteless. The lemon grass soup ($6.99) had a few slices of mushrooms and 4-5 shrimps. It was also unacceptably spicy. We dumped the whole thing down the drain. The curry beef was simply disgusting. For $12, we got skimpy slices of low grade beef which were overcooked. 3/4 of the food ordered simply went down the drain/garbage chute. How this restaurant manages to survive with their abominable food and service is simply beyond me. But there are much better Thai restaurants in Toronto that are worthy of your patronage. This one simply does not make the grade by any measure. Disgusting. 1
The menu is classic Chinese restaurant; the food on the menu is authentic; and the staff here knows it. The menu is packed with stuff that if your mom didn't make it, you probably have no idea what is actually coming with the [insert meat here.] This place is great for a group (the larger the better) and even better if you are with others who enjoy Chinese food (make some Chinese friends if possible!).If you are going to a Chinese restaurant for the first time and this is the one you have stumbled upon it may be a little difficult to appreciate a gem like Fugu. You are not really supposed to eat the food and think: "omg, this was like the totally best thing I have ever eaten." You are not supposed to order something that you like and you are not supposed to order something for yourself. You order things that your friends like and you order a lot (more than you could possibly imagine eating). You eat a little bit of everything (you share!). And you focus on spending the meal with your mates and not with the food (talk!). Make sure you eat like a pig though because it is good to be bold towards food. At the end you have a great dining experience and a memory you can share with good friends for a long time. 4
My family and I went to Aji Sai last weekend for lunch. They renovated their FOTH and it looks pretty decent. They also printed new menus since the last time we were there. We've always enjoyed coming to this place in the past, but we had a different experience this time.Food:- Their wakame salad (a cooked seaweed salad) is tasty. - Their fish does not taste fresh and has a mushy texture- Their rolls have very very little flavour (the spicy salmon rolls has NO taste. It's not even a bit spicy).- They do not have shrimp tempura during lunch service (whereas Sushi on 7, Maison du Japon, Yang's Kitchen all do)- Soft drinks are not included in the price (whereas again, the other AYCE restaurants nearby do)Service:- Servers are indifferent-- I don't mind, as long as you bring the food- Servers don't bring food. I think this is the problem. It's happened more than once. They bring the first round quickly, but the second round either takes forever, or does not come AT ALL. We waited 30 minutes for the second round orders, and finally gave up because we got full from sitting and waiting. When we told the manager to cancel or order and to just give us the bill, he looked annoyed and asked us what we ordered, and when told that we don't want it anymore and just the bill, he walked off w/o saying anything. Had to ask for the bill a second time. Hmm.I'm a low maint. kind of guy. I ain't rich, I don't go to high class restaurants, I don't care about decor-- I just don't like getting shafted.By the way, it definitely is a popular and busy restaurant. But look around you when you go.. you'll see that going to Aji Sai for Japanese food is kind of like going to Mandarin for Chinese... 1
A welcoming environment, a kind, honest, and engaging staff, and an exceptional inventory of instruments and gear make Hilltop the best music shop I've seen in Jackson County. The enthusiastic care I've received from Wayne, Lily, Dave, and Connor has even inspired me to practice more often. As someone who needs an honest, no-pressure, fun, and well-equipped music shop in his life, finding Hilltop was like winning the lottery. 5
If you're a fan of poutine then I would recommend coming here. This is the only place I've been to in Toronto thus far that puts a decent amount of cheese on poutine. And I am a fan of cheese. If you agree that there's never enough cheese on your poutine without you having to pay extra- and even then it's still not enough cheese- then this might be your place. I've also tried their fish and chips and they weren't bad. I wasn't particularly fond of the wings I tried but my friends liked it so it's a matter of preference and flavour.My 4 Factors:Food: 35/50Service: 15/20Timeliness: 15/20Good Vibes: 10/10Total: 75/100- BTips:If you'd like to eat in then go to the one on St. Clair, the Kensington location doesn't have much seating and a lot of it is outside.Favourite Dish: PoutineRating System:A- Excellent (80+)B- Good (70-79)C- Tolerable (60-69)D- Something but not good (50-59)F- Not even if I was starving (49-)4 Factors:Food (50%)- How does it taste?Service (20%)- How was I treated?Timeliness (20%)- Did my food get there before I expired?Good Vibes (10%)- Could I relax and eat my food/atmosphere/space? 4
Hotpot is the perfect food to for this season. This is our regular hotpot spot my boyfriend and I usually go to because they offer wide range of sauces and food selection also their soup broths taste very homemade. For 15.99 (roughly)  AYCE after 10pm special during the weekdays  Kim Tao is def a must try. 3
Frozen hot chocolate! Amazing. Service? Sucked. 3
This is not a Lebanon's restaurant the food is ok but for the price NOT that's good at all the portion is very small for the price I will not be going there again 2
Adobado Tacos are THE BEST tacos they have here!!!  i'll go through 6 of them easy... the area here late at night is kinda sketchy... while lining up for tacos, the drunk people behind me got into a heated argument and nearly started a slug fest... too bad it didn't get ugly or else I would have lost my spot in line... 5
I've been eating here now for over 4 years from highschool until now my sophomore year in college, and I have to say they are on their way out because at one point their food was to be reckoned with and now it's just bleh. Last time I was there I was really disappointed by the service. One lady working and I seemed to bother her to give her business. 3
I'm going to go with the 3.5 stars as well.We walked in without a reservation and got a great window seat right away.  I really did like the room, it worked and was warm.  I had the asparagus soup which tasted well nothing like asparagus but it was a winner because the scallop in it was fabulous.  There was also a potato puree involved.  For my entree I had the salmon with crab, bearnaise  sauce, fingerling potatoes and asparagus.  Now my fault for ordering the asparagus soup with potato puree and then having repeat ingredients on my entree.  It kind of peeves me when restaurants have repeat ingredients.  It's a personal thing.  I kind of instantly found the bearnaise sauce a little cold but moved on.  The food was good, old school good.  Like it reminded me of something I'd have years ago at dinner.  Classic French, but I did like it!I found the service a little stuck between two different places. They tried to give good, fine dining service but I found these little upsells that I wasn't really buying into.  Like coming over and trying to sell us a Cognac flight after we both said we didn't drink Cognac.  Weird.  Also giving us INSANE pours of our wine.  Who does that?  We won't drink me just because it is in our glass.  Lastly, the cheese plate seriously needs to be worked on.  Great concept but really generic cheeses.  There were about 7 different types that were the size of practically my fingernail.  They were things like "gouda" and "white cheddar" - I have no idea what they were doing on there.  There was also this one cheese that they made look like a flower.  It was HORRIBLE and quite possibly the worst cheese I have ever tried.  Overall I did like it for a Vegas restaurant.  I could just really do without the little upsells they sneak in or maybe not be so obvious about it. 4
$1.50 TACOS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yum!This place was recommended to us by a local. We asked where to get a good cheap taco and this place hit the nail on the head. Two hippies are on the right track with this place. It's a bit small and it took about 20 min to get my food (they were really busy) but it was worth it. If I lived in Phoenix I would come here daily. A word about the fish tacos...they are good but seem as though they might use canned fish instead of fresh grilled chunks like most places. Considering the price this is acceptable!The drinks and baked goods looked great though I haven't yet tried any. I'll save those for next time I'm in town. 4
Dr kalifa has done excellent work on me mouth in the past and my treatment was of the highest caliber so I called for help again on a Sunday and he promptly returned my call in 60 min. I explained to him  my Genral dentist said " next time I need a root canal " and I was in PAIN!Dr k, said he "can't help till Wednesday" and gave me the option of waiting or seeing dr lammot the next day? I chose dr Lamont due to high pain, and I was not disappointed! Like dr kalifa, dr L gave me confidence, options and a detailed explanation of what we needed to do to complete a DOUBLE ROOT CANAL! All staff were happy, knowlagable, clean and I was all done in 1.5 hours.My mouth was bruised for 4 days and it was painless until the Novocain wore off  but, the process was! ( Discloseure here my brother in law, went to and graduated dental school with dr K but practices in San Fran  and he reffered me to dr K years ago. It has no weight on my review!) 5
very disappointing I ordered xlarge pizza for $10.99 I got a large 8 pieces is a large .greasy pizza ! won't go back. 2
I really liked this hooters. i am visiting, and the hooters from my town isn't that great. Hot girls and decent priced beer. I plan to go back before I leave. 5
Chuck was great for my husband and I. Allowed us to lay on many mattresses even though we walked in at closing. (We didn't realize it until I started to Yelp) Chuck even left us alone to talk and go back and fourth from mattress to mattress. The experience was so enjoyable without any pressure. 4
If you are a one of those people who say "Nothing tastes as good as being thin". This place is for you. You will leave guilt free and probably still hungry. Millenials will love the ordering process, the food is as good as sprouts and foofy can be. The whole corner patio area is awesome and having to share it with other restaurants makes Kravings's confidence in their menu worth a try. I liked it and I am not one of those skinny butt bike shorts wearing guys. You should too. 4
We purchased a groupon for dinner.  We got married there several years ago and felt it was a great way to revisit.  We were so disappointed!  The view was spectacular as well as the mansion but our food was mediocre for such a nice place.  We were sat by the wine closet and were interrupted numerous times.  Clearly there was available tables we could have otherwise dined at.  When our coffee came at the end of dinner it was cold and had been sitting for quite awhile.  We WON'T be back for the food. :( 2
My food was great, as it has been at all First Watch Restaurants. Highly Recommend! The service at this location is absolutely HORRIBLE! I will never go back here. It was as if the management purposefully did not train the staff on customer service and as I received poor service I watched the staff sit all together and each their shift meal while I waited to pay my bill. I will most definitely go and eat at other locations but NEVER AGAIN at this location. 1
It took me  3 or 4 months to find the right Auto Body Repair.After getting repair estimates from other repair shops that were ridiculousI stop in at Northern Auto & Equipment to get a estimate..The price was fair so I said ok I will have them fix my car.WOW!!!  when I pick up my car, its was perfect!  The body work was done right, the paint matched perfectly.Everybody was friendly and they answered all my questionsand the price was exactly what they said it would cost.I'm a HAPPY customer...if your looking to get your Autobody work on your car..go there and see for yourselfAlso, my car was fixed in a timely matter..Roger 5
They did a good job...I tend to judge it not just by the result but by how much attention the guy is giving your car.  He worked hard, and the interior looked great.  Would definitely return 4
Excellent food, with so-so service. I've been here several times and have never been disappointed in my food. The food is excellent and the portions are always very generous. My two favorites have been the lasagna and the chicken parmigiana. My husband and I always order a side salad and split it because they're so huge!The bar leaves a lot to be desired. I have not been too impressed with the bartenders-- always lacking in personality as well as craftsmanship.Waitstaff are much like the bartenders... Just so-so. Seem to lack any real personality. 3
Love this place!! The food reminds me of Thanksgiving back home. So one thing that really stood out to me..I called to see if they had banana pudding. The lady answered and told me yeah. Cool..we head to the restaurant. About two minutes later I receive a call back and it's the lady from NaNas and she says, "I'm so sorry to be calling..just wanted to let you know that I went to double check and were actually out of banana pudding right now. I didn't want you to drive all this way just to find out we didn't have it". So this may seem pretty simple, but it was a big deal to me. She didn't have to call back - she was so nice and personable. We still ate there of course lol. I was too stuffed for desert anyway. But really friendly people, gave food suggestions and samples. Would recommend. 5
I really enjoyed my meal here. I opted out of getting a beer, as i had a wicked hangover at that point, and needed some good old fashioned BBQ to sooth my soul. My friend and i both ordered the pulled pork sandwich, with slow cooked onions to top it off. I would consider myself to be a connoisseur, as ever since my mom got a slow cooker, when i was 6, I have loved her rendition, and a bevy of other restaurants try at it. This pulled pork was fantastic, although a little cooler than i would like, the taste was fantastic, and the bun held up to the last bite. A basket of the yukon gold fries as a side, it was a fantastic lunch. The barbeque sauce is absolute top notch, and the service was great. Two monstrous biker'esque gentlemen beside us, ordered the B.B king platter, and at a wopping 55 dollars looked a little understacked. They seemed to have enjoyed it though. If your ever on bayview and crave some bbq, i'm pretty confident you will enjoy it as much as i did, as far as pulled pork goes. 4
OK, what is everyone else seeing here that I didn't?  Yeah, I went for a weekday lunch instead of for Sunday brunch but shouldn't it still be at least a good experience?On the plus side, the physical space is special - lots of exposed brick, high ceilings, worn wood floors, lots of windows for natural light.  The restaurant was only about 1/3 full at 12:30 pm on a Wednesday.  It is definitely NOT handicapped accessible.  The only access to the space is a very long, very steep flight of stairs.  (Even the server told us that cases of food, wine and beer kegs have to be lugged up those stairs, there isn't even a freight elevator in the building.)I ordered the potato bisque (a menu staple) and the chef salad special.  Our server forgot my soup and brought it out after she'd served my entree salad.  The meats in the salad seemed like cold cuts - in fact, rather than being served julienned or chopped in the salad, they were simply layered on - rounds pieces of cold cuts in the salad!  The ranch dressing was likely homemade but was runny in texture and bland in flavor.  My chocolate cake dessert was okay - but not $7 worth of okay.My companion enjoyed the crab cake on top of an otherwise ordinary looking salad and she raved about the tiramisu.Our server does get points for assisting my companion with a wine selection.  She brought out two bottles, let my aunt try both and make a selection.  She even let the unchosed sample stay on the table instead of quickly whisking it back to the bar.Parking is a private lot off of South Blvd - but it's very easy to miss the entrance to the parking lot - and once you miss it, you can't access it from any of the neighboring parking lots either!Maybe I'll try again with a Sunday brunch - but the experience will have to be world class amazing to erase my memory of this lunch. 2
TERRIBLE! TERRIBLE! TERRIBLE Customer service: TERRIBLE They also do not know how to do nails, they do a bad job and complain when u tell them to redo, they need to shut down. Expensive and just a waste of money and time 1
Good food...but won't return because they sell shark fin items. And I don't believe in finning a shark and because I don't know how it was harvested (properly or not) I won't be returning to eat there. 2
Those yuca fries ... absolutely delicious with the dip.Actual chicken is also very good, especially when combined with their sauces. They have daily deals as well which I suggest trying. 4
I'm a manager of a health care office,I dropped off my prescriptions and the girl that works in the pharmacy took down all my insurance information. Told me to comeback in an hour, when I came back not only did they not have my prescription ready, but I was told they don't expect my insurance, they should have told me that in the beginning! The manager of the pharmacy then tells me that she will call Walmart to transfer my prescription to them and I would be able to pick them up the next day. So the next day I go to walmart to pick up my prescriptions and the Walmart pharmacy tells me that is was never sent!!  I go back to walgreens to see what is going on and the pharmacist tells me that my medicine is not that important that I can buy them over the counter and she can not give back my prescriptions!! Do not go to this walgreens this place is incompetent and very un professional. My health company will not recommend this dump ever!!!! 1
Barhop is an excellent west end option for those seeking great beer and food. The garlic doughnuts are heaven and Mussel Monday's an affordable, awesome treat! They bring in a lot of exclusive US craft beers and some great local ones as well. Be prepared for a long wait on a table if you are arriving anytime after 6PM until 10 or so. 3
best outdoor patio!  this is the best pizza I have ever had and my all time favorite.  everything is great- service, food, drinks and dessert! we tried all 3 pizza desserts and it was hard to chose a favorite, they were all delicious.I strongly recommend this place! 5
I was really excited to go here, as it has been hyped up time and time again by my friends.  This is why I am so shocked at how bad the food ended up being.  Something must have happened that has caused this place to go downhill.  Lobster pasta appetizer - This was very bland, very mediocre.  Not a terrible dish, but not what I would expect at this caliber of restaurant.Branzino - Fish with Chicken Pate and Baguette.  This was the weirdest dish I may have ever had.  The fish itself came out mostly whole and was dry and bland and not seasoned.  There was no sauce, yet it had a huge loaf of bread broken in half and laid on top of the fish.  Then, for no apparent reason, there was a scoop of dry chicken pate on the side.  Three dry items and no sauce, liquid, or flavoring.  Hands down the most disappointing dish ever ordered at what is supposed to be an upscale/modern restaurant.  Hanger Steak - The hanger steak itself was cooked a little more rare than the medium rare that we ordered, but no big deal.  It was a good cut of meat, but again very bland.  Could've used SOME salt.  There were some vegetables on the plate that were overcooked, under-seasoned, and uninspiring.  Desert - Chocolate cake with banana puree and ice cream.  This was a tiny little cake, just the right amount for a desert if you ask me, but was so boring that four people didn't even bother finishing the dish.All in all - I can't believe for a place with salt in the title, how under seasoned and bland everything was.   I am giving two stars for the atmosphere - it is a beautiful restaurant.  Given that the reviews have dropped off over time, I hope that the owners and staff can reclaim the magic that they'd once apparently had at this place.  I am holding out hope! 2
After much searching for a good mechanic for my imported A class Mercedes, I found McNally's. These guys spent the time and asked the right questions. Five different mechanics prior could not solve the problem. McNally's is brilliant! Cheers! 5
HTO Park is great! I particularly like the urban beach--what I come from. It's right near the lake, across from the Rogers Centre/Skydome. It's got these great yellow umbrellas and white Muskoka chairs so you can sit and also have shade. Bring a book and just park yourself for the day. There's usually skateboarders or bikers/runners in the area, and people walking along the water, so it's great for people watching. If the beach/sand area is packed, you can hang out on the grassy little hills.Tip: Come before 12, before it gets busy, to grab chairs (which are chained to the umbrellas). Even if you can't grab a chair, just throw down a blanket on the sand and enjoy the lake views. There's also a water fountain nearby if you get thirsty and want to fill up. 4
my first time in value v. i like to help a cause so i don't mind shopping but what to buy??? i was shocked by their clothing prices, all smelly, dirty my fingers got sticky from dirt, 35 bucks for a non-brand torn garment??? yucki bought vases for my plants nothing else was in a buy-able condition, i would never dress my kid from here, holes and stains in the clothes, if target and walmart so cheap then why not buy new, the toys were extremely dirty or broken, they sold kids chairs for the same price you buy new and they were black from years of filth!!! i also saw they were selling a 15 yr old OLD and USED ELECTRIC SHAVER omg, full of germs, would you use it on your skin and risk infection??? 2
Fantastic sushi...fresh and yummy.  Large portion and selection. Also offers all-you- can-eat for $26.95 for 60 minute dinner. Tempura very good, too. 5
We went here based on a recommendation from Cleveland Magazine's feature on regional diners.  It's only a few miles from home, and it's got that classic, shiny, stainless steel look that epitomizes the American diner.There was nothing wrong with this place, but there was nothing outstanding about it either.  Inside, it's so immaculate that you get the feeling that you're sitting down in a chain restaurant with a 50s diner theme.  If you've ever been to a Ruby's Diner, then you already know what the interior looks like in here.I got a cheese omelet and my partner got sausage and biscuits.  Both were fine.  The service was fine.  The prices were fine.  Everything was fine.  But nothing was great. 3
Ordered two pizzas from here recently.  Not my taste, overly greasy and layered with salty garlic butter. I enjoy the simple taste of pizza and prefer not to have a layer of fat and salt overpower everything else. Crust also soft and droopy. 2
