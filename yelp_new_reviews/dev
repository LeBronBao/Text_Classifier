The package states that the 1500 thread count sheets "feel like Egyptian cotton" but they are in fact only microfiber (which isn't stated anywhere on the package).  Luckily I bought them on sale ($40 for a queen set) so I don't feel too scammed.  We'll see how they hold up. 2
A seasonable evening with the lady brought me here.  The concept is great, the menu has a diverse offering for all tastes and appetites.  We tried the cherry bombs and salmon roll to start.  Both were unique in their own right, but they tasted great!  They have a chefs menu that changes daily based on seasonal ingredients.  This was fantastic.  Great spot for a date, intimate  lighting and cozy seating.  Worth a second trip. 4
1 star deduction for the quality of food they served with the price they are charging. It definitely didn't worth the $120 omakase.   2nd star deduction was the extremely poor services.  It took us 3 hrs to eat honestly 5 real courses, on avg 20 mins wait for dish.  The waitresses didn't seem to know what they were doing.  We ordered a bottle of sake,  and we have to ask 3 times for them to bring it and our table was next to the kitchen looking at them running around for nothing.  3rd star deduction was the portion of each dish was extremely small.  I am a very small eater, weighting 93 lbs ands I want full at all. I do not recommend any one to try until the chef improve their food and services some day.  Don't be cheated. 2
I brought a bunch of winter clothes in for cleaning at the end of last winter, and finally today on a cold day, i took it out to wear it, only to find out that the belt was missing. The coat looks very odd without the belt and I was very upset. I went to the store and they had it, and the guy working there had the audacity to tell me that I didnt give him a chance to give it back to me. Really? When you drop off x number of clothing for cleaning, you would expect the same number to come back with all the right parts. He is rude and i may have been lucky this time, but when there are so many cleaners around, i will not be taking the chance again.On an unrelated note, a year ago, i brought a beautiful dress in to get it altered. He said i can come back in a few days on the Friday, which fell on the day before a big event that I specifically bought the dress for. I go in on the Friday, only to find out that the "dress was too complicated". He waited all those days to tell me the day before the event, leaving me no chance to take it anywhere else!!!! 1
Great ambience and good service. Food is OK in average but nothing to write home about. Nice place to handle on weekends in the West Island. 3
Overall, this was a good experience.  I was amazed at how easy the whole process was.  They picked us up at our hotel, and 30 minutes later, we were driving out in a 2015 Lamborghini Huracan.  My big complaint is that the car was dirty - inside and out.  When I mentioned it to the guy working there, he took it out back and did something with it, but he didn't clean it.  Then, when he came back and I mentioned how dirty the interior was, he went and got some glass cleaner and started spraying down the leather - it was kinda funny actually.  Don't get me wrong, the car was not filthy, but not as clean as it should have been.  If you are paying $1,500 a day to rent a Lambo, it should be spotless on delivery.This was a great experience mostly because the car was awesome, not because the service was that great.  Also, we aware that there is a 22% tax on top of whatever price you are quoted. 3
As I was pulling out of my drive way I noticed my passenger rear tire was flat. After stopping by QT to put air in, I noticed a massive nail... sure enough just my luck. This was the third time the same tire has had a nail in. So I look it to Discount and to my surprise there was no wait, they helped me right away. Quick and easy process and the best part it was free. They gave me a whole brand new tire since the hole wasn't repairable. I don't know why it was free, I never bought any warranty. I am assuming the tires themselves have a warranty (the tire was less than a year old). I will never buy my tires from anywhere else ever again. I am a customer for life! 5
I think its GREAT, with a capital G. First discovered them when I was in Nevada. I'm a vegetarian so was expecting the typical veggie sub. Boy was I pleasently surprised. They have four different veggie selections including a veggie turkey sub., veggie cheesesteak, and veggie burger. I've only had the veggie turkey and veggie cheesesteak.  The cheesesteak was just O.K. and I wouldn't get that again, but the turkey was fantastic.  The negatives is that they can be slow at times, and prices are a bit high, but I can live with that.  Definitely one of my favorite sub shops. 5
Very good, very fresh!    The menu is not as large as I would like, but they were able to make new things on the spot with the ingredients they have which is pretty awesome. The staff/chef were really nice, the place was clean and the food was good. 4
Food was excellent and they served lunch in the form of sandwiches. Drinks were good too. Coffee was delicious. Wish they had more pastries though. Chairs werent that comfortable, and it was very busy in there...not much privacy at all. They had a shower facility and very clean bathrooms. I had access to united club, but chose the club instead because of way better yelp reviews. I was not disappointed. 4
So I finally got the chance to try out this place, drove by couple of times and had friends said it was really good and they been coming here since kid. It was a hot Sunday afternoon in Phoenix so me and a friend was thinking what's better things to do than get some ice cream.. This place definitely be here awhile and you can tell, as we walking in we were greeted and was seated down. The place have a 60s look to it and it was quite unique, even the employees dress according to and compliment to the store. All I wanted was some ice cream and was the reason I came here, I got the 3 dip homemade waffle bowl with mint chocolate chip, cookie and cream, and caramel pecan. I got to say this was one of the best ice cream I have tasted in a long time. Plus I didn't know 3 dip and each dip was two scoop. It was very felling. The employee was very attentive and nice. The price for ice cream was really good for the amount. I am very please with it. I am looking forward to come back and see what else they got. One thing that caught my eyes was like a bucket of ice cream that was over $100, sounded very interesting. But man who could eat that much ice cream anyways.. Anyone who haven't check out this place should give it a try, I mean I liked it. I haven't try anything other than their ice cream which was great.One other thing that I really like is they close at 11 on Friday and Saturday which is awesome, now I have a place to stop by after work for ice cream.WILL BE BACK AGAIN. 4
I've seen most of the mainstream shows in Vegas, and this is my favorite. 5
This place was excellent!!!  Super cute, modern ambience.  We went on a Friday night and a jazz band played some nice music.  The music was not overwhelming either.  You can easily hear everyone talk.There were 9 of us and we got a nice table in the side room which gave us our own space.  I'd have to say that my only compliment was the size of my meal.  I got the salmon with pea risotto.  The portion was very small.  But, boy, did it taste fantastic.  I don't even like peas and I loved the risotto.  I noticed the steak meals were well-sized portions.  I had a salad with dressing that was homemade.  Absolutely delicious.  And then I split the brownie dessert with someone.  They add ice cream to it, which is a nice touch.  And, last by not least, I am a sucker for giving back to causes.  I love the concept of this place.  I would definitely go back again! 4
When I enjoy the appetizers more than my entree, and have to wait a substantial amount of time between appetizers to my entree I think there is a problem.I usually don't like to rate bad, but personally I didn't enjoy my dinner.It seems like a great place to nibble and drink mostly. 2
We did not have the noodles but we did try the wings (very tasty) and pork on buns (also excellent).  Nice place for a quick and easy meal but not that healthy for those watching their waistlines! 3
Ugh. Totally frustrated. I gave them my iPhone 3GS which was still operating, but the backlight was no longer able to light the screen. (So I could see see messages, take calls, etc, but had to read it in direct light otherwise couldn't make out the words)  Anyway, they took the phone, opened and found water damage (weird), and then returned the phone to me and it no longer worked AT ALL. If I had known they would have caused irreversable damage, I would have saved all my photos, downloaded contacts, etc.  PLUS - they charged me $20 to pick it up because they "spent time cleaning out the water damage" - whatever they did to it completely rendered my phone useless.So frustrated. I'd suggest the iPhone repair place on Maryland near Wigwam, in Silverado Ranch. I've used them before and they are credible, friendly and professional. I should have gone back! 1
Stay away from this train wreck of a hospital , ER is very unprofessional and I can't believe they can treat people that way. Doctors don't have any idea what they are doing, but they will take your money and if you don't like the way you where treated, to bad and good luck filing a complaint or talking to any one, they are the cricket of hospitals and if you have ever had cricket and had any problems you will be familiar with the way they do things at st lukes.  NEVER AGAIN ILL DIE FIRST BEFORE DEAL WITH THOSE LOOSERS!!! 1
I'm loving all the new food treasures in Downtown lately!  This joint is walking distance from my dad's office, so we stopped in the other day.  How fitting to have old courtroom decor and movie posters from Inherit The Wind!I immediately decided on the brown rice bowl with a Limonata and my dad ordered a wrap.  We were the only ones enjoying a late lunch, but the staff made us feel welcome without that "we close in 30 minutes" vibe, so it was quite enjoyable.I'm looking foward to my next meeting Downtown...hopefully around lunchtime so I can make a stop in again.  Also, this could be the perfect spot for a Saturday brunch! 4
Certified Tire used to be the best there is-- trustworthy, competent and reasonably priced-- and so I have been a faithful client of theirs since about 1987. But in the last 2 or 3 years their standards have dropped-- Frank just doesn't seem to care any more. Probably 4 out of 5 times I have had to go back to the shop after service, in order to get something fixed that wasn't done right. And in the last couple of years there have been a couple of major things that they have slipped up on, and he just refuses to take any responsibility for them. For example, he always kept track of routine service intervals for me and I could rely on him to let me know when service was needed. Recently my transmission began making noise, and on checking I realized the fluid had not been changed for about 170,000 km. His only response? "Good thing it wasn't a Ford-- it wouldn't have survived." In another incident, I had asked them to replace some dash lights that had burned out. Despite three tries the lights they installed are still mismatched. But more serious, following the last time they worked on it, a custom disconnect switch I had had them install a couple of years before was no longer working. Though they are the only people who had ever touched the car, they refused to acknowledge that either the original connection was poorly done, so came apart when disturbed, or the guy replacing the lights had damaged it. All Frank was willing to do was unplug a couple of connectors under the hood to do what I had installed the disconnect for. When I finally took the car to another shop to have them look at it, I found that in doing the work-around, they had also torn some rubber protective skirts around the connectors, so now I have to replace those as well.  It is really hard to give up on somebody I have trusted with my and my wife's cars for decades, but I am not going back. 2
More of a take out place but there is couple of tables u can eat there. Mostly for take out, I would say its pretty good. the girls up front are efficient.  The prices are reasonable.  love there eggroll.  I have tried other places in Huntersville for takeout. I still end up coming back to Jin Jin. 3
Sent my Daughter for an oil change.  They stripped the oil pan drain plug when putting back in.  Instead of replacing which I would of happily paid for they put the same plug in and then applied epoxy to seal.  When she went in for her next change at a different location they would not change since the plug was epoxied in place.  They told here to go back to this store to remedy.When she went back they said they could not do anything and recommended going to a dealer - even though they had caused the problem.Stick with the places that hire quality people to do the work.  The $10 an hour high school dropout they call a technician will do more damage than good. 1
Horrible experience! The barber who cut my hair didn't know how to cut my hair or didn't want to cut my hair. I had been wearing a cap all day he didn't wet my hair to straighten it. He just used clippers to cut my hair. When I got home and combed my hair it seemed like a blind guy had cut my hair. I had to cut my own hair to fix the horrible cut I got at fade specialist. Don't recommend at all. 1
WORST restaurant experience EVER! My wife and I visited Pure Spirits for the first time with two other female friends of ours (our party consisted of 4 females, ages 25-32). We drove in from Buffalo and arrived in the Distillery District around 1:30pm. We enjoyed one beer each at the Mill Street Brewpub along with a meat and cheese platter. We then headed to Pure Spirits around 3:30pm. We were genuinely excited to try the oyster bar out! As we sat down at the bar, we were immediately impressed with Tyler, the oyster expert. He shared much of his oyster knowledge with us, and we were greatly intrigued by the oyster selection (and education provided by Tyler). We ordered a basket of sweet potato fries to accompany our oysters. The food in general was good. We closed out our $150 check and tipped an additional $80. Three of us work in the service industry as bartenders/servers, so we always appreciate a knowledgeable and friendly server like Tyler. We truly enjoyed the friendliness of the wait staff in the beginning.After closing the tab, we put on our baseball hats and prepared to head to Rogers Center for the Blue Jays game. My wife and I (we're both women) hugged and took a photo together in the restaurant. Then, my friend and I headed outside for a cigarette. We spent about 25 minutes outside talking to other tourists before heading back in to the restaurant. The new bartender coming in (who appeared to be 13 years old) was less than pleased to be introduced to us as we ordered our second beer.Before we knew it, a server we hadn't yet seen came over to inform us that we were "cut-off". We laughed, thinking he was joking, but he was not. After asking to speak with the manager, she finally appeared with a large security guard in tow. The manager, Nadia, offensively accused us of being "intoxicated" and told us we had to leave. One could imagine our surprise. After all, we had only consumed one beer and one shot each over the span of 2 1/2 hours we spent in Pure Spirits. I could understand being asked to leave if we were vulgar and disrespectful around other patrons in the restaurant, but I can assure you this was not the case. Nadia was abrasive, offensive, ignorant, and condescending. She was rather speechless once she realized that we were actually completely coherent and quite sober. We coached her in how she could've better handled the situation and advised her she would've been wise to approach the situation like a professional instead of treating us like common criminals. I doubt such clientele would tip $80 on a $150 oyster tab.Moral of the story: If you are ever dumb enough to patronize such a poorly managed establishment, do not order ANY alcohol! You will immediately be labeled as a belligerent troublemaker. Also, do not hug anyone of the same sex. Gays and lesbians will not be tolerated. Expect to be accused of being "intoxicated" (probably even if you're only drinking water) and escorted out. 1
We had the a la acarte, and sat on the other side.  The other side was for all you can eat with the "cook your own meat grill".  The service was good and fast; which is what you expect at most asian restaurants.  The bulgogi was really good.  I have been looking for a place that had the same taste and flavor as the one back home; and this one is quite similar.The only thing was the cleanliness of the restaurant.  It wasn't in tip-top shape.  And, I don't like eating while I have to shoo a fly away.  Next time, I may just have the order to go.  Ohh, and another thing..it was a little pricey than I had expected.  Typically, you can judge at how much a restaurant will be based on looking at the restaurant.  I think the bulgogi was $14?!  A little steep. 3
Was so excited to hear that diner deluxe was opening a second location close to home!  I am a big fan of the one on edm trail. However this location does not live up its reputation to the original location.We didn't have any issues with the service here like others, in fact the service was actually good.The restaurant is beautiful over looking the pond at aspen landing.The food though... Doesn't compare to their first location, they have the same menu items but prepared slightly different such as the meat loaf hash they don't do the sweet potato hash and just plain hash and the taste of their other items just don't taste as great.  Kinda blah. Also don't understand why they would use bottled tropicana oj and charge a premium for it, should be freshly squeezed for the price they charge.  Taking a look at the dinner menu...don't think I would return to try that anytime soon cause it's been Aspenized, too high for too little. 2
I have ordered flower arrangements and plants from Bobbie's Flowers for years and I have never been disappointed. They remember special occasions and gave me a courtesy call to ask if I wanted to re-order flowers. Their arrangements are absolutely gorgeous and have always been lovely and fresh! They are so friendly on the phone when I place an order and always accommodate my request by making suggestions for arrangements. I have placed orders at the last minute and their delivery service is spot on and they delivered on time. Call Bobbie's Flowers if you are looking to send someone special flowers and make their day! 5
This was my 2nd trip with my grandchildren to Altimateair, 1701 Lincoln Highway, North Versailles, PA.  While completing the required Liability Waiver is time consuming I understand this necessity, but is there a more time efficient way to complete this process for those visiting the same facility with the same children?  Is there a modified version that returning customers can access to help expedite entering the facility.  This is a minor issue. While I totally understand the company's need to protect themselves, my question is what kind of training if offered to the staff interacting with parents and guardians upon entering the facility.  It is very comforting to see many, many staff on-site watching and guiding children as they play.  My question is, are staff only trained in policing and how to safely use the equipment?  It appears additional training is needed for those interacting with parents and guardians of children as they enter the facility.  There was no explanation of what is required to access some of the experiences offered at the facility, which experiences were out of order, when or if it is necessary to have staff accompany those wanting access to some experiences.  The staff are more interested in engaging in conversation with other staff and appeared bothered when asked to explain how to ensure children get the most out of their experience.  My twin 9 year olds only had access to the trampoline.  According to a curt response from various staff, when I asked if they had access to other experiences they were not old enough for the Jungle Gym, they didn't have the proper shoes for the Rock Climbing experience all of the other experiences were closed.  What did $16 each for All Access cover?  When I asked to speak to a manager, I was questioned why I needed to speak to a manager.  So I tried another approach, is it possible to get a manager's contact information either in writing or a business card, again I was asked why I needed to contact a manager and that they would answer any questions I had. To be honest, I'm sure you're aware since the facility caterers to children of various ages, sizes and levels of excitement trying having a conversation at the sign-in/payment area to address my concerns would not have been helpful .  When a "manager" did approach me and I asked him for a business card, so I could attempt to have a private conversation with him or someone from Altimate Air he couldn't understand why I didn't want to have a discussion in the middle of chaos.  He explained he needed to go "upstairs" to get either a business card or some type of contact information.  I never saw him again.  While I recognize your facilities are staffed by teen-agers and young adults, it is your responsibility to train them to interact with the public and have the knowledge to explain all the experiences offered by the facility.  Since my grandchildren did not have access to all of the experiences available at the facility we should have been charged accordingly.  After giving the facility all of my personal information and signing away my legal rights a verbal explanation at the time of payment, of what the facility offers from informed and knowledgeable staff doesn't seem like to much to ask. 1

I love this place.  Me and a buddy have had literally every pizza on the menu.  We go for lunch and split a pizza, get water to drink, we're out for $9 each.  You really cannot go wrong, and half of the pizza (the normal size, not the personal size they introduced a month ago) is usually too much food.  What we usually do now is get the spicy salami (...i think it was salami) as an added item on 1 of the pizzas.  I then add sauce and a mix of parmesan and pepper flakes.  My friend doesn't add the sauce.  They also have those little spicy peppers from Italy you can add yourself, I eat 3-4 of these and love it.  But they are spicy, be warned.Last time we went they just started offering salads, and the manager just came and gave us 2 salads!  We don't know them, are not in the family, but they are just really nice.  Service here is always super fast, which is what you want at lunch.  I can't usually afford more than 45 minutes or so, including drive time, and this place fits the bill with an 8+ minute drive.Now this place is authentic, so don't come expecting Dominos or Pizza Hut style pizza.  This is for people who want to enjoy some of the best of Italian ingredients and methods. Of course it is true that Americans are usually disappointed by Italian pizza, I had a typical tourist pie in Rome once (with the anchovy) and was not impressed.  A pizza I had in Perugia was somewhat better, but in general I stuck to pasta the rest of my time on those visits.  Alino's pizza is how I always wanted authentic Italian pizza to be - authentic ingredients prepared well, not leaving hungry. 5
This is a great little Filipino Restaurant located in the Southeast area of Las Vegas.  The servers are very friendly.  The food is flavorful.  Highly recommended. 5
Went here on a Saturday night. Asked for dry sake got the sweetest one they had after waiter said it was very dry. Purchased 2 rolls and some Nigiri and sash. 1 roll was great the other looked like they stuffed it with pre-chewed fish from previous patrons and tasted as such. On my third piece giving it the college try I found a piece of bone an inch and a half long. At this point I just stopped eating and left. My first visit with my wife was sub par and this followed. I have had sushi in Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan and all over the US..trust me this is bad. How it receives good reviews is amazing. But perhaps this is why Applebee's gets 4 stars. 1
Went at 8 pm so can't say if the donuts would have been the freshest, but they were pretty good. Not the best I've ever had, but I'm still new to the area so maybe they are  good for around here. Upon entering there were two people on staff...one gave us a glare like oh great people. She shoved a donut in her mouth and continued whatever she was doing. The second employee walked over and was totally enthusiastic and pleasing. We ordered a dozen variety of donuts. I also got a mocha cappuccino. I was really  disappointed though, I thought it would be a real cappuccino, but it was just a flavored machine. It still tasted decent though. So the donuts were all pretty good...the chocolate Bavarian being my favorite filled. The donuts were light and airy inside and the frosting was just enough. 4
The food is fresh and tasty.  I'm having second thoughts about whether it's worth the wait or not.  It's typically chaos by the door when trying to check in and the staff has no idea who is next. 3
Fantastic food!!! I got the vegetarian pho with tofu. Got there 5 minutes before closing and they still sat us! Incredible food and incredible people. 5
"grossest hostess"Okay, so you know when you go into  place and it's close to closing time?  You aren't sure whether the staff will be cordial and inviting or straight up rude.  Well my wife and I went into Millers at 9:15 pm for dinner.  The hostess was incredibly rude directly off of the bat.  she said "ughhhh you know it's close to closing time, right"?  my wife said, "what time do you close"?  The older, short blond curly haired hostess with glasses said "we close at ten".  TEN???  TEN????  They weren't closing for 45 minutes!!!!  This was the second time she did this to us and it will be the last because they have lost our business for good.  We even heard a phone ring at quarter to ten and she didn't even answer the phone, she just picked it up and snarled "closed" and hung up on the person!  Our server however, was spot on and the food was decent but the hostess or manager or whatever she was left the worst taste in our moths and spoiled Millers Seafood forever.  If you go to Miller's Seafood and you see her at the front, turn and run! 2
Wow!  Talk about a rare find these days.  An auto repair shop that does not try to intimidate a women when she brings her vehicle in for repair.  One of  my vehicles did not pass an emissions test here in Mesa.  I had no idea what was wrong.  I needed to find an auto repair shop to bring the vehicle too and Shane's was recommended.  I brought the vehicle in and they fixed the problem with my vehicle and even brought it back to emissions testing for me and it passed?  The were extremely reasonable and very helpful,.  If you need any type of auto repair, an oil change or just a question answered, do yourself a favor and call.  You will not be disappointed. 5
The food is not worth the price. Service is okay but for the price you are paying, they should do better. The tasting menu is 145 bucks minimum but the food is worth more like $65. I am extremely disappointed. Probably the worst I have tasted in a 5 star hotel n Vegas. 2
Took my sister on her first Vegas trip and wasn't sure where to stay and since i haven't stayed here yet, why not! So glad we did cause she loved it, from the music they play throughout the casino and the vibe of the place ,which seems to attract early to mid 20 year olds, since we are in that age group, it was a good place to stay. We arrived at 8am and asked to check in but they only had smoking rooms available so we just checked in but had to wait til 12 to get our rooms which we figured was gonna happen so we put our bags away and came back at 1 and got our rooms right away.The rooms were clean with minor problems,In my sister and cousins room their light in the restroom wasn't working for some reason but, the maintenance guy came up to fix that right away and in mines and my bf room our toilet was having issues and our water pressure was weak in the shower, but their bathroom is really spacious which i liked! We loved the location it's right across from the city center and the Miracle mile shop is connected to the hotel and lots of places to eat. I would stay here again! 4
Nice girl who did my lashes but they were like plastic and multiple fake lashes glued to just one of my lashes. That's what I get for the 89$ new sign I  deal. 3
Visited Pho Hung for the first time today. This place is definately overrated. Portions were unreasonably tiny. The house special pho consisted of a bowl filled with soup and  1 piece of each type of meat on top of a small portion of noodles. This was the first time I was left still feeling hungry after finished a bowl of pho.Service itself was average for a pho restaurant. Quick and prompt but not much other than that. I will most likely NOT be coming back to pho hung and will be trying out the various other places in the area next time. 3
Sea Level is one of my favorite new restaurants in Charlotte. I've been in a couple of times with my boyfriend and so far we've tried the shrimp po-boy, catfish reuben, lobster roll, and $1 Sea level oysters. Everything was delicious, but the catfish reuben was the real stand out dish. The sandwiches all come with french fries, which are really tasty. The lobster roll could use a little more butter drizzled on top, but that's my only critique of the food so far. What I really love about Sea Level is that it seems to strike a great balance of semi-fine dining, while also being casual, if that's what your mood is. To that end, there's a big patio, and a good bit of bar seating, so even on a busy weekend evening, you may be able to be seated without a reservation at one of the aforementioned locations. Additionally, the service is fabulous. The servers are very professional - They know their stuff and they ensure patrons have a great dining experience. Finally, I love that there are cheaper options (i.e. $2 beer, $5 house wines, ~$12 sandwiches, and $1 oysters), and there are plenty of high quality, more expensive options as well. You really can achieve whatever dining experience you are looking for at Sea Level, whether is be a nice date, casual happy hour drinks and oysters, or somewhere in between! 4
This is our favorite dinner spot close to the house. Everything we have had from there has been great and it's the most cozy feeling restaurant around.  They get pretty busy on Friday and Saturday but the wait is normally pretty sort and worth it. The crab soup is out of this world good and no visit complete without it. 5
I go in there frequently to sell DVD's or CD's. Today, Jan. 14th, I went there to look for TV DVD collections.  I was standing there by the locked case, and 3 clerks walked by me and didn't even ask me if I needed help or if I wanted them to open the case.  I made eye contact and looked at them, so they could see I was trying get their attention!  After 10 minutes I started walking to the front, and I saw 2 clerks just standing around gabbing to each other.  I walked out, so mad!!!  Thanks for no help, people.  So rude... 2
Wow... Nicole went above and beyond to get my company set up and make sure I understood the laws that applied to my type of business. I almost lost out on a lease to another prospective tenant but Nicole rushed to get my contract reviewed so that I was able to quickly sign on the perfect place! She walked me through everything and was very diligent. I was so impressed. 5
An old staple of my old stomping grounds.  The white cheese pizza here is the most popular among my friends.  This place has just been here so long that I dont think that even if they served awful pizza to you, it wouldnt make a difference.  I am not saying they ever have but this place...like I said is a staple.  The crust is burned most of the time so it is crunchy and the actual pie isnt that thick so if thats your bag, this place will be good for you.  Honestly though, you have to try the white cheese pizza... 3
The food quality was not very good. The flavors were neither authentic Vietnamese or well executed fusion. Confused as to what their objective is.  It definitely isn't tasty, fresh food. Wish Chada Thai would have been open :) 2
Sorry guys, I've seen all these wonderful reviews about Sals and maybe got my expectations up. Ordered a medium pepperoni pizza and was disapointed when I got home. I found only 10 slices of pepperoni on a 14" pizza. Come on man, don't be so chintzy. 2
Lobby bar bartenders are rude. Two bartenders ignored us for 5+ minutes. We tried to get they're attention and when they made eye contact with us, they made no sign that they had seen us. We finally just decided to leave. There is no excuse for rude service. 1
Excellent customer service fast and reliable very pleasant atmosphere second time I went there the best thing he's open on Sundays he has candy and a nice place to sit Randall Tolliver 5
It is always nice to go back to Hank's. We live in the area and when we think of having brunch we usually go there.The waitresses and the atmosphere are great. Food is really good too, can't go wrong. For example they serve a lovely salmon dish. I especially like their big elephant tea pots. Suits for bigger groups too. Happy to recommend! 4
This is the place that I have been searching for all my life!!!! I wanted a place that offered a unique culinary experience and boy did we get it here!!! Service was impeccable; Steve was awesome and delivered great service. The wait was 40 min for our group of  9, but it was so darn worth the wait!!! I literally wanted to order everything on the menu; they're known for their hashes and Benedicts. Keep in mind that you aren't going to get the traditional Eggs Benedict with hollandaise sauce.  Instead, they create their own special sauce and everything we ordered was delicious! We ordered:Sage Chicken Benedict: Crispy Sage infused chicken on top of a mountain of carbs (2 grape size biscuits and mash potatoes) smothered in a creamy Chipotle sauce with sauteed spinach. One word: Heavenly. Meat Loaf Hash: Meat loaf was tender and well seasoned. Best part, you didn't overdose from the salt because there was barely any! Blueberry Pecan Pancakes are as gigantic as a large pizza and was crispy on the outside and moist and fluffy on the inside. Sage Chicken & Bacon Waffles: This meal changed my life. I never understood the hype over Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles or the new Lays Chicken and waffles potatoes chips, but this dish seriously was the best ever!! The sage not only elevated the super juicy and tender chicken, but the fried leeks seriously took the dish to the top level. I wish they had chopped bacon bits throughout the waffle rather than just one strip, but their homemade maple syrup wasn't overly sweet, so the juxtaposition of sweet and salty was like an explosion in your mouth.  We are definitely coming back here every time we're in Vegas. 5
Myself and a co-worker had used to go here every thursday after work. The service has always been a touch slow. We loved the wings and onion rings. Our last visit there was a disaster. We took a larger group from work to celebrate a co-workers promotion. We were largely ignored and what service we did receive was rude. The waitress...to use the term loosely...was even argumentative. Especially with one of our more sun tanned guests. After that experience we have not been back and have no intentions of it. Goodbye monkey skanks 2
Menu is pretty basic, food is creatively plated.  Staff is pretentious and rude.  Menu prices are as high as they are because you are paying for the atmosphere... Not the food.  If you are expecting an exceptional meal, not the place.  But good spot for coffee and a quick basic dessert. 2
Room was clean but that's as positive as I can be.  Very little water pressure in the shower.  Tiny soap bars. Only 2 towels.  No tv channels to speak of.  The casino and midway smelled horrible.  Very out dated will definitely go back to our regular spots on Fremont Street! 1
Ate here with friends this past weekend, and was a bit let down...too much hype? The wait was sooooooo long, the food was ok, and the service?? Hope these guys do not lose what they had because of the popularity and attention. 3
What a great restaurant. My wife and I are use to going to Morning Star Cafe not far away and wanted something for a change. This place is excellent. We both had their chicken and wild rice soup and it was very yummy. I had the turkey and roast beef sandwich while my wife had their daily special. We both really enjoyed the sandwiches. This place really has your drink choices covered as well. Lots and lots of choices! We will be back for sure! 5
First time here and I can honestly say I WILL NEVER BE COMING AGAIN!! Jason's deli was horrible ordered 3 items of the menu and disappointed with all 3. My turkey wrap which is a top pick was horrifying. My entire tortilla was hard and cracking apart as I picked it up. The wilted vegetables and over ripped fruit that came with it didn't help. It had no flavored and the sauce didn't help it just over powered. The half sandwich and soup option was no better actually worse. The soup seemed like powered cheese clustered into one ball and the sandwich the best out of everything was literally two bites. My panini was horrible the bread was some hard nasty plain white bread and the sandwich had no flavor. It was dry and flavorless. What a disappointing experience now I know to never come back. 1
Favorite coffee place ever! Best coffee and most comfortable place to relax and listen to music. The atmosphere is nice as well. The coffee is a Little over priced but otherwise love. 4
Boy, do I feel stupid for going to this store to mail a package.  Sold a product on ebay and the owner told me that the shipping prices on e-bay are all wrong and I was getting the corporate price for shipping.  He showed me the Postalmax prices for FEDEX, UPS and USPS.  USPS was the cheapest at $43.43.  Unfortunately, I said okay.  I went home and checked the USPS price and it was $22.80 for the same service. I called withing 20 minutes of being at the store and told the man what I discovered and asked if I could pick up that package.  He told me it was already gone and they are a little more expensive than the post office for the convenience of not waiting in line. Almost double the price is ridiculous.  So much for being up front and honest. 1
I always come for the breakfast. I'm never disappointed I usually order the chorizo breakfast burrito 4
Very disappointed. Maybe it was the fact that we didn't order pizza, but when your kids are disappointed-that's not good. Portions are extremely small. Stick with the pizza because the kids meals are sized for four year olds. The kids ordered spaghetti and got less than a cup each. The waitress suggested we BUY another meal for them. The free scoop of gelato that came with the kids meal was smaller than the tablespoon they gave them to eat the dessert. My wife and friends ordered the pizza which was ok. I ordered a cup of soup and sandwich because I'm a little tired of eating pizza every week. For nearly $4 I got a double shot of flavorless minestrone. The sandwich was good but not for the prices we paid. The new location is nice. But the ambiance didn't make up for the portions, the wait, or the lackluster waitING staff and service. 2
The Cafe noodle restaurant is where we go when we have guests in town. The service is super fast and the food is great. We always order the house noodles, salt and pepper shrimp, the roast duck, and the crispy chicken. 4
Smoothies taste great. Service is often unfriendly. They charge for a cup of water here. I'm sure that's illegal in the state of Arizona. 2
I again found myself getting outta work at a totally unreasonable hour.  I was hungry and in need of a much deserved cocktail.  It was around 9:30PM or 10PM and a bit late for anything heavy.  So, we kind of stumbled onto this place.  It is small and cute and a quite place to unload the days drama and enjoy eachother's company.   We sat at the sushi bar but they do have really cute little booths that are very private.  It was Wednesday night and the waiter tells us about the $4 Martini special.  Are you kidding.... yes please!  So, I drink my Orange Something Martini that was yummy yummy yummy and ordered the Miso soup and the Veggie Roll in the non-seaweed roll.  It was excellent.  Our waiter was quick to bring the refills and I left there in a much better mood then when I arrived.  Much love for Pisces.... 4
Ordered flowers for Mother's Day, paid almost $10 for nearby delivery. The flowers never arrived; they didn't call or email me to tell me that delivery would not be possible. Yet, they did take the money from my account. What I ordered on their website was not available, and when I asked what they would replace it with, they were extremely vague, but I decided to try. I am in Europe and I told them when I ordered how important it was for this order to arrive, and if not, to let me know so I could arrange something else. I am not sure how many years I will have have my mother around, and this is an absolutely vile way to do business. They don't respond to emails in a timely fashion, and phoning them is not really helpful, either. Local shop with franchise store style customer service (actually worse). 1
My family and I went to the soft opening and the service and food were both amazing. The food came quickly and the water and wine at the table were never empty. I can't wait to go back. 5
Went for dinner Saturday night. Sat on the patio. The atmosphere was definitely high end and romantic. We had the kale salad, duck confit meatballs and the seared scallops. And for dessert, the caramel upside down apple pie. It was all delicious. I will definitely go again and look forward to it. 5
Alas I am sad to report the owners have stepped away from the business and quality has gone downhill. 3
I've heard nothing but good things about DuPars from California.  This is my 2nd time giving this location at the Suncoast Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas a try.  I went for breakfast around 10am on a Wednesday.  Service was absolutely horrible.  No one seemed to care.  I overheard servers complaining to each other about other customer complaints about the food.  The prices are outrageous!  I wanted a simple eggs, bacon, & hashbrowns with a side of pancakes combo like you would normally get at any other breakfast restaurant, but nooooo!  The only way you can get that is a hidden special on the back of the menu that only offers 1 egg, bacon, & 2 pancakes for $10.25!!!!  If I wanted hash browns I was told that is an additional $4.25.  $4.25 for hash browns that should already come with the meal?  Really??????  Plus the cup of coffee was $3.00!  Ad all that together plus tax & you are spending well over $20.00 for a breakfast of 1 egg, bacon, hash browns, 2 pancakes & coffee.  Think about that for a second.   I don't care how good the pancakes are supposed to be.  That is highway robbery!!!!!  That made me angry plus no one cared to serve me after I made my comment about the price & the lack of being able to put an appropriate combo together so I got up & left.  They didn't even care.  I will not be back.  Went to the Bagel Corner in the casino instead & had a great breakfast for a decent price! 1
its a nice hotel.. i havent been to the hotel rooms yet, but marquee is there, which is the new hottest club.. i wish i could say more, but i was only at the cosmo for about an hour... 4
Update.  I'm dropping a star from my previous rating because of their lack of consistency.  A couple of times in the past few months, the pizza dough wasn't cooked through and the sauce tasted different somehow.  Maybe it depends on who is cooking that night, but they really haven't delivered up to the standard set the first time we went. 3
They were short staffed, so you had one person doing the work of 3. Hostess was told us "a server was late to her shift so we can't seat you yet". The coffee was good.  The food was average, nothing that said "wow I want to order that again". 2
The burger was ok. Not what I thought after reading and hearing about this place. Very small a couple of stools. The cashier needs to learn manners. Really for what you get its over priced. The only good thing was the chilly chesse fries. I would go back for them again. 2
Nice place  Friendly service and great selection of wine.  A nice refuge in a busy airport.   The cheese selection was varied  and the burger delicious 5
Awesome pizza! They are always very fast and friendly for delivery. One of favorite places in Arizona! 5
Called at 5pm on a Sunday to place an order and they said they were done talking deliveries for the day. 1
Went to Euro Cafe last Friday evening for a bite to eat before a 7:30 show at the Hale Theater.  We arrived at 5:30 ordered 2 glasses of wine and 2 beers immediately and our dinner by 5:45PM.  The salads for the two entrees that came with a salad were not served until 6:22 without waiter apology or and update as to what was happening in the kitchen.  The four entrees finally arrived at 6:36, more than an hour after we arrived.  Not satisfactory at all! The place was packed and looked very under-staffed.  On a show night, they should be more prepared to get guests in and out.  We received no apology, no offer of any kind for our poor service.  I ordered a simple Greek Salad that was so covered in feta cheese, that I couldn't eat it, too overwhelming.  Not a return visit in our future. 1
Definitely a little neighborhood bar, with the feel that comes with it. But the burgers are made fresh and are served on really good bread, the fries are hot, and the pizza is tasty. The ribeye steak dinner is a good bargain for your money, but be warned it won't be the best steak you've ever had. The wings are large and also tasty. We didn't have bad service, but you can definitely tell there are regulars who probably can take precedence. But you can't beat the bar food for the price. 3
We were very pleased with our first dining experience at this community diner. We arrived about 315 which is past  the 3pm deadline for certain menu options. The waitress confirmed we were good to order from that selection regardless which was a nice surprise. My husband had the roasted chicken with au jus, green beans and potato gratin. I had the roasted beet, kale and goat cheese wrap. We both loved our meals and found our server Ashleigh attentive and pleasant. Only a 12 minute drive from our home so we will certainly be back! I definitely recommend if you're looking for a low-key dining experience but creative and yummy food ! 5
I really enjoyed this restaurant.  The food was very good and the atmosphere was very cozy.  We will be back! 4
i had the same experience as rowena D.  i scheduled  for a deep tissue massage and the therapist just gave me a rub down and it definitely felt so weird. the massage was so ineffective that i even got a headache after.  and i regretted that i even tipped her. i wish i remembered her name. does anyone know what happened to april? did she move location? 2
First I think YELP needs to change the $$ to $$$ and a half, but, they do cut meats do your requests cool (buy larger roasts for smoking and are great), They have a great selection of grab and go dinners, but their over all pruoduct selections are more limited than Woodmans, but that is not a bad thing-the problem is their shelf system is weird and if you are looking for a specific item, it may not be where you would expect. One major problem is I have never been in there where it took less than 5 minutes to get through the register line. Staff all over the place, and they stand and watch these long lines, but do not open more registers. Definitely need self check out!!! Many times when I have been looking for something, several staff will walk by, and not offer any help to find something. It is convenient living in the neighborhood, but if this store was farther away-I would opt for the Pig in Cottage Grove over here. I only use this store for quick needs, not as a regular store because of the prices (Woodman's is cheaper) and fear that in 5 or more years, this store will be dirty and run down as Woodmans's East has become. I am not one of those people that care about the difference of a $1.29 loaf of bread to a $3.49 loaf, other than the price-however sometimes I splurge and this is the place I do it at. 3
If you elect to play either of the Arizona Biltmore courses be prepared for a slow round of up to 5 hours. The club is under separate ownership from the Biltmore Hotel. Hotel guests pay considerably higher green fees than local residents. The owners of the courses pack as many people on the course as possible and do little to maintain a decent pace of play. Sometimes they run out of carts. Today's round took 5 hours on Adobe. The lead group had three open holes in front of them. Two groups behind us quit and we still had 3 groups waiting to tee off on 18. This is not an uncommon occurrence, and it's frustrated members for some time. Some have quit and joined elsewhere. The current owners have done little to rectify the situation and have demonstrated no inclination to do so. They have taken bad management to a new level. As for the courses, Links is more sporty and diverse than Adobe. The Adobe dates back to 1928 and is pretty wide open making for a lot of wayward shots into adjacent fairways. This once proud facility is but a shell of it's former self. I attempted to post this review on the course's website, but the "write review" link did not function. All but two of the reviews posted were at least 6 years old. 3
Really try to like this place cause we live right by it. They mess up orders and when i called to let them know, was told to call back later when a manager was there. Apparently he was out on a delivery!?  Why he left two teens to run the store is beyond! 2
I might have given 5 stars a couple months ago, but lately the quality of the yogurt (runny) and service has gone down hill. The person on shift is never out front and the answers to questions about the NSA flavor or toppings is always "I dont know" or "I'm not told that". On top of that the machines don't always function right and there is old yogurt on the catch grills. But for me, the 3 stars really is for the fact that they have not switched the no sugar added flavor in three weeks. I don't eat anything with sugar and was so happy they offer a NSA yogurt and fresh fruit toppings. I can have dessert! However, it's been Blueberry Blast for way too long. I noticed they haven't  switched out the sorbet either. Those of us with dietary concerns would appreciate a variety, too. 3
4 stars for the young bear stuffer guy rockin the converse shoes, he tried his best to keep my birthday girl's attention. She just turned 2 (if you read my reviews she is the one that might be autistic or has adhd and is wild nutz) and she was just all over the place.Now, this is where I have to take off a star... at the check out... my daughter had a build a bear purse that she stuffed with hearts (both the purse and hearts were BAB, I was not buying them). I quickly snatched it without her looking and put it behind my me and on top of a shelf.... obviously so my daughter would not see it and scream. Well Mr. Lazy from behind the counter (not my cashier) starts yelling MAAAAM give it to me and I will put it away...  HERE GIVE THAT TO ME AND I WILL PUT IT BAAAAAACK. My daughter started wondering what he was yelling about and she was looking around. The guy was ridiculous, my husband was paying and he even turned around to see what the guy was yelling at.2x I replied to him that I didn't want her to see it and then I just walked away.That jackass should know if a mother tries to hide something away from a child that he should not create a scene. All he had to do was put it back after we left. 3
The place was clean.  They do encourage you to take out. Order was wrong peirogies mislabeled asked for mushroom  was labeled mushroom got meat.  The stuffed cabbage was undercooked  hopefully it was just a bad day for the kitchen. 1
1 at time at this location, it seems like they are still working the kinks out of the system. The ones in flagstaff or Tempe are the best but they also have been around for years!!Sandwich was good but smaller portions than the other locations. They were having trouble with computer so the check took a while.Overall I'd say average. But in sure it will improve. 3
I'm not sure if this is the same as the old chestnut lane across the street or not but the old one had these awesome chocolate chip cookies and they are trying to make the same one and I have had them twice and they are not the same, sad for me.  I will still probably try them again though as I dream of the old ones sometime when i am craving some cookie action.  Went in here a few times just seems a little strange, did look over to the right and noticed food all over the floor in the kitchen which seemed strange for such a place.  Saw a tasty looking loaf of coffee cake on the counter with no price marked, lady at the counter said embarrassingly, 32.00 dollars, and I put the cake back on the counter.  Never heard of such a thing.  We also got some muffins that seems like they needed help like the cookies. 1
Very expensive for the amount of alcohol in the margaritas.  Very small portions for the money.  Terrible service.  Waitress never checked on us.  Go to Arribas! 1
Outstanding customer service!  Working with Ray Albright made us appreciate that all appliance stores are NOT the same.  Not only did Ray provide us with the best price, but he remembered us several weeks later when we came in to purchase the refrigerator.  We also made a mistake in the purchasing process and when we contacted him after the fact - he quickly took care of it and everything was the way we wanted.  I rarely fill these things out, but this guy and this store deserve it! 5
I am not usually a fan of burritos, but wow I am obsessed with their breakfast burrito and all of their pastries are fantastic. I've definitely found my favorite place to grab breakfast or lunch or just a sweet treat! 5
Not my first choice of stores, but it's fine. You can find most of the staple items you're looking for here, usually at pretty good prices (especially on sale), and it's a fairly clean & well-organized store.My one beef with this location is the produce. If you're looking for fresh herbs, they're selection is terrible. All the other produce is average to below average. Rarely do I find better than average produce here, and even more rarely do I find great produce. And, more than that, the selection of produce is severely lacking (at least for the kind of cooking I do).I usually go to the Safeway across the street because it's got more of what I want, but I'll sometimes go to this store for staple items (milk, cream, sugar) because Fry's often has better sales and better prices than Safeway. I rarely buy produce at this Fry's location. (Other Fry's locations, e.g. Tatum & Shea, have much better produce.)This particular Fry's location is fine, but it's not great. 3
I went back for a second time since the first time was really good and just as I expected the food was really really good and the staff just as friendly as the first time.now days is hard to find a place that offers healthy and delicious food, im glad my friends recommended this place and ill be coming back for sure. 5
Tourist Trap  and Worst Pub Ever! Place looks like a poor version of a pub set not a real venue and the service was horrible (had to hunt down on straw and napkins). Most of all it was far beyond overpriced. Case and point: watered down double shot of Bailey's was $20!!!Was excited but now disappointed that this place got our money!! 1
The owner has really helped me out with my Nissan Cube over the past year, they will take care of you for almost half the price of anyplace out here with no haggle. 5
I highly recommend Trisha!  I have had previous treatments and no other person or entity compares to her professionalism and knowledge.  She spent so much time on my initial visit educating me on things that no one ever told me before and I wish I knew.  She truly cares about the results that you get from her services.  I will be returning to her for more treatment because I was so impressed with her. 5
Love this place for quick Asian food. The restaurant is very clean. The service is quick even when ordering for delivery. My favorite items on the menu are honey walnut shrimp, chow fun noodles, and a Thai tea with boba. I also occasionally order from the family specials, because you get more bang for your buck. 4
Nice atmosphere if your not in a hurry. The 2 stars are not for service but for the fact that this location is always out of pastries and other products. 2
Awesome staff, super clean facility. 5
I'm giving this place 2.5 stars. This place has amazing, delicious drinks but the service is atrocious! I've been here multiple times. The taro boba and Thai tea boba are my personal faves. I do like that they have a very creative and vast array of drinks, I just simply tend to stick to traditional flavors. I would describe this place like a Thai/Vietnamese version of Starbucks. I could see why the menu might be overwhelming for some.    Now for the service portion. The lines can be long and the place can get crowded, I see a lot of Tweens and Teens here. It wouldn't be a problem had the service been better. The first three times I went the same guy was at the register and he was awesome at giving me suggestions for drinks and friendly small talk. The last two times a young female has been at the register and is short, rude, and seems annoyed. I wanted to try out their spring rolls and she said the wait would be one hour. I thought she was joking. She said "no, can't you see we have a lot of ppl here? We're pretty busy". Her fake eyelashes must have been blurring her vision bc it was not any more crowded than usual. There wasn't even much of a line! I ended up just ordering the boba.      Honestly, I'll probably return here just bc I liked my drinks that much but if I plan to eat or they're too busy I will go across the street to Pholicious. They have quick, fast, easy, good food and service and they sell boba drinks there too. 2
Ordered 6 over priced latex plain balloons, waited 20 min and no one even began to fill my balloons knowing that I was waiting , ended up getting a refund due to the wait . Refund took so long and no one ever even apologized for the wait or anything . Awful customer service !! 1
I have been doing the infrared body wrap on and off for a few weeks, and I am addicted! I have tried other methods of infrared, and nothing compares to this one. If you have tried other methods(the sauna, formostar body wrap), you will never go back once you try this. The staff at Custom Tan is incredibly helpful and friendly. You will not be disappointed:). 5
My boyfriend and I came for the Winterlicious dinner during the past week. We were so excited for dinner after reading the menu online. And to get an app, main course and dessert all for $35 at a steakhouse - seemed like a steal! Upon arrival, we were seated at the bar until our reservations opened up. After being guided to our booth, we were presented with bread; no big deal. My boyfriend ordered the soup which he really enjoyed, and I ordered the caesar salad. There were literally about 5 pieces of lettuce on my plate. I was hoping that this app didn't set the stage for my dinner..For the main course, my boyfriend ordered the Bacon-wrapped Beef Tenderloin, well-done; I ordered the Steak Frites, medium-well. When we got our order, we were extremely underwhelmed. My steak was overdone and very dry, while my boyfriend's was still a little pink (he hates blood!). Still, without a fuss, we ate it. The waitress barely ever came to check up on us, and was not very friendly to say the least. We still had our hopes high for dessert...We both ordered the double-chocolate pecan fudge brownie. THIS was the biggest joke. It was literally two bite-sized brownies, two tiny pecans and a little chocolate fudge. I could've made this at home for $2. I understand that this (should) mostly function like a pub, but the prices are WAY overpriced. The food should at least be suffice for the price. I could've eaten better food at the keg for WAY less. Needless to say, never coming back here again! 1
I would like to enjoy this restaurant because it is within walking distance of my house. But after trying it at least a dozen times over the past few years I have finally had enough.  My wife and I can't remember a single visit that one of our dinners was not cold/warm or we had poor service (and that starts at the top).  My suggestion is to go to choplins just 1/2 mile away or Dresslers in birkdale off exit 25 (3 miles away).  My other suggestion to Altons is put some effort into cooking new dishes and get your plates out of the kitchen onto your customers table instead of setting under lamps!! 3
Greek food is as good as any other Greek restaurant that I've ever been too.  Service is just lacking.  Takes forever for them to bring the check to the table and it's not even busy. 4
3.5/5!I LOOOOOOVE pho! It's a mad real craving and I don't always have it so when I do, I'm critical about everything. I went with an old friend to catch up and frankly, my rating is best more on her dish than mine. We went for lunch around noon and both order the Special 99 beef soup which comes as the broth with all types of beef (brisket, tendons, meatballs, strips, etc), tripe, and noodles. It was nice and warm, very filling and adding Sriracha really cleared up my sinuses (suffering from a cold at the moment lol). My friend ordered the exact same dish but had asked for no onions. I don't know if they interpreted that in a different way but they didn't give her onions (good) but they also didn't give her any of the meatballs or tripe. She still enjoyed it but felt a bit jipped. I took out the tendons from my bowl when it came but that's just preference. Also, I actually haven't tried pho anywhere other than pho mi 99 so next time I'll definitely expand my horizons. We both got medium sized bowls and all together with tax was $14.39 (a little under $8 each) which I think is pretty good considering the quality and quantity you get. Definitely recommend, I'll be trying their fish balls and shrimp bowl next time :) 3
Oh gag. Took two bites of the pizza slices and our party walked out. We walked in at 2:30 for the first time. There were many different KOSHER (no meat) pizza already made and cold for many hours. Our party were surprised but we all ordered. They re-heated the slices we ordered. Absolutely no taste very bland. Silverware  was dirty---bad bad sign. We laughed cuz we all hated them. Never again. Dont recommend it!!! 1
was ok. oldish. only 20 lanes. had that stale smell. shoes weren't as bad as i thought they'd be. was fairly priced. 3
Being a high school student, I was definitely familiar with the name "Blue Lotus."  I live on the West side of Madison, and Blue Lotus is the place that all of the students at a my school go for tattoos and piercings.  After hearing great things from fellow students, I decided to drop in to get my ears pierced. I had had my ears pierced previously, but they closed up because I never wore earrings.  It was too much of a hassle to bring my mommy in with me to get a simple piercing, so I waited until I was 18 to get the piercing done.  I went in on my birthday and upon seeing my ID, the guy at the counter wished me "happy birthday."  I know that's not a big deal, but it definitely created a good vibe and little things like that in a skeptical situation can make a big difference.  There were people still waiting to get their piercings done, so I had to wait a bit before I was shown the jewelry.  After I picked my earrings out, I had to wait even longer to be escorted into a room.  I'd say overall, the wait time was probably about an hour.  I don't think that's Blue Lotus's fault, though.  It was busy, and people had appointments, and I did not.  Eventually I was taken back into a room by Myke.  He was very kind and thorough in explaining to me what was going to be done and making sure that I knew how clean the whole process was.  He washed his hands and changed his gloves numerous times and even though I'm a bit crazy about germs, I felt completely comfortable.  I turned out that my hole hadn't completely closed up, and Myke was able to just insert something through my ear the opened the hole back up.  There was a bit of pain, but nothing bad by any means.  I'm very afraid of needles, so I began to get dizzy when the first ear was done.  He kept asking me if I was okay throughout the entire process, and when I told him I was dizzy, he was extremely understanding and finished the other ear with my lying down.  After the piercings were done, he had me check in the mirror and explained to me the steps to take in the weeks to come.I didn't get a tattoo or a major piercing, but I can testify that the Blue Lotus staff, especially Myke, is professional, kind, and extremely careful about cleanliness and sanitation.  I would recommend Blue Lotus to anyone!Ear piercings at Blue Lotus cost $15, but mine was only $5 because it was just reopening a previous piercing.  My earrings were Neometal with CZ and set me back $60.  It seemed a bit pricey, but I really can't judge because I haven't compared the price to other places around Madison. 5
I love this place! I will never go to another wax salon again. I go to Kennedy and she always does an amazing job, and she's also friendly and very personable. the staff is nice and always welcoming. it might be a little expensive for an $18 eyebrow wax but the results are always fantastic, and I only have to go in every 5 weeks. tell your waxer exactly how you want it, and she will do it for you! 5
We went here when it first opened, after receiving coupons in the mail.  The staff was very nice, but other than that I honestly can't say anything exciting about it.  My kids each had a hot dog, and hubby tried the chili dog and chili cheese fries.  I couldn't find anything on the menu that even remotely appealed to me, so I opted out.  If you like greasy, cheese smothered food then this is your place, but it's just not my thing. It is very overpriced for what you are getting... I can't even fathom paying more than $2 for a hot dog (we had coupons for 99 cent hot dogs).  For the amount of money we spent I would have much rather gone somewhere else with more variety. 2
Very good shanghai food, especially the ??? which was juicy and in just the right size. The chicken wonton soup and shredded cabbage nian gao are must try. The place is very packed, especially at night so make sure you get reservations. 4
The food was ok, the atmosphere was a bar/happy hour atmosphere.  I'm just glad we didn't bring our son because it wasn't really an environment for kids.  It was also lacking in cleanliness. 2
I tried the Gyro during Taste of Danforth, and I returned during the weekday to try the Lamb Gyro. It's so tender and juicy, it blew the food court / Mr Greek's Gyro away! I totally did not expect to get full from 1 Gyro.But the cooking speed is slow, in their defense they only have 1 person cooking that day.....Reviewed during: Mon - Fri Lunch timeService Speed: 3.5 / 5Cooking speed: 3/5Food Quality: 5 / 5Food Quantity: 5 / 5Price: 5 / 5Cleanness: 4.5 / 5Repeat: YES! 4
We were quite tired after our drive from SoCal, so we decided to eat at the Bellagio, where we were staying for a few nights. The "cheapest" thing we could find here was this Asian restaurant named...Noodles.At 15 bucks for something like chow mein, you're paying for the decor or something else, certainly not the food. Rows and rows of dried noodles were on display on the shelves.Even with my parents paying our tab, our hands were tied from being thrifty folks, so we tried finding some of the cheaper things on the menu. This meant things like the Signature Premiere Rice.....which was bland fried rice despite the bits of pineapples and raisins they stuck in there.The Signature Chow Mein Mandarin Noodles with Barbeque Pork was surprisingly good, although the dish was a bit heavy on the onions. The noodles were thick and tasty.And the Yaki Udon with Chicken was just average, on the salty side, and heavy on the bell peppers, although I liked the texture of the noodles themselves.The chicken slices were quite large in this dish.These three dishes cost about 50 bucks and barely fed three adults and two young kids. When you're stuck in a Vegas casino and you've got few options, a place like Noodles is a decent place to get overpriced food. Otherwise, get in a car or taxi and head over to Vegas Chinatown for better Asian food.Full review and photos are on my blog. 2
We went there to celebrate wifey birthday. French and had vegan options I was sold there. Never had French with vegan options.  The place is really upscale looking and the waiter Alexander was great.  He explained all the options and made sure our glasses were not empty.  We ordered beet salad and ratatouille for main course and tapioca pearls pudding for dessert.  Beet salad was fresh and it had that crispy taste. Ratatouille was eggplants, capsicum, vegan cheese layered dish which was cooked to perfection The icing on the cake was the tapioca pearls pudding with some edible orchid petals. All the food was beautifully decorated and yet it was tasty!!!5 stars all the way. 5
This store is A-OK. Did you know this location closed out the Rona across the street? It's because most employees know what they're doing and sell crap. Their busiest times are during 10AM to 2PM - this is probably when they'll find the store well staffed but busy.Their clearance prices are sometimes a joke but it's not usually up to the store to decide. Clearance prices also very by store.This is the only place my family purchases their paint since Behr exclusively sells at HD. The paint staff is awesome and truly know about the products! Paint is usually on sale before a long weekend to encourage weekend projects. I would plan ahead since stores will be extremely busy.HD has a price beat policy, so if it's the same item they will beat the price by 10%.The return and exchange policy is also lenient.Hope this helps,-jT 3
Its super cool. Favorite bartender is Travis. The pregnant girl my favorite waitress. 5
If culinary technical proficiency were the only basis of for assigning a value to this restaurant it would be 110%. We were four and tried almost half the menu, and while we all admired the impressive skill that went into the preparation of the food, there was not a single dish that wowed. The wines we chose and that were suggested were exquisite, I am not sure what the current mode is for markup in a restaurant setting but the prices seem a bit exaggerated to me.The service was great, the lighting and decor a bit off. Not sure what else to say other than it was the most expensive restaurant experience of my life, and I eat out a lot. I wish I had liked it more than I did. I think they need to work on putting a real signature spin on the food in order to make the value for money equation work. 3
This place is horrible, I heard lot of people say "pho Hung " is bad. But I saw they put under new management, so I want to try see how is it new.. OMG...it is super disappointed, they are a copy cat, they copy the menu from one of the restaurant on LA,menu exactly the same of them but the food is super horrible. Service is bad. I ordered the Vietnamese dry noodles(mi kho ),usually it had oyster sauce on it,guest what,this dry noodles had nothing on it.I asked my server why it doesn't have sauce,he give me a funny answer "it had sauce on it,but is white sauce ". Wth is "white sauce" I never heard that,I try one bite, it is salt & water mix = white sauce. I highly recommend people do not go to this place, you'll waste your money on to this restaurant with a horrible food & service. I don't want to give even one star. 1
Just visited this candy store. Excellent selection and very sweet employees. Thank you for an excellent experience. 5
I couldn't believe the amount of sodium and the calories in the oriental chicken rollup I had yesterday!  I went to their corporate site and checked out the nutrition table they have posted (kudos for having it!).  1180 calories for the rollup - that doesn't count the fries, and 3220 mg of sodium - that's more that 50% over the recommended daily intake of 2000mg.  Last time I will ever eat at any Applebees.  They do have a 550 or less calories lunch menue, but not on weekends!! 1
Far from authentic Mexican food. Lack of flavor in the asada and Pico de gallo was real disappointing considering the 4.5 star rating. Chips were fresh but so are bagged chips....Dios mio! 2
Excellent food - high quality ingredients and a simple, satisfying menu full of healthy options at reasonable prices. Good ambiance and friendly service. I'd recommended this place to anyone looking for a healthy and delicious breakfast or lunch. 4
I like the Thai tea here. A bit pricey for a Thai tea compared to Thai restaurants but you can't really complain since it has more options that Thai tea. I've heard the froyo is good too, I'll have to try it next time. Overall, good Thai tea. Taking one star away for being a bit pricey. 4
Loved the fried chicken!Last minute decision to get southern cooking. This place was close to where we were. Friendly staff, wait to be seated only 10 min. Delicious biscuits, mostly like a mini chicken slider but super delicious! Fried chicken was excellent and loved the grits we ordered. Lots of savory with a very tiny hint of sweet. I recommend this place! 4
My experience was mixed. First encounter with a salesman was positive. I was replacing a 25 yo bike due to discomfort on long tours, and didn't want to pay for things that I didn't need. He listened well and narrowed the choices, and suggested that I start with a fitting to ensure best comfort. I did have my old bike fitted (prepurchase fitting), even though I thought it expensive (a second fitting would also be needed for the new bike for seat mapping, etc). The appointment started 30 min late, and a second salesman was a bit awkward with me in the store, but the fitting was thorough, and the tech spent a lot of time making sure that it was exactly right. This did not help me with selection- she directed me to a website - but I figured I would come back and talk to the original salesman. The change of my old bike did make a huge difference. I was able to extend my range the following day and was much more comfortable...until I had a minor crash when my handle bars came loose. Turns out all the changed settings were not tightened down completely (protective caps were also left off). Luckily we were in the last 2-1/2 miles of a 40 mile ride so the walk back was only a mild annoyance - some responsibility is mine for not checking the bike first. My husband was much more frustrated about the lack of attention to detail and vowed never to return. 2
Came here for trivia. I had the nachos, and they really weren't that good. Within 5 minutes the cheese made a hard, thick dome around the entire thing. It was not very satisfying after that.Also the service wasn't great. The waitress would continually ask if we wanted more drinks, when we weren't even close to finishing the ones we had.I guess it's alright for a sports bar. My expectations were low and it met my expectations. 3
Terrible & Dishonest. Maybe it's my dumb luck but I've had problems with Jiffy before when getting an oil change that it cost me a road trip in which my car ran out of oil because they damaged my gasket amongst other things. I was lucky to make it back home and all they did was deny they did anything wrong.Regardless, I thought I would give a different location a try and decided to stop here when I noticed I needed a new headlight. I checked in and told the Jiffy employee that my head light went out and if they had the proper bulb if they could fix it. He said, ok and I went into the waiting room. After patiently waiting for 45 minutes they call me back to to my car telling me the electrical wire is the problem and not the bulb. They said I needed to check if it was under warranty with my dealer.  Unfortunate to have to wait all that time just for that simple answer. Never the less I remained pleasant with the workers and thanked them for their time.Luckily I have a family friend who works at the dealer where I got my car. After explaining to him the problem he got back to later with some interesting information. My headlight casing was cracked and busted recently and the reason he could tell was because upon inspection of the light they found an epoxy that had recently been applied to the damage area for a "quick fix". Another words the "great" employees at Jiffy Lube further damaged my vehicle, made me wait 45 minutes while they hid it  just to lie to my face. I want you all to think deep down to a time where a dishonest mechanic did you wrong (because let's face it, this happens to everyone at-least once.) and maybe you were not only a victim, but a victim whom to no fault of your own is not in a position for justice; then please I ask you to not patron this establishment out of sheer principle. It's not like there aren't many other business that offer the same services. I apologize for such a negative post but if you look at my history I mainly give 4 & 5 star reviews filled with positivity. I'm not some negative spreading person I just hate seeing good honest people get taken advantage of by dishonest people time and time again. 1
The service was amazing, and we loved Scotty! He definitely made our night out on the town fantastic. Would highly recommend 5
We went looking to try the Lumberjack waffle at  the Ballantyne location and found out they were sold out. I guess that's what happens when you show up at 11am. But none the less, we had amazing waffles (peanut butter cup deluxe and the deluxe). I'm looking forward to coming back, earlier of course for the Lumberjack. 4
We live close to this restaurant, but had overlooked it.  We didn't realize that it was there.  But some friends recommended it and we decided to give it a shot.  We were really glad that we did.  The atmosphere was relatively quiet and quite intimate. We were comfortable from the moment we sat down.  Our waiter, Ray, was attentive and very knowledgeable.   The food... oh, the food.  We both loved it!  I had the lasagna, a unique implementation that had me eating the entire very large portion, even after telling my wife that there was no way I'd ever eat it all.  My wife had a special veal meatballs with fettucini entre' and also loved it.  We will definitely go back and we were excited to find such a great place so close to our home.  We highly recommend this restaurant! 5
I haven't been here for about four years, so when the opportunity to return came up, I jumped at the chance. Alas, it appears certain things have taken a dive. Our waitress started off great, bringing us water, taking our cocktail and wine order, then brought over the steak centerpiece and went over each steak. Cocktails and wine came out, our wine server was prompt in refilling our wine glasses and gracious. Our meals came out, and the steaks were cooked perfectly, but I wasn't wowed like I was the 1st time. Also, one of my friend's had an issue with his crab legs, there were 2 tendents attached, and the ends were rough. For $55, this is unacceptable, our waitress didn't come over for 15-20 mins, when she finally came over she took it off the bill, but she should have checked on us sooner to make sure our steaks were cooked properly. The steaks and sides were good, but you are paying a premium for the experience, and the experience was off and not worth the money. 3
The food was good, and the atmosphere nice.  We were very frustrated by the service.  They were constantly trying to sell us more food/drinks ("Can I start you of with a round of cocktails? How about a some appetizers?  Can we add some sides to your order").  They also offered water ("sparkling or still"), and we assumed that still meant tap water -- it certainly tasted like it. When we got the bill they had charged us $30 for water. They had given us six bottles of water, and never once asked if we would like to open a new one. In fact, they refilled our glasses without us asking for it, which in my experience is restaurant code for free refills. When we explained that we thought we were ordering tap water, both the waitress and the manager told us there was nothing they could do about it because they were "very strict" about these things, which we assume means they do this a lot. We are not trying to be cheap either -- our group spent over $400 there, so they were really just trying to nickel and dime us. 2
The customer service at this location is great! I used to go to the location on Mt. Holly Huntersville Rd and they were very rude and not helpful. I decided to drive a littler further and give this location and try and am so happy I did. They were so kind when I called and when I was there. They didn't try to BS me and tell me my car needed all these things done. I highly recommend them!!! 5
I have been buying fudge here for years. It is the best I've found!  I especially like the maple walnut and chocolate cheesecake! 5
The cocktail was outstanding and the Grilled shrimp Caesar with truffles had great flavor. That said, the lettuce was not crisp - something I would not have expected for this caliber of restaurant. 3
I have been a customer for the last 6 months and will say they have the BEST PIZZA AND BREAD STICKS IN TOWN!!! I cannot attest for the rest of their menu but their pepperoni and cheese pizza is the best!!! 5
Food quality is low..  price is high....If the lobster at Congee queen is 8/10..  the lobster here is 3/10.Do not order the fried chicken wings. Tasteless and very pricey. Walk a bit more to Spadina and have some popeye chicken. 2
My wife and I had the Cranberry Walnut Chicken Wrap wrap (2) with potato chips and drinks.  The chips were more than good, they were FABULOUS.  And the wraps were nearly perfect.  OK, I can't think how they could have been better.The only bad thing is we're traveling through to see my cousin Tom in Tucson on our way home to Santa Barbara.  But you can be sure I marked this place so I can return easily next time I'm in Phoenix. 5
I finally decided to give this place a try. Even though I occasionally walked by the place after class, I couldn't find the urge to go in. When a 12 PM class ended earlier than planned, I went to Silver Mine Subs with a friend for lunch. The place seemed clean and the workers were friendly. I had the California Gulch on wheat and my friend had the Steam Engine. I paid about $8.00 for the large, which was said to be 11". The ingredients in general seemed fresher than other fast food restaurants but it could be my biased opinion. For the particular California Gulch, it included tuna salad, provolone, lettuce, tomato, and sprouts with the addition of banana peppers and jalepanos, The additional ingredients were free. I thought the tuna salad had too much sauce in it but the bread was soft and fluffy. The sandwich overall had a clean taste. 3
Sorry Yelpers, but I disagree with the previous reviews.Maybe they've changed ownership?  But they are not Japanese-operated, the chef and all the waitstaff are Korean.  It looked like a small family run business though.Also, not particularly authentic.However if you live in the area, and are craving sushi and don't want to go far, and willing to pay for it, this is could be your place.Foodwise - overall fairly bland tasting fish, portions small.  But freshness was decent.  Temperature of the fish was just right.Agedeshi tofu - could taste the flavor of the tofu (nice and fresh) but drizzled with a sweet sauce (rather unusual for agedeshi); dipping sauce on the side (not very flavorful), and without bonito.Sunomono seafood salad - nice assortment of different types of kelp.  But seafood consisted of one piece of fake crab (pollock), one small shrimp, and four quarter-sized 2mm thin tako (octopus).  Yikes.Wild salmon sashimi - looked and tasted sub-par.  My SO and I rock-paper-scissored to see who HAD to take the last piece!  White tuna and regular tuna nigiri slightly more flavor.  Black Dragon roll was better - shrimp tempura inside a roll, covered with avocado (perfectly ripened) and few slices of unagi (again needed more flavor). Service is attentive.  Restaurant is small and quaint.  Busy with the neighborhood crowd, mostly youngish families and takeout.$50 plus tax.  No alcohol.  Neither of us were full, and we are both small eaters.... paying for convenience as we were in the neighborhood, I guess.Sorry but I don't think we will go back.  Didn't seem like just a bad night, unfortunately. 2
I've always have a good meal here. The pricing is reasonable and a wide variety. Wait staff is hit or miss, sometimes on it. 4
"Massage therapy can prove extremely helpful in dealing with the effects of cancer treatment such as nausea and fatigue. Massage also can help fight the anxiety and stress that come with any cancer diagnosis." ~ Massage EnvyWhy do you have this statement on your website if it's not what you practice? You denied my daughter a much needed massage today because she has cancer and is receiving chemotherapy. You actually told her that when they massage the lymphatic system that the chemo can come out through her pores and put your massage therapist at risk. Can you really be that ignorant? 1
This used to be a Golds Gym and it was awesome then!! Since its been change to a EOS Fitness it just seems to go downhill. The broke equipment seems to stay broke and the facility always seems dirty. The staff also isn't the friendliest. They don't clean out the pool very often so it feels like you have oil on your skin when you get out. The bathrooms usually have toilet paper all over the ground, which I don't understand why people do that that's a customer issue. They showers seem to be broken a lot so it's unpredictable if you'll be able to shower there after your workout. Wish this was still golds they seemed to care more about it then. 2
The food is good, but service very slow.  It took an hour for our food to arrive.  When I asked about our order the waitress said the kitchen was backed up.  She made it sound like we should have known it was going to take a long time to get our food.  Extremely rude. 2
Sorry to be giving a poor rating but the service is horrendous and too long most of the time. 2
This is my go to place for a quick light meal whenever I'm in the area. Came here last night after watching a show across the street at the lower Ossington theatre. I always order the rare beef pho and avocado milk shake. The pho was definitely one of the best ive had in Toronto, the brooth was clean and flavorful and the beef thin and tender. The avocado milk shake was a good complement also made properly smooth and creamy as it should be! One major downfall of the restaurant was the bad service and almost too efficiency service making me feel rushed and unwelcome (hence I only give 3 stars).Love: clean and flavorful brooth, good portion sizeHate: bad service, loud atmosphere 3
The mall is ok, nothing that will blow your mind. There really isnt a variety of stores unless your a teenage girl (or you think you are still one). they need a movie/music store like they once had and for the love of god get rid of the people with clipboards asking if you have a few minutes (the answer is always no). 3
This place is a Mississauga GEM.  I have friends that drive from far places just to have rotis and doubles from Leela's.The goat curry roti is the best and i have never had a dish here i have not fallen in love with.The servings are huge amd the prices are good.  The best part of it all is the warm and friendly service that comes with your order! 5
Came on a weekday with a co-worker. The place was so packed that we waited in line (it was -8 outside) for about 15 min. What to say? My expectations were high after the line-up, and Kenzo did NOT deliver. We had the Shoyu and Tonkatsu Ramen. The Shoyu was much too salty, I felt like I had consumed 3 days worth of sodium in that one meal. Toppings were sparse. There was barely a handful of noodles in the bowl. Service was cold, although there were only 2 waitresses for a packed room of hungry people. So not much room for complaints there. 2
Looked this place up on here hoping to find a diner worth coming to. I give it a low rating because from the start it wasn't good. The young boy & woman servers were rude & had a vibe that we didn't appreciate. When I go somewhere I want to feel welcomed. Our server had an attitude as if she didn't want to be there waiting on us. I had the Philly cheese steak & my mother had the American Burger. My sandwich had more onion and peppers then meat. When I want a Philly Cheese Steak I want to to have some steak, not a bun overstuffed with onions & peppers. My plate was messy, as soon as he put it down everything started falling off onto the table. My mother was not even a bite into her sandwich when it all started falling apart. The bread seemed to be old and dried out, it kept crumbling up and everything fell out. She stopped eating after that, and when she asked to get it taken off the bill since she barely had anything to eat, our server gave off that negative vibe again. Finally as we were leaving, we were getting ready to pay and our server told the young boy to check us out, she told him to take off my moms food and he just gave us this look and rolled his eyes. We asked for military discount which was nice that they had since places never seem to do it anymore. I still don't understand how my philly steak & an ice tea came out to $22. By then we were just over this place and wanted to leave. This place was dirty & just a negative vibe from the start. Never coming here again.  Please don't waste your time. 1
This company is a complete joke. The owner Mark is incompetent and a fraud. Save yourself the hassle, and do not hire them! They never answer their phone or return messages, so hopefully you won't be able to anyway. The only reason I had to use them is because they are who my home warranty company uses. Mark showed up unannounced when no one was home, and completely misdiagnosed the issue with my pool. He claimed it was an underground issue, with my return lines being blocked...which isn't covered under my warranty. He quickly took my money and scurried off. My security footage shows he was in my backyard for a total of 4 minutes. There is no way he can make that diagnosis in 4 minutes. That being suspicious, luckily my warranty company sent another pool service for a 2nd opinion. They easily identified and fixed the issue, and were mind boggled with Foster's "diagnosis". They said the issue with the motor was so obvious that anyone with any pool knowledge would be able to quickly identify it. Needless to say, no one at Foster's will return my calls. Stay away! 1
Food is great I've been vegan and gluten free for a while and heard about the selection of food they had very hard working people if something isn't go your liking you will not leave u satisfied today I ordered a chicken philly cheese steak on gluten free bread I liked it so much for lunch I got it for dinner as well I was craving a chicken steak sandwich and this place is beyond phenomenal if you haven't done so check them out!! 5
This is a very, very nice farmer's market and I have been to farmer's markets all over this country.  It cannot be beat in the summertime, when it is set up on the Square, encircling the Capitol Building with tents and carts every Saturday morning.  In the wintertime, like most things Madison, it loses some of its luster when it goes inside.  Although Monona Terrace is an interesting building with a neat history, the Farmer's Market is thrust into a conference room.  Still a nice variety of local produce, homemade products, breads and of course CHEESE GALORE, but the feeling of being stuffed in a cramped, windowless room makes it less of a fun outing. 4
Good service, quick ticket time and live music on the Saturday I ate here. The food quality didn't blow my mind, but it was definitely above average. I would come back. 4
The staff is very welcoming and have taken the time to get to know my regular order and to greet me with a smile every time. This location is very spacious and comfortable. I recommend this place over any other coffee shop on 17th ave.As an update to Laura B. And Arc P's previous reviews... the meeting rooms are no longer available for renting as they're being rented out by a local small business full time. 5
Parvin is phenomenal!!  I've been going to Parvin since I moved here over 2 years ago.  I tried many others before finding her and I have been to many over the years and I can say Parvin is tops!!  I wouldn't trust my brows (and such) to anyone else!  She makes getting a brazilian wax comfortable.  Who knew?!  She's awesome! 5
Came here for breakfast and thoroughly enjoyed it. Waitstaff was informative and very nice. As students, we were able to enjoy the unlimited breakfast for $8.99. My friends had done a combination of an omelet with french toast or pancakes. You can create the omelet with meat (sausage, ham) and veggies (green peppers, mushrooms, etc). French toast and pancake options included fresh fruit and nuts. Plus, you can add in at no extra cost hash browns, bacon, or sausage. Everything came out HUGE and on huge plates. There was also a side buffet of fresh fruit, muffins, light mixed salads. Not bad, and a good deal if you can eat a lot. Me, I could only finish 3/4 of my omelet and that was def not worth $9+. 3
I have gone to this place for over 40 years. The first thing i bought was a vacuum. I was pregnant at the time a nice young man ask me if he could help me. He has helped me ever since. They serviced it until i moved. I also took my sewing machine there for years. The owner has always helped me. Very nice and professional. I recently happened to be in town and took my sewing machine there. And that same man helped me after all these years... 5
This is the BEST sushi in town. BEST fish I've had in all of Nevada for sure. For people who like good nigiri and good raw fish, this is the place to go. And its all you can eat which is great. The nigiri Albacore is amazing. It rivals sushi I've had in Japan, Cali, and Caribbean. BUT... I gave it two stars because the service is TERRIBLE. I have been there three times now, and I never leave a bad review until its happened a few times, because some times stuff happens. But, this is bad, every time I go the service is terrible. I had to order my food multiple times, I received other peoples orders, I never received parts of my order, and even after ordering rolls and nigiri multiple times, the server came over 20 minutes later and asked "would you like to order anything more?". I HADN'T EVEN GOTTEN MY FOOD YET. WTF. so weird. They seem chaotic and unorganized. I ordered a total of 40 pieces of hamachi nigiri and ended up eating 8 pieces, my wife and I laughed about it. This place is amazing and has great potential but seriously needs work on their service. Get organized! I will definitely go back for the food but not if I am in a hurry or have anything else to do that day because who knows how long it will take to eat. 2
Was bored, so I came in here to grab a few beers and watch the Dbacks game. Never been here before so thought I'd give it try. Its a Boston themed sports bar, but I was really impressed with the bartender(Boston) calling me by my name the whole night, as well as everybody else. Great customer service and good prices during happy hour. Definitely coming back. 4
This place is amazing great service and "BEST" quality of foods. I do not usually give five stars but this place is amazing.  DEFINITELY come here if you are looking for entertainment + quality. 5
Tried PokeWrap for the first time today and got the Spicy SF Wrap because that was the free choice on MealPass.Staff was very friendly, the food was too spicy through the overuse of jalapeno and this was my first time trying out Hawaiian food and to be honest it was pretty great.Will I go in again? Likely - especially for a treat or when I have extra money lying around.Wasn't expensive if for a dinner, but it seemed mildly overpriced for lunch. 4
My husband did lots of research on the cars he thought would be best for our family and the dealerships we should contact. My Father in Law bought a bio diesel from Airpark and loved his experience, so we came. My husband came one day and asked to test drive 4 different Jeeps. Fred didn't have any problem allowing him to test drive what he needed. He was patient and very knowledgeable about each vehicle. Fred didn't try to push any deals on him or "sell" him. My husband left and went to a couple other dealerships. Long story short... My husband brought me back to "test drive only". Fred was gracious, showed me a couple of cars. Then worked a great deal for us. I only gave 4 stars because of the time it took. 4
They want want to card us to get a beer, but they never had card me before.  She ask my husband  for I.D but not me. Really! The waitress never came to see if we were fine or we need anything after. 1
What happened to this place???  It used to be AMAZING - never never ever even the possibility of a bad meal.  Of course that was 10+ years ago.  Now?  The reviews are right.  It's no longer that place.  Bland & tasteless, overly oily, and just bad.  Bad bad bad.  SO disappointed. 2
I live in Vancouver, but when I am in Montreal I go directly to this bakery.  Everything they make is amazing.  I wish I could bring everything they make back to Vancouver with me. 5
Nothing memorable to speak of.  Went on a Friday night, and yes, as other reviewers have noted, the crowd is definitely older. As the night wore on mid-twenties individuals came in. However, the music was ok. As it changes nightly not much to say about this. They have a dance floor that was well used on the evening I was there. My friend and I sat at the bar, bartender was semi-attentive. My mixed drinks (Jameson and Ginger Ale) were weak and nothing to speak of, but I believe only $4. While I was excited to head here due to hearing they have live music 7 nights a week, I most likely will not be returning. Not the right crowd, vibe or cocktail for me. 3
I have been to the Carolina's Original Location many times and always enjoy but sadly this location does not boast the same consistency. I ordered a combination taco tostada and enchilada with rice and beans. What a mess was served, a tostada with beans on one edge covered with wilted lettuce and the cheese missed the top and ended on the rice. The enchilada was simmilar with only 1/2 with cheese and sauce strewn across the foam container. To complete the disaster the taco was broken in three sections and covered with lettuce to hide the mess. It might have been a one time mistake or a new cook and I will try again as I always enjoyed the original location and like this location. 2
I agree with the precious review; many of the dishes were not not available when I came in. I was told that I would have to wait 5 minutes for most of the dishes to come out, so I did. 10 minutes later, I was still waiting. Eventually someone noticed I was still waiting, apologized and offered me a free drink. I ended up getting the orange chicken, walnut shrimp and mandarin beef (crispy beef). The food was not that bad, typical Chinese takeout, but a little healthier. I think that the fried rice was brown rice. Note that the walnut shrimp is considered a premium item and has an additional charge. While I don't have complaints about the servers, the manager of the place did act very professionally. With an open kitchen, customers can watch their food being cooked and any interactions in the kitchen. That day, the manager reprimanded one of the cooks; not only did this slow down the food being prepared, but it was unprofessional. As I watched, I felt very bad for the guy; he was only one of two cooks, and from the time that I got there, he was cooking fast and hard. I think that Panda Express needs to hire more cooks to have food ready to go, as they are a fast food/ take out restaurant, and consider better training for their managers. 2
A couple people have said the menu is strange and I'm going to have to agree. I ordered the penne with chicken. It was also equally strange. My chicken was shredded and it sorta looked more like chicken salad then anything. It also did not taste very good.The service was pretty good. I mean the place was empty so I would hope it would be. We only ate half our meals as the portions were also too big. I attempted to re-heat mine the next day but it was gag worthy for sure. Someone in my household ate it though... but it was not me.I also thought the prices were wonky. I mean it wasn't offering anything out of the ordinary and after having a really disappointing simple dish I can't say I agree with menu prices. Just BLEH all around... I hope it improves this is prime location! 2
Great brunch! Cheap drinks, nice patio, cool place to start the night out at, the staff is also pretty awesome :) 4
Well!  I found it better than other Wamarts in terms of quick check out and good customer service. Secondly I find almost anything I need. Just one negative thing is they run short of milk most of the time. 3
Rachel recently assisted my husband and I with our home purchase in the cleveland area. She was great at the knowing the area as we had just moved to ohio. Rachel was great throughout the offer process which for us was a little lengthy and had some hiccups. She offered us solutions and options during stressful times and was spot on with communication. She was always on time and was very easy to get ahold of. I would certainly recommend her for your home buying/selling needs! 5
Food still about the same. Not great but passable.Service was lousy, lousy, lousy.  Talk about an attitude from servers.  Cleanliness.  Yuck.  Server picks up glasses from table beside our table.  Pours water in the glass,  Wipes clean the lipstick marks.  Places back on shelf for next person to be served.Pretty sure that is not how its supposed to be done.   Servers would much rather stand around chatting than actually looking after customers.Most Fox restaurants are about a 3 1/2.  This one IMHO, at best a 2. 2
Fantastic service,  and beautiful new clinic! I would recommend this clinic to anyone looking for excellent health care. Dr. Uma Ratnasingam is friendly, professional and very knowledgable. He recommended that I try a different prescription that what I was currently wearing (as recommended by another optometrist) and since then I have noticed a decrease in headaches. I would recommend this clinic to anyone looking for an Optometrist or new glasses. 5
Fast on refills, even provided a to-go cup when requested.Ordered the 3 meat platter and received large portions.  Baby back ribs and brisket were tender.  Chicken was just a little dry in some areas.Servers and cashiers coordinated very well for a party of ~20 people.  All food was delivered at approximately the same time.  Checks were split without problems.Fresh, complimentary cinnamon doughnuts were super tasty. 5
Their food is great and it's a nice environment. It does get slow when they are busy so just be patient. It is worth it. 4
This place absolutely sucks. You would think after an entire year of going to them consistently they would remember my name but NO.....as soon as I arrive they ask me all kinds of personal questions like "how am I doing?" Ugh I just wanna be like get out of my bizzness! I find it to be so annoying when they ask me what colors I want or if I want any designs pfftt.....they should know what I want by now!!!! I guess until I find a tech who can read my mind I'm stuck with these bums! 1
A friend of mine and I stopped in to watch her boyfriends' band play and have a couple drinks and if it weren't for him playing I would've left. Honestly, never at one point have I thought "Hey, I'd like to go to a cool bar tonight and watch some good music, how bout E-strings?" It was just full of kids and I couldn't get a drink too quickly.I've also heard some really terrible things about how the owner feels about talent so I don't want to support that. If I want to see some great bands, I'll check out downtown. If I want crappy mozzarella sticks, basic beer, loud music and out of touch owners? I'll come here. 1
Record store prices, flea market quality.  I was impressed with the selection and made a substantial purchase. Later I found that about half of the records I bought had significant damage. I understand this is a risk when buying used and I will be sure to patronize establishments with better quality control in the future. 2
This review is long overdue. Moved to the neighborhood earlier this year and wanted to check out this place because of all the positive reviews and it's the only Korean place close to me outside of the North York Yonge St. area.I've only had the Gingseng Chicken soup. The chicken is organic, stuffed with sticky rice on the inside and comes with a small side of rice noodles which you can place in the soup. It is delicious and has a subtle gingseng taste.  My spouse has had the bibimbap and tofu soup, both of which were great. The menu is small. I wish they offered pork bone soup and kalbi beef. The prices are slightly higher than other Korean restaurants. Service is always friendly.I've been to this place about four times now and will definitely be a regular. Highly recommend! 5
over rated! I purchased my ticket online $30 plus taxes and fees, which included open bar till 12 am. I met other people in line and they said just signip for guest list and it is free entry. when I went in, floor was sticky an dirty, I like drinking rum and coke, I was told I can only order vodka and mix drinks and juice. I ordered cranberry vodka but there was no vodka in it. I went downstairs to dance floor, stairs going down the floor is very steep. couple girls coming down spill drinks on me, I went to bartender to get some water she charged me $10 for the bottle. I told her i have an open bar till 12, she said she cannot give water for free but she can give me vodka and water for free didn't make sense. dont let the girls waiting in line fool you. once you get in, you wanna come right back out. 1
What can I say...  Staff are liars.  Three of us went in, ordered food and the fellas ordered a pitcher of beer.  Later, the server asked if they'd like a second pitcher, and the guys said, "Yes."   We were enjoying ourselves, and the food was tasty enough.  The second pitcher to arrive was clearly not the kind they'd ordered (the colour was dramatically different), so the server took it back and brought the correct one.  The bill came, and we were charged - not even for three but - for FOUR pitchers.  We reminded the server that we'd only consumed two, but that one was brought in error.  Server went away, but came back insisting we pay for at least three (like they were doing us a favour by removing one of the two erroneously-charged pitchers).  When we tried to explain the server's error, we were directed to (the manager?).  He was acting as though he was too busy to even listen to us.  He abruptly told us to pay for just the two pitchers, but to never come back.  What can I say?  Gladly.  ...Just unprofessional liars.  I have never, ever, ever, had a SINGLE problem at a restaurant before or since.  Goodness.  I've never even sent a dish back.  We were respectful and earnestly tried to explain THE SERVER'S error...to no avail.  There were no raised voices on our part...just complete bewilderment.  We left embarrassed and dumbfounded.  What a shoddy way to do business.  This happened a little while ago, but I'm still so offended, I'm finally getting around to telling what happened to me.  This may never happen to you...if you're lucky.  (To be fair, in 50 years of eating at restaurants in a dozen countries, this restaurant is the only one to treat me so badly and unfairly.)  Every dime you spend there supports staff who will try to lie and cheat customers out of their money, and then slander them, publicly, when they don't acquiesce.  I'm thrilled to have never been back.  There are literally thousands of restaurants in Toronto from which to choose. 1
If I could give it this store a lower rating I would it was the worst experience I ever had. I went in to buy a very expensive toolbox and I got treated like dirt. I will probably go to Lowe's to buy my toolbox now. Sears can kiss my butt. 1
What's a sultan burger ? I quote " The Sultan burger consists of the 8oz burger, plus tandoori chicken samosas, butter chicken vegetables, provolone cheese and a lime pickle and jalapeno relish." Now I know what you're thinking, way too much going on there. Not so. The patty is perfectly cooked, juicy, full of flavour. The samosa has great crunch and there is just the right amount of spice. On paper it doesn't work, in your mouth it works wonderfully. The catch; these specialty burgers change on a weekly basis. The quantity of the food is substantial. Go here hungry, but go here. I will be a return customer with my eye on the Mac and Cheese and Veal meatloaf. 5
I had been noticing a burning odor whenever my AC turned on and needed to find the problem. Ace Air and George Brazil came out to troubleshoot and - surprise - both companies told me I should replace my entire AC unit. I was told totally different reasons from each one but they both stressed that I needed to replace the unit right away.  I was given quotes from $5,500 to $7,800.My gut told me different. I saw that Definitive Air had 4-5 star ratings on many consumer sites so I gave them a call. I am glad I did. Mike came out right away and diagnosed my problem as a bad capacitor on the evap blower. 30 minutes and $128.00 later everything was fixed.Thanks, Mike, for saving me thousands of dollars! Definitive Air is my HVAC company now. 5
This AAA shop quoted almost $2000 for front end work.  Car was having no issues no leaks. Went for an oil change and multipoint inspection.  Declined the "we can fix it today and supply a rental car" offer.Car was brought to another reputable mechanic in town with 40+ years experience he went through the entire car top and bottom... Was with him under the car (on the lift)..as we went through the quote/recommendation sheet from AAA at 75/T-bird ....went through every component of the steering system which was bone dry and in perfect working order...not only do I feel they were making up the supposed needed repair they then tried to hyperinflate cost...again mechanic showed me cost on part and book hours for repair...part was Triple the cost of a first qualty lifetime warranty item and labor would have $150+/hour.....I have been AAA member 20+ years this experience certainly tarnished my opinion..... 1
The staff was very friendly. The person who filled in for Maria was exceptional after speaking to Nicole 2 days prior and gave me inaccurate information on my storage price this person gave me a different price as a move in special for only 3 months. The site says ZERO payment for first month but it's actually 29.99. Then the rate is only good for 3 months and then goes up. Nicole didn't state that. I was told a certain amount for as long as I rent...NOT ACCURATE. I rented anyways as location is great. The staff was friendly and the site was clean this is the only reason why I gave a 4 star. 4
Really like to food. Soooo too bad about the bad service. Came for brunch today. Ordered the duck benny and french toast and a side of DF tater tots (wanted to give them a try). When ordering the waitress asked if i wanted the side dip for the tots, but forgot to mention it was $2. All the food came together- lovely and hot. Had to call or track down the waitress for everything I needed. More water, salt, sugar, etc. When the bill came  i saw i was charged $10 for the appetizer portion. So my $5 side, just became $12. And really, again, no biggie. But when I asked the waitress about it "oh, I ordered the side" (and we didn't even finish them), she said sorry, I thought you ordered the app. Although, it didn't come as an app.  If a food item is listed in 2 places on the menu  at 2 different price points, the waitress should clarify. The correct response should have been to say, "oops, my mistake, let me change that for you." But instead, she said sorry a few times and made my feel like it was my mistake. I assumed in a local place like this, folks would be trained in the customer-is-always-right motto. It also would have been nice to have been checked in with at least once through out the meal. Was hoping I just got the wrong server, but the bad service reputation was confirmed with a few other friends' experience. Such a bummer. Hope they get a handle on this because the food was great, but service is why people return places. 3
We are in the restaurant industry and I hate leaving bad reviews but after a very disappointing Sunday dinner I felt like I owed it to everyone in my shoes looking for good sushi.. Fish wasn't fresh, wasn't cut properly for sushi, and the spider roll was not edible... hopefully it was just a bad night for them. 2
We were so excited to try out this place given all the positive reviews and hype.  But we were very disappointed.  The prices are a lot higher than you're led to believe.  And the food left a huge lump in my belly.  Wasn't feeling too good the rest of the night.  I think it was those fried cheese curds.  They were a party in my mouth going down but I paid for it later.  Didn't even get to try the ice cream because the bill for a family of 5 was already $50. 3
YUM!My husband took me here on one of our very few nights out.  First Fridays in Phoenix, made the restaurant very busy, the waitress was friendly, and the food delicious. 4
Servce was very disappointing.  Waited 20 minutes for someone to take just our drink order.   Getting our ckeck wasn't any easier  this was my second attempt at this location. First time was a to go order, got all the way back to work an only had half my order No Pita!!  I-ronic ugh!!    Never again sad to say i love the food. 1
Destination wedding made easy! When my husband and I decided on a destination wedding we knew we needed help with travel. After getting about 500 quotes (more like 10-15) we decided to go with the travel network as they not only came back with the best quote but were fast to reply and easy to communicate with. Ashley O'Connor was our travel agent and she really is amazing! She took care of everything for us, dealt with all of our 34 guests and sorted out every issue that we encountered. She is great at responding to emails and calls, worked for us (when it seemed like Air Canada was against us) and coordinated travel for our guests in 3 provinces, BC, Alberta and Ontario (everyone arrived the same day and the cost was pretty close for everyone which we found amazing) I recommend going with the Travel Network and working with Ashley if you want a stress free getaway made easy. 5
Out of the 100+ fine dining tasting experiences I've had this ranks at the bottom. Four of us had the chefs signature menu and we were all disappointed. The food was bland or salty. Lacked imagination. The server was rude and made me feel stupid because I didn't know anything about absinthe. 1
A rare gem hidden where you wouldn't expect it. Superb value/quality for money.I was looking for an above average steakhouse to dine with family and upon consulting Yelp, The Steakhouse checked all the right boxes:Good foodGood serviceGood valueplus the added "old school"/ "hidden gem" allure.I arranged to visit The Steakhouse early, just when it opened up for the evening. As soon as you enter you can see the room where they age the steaks. The overall lighting is low, with the appropriate amount of light on each table. The overall decor  might seem "old school" as others have pointed out but I found it to be very appropriate for the type of the restaurant. The music also seemed to compliment the "old school" atmosphere with Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin lightly playing in the background. While this looks like a somewhat "dressy" place the atmosphere is quite relaxed and unpretentious. All dishes at The Steakhouse include a big bread basket with quite a variety to choose from. All of them were fresh and delicious.We tried the Porterhouse, Ribeye and Filet Mignon; all were cooked to perfection. Unseasoned of course so you can better enjoy the taste and quality of the meat and also so you may add one of the sauces The Steakhouse offers. The green peppercorn sauce stood out, crisp and flavorful. Each steak costs about $50 which I think is very reasonable:Meat quality and cooking is splendid and the price includes the big bread basket as well as your choice of a salad or soup AND (that is, in addition to) your choice of baked potato, mashed potato or wild rice blend.Since it was my first time at The Steakhouse, when I asked for the dessert menu, I was surprised to see that our server actually brought a whole dessert cart which showcased all the desserts. I assure you, this is much better than looking at a menu but it might also make your choice even more difficult as all the offerings looked delicious.We sampled the creme brulee and the tiramisu and, as expected, they were splendid!Service was exquisite: polite and attentive just when you needed them without annoying and pretentious interference. I can't stress enough how impressed I was.If you want to enjoy a good steak dinner in a more than casual atmosphere then The Steakhouse is the place. Not only is the food excellent but the service as well. Couple these with not so unreasonable prices and you have quite possibly one of the best value for money steak houses on the Strip. 5
Fun atmosphere and decorations. The atmosphere is typical mainland china style. Kind of garish and over the top and showy. Nothing understated here. But it is a change of pace from the typical generic styling you usually see. The name in chinese is not actually china buffet but rather summer palace which refers to an historic site north of beijing which is not necessarily a proud moment in chinese history but historic and a fabulous place to visit and on most tourist's list when in that area. The real summer palace is the definition of over the top. Anyways on to the food itself. The food is decent, you will most likely find at least 2-3 things that will satisfy you when you visit as they have a wide range of dishes. I will point out the highlights. First off, the hibachi grill is good, always, always get that first and they have scallops. The soup is another decent item. The rolls here are not worth much in my book and i always pass them up. The steamed fish is very good. One very unique item here is the frogs legs. How many chinese buffets serve frogs legs every day? In my opinion, this is not the best chinese buffet in the area but it has the most variety and noisy typical "chinese" atmosphere. Which is a good thing when you are in the mood, if not you may find it too noisy which I sometimes do. I do enjoy coming here for lunch and sometimes dinner. 4
We were getting our first flat screen tv installed and Joe went above and beyond our expectations, from the moment we first spoke on the phone he was thoroughly informative and above all exceptional  professional customer service! He answered all of our questions and genuinely cared about getting the customer what he/she wants! I would recommend Mythic Home theather to anyone looking to install one or several tv's for their home entertainment! You will not be disappointed they aim to please the customer! Thank you Joe you  made our first installation an amazing experience! 5
If I could give zero stars I would! This is the most horribly slow drive thru I have ever  been in. You can guarantee that I will NEVER BE back. The food was below average and the fries were cold. 15.00 got me the following: a 40 minute wait in the drive thru,  a cranky toddler, cold fries , and a drink that was filled to the top with ice and no fruit punch. Never, Ever Again! 1
Worst pizza I ever had! I ate 2 pieces because I was starving and threw the rest out.  I don't recall ever throwing pizza away. You can always just stomach it if if you don't really like it but this was just gross! Soggy, soggy through most of it. I had mushroom and bell peppers. There were 6 times more bell peppers than mushrooms. I think they used one mushroom on a large at most. I like pretty much ANY pizza so the fact that I threw this out says volumes! I would have enjoyed a frozen pizza from the grocery store more!  It really sucks too because I wanted to believe the good reviews on here because its so close to my house but unfortunately, I have to side with the bad! 1
I actually started this review four months ago but decided not to post it because I was afraid I was being unnecessarily harsh. However, I told the story to someone recently and the first thing they asked was if I posted it on Yelp because it's pretty bad. So since my unfinished saved review was staring me in the face as I logged in today, I figured I'd just do it. I could just sum up my whole review now and say don't waste your time because all this place gave me was horrible service, high prices, and generic food, but I figure I should give more evidence to back it up. I recently moved back to town and was excited to see an Italian restaurant right around the corner from my new home so I wanted to try it out ASAP. When you walk in the door it is very unclear what you are supposed to do. No one greets you, no one seats you, nothing. There are menus on the tables and a sign that says "ORDER HERE" at the counter. We sat down for a minute to look at the menu but no one came over to help us so we figured we had to go up to the counter to order. We were helped by an older gentleman. I'm not sure if he was the owner. Based on the conversation he was having with another customer (who was clearly  more important than we were) I think he was. I ordered the gnocchi and my health conscious friend ordered a turkey sub. We have a serious lack of Italian restaurants here in Chandler so it is very hard to find gnocchi. Because of this, I order it whenever I have the chance. I was so excited to see it on the menu I immediately discarded my plan of ordering pizza. I've had gnocchi dozens of times in my life, both good and bad. This stuff was awful. It wasn't even edible. I never complain about food, I just eat it. I couldn't do it this time. I brought it back up to the counter and politely asked for something else. The older gentleman rudely asked why and when I explained and he said "that's how it's supposed to be." He agreed to make me some basic spaghetti when he realized I wasn't going to just take it back to my table and stare at it. In the meantime my friend ate her turkey sub. It wasn't very good, either. Very expensive for three pieces of turkey, but I guess you shouldn't have high hopes when you order turkey at a pizza place.  While I was waiting for my replacement spaghetti I watched her eat the entire sub. It didn't take long. I also watched the older gentleman who was "helping" us proceed to leave the restaurant, get into his vehicle (parked right up front in a handicapped parking spot), and drive away. My friend jokingly said "hah, you're never getting your spaghetti now." She was right.I went up to the counter about ten minutes later to inquire about my food and the girl that was now in charge had no idea what I was talking about. She didn't offer to make me the spaghetti herself, she didn't apologize, nothing. I paid for our drinks and the overpriced turkey sub (which she tried to overcharge me for as well!) and we left very unhappy. I enjoyed a wonderful meal across the parking lot at Taco Bell instead that night. 1
Best groomers! I take all 3 of my dogs and cat here on a regular basis. One of my dogs is blind with health issues and they take special care in grooming him. I also LOVE that they have pet dyes to make our animals look fabulous!! They offer nail polish too! I will post some pics. They care about animals and do an excellent job. They also go out of their way to try to accommodate all 4 of my animals every time I call. 5
Very impressed with the work that precision painting did.  We have a 3000+ sq foot house that we had just moved into about a month prior and didn't want to spend a lot of money on painting. A crew of 5 people showed up on time for 4 days and did an amazing job working around our crazy life at home and when they were done they even cleaned the floor leaving house cleaner then when they got here. The best part is they only charged $1700 for the whole house and that included them purchasing the paint. 4
Whether you're visiting Scottsdale or a local resident, put Cafe Forte on your must-visit list.  The food is unbelievably delicious and healthy, and the staff and atmosphere are very pleasant as well.  If you're there on a Thursday night, you can enjoy live music and the art walk in Old Town.  Oh and try the horseradish salmon dish - it's to die for!!! 5
Good take-out Indian at affordable prices.  Portions are generous, and food is not overly oily or salty, which I find to be the case at many Indian places.  They have plenty of veg selections, I love the okra dish.   It is a bit light on the spice, but perhaps I just haven't ordered the spicier dishes.  I also love the little container of rice pudding that you get with take-out meals. 3
Summer Rivlin, Alex's wife and partner, in the agency, is as wonderful as it gets. I found their agency on Yelp, after receiving several different quotes from other Farmer's agents and other companies. Not only did Summer meet with us and took the time to get to know us, she went through every option on our insurance plan so that we knew exactly what we were paying for. AND, then she saved us over $400 a year! She is personable, a Las Vegas native, and she really does want to help you. She has a genuine interest in her customers and that's why I am writing this review. Farmer's is already a trusted name in insurance and Summer just puts it over the top for my husband and I. Please choose this agency when looking for insurance in Vegas. You will be very pleased! 5
Really BAD. Had the chicken and beef tacos. Disgusting. Grease grease grease.. The beef is the cheapest I've ever had. Ground chicken. Simply yuck. The waitress handed us our check with someone elses info for their name and e-mail address inside. I mentioned it to her but she didn't really seem to care. Save your stomache, taste buds and personal info. This place is a NO-GO for us. 1
My family has been going to Popo's on Indian School Road since the 80's, so it was great to find out that one opened up closer to El Mirage.This is probably my favorite Mexican Restaurant. The prices are decent, the service is good, and the food is consistently tasty. It's sad that I have to leave El Mirage, a city that got its start as migrant farm worker's housing, just to get great Mexican food, but at least it's only 15 minutes away. I highly recommend the bean dip with fried flour tortilla chips. Can't comment on the bar (I don't drink) but I've never had bad food. 5
There was a massive fire and partial building collapse on Feb 14, 2017. The place is likely shut down for a while if not permanently. 3
I lived here for 6 years. I never had an issue with pests of any kind and the building I lived in was very quiet. I can't speak for the rest but the biggest issue I ran into was people not knowing how to use the round about by the office. I loved the package lockers because I worked mostly when the office was open so I didn't have to wait days to get my deliveries. I've never had any issues with any of the management they've always been very courteous. I only moved for outlying reasons nothing to do with the complex. 5
Came here for breakfast while car being fixed across street. Jules the bartender was friendly and welcoming. I had the omelet and it was enough for two. Price was half price before 10. Home fries were crisp but not greasy. Omelet cooked but not dry. Felt comfortable sitting alone. 4
There are better locations, this one is OK.  The key is to go on Thursday, which is "Dollar Day", where every price tag with the color of the balloons they have flying is one thin dollar (if you can't tell the what the color is, just ask the staff).  There are a few exceptions to the dollar price for certain colored tags (they will tell you over the loudspeaker, or you can ask).  But there are EXCEPTIONAL bargains to be had.  Dress clothes. Casual clothes. Shoes.  Electronics. Appliances.  CDs, DVDs.  TVs. Bikes.  Food Savers.  Dishes, silverware, pots, pans...I could go on and on.  You never know what you will find, and it's fun.  I go to several locations every Thursday. 3
The hot and sour soup was very warm and fresh. They say it is made daily from scratch. It is much better than the boil and dump dry soup I try to make from home. The vietnamese crab salad was not sour as described. The papaya is ripe and not green so the flavor is dulled. 4
The coffee here is pretty mediocre for the price, the food is decent, but WOW the service is the slowest service I've ever experienced at a coffee shop. I visit this location roughly 2+ times a week and I'm on the verge of not going anymore. It takes forever for just 1 coffee. 2
Wow, this place is spicy! I usually get their lowest spicy level or one level up, and it ends up being just right for me. Anything more, and I start sweating bullets and chugging water. I've tried 4 different noodles from here and have loved every single one. I would love the dishes even more if they weren't as sweet (I think they add a lot of sugar to their dishes). Their portions are big so you have enough for lunch the next day! 4
Visited Valentine's day.I don't come here much because I think the smell they pump through property is obnoxious, also the place is so big and without ample signage it is hard to find certain places/venuesSoul 2 soul is a great show and we had a nice dinner at Zepphirino(spelling dicey)The cocktail server in the pit however was NOT amazing. Ordered about 15 minutes into new blackjack shoe(normal), We were the only people playing at the table for 45 minutes so a single drink is obtainable by Vegas service standards of 15-20 minutes roundsGot through the entire shoe up double so we had just colored our chips out when the server came with our drinks and claimed to not know who we were and what we had ordered.  This was not incredible as we could see our drinks on the tray.  I don't think this is acceptable and I am certainly not into this sort of behavior at a five diamond resortI don't so much care about the drink as I am with the lack of hospitality.This woman alone is the reason for the 2 stars. 2
The best all-you-can-eat sushi place in the city. Lots of options, speedy/friendly service, tablets with pictures to make ordering quick and easy. Highly recommended! 5
We seriously won't go anywhere else for chinese food! Whether its dine in or take out the service and food are quick! Very family friendly and make my children feel welcomed. We wish it was closer but dont mind the 25 minute drive at all! Excellent establishment. 5
This is by far my favorite Mediterranean restaurant. Always fresh and delightful, and the same at both locations. From the Cauliflower or Falafel to the Hummus Shawarma, Enjoy!! 5
Tried this place for the first time after reading positive reviews on Yelp and other places.  Food and service were very good!  Would definitely be going back there and making recommendations to my friends. 5
Highly recommend no one go here. If you are looking for professional, competent service this will not be your go-to place. Their gel application chipped The Next Day!  By appointment, I returned 2 times: 1st time owner stood me up, second time owner's sister refused to apply a sealer to 3 nails.  Uugg!! 1
Sugar and grease, be ready! If that is what you like...Worst Sangria ever, pure sugar, no taste whatsoever.BBQ chicken sandwich drenched in super sweet sauce, can't tell of the taste.Really really bad BBQ joint. 1
My wife and I have been seeing various doctors here for the last 6 or 7 years.  Saw Dr. Pod. the first couple of years.  He was the best.  Since then we've seen 4 others.  Dr. Mehari was nearly as good as Dr. Pod.Last visit, they got one lense off by a fraction. Ok nobody's perfect. This last visit was the last straw.  They mixed up my prescription with somebody else. Recheck (after an hour overtime wait). Original prescription was correct.  They submitted to the lab again.  TWO WEEKS LATER (supposedly as a rush order),  they were still not correct. Recheck. Another TWO WEEKS LATER they finally got it right. That was after more than 6 weeks after our original checkup. Last but not least, not only are their prices on frames ridiculous, the selection sucks. 1
Our three rats were aging and having various health complications.  The vet at Greenwood Park examined them, outlined their problems, suggested I think it over and I decided to have the rats euthanized a couple of days later. The vet gave me the option of staying with them for sedation and euthanasia process which I did.  She and her assistant  explained everything they were doing to make sure the rats weren't in any discomfort. The team at Greenwood couldn't have been more supportive, caring and compassionate, not only of the rats but also of me as the owner.  I would definitely go back to Greenwood Park. 4
Definitely not worth waiting in line for two hours. I get that it's a different style of cheesecake than what we're used to in North America but I was pretty disappointed. It's like a bland slightly sweet souffle. We also had the madeleines, which were grainy in a cornbread sort of way. Thankfully my mother-in-law was the one who waited in line for them, not me!It's certainly a novelty so if you have absolutely nothing better to do than wait in line by the gross bus depot for a few hours, go for it. Just don't say I didn't warn you. 2
I've been to this place about two times since I love burgers. So first off this place is really small but clean (then again it's a fairly new place). The staff was friendly but the cleaning the tables part was very poor. It took a while for them to bus the tables when people wanted to sit down. Now getting down to the burgers, so far I tried the mushroom Swiss burger with extra mushrooms because I love mushrooms. It was really good but very greasy. I also ordered the smashfries as a side, ehh it was okay it's topped with rosemary, olive oil, and garlic salt. But man was there way to much olive oil! The other burger I tried was the Sin City SmashBurger which has bacon, fried egg, cheese, onions (I don't like raw onions so I took that out), haystack onions, and egg bun. It was good but oily! The prices of the burgers range from $4.99 to $6.99 and the sides range from $1.49 and $3 something. 3
Seems like a hip place. Bartender was friendly and so were the patrons. The night was halloween.  A few minutes into the experience  i was cussed at by a man who then approached me. This man was highly intoxicated and too major offense to my scarecrow costume, which he took as some racial flaunt. He presented him self with profanity and bad balance and all of my friends were disgusted. I learned that this man was the Bar owner (says the bartender). My group could not be served, and we kindly left.  My sister who lives there says this place has always had an attitude problem, and if you are not in their regular club, well, your subject to the owners discretion. Overall, it seems like a good place to eat and dine, just avoid the bar managers/ owners or pre booked events. 2
I was disappointed because I have never tried nor heard of bon hue. So after reading the description it sounded great.... Until It was brought out and i realized it was liver .Wtf. Discussing.You might want to add that little detail in your menu.Thanks . 1
Great food, horrible service.  For the 3rd time in 5 visits my pick up order was 10 minutes late.  No apologies no drink no discount t 2
If you from Hawaii and want to fell like you Hawaii this is the Hotel for you. Lots of local food sold here.  Older Hawaii residents stay here but you smoke cigars in the Keno area.  Right across the keno is the crap tables.  Ox tale soup is great, Hamburger steak is also great.  One the weekends in the days you see choke local Hawaiians.  Then at night  Hawaiian local girls come out hotel rooms because  they're headed to  the night clubs on the strip.  Guys if you up with friends and girlfriend.  You and guy friends  get drunk playing games then go to the clubs cause the drink prices in the clubs is expensive.  You easily spend 100 in 30 minutes just buy 1 round for a group 8. 3
THIS PLACE IS NOT CLOSED but there is completely new ownership and an entirely new menu that is very unpleasing. We miss you Winnie 1
Meh. I've experienced MUCH better. I'm originally from Toronto but moved to Montreal about 7 years ago. Well, two weeks ago I finally came back home for good. It was good to see certain stores still around and Le Richie was one of them. After spending a few minutes in the store I soon realised why I didn't like it 7 years ago!! Staff wasn't the greatest, one older lady there (owner I would assume) and she had a serious attitude problem... I was made to feel like I didn't know what I was talking about... but i've been a metal head since i'm 15 ( now 46). Someone else made things right while I was there, but this this is the last time I stop in there. Other places will get a crack at my money first... 2
Chris pierced my septum and it was an easy, almost painless experience. He was super nice, knowledgeable, and made me feel at ease with not only the process, but being there as well. I have several tattoos, but had only had my ears pierced prior to this visit. Extremely clean place, and well worth it! I will be back! 5
Don't judge a book by its cover! This place from the outside may look questionable, but once you get inside everything changes. Some of the best Mexican food I've eaten in a long time! Great ambiance, fast and attentive service. Green salsa is soooo good! You won't be disappointed. Only reason I didn't give 5-stars was because I was charged for an item I did not receive or even ask for. Upon bringing this to their attention they apologized and fixed my ticket. Great little Mexican joint. We'll definitely be back! 4
The food was okay. I will not return, however. When I complained to the waitress that my wine was stale and vinegar-y, her reply was "well, you shouldn't have ordered the cheapest one then".  This has not happened frequently but when it has, a new glass has always been supplied immediately with a "so sorry". 1
Wow! This place was great! They fixed a puncture in my tire in less than a half hour for only $10! I'll never go anywhere else! Thanks! 5
We hopped into a cab from the Mirage to start at this end of the Strip. Whiskey sodas for him, whiskey on the rocks for me. I did end up falling on my butt because of some water on the wooden floor - that hurt and I still have the bruises and wounds on my feet - but they were good about it. The music is country, of course. There are two bars on two levels, with giant projection screens. Good place. 3
We recently moved to Fountain Hills and have been here four or five times.  Here are our favorites.  The flatbread/pizzas.  They are exceptional; thin crispy crust and always with fresh stuff on top.  If they have a special pizza, I would order it.  The Gattopardo with arugula/prosciutto was the closest thing to the pizza we loved in Italy.  My mouth is still watering over the Chicken Piccata.  My husband had the marsala and that was great too.  The calamari is fun if you have a group.  We like to go and have a glass of wine, salads and share a flatbread.  That is plenty for us.  Other people reviewed that the portions were small, I would say the portions are "normal" and for the price, I think fine.   It is nicely family run, with good service but not smothering. Maria works the front of the house.  Her husband works the wood fired pizza oven.  By the third time we were there, they welcomed us like we were family. 4
The refried beans and tacos are in a class by themselves! Really great in comparison to others.Everything else we've tried was similarly great EXCEPT for the Wak a Mole!They tried twice and still got it wrong.Love the place, highly recommended. 5
Drove past last night and noticed a new Bakery. Came to eat first thing in the morning to find out it was opening morning for the Bakery. I had the Apple Cranberry Oatmeal, and a  frappe Mocha. Both were very good. Oatmeal was a nice sized portion and very good. 5
Took the family here since we loved the Gen in Torrance California. We Went on a Tuesday night and still found a long line. Hostess told us only a 20 minute wait, ended up taking 45 min, I love Korean BBQ so it was worth the wait. The crappy part of waiting was watching parties the same size or with 1 more than our party get seated first. I decided to ask and they said that a table of 5 had to be seated first because the table of 5 was ready (we he 4 in our party) not sure how that worked. Once we were seated we were greeted right away and I was ready to order. I asked for the premium steak, 2 orders of brisket and the marinated steak. They ended up bringing everything except for the second brisket. You are allowed to order 4 meats, every time we asked for more than 1 of a meat they wouldn't bring it. Service was really good at first, It went to a crap after the first 30 min (it's a 2 hour minimum) which is fine but me and the wife didn't leave full at all. Our waiter seemed to try and not make eye contact every time he walked by, we would have to ask the busser or anyone else that walked by for our next meat. Once we were ready to go, I looked over he check and they charged my 4 year old and 2 year old 10$ each for all you can eat. They both only had rice.... Not sure how that works. Definitely won't be returning here. 3
The shoe department namely, the mens shoes department there has the worst customer service.  I was there on a weeknight, took two pairs of shoes and waited to be served.  There were two clerks working there, two other customers besides myself.  I was ignored, made to wait, and wait some more.  I waited for 20 minutes without even the clerk acknowledging my existence.  Disgusted I asked to speak to the floor manager on call that night.  I told the store manager what happened to me and that I will NOT EVER shop at their store again for this kind of bad service.  I eventually went to the puma store and bought 5 pairs of shoes.   Nordstrom, take note.  Piss me off and your bottom line will suffer.  Shoe stores and clothing stores are a dime a dozen - especially in las vegas. 1
Went for Thanksgiving buffet.  Lets start with the food:  lukewarm at best with soggy dressing and over cooked vegetables.  Knew we were in for a pricey dinner because of the holiday but then they hit you with special event parking plus a banquet service charge of 22% that doesn't include gratuity.  All in all very disappointing, will not return. 1
Solid experience.Fried green tomatoesLemon-herb salmon (potato salad/beans)(Fried okra/Mac& cheese)The beading for the tomatoes was excellent, and remained crispy fat longer than I expected. The salmon was nicely visited on the edges, while remaining flavorful. The Mac& cheese could have been a little cheesier, but I'm spoiled by the store bought ones. The okra was AMAZING. The beans and cornbread were alright, but combined, they were wonderful.The potato salad was a bit creamier than I preferred, but this scratched my itch for that home-cooked flavor. Worthwhile. 4
My uncle went into cardiac arrest and this was the closest hospital. They've taken amazing care of him. I love the nurses, the staff, and the doctors here. I just wish it would have been the same with me two weeks ago. Thank you for saving my uncles life. 4
If you dare to eat here do it I assume before 7pm. We got there a little before 9pm on a Tuesday evening (they are opened until 10pm).  The smell of the place should have been my first clue as to what I was in for. Moth balls and old musty water damaged wood comes to mind.  The food,  what there was of it... (1/2-3/4 of the hot food pans were empty) was dried up and stuck to the pans. And a fly seemed to enjoy the withering sushi (I only hope my husband and son survive consuming it). You may say well that's what we get for going so late.. but we were not alone... 3-4 other tables were sat after us!! (How they could seat people in good conscience is beyond me) If they are going to stay open until 10.... serve GOOD FRESH food until as close to 10 as possible!  Chinese buffets are some of our favorite places to eat...usually 2-3 times a month.  We've had them all over and this was by far the worst!  And never was one drink refill offered! There are ways to put out good quality food until closing without wasting food... smaller amounts at a time.  Especially when you have customers still coming in. We will never be back and I'm sure the owners could care less.... they got my 30 bucks. My advice... goggle another restaurant.... you couldn't possibly do worse. 1
This place is the GREATEST!!! Priced right quick and easy.  Get ready to pack that BOWL YO!!! 5
Visited on Monday morning, November 9.My major issues with this place is that the waitress had a real attitude.  Not only that but she had a cell phone to her ear from the time we were seated to the time we left, over an hour.Service was practically non existent.   Several times I had to get up and go to the counter for incidentals.  Getting a refill on coffee was like pulling teeth, we never did get a water refill.I ate there twice while in Vegas.  The meatloaf dry with the consistency of a can of dog food.  For my Monday breakfast I ordered sausage and eggs, all bland.To be fair, my friend really enjoyed his gumbo but completely turned off with the service. 2
Honestly, I wasn't impressed. The place itself is nice: the patio is gay boi heaven with lots of seating in the summer for people watchin'. There was a sufficient smattering of hunks in tanks and their older followers. I think that is the main draw here: the patio. It seems like the inside is very 'meh,' your typical converted Victorian home with the standard modern decor. My boyfriend and I went for Summerlicious and truthfully the food was good. I started with the caprese stack, had the streak frites for my main, and finished with the brownie. The price for the fixed menu itself seemed reasonable: $35. But seriously those portions were TINY. I mean the 'stack' literally had maybe 6 leaves. I mean, really!? Do I look like a bird? I need to EAT mofos. So while what was on the plate was tasty, there really wasn't much of it.  The steak was FATTY like, that's not ok. And the piece of meat was small. I understand that us Canadians may be used to big pieces of red meat, some the size of your arm, but this was just SMALL. The host was a nice enough guy but our Australian waiter was so abrupt. I mean like he was a bitchy queen. I saw him ordering around the bus boys, and demeaning the other staff. I mean, lighten up ol' boy. And while this is a relatively minor point I noticed that almost EVERY table they brought the wrong food to the wrong person. We were approached twice with someone else's food. None of the waiters deliver the food to their tables: they have the kitchen staff do this. And it seems they don't even tell them which table its supposed to go to because they just wander around aimlessly asking 'steak frites, anyone steak frites.' Like that is sosososo 'Applebee's' of them.The bill was $140. I KNOW. FOR TWO PEOPLE. I really find that over-priced, especially considering it was during SUMMERLICIOUS! Like, it's supposed to be cheap. Only cheap bitches go out during summerlicious. The pitcher of sangria was $39!!! Honestly the one thing that is really really overpriced here is the liquor. You could've made that shit for $10 yourself. Not impressed. Won't be back. We'll try some over spots in the Village before coming back here. 2
It's hard to find a really good Chinese food place around here!! This is one of my favorites in this area. I recommend the shrimp egg foo Yeung (not sure how it's spelt), the orange chicken and the beef and broccoli! 4
The place was almost empty when we arrived on a Saturday afternoon, only 3 other tables were filled. The service is average and the servers don't seem to speak much English or maybe they are just very quiet. We ordered the seafood chao mian and the general's chicken. It was very good, and greasy like most of the authentic Chinese food I've had. I would go there again. If you're looking for five star butt kissing service you wont find it here, but if you're looking for authentic tasting food its a good pick. 3
The desserts are alright, but the service is a let-down. I've been here on two occasions. The first time the service was barely satisfactory, and the second time, we just left after 10 minutes of waiting for service after sitting down. The wait staff, who look and act as if they are customers themselves, served a group of 8+ people who came in 5 minutes after us. Clearly they have their priorities, so we didn't want to bother them. 2
I go here about once every six weeks or so to get my hair lined up. The lady who owns the place is very firnedly and I always get a proper haircut. My girlfriend says she likes this place much better than the place I used to go. She says I look "hotter after my haircut"   :)  The prices are very reasonable, it's clean and in a good location.   4 Stars! 4
Went there with a friend for a late lunch on a Friday afternoon. When we got there we were the only people in the restaurant. We both decided to a get a beer, after about 10 minutes I was told they didn't have the beer I wanted, so I decided to get the one my friend got. We ordered the fish tacos, steak tacos, mac and cheese and empanadas. There was only one server and they seemed to be getting ready for some kind of event.The food took incredibly long to arrive which was rather odd considering we were the only only ones there. We ordered two empanadas but only got one...after asking if the second one would be out soon we were told that that was it, and nothing else would be arriving; which means the order was taken down incorrectly. Again, odd...considering we were the only ones there . The waiter was polite, however considering that they weren't busy I was surprised at the error and the amount of time the food took to arrive.The food was actually pretty good, everything tasted fresh and the empanada was really flavorful and crisp on the outside. I might return again for dinner to see if the less than ideal service was an oddity. 3
Horrible service. The food took a very long time to be ready and when it was ready it was cold. When I asked for it to be heated the waiter was very rude to me. I felt disrespected. 1
It's cold here, like anywhere indoors in Vegas.  We came for a late lunch on Labor Day weekend, so it was still a little crowded even around 1pm, a 10-minute wait.  But we got a nice table by the fountains and strip club, so it was pleasing for both parties. :)The food seemed a little 'meh', to put it best.  It was very run-of-the-mill island bar fare.  Basically their take on "Hawaiian" burgers is to put bacon or avocados on everything, with a slice of pineapple on the side.  Last time I checked, that really doesn't have very much to do with the beautiful islands of Hawai'i at all.  Neither does the Buffalo Burger, which we ordered.The burger came out medium rare, which was nice.  Although, my girlfriend did later complain about some stomach pains, which made it a tough day.The prices here are going to be resort prices - you can get better just by walking around in Vegas, and I suggest you do, unless you're absolutely set on eating at the Miracle Mile Shops. 2
Staff is somewhat friendly but the Doctor is rude. If I had to choose all over again where to get braces I would pick a different orthodontist. 1
Food was cold and didn't taste good then to top it off the manager was yelling at these two ladies and just being so rude when they went nicely up to him to inform him that they weren't satisfied with the food yeah after that I'm good I'd rather go to denny's 1
This specific location had the finest level of service and quality I have had at a Taco Bell in a really long time.  This is nit-picky, but It has probably been 15 years since I have eaten a Burrito Supreme that didn't have all of the sour cream accumulated on one end of the shell.  At this location, they do it right: evenly distributed with equal shares of filling in every bite.  Other items were also prepared with surprising care and quality, plus they gave me just enough sauce at the drive thru, dare I say perfect?  They've done right by me on two occasions, so I suspect it might not be a fluke!  Also, friendly and personable staff. 5
I bought a package for 5 versa spa spray tan sessions which I was only given 3 months to use. Well I only had a chance to use 2 during sessions During that time so they extended it for a month. Unfortunately, given my hectic schedule, I only could fit one more in during that  extension. Basically, My time is up and I have 2 unused spray tans. The 5 tan package cost $170. Since I only used 3, I wasted 2 sessions. So in reality, it ended up that I paid about $58/per Versa spa tan!! The tanning place I used to use before this place bought them out never had a time limit! I'm so upset that I had only 4 months to use my 5 spray tans. I am definitely going to look around for a new place to tan that doesn't restrict u to a time limit. Also the staff is very pushy to sell you a $55 bottle of of pre tan primer. I bought a $12 sample and my tan smeared all over and the tanning solution got all over my close! DO NOT BUY A PRIMER FOR SPRAY TANS! THEY MADE MY TANNING SPOTTY AND IT DID NOT PROLONG TGE TAN AT ALL!! I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE AT ALL to anyone!! 1
I would like to say right off the bat, I am a fan of this place...BUT! today when we visited this establishment we were treated BADLY...I'm 45 years old, spent most of my late teens and early 20ties at night clubs, listening to LOUD music.. but never thought I would be subjected to LOUD MUSIC at a breakfast restaurant, even if it's at 2:00 in the afternoon, needless to say, we asked if the music could be lowered a little, NOT turned off, I wasn't being unreasonable.. TO which I was told "I don't think I can,the cooks like it loud" !!!  I mean REALLY? I'm only going to be in the place for the most 45 min's, you mean you can't lower the volume of the music for 45 min's? So I can enjoy a meal I'm Paying for!!  So let's finish the story, they lowered it a TINY bit, for 4 min's then a song one of the waiters liked came on, and he proceeded to turn the music back up, So again I asked if they would be so kind as to lower it, to which they turned it down soooo slightly that it made no difference at all..and after about 5 more min's it was back to it's original volume..at that point I was pissed beyond belief so I rushed ate my food and as soon as the last fork full was past my lips I left the restaurant and walked out the door, and my husband who was also bothered by the LOUD music didn't not leave a tip.. I won't be back to the George st dinner for a while now..maybe even never again... 4
Well what can I say...this place has been around for what seems like forever and if your hungry enough can be quite good. Especially, if you don't mind dirty tables, an occasional roach and a cashier that is a bit on the intense side. But on a normal day Happy Foods is less than satisfying, especially when you have more than a few choices of really good, clean Chinese food spots within the area. 2
The service throughout the night was inconsistent.  I asked how the shrimp was prepared.  The server said, "medium, we prepare all of our fish medium." Uncooked shrimp? No thanks.  We ordered two appetizers, a salad, steaks, and a side dish.  The oysters were placed on the table without explanation of the accompanying sauces.  The salad was good, tomatoes were fresh.  The lobster mashed potatoes had so much butter that it was pooling around the edges of the bowl.  One steak was overcooked, came out medium well instead of medium rare.  The server took it back and the manager quickly came over to apologize and offered to even cook both steaks again so we could eat together.  We felt it was handled appropriately and would easily have returned for future meals after this.  However, the steak never came out.  I asked the server after a long while to see if it may be ready.  She came back from the kitchen frazzled and said, "it will be out but I don't have a time to give you."  Then a kitchen manager brought a piece of meat, set it down, did not wait for me to cut it open and quickly left. It was very fatty and appeared to be NOT the cut of meat (filet) that I had ordered.  It was over cooked, again.  The server happened to walk over and said, "yes, I thought that it didn't look right."  I left without eating dinner.  She brought the check over and said, "I'm sure you guys don't want dessert, so I brought the check."  The manager never followed up to see if I had received the new steak.  The issues could've easily been solved had someone not dropped the ball and given up on following through.  They did credit the check for two steaks, but really that was not the issue.  Unfortunately, this restaurant was a big let down. 1
Awesome service, real simple and easy process, very affordable and very polite employee! 5
Service stinks.....We stopped in and waited for 5-10 minutes and we left as no one came over to get us a drink.  They were not busy.  Grrrrrrr 1
Food is always fresh and tasty. Staff is friendly and accommodating. The service can be slow at times when busy. Overall a great neighborhood sushi go to. I love the creative rolls like the 67th Ave. roll. 4
Great place! Friendly staff. Good music and awesome beer selection. I reco Bells two hearted ale! 5
We've had Pho at different places all over the city.  When I want Pho, this is where I want to go. I don't know their secret but I love the spring rolls and rare beef pho made here. Nothing else seems to compare for me.  We will drive across the city to go here for inexpensive, fantastic Pho! 4
Well I did it, I made the schlep!  I actually found a much better route then Avenue Rd.  I arrived just over half an hour early for my appointment this time and Thuy was available to take me in early.  Thankfully because as a newbie it took a little more time than I imagine a maintenance session would.Does it hurt?  For a second there's the usual waxing rip of pain but gone a second later.  I did take two aspirin an hour before the appointment as Tien recommended and I can't be sure if that was necessary.  I'd like to think I could handle the discomfort unmanaged but won't know better till next time.Yes, the place is immaculately clean.  Thuy is experienced and enjoys her work.  She told me how to maintain my wax to prevent ingrown hairs and definitely what not to do.   I would highly recommend this place and am glad to have it in my bag of tricks.  Every girl needs one you know ;) 5
The hostess was really nice and friendly but as soon as we sat at are booth are waitress was so rude you can tell she just hated her job.. She took forever to come take are order . I ordered the taco salad with chicken (special order) asked for no tomato or onions. Food comes out really fast and I start mixing the salad a little bit I notice a couple tomatoes no big deal... eat a little bit more a whole layer of tomatoes ( even told her please make sure there is no tomatoes or onions ). She checks on Us once and i mention the tomatoes and I show her the plate of tomatoes I have now all she could say In the biggest attitude was I'm sorry We get done eating and we don't see are waitress again for 20 minutes she is no where to be found she finally showed up with are check and makes a comment by saying she tried to prices are things the best she could and then proceeds to say "homeboy is hungry this is a lot of food" .. (she is referring to my boyfriend)  like really you are basically calling him fat -_- RUDE! defiantly going to be a while till I go back 2
Love coming to this place for a great comedy show. The only thing that bothers me is expensive drinks and a expensive two drink minimum. The waiters or waitress I never have issues with, nothing but great service. Live,Laugh, Love that's what I say. 5
Go and try it - the food is delicious, you won't be disappointed.  That said - it's Banh Mi.  Go to any mom and pop Banh Mi shop in the city and the sandwich is $2-3 tax included.  Here it will set you back $8-10.  My 4 stars is for the pricing of what in Vietnam is a humbling and cost friendly experience of cross cultural fusion.  At BMB it's just a little too pretentious for my taste.  Everything is delicious, but you're paying for an environ designed to cater to the Western consumer.  I suppose you cannot blame them for their business sense, but it just rings off inauthentic. Amazing kimchi fries, even if it's a day's worth of calories in a bowl- you gotta get those.  Don't get it as a side on your own unless you are morbidly obese or like to throw away food. 4
This place is all right. I really can't complain; food was decent, our server was amazing, knowledgeable, and had good and obviously heartfelt suggestions for both our table and another.The prices are a little high, but I think it's overhead (given the fancy interior, Scottsdale location, full bar, and number of employees). The food seems to be high-quality, as well. All I'm saying is that you can get comparable food (Mexican) elsewhere for cheaper.Still, a good place. 3
The fluff and fold service is definitely worth giving a shot. They turned it around in about 4 hours and all of my clothes were on hangers when picked up much like a dry cleaners. The owner Sylvia was also very courteous. I recommend!!Vincent - Atlanta, GA 5
I was in Toronto for a business trip and decided to visit this place based on a friend's recommendation. The place has a nice modern decore. The menu had nothing special. The selection were limited (e.g., you could only get one type of steak !). I ordered one of their pastas and while the taste was good, the portion was ridiculously small. I mean for pasta you expect at least a reasonable portion as it doesn't come with any side. My colleges ordered liver and chicken burger. Both of them liked the taste but again, portion was a problem. Overall, I think this place doesn't worth the price you pay for the food. 3
Do not go to Dr. Sharma I can't stress that enough!!! I seriously don't understand how he has so many positive ratings.I went to him for a severe medical condition (bronchitis). The wait was nearly an hour long and his receptionist/help are idiots who don't know what they are doing and speak very poor English. The medication he prescribed me gave me a nasty allergic reaction on my face and body. His nurse Luis kept insisting that he sent over a new prescription to my pharmacy but over a 6 hour period my pharmacy told he he hadn't before I finally got it. I asked them to reimburse me for my medication which they refused.And the worst part I told the doctor I needed him to approve FMLA otherwise my company would discipline me (I know I worked for a terrible company), at the time Dr. Sharma said he would and thought it was a travesty my company would do that.I paid him $25 for it, despite my displeasure he didn't reimburse my mis-medication cost. But then to my surprise my company tells me he stated my condition was not serious enough. I thought it was a mistake and felt he would easily fix it...WRONG! I went to his office and Luis kept insisting he filled out my FMLA form correctly I thought he was an idiot so I asked to speak to Sharma. He made me wait over an hour. When I finally got to see Dr. Sharma he lied to me saying that he only promised to fill out the FMLA form not get it approved but I knew I asked him before to get it approved cause I know my company's strict policies. He then kept using all these manipulation tactics to try and get me to believe that I was wrong but I saw what he was doing and I wasn't buying it. I was furious and let him know about it. When all his BS wasn't working on me he just ends it like a scumbag politician telling me that I will not raise my voice to him and that he was going to "report that I tried to intimidate him." Who was he reporting to btw? My guess is the Imaginary Board. As he was walking out I told him I'll be getting a lawyer, then I chased him into the hallway and told him he was a fraud and crook. He yelled at me to get out of his office. I did and right to a lawyer...I almost called the police but realized there probably wasn't much they could do.I did not pay him to give me a life threatening medication and he ripped me off for that $25 just to sign his name...once again he is a crook!!! 1
Big Twin Peaks but very expensive beer- $9 for a Coors lite that would be no more than $6 at their other locations. 2
I went to Bar_One for Sunday brunch with a dear friend who I hadn't seen in a long while. I called the day before to reserve a table on the back patio (FYI they accept reservations for seatings before 11 a.m  only), and when I got there was seated with a smile. I quickly realized that eating on the patio on a day  like this would cause me to melt away, so I asked the server if there happened to be a table free inside (in the air conditioning!).  This was after we had ordered and already started sipping our delicious mimosa's!Lucky for us, there was a table free and our server was nothing but helpful and friendly throughout the transition inside.Now for the eats! Dee-liiissshhh-oouuuss!!!I had the Ozo Buco (egg in the hole) with smoked Salmon and spicy hollandaise. The bread was thick, and soft, and the hollandise was draped inside meticulously as not to take over the dish. I also ordered a side of peameal ($2) to complete my tasting, and I was in heaven!!My brunch companion ordered the Bar_One Brunch and was just as impressed. Eggs, potatos, pancakes.. The perfect portions to make a successful meal.I will go so far to say that Bar_One has one of the best brunches in the city.  Plus, who can resist an atmosphere that is modern yet has a family feel?Well done guys, I will most definitely be back! 4
I liked this place but didn't love it. The decor felt exactly like a typical restaurant anywhere in Mexico. It was pretty empty on a weekday night and there was only one server working but she was great. Friendly, efficient, and she pronounced all the dishes properly which impressed me. The food was good but lacked a bit of flavour and I didn't like that you had to pay extra for salsas. My wife had pozole which tasted pretty authentic however we would have preferred tostadas instead of totopos to have with it, and it was missing the standard garnishes of shredded lettuce, radish, and chopped onion. We even had to ask for a slice of lime (which the server graciously provided but one shouldn't have to ASK for lime when ordering pozole). I had the taquitos which were fine but bland. I would have liked to have had some fresh salsa to put on them. Perhaps I would go back if I were in the neighbourhood and Ravi Soups was closed but it wouldn't be my first choice. 3
Great place. Best hidden secret in Solon Ohio. The service and atmosphere are second to none. Happy Hour so good you would want it to never end. Russ is so courteous and pleasant. Makes great drinks. Every food item is tasty. 5
Our visit with our new puppy Molly was wonderful!!  The staff was kind, gentle and truly interested in our new addition.  I would highly recommend them. 5
I had the scallop quesadilla which was like eating a salt lick. Dining partner had the green corn tamales which had a really pungent cheese which made them unpleasant to eat. The beans on the side were cooked in red wine with a spicy sauce which was bitter and spicy, a particularly bad combo. Given the price of 12-15$ per plate more palatable fair should be the standard. Secreto has a nice atmosphere and great decor so I'm giving a second try in the future but I find it fishy that 2/3rds of the entree menu is steaks and pasta when this is suppose to be a New Mexican restaurant. 2
(POOR SERVICE).   My water heater went out so I came on yelp to find a good company, saw the five star rating Pure had so went with them. Started out ok, made a next day appointment, they showed up on time told me what I needed and gave me a price but said they had to get the part so couldn't be fixed till the next day and they would be out between 10 and 12. I received a call a little after 10 saying they couldn't be out that day and I need to reschedule which I did for the following day with the same time window. The day of the appointment I received another phone call saying they were going to be 2 to 4 hours late so I wasted my day sitting around waiting again. Finally a new guy comes out looks it over again and tells me he will be back he has to go it parts ( the water heater problem was already diagnosed) not sure why he didn't come with the parts in hand. An hour later he returns and fixes it. Later the same evening I still don't have hot water so I call pure back the next day they tell me the will be out and fix it which that did not happen and I had to reschedule again went 3 more days without hot water because I work 12hr days and they wouldn't  come out after 6 to fix the problem right. which brings it to 7 days now with no hot water. Had another appointment scheduled for window 10 - 12 and again I have been told they won't make it out until 2. All I have received from this company is a waste of my time and Receipt for $195 that fixed nothing. (UPDATE) I'm giving Pure 3 stars now up from 1 star because the own has reached out to us to apologize for the hassle it was to have the water heater replaced. I feel that the multiple attempts the owner  has made to reach us has a genuine feel to it and if I would have gone up the chain of command with my issues and made Andrew (the owner) aware, he would have had someone come out after 6pm when I was off work to address the repeat problem since they do have an after normal business hours crew. 3
Not a complete waste of time... The music was really good and the mix was fluid when I went earlier this year.... Also seems like the club might be employing girls to dance with random guys.... Hmmmm... Worth the cover (whatever it was ... Less than $10).  Hard drinks and wine are a bit pricey, but some nights they have pitchers of beer for $5 or $6. 3
Starting with the stale chips and ending with a disgustingly dirty bathroom with no soap and no paper towels.  I can't imagine what the kitchen looked like.   Beer was good. 1
Scam alert.  Was given $100 in credit for the slot machines.  You must use it all in one special "promotional" machine.  with a MAX payout of $100, and to even get you must win a fake jackpot over $4,000.  This place was in need of repair, with rude staff and a generally scummy vibe. 1
Kyle is an exceptional server! He always takes great care of me and makes fantastic suggestions when I can't decide what I want. Love going to CPK at Town Square! 4
Sun's Thai Food & Jerky was a wonderful surprise! We stopped in to grab their lunch special, around six dollars for select entrees and it included a drink, a small appetizer (either soup or a spring roll), and steamed rice. They have a karaoke stage open to the public, and the atmosphere is relaxing and simple. The service was really friendly and was happy to answer any questions we had.My boyfriend ordered red curry, and I ordered the green, each with pork as the meat. The orders came very quickly, and the appetizers were quite good. The spring roll was a little plain, nothing special, but the hot and sour soup was fantastic. The curry that we ordered for the lunch special came in a bowl with a scoop of rice next to it. It didn't look like a lot of food until they were combined, but I could barely finish half of mine, so don't worry about leaving hungry. Their portions are quite generous. As for drinks, the standard Thai tea and Thai coffee were delicious and included in the special. The only warning I have to give about this place is how spicy their seven was. I can usually handle spicy food pretty well, but they use baked Thai chilies, and they really bite you back. My boyfriend, however, ordered their ten and absolutely loved it, so I suppose it just depends on if you're a weenie or not. Either way, Sun's Thai Food and Jerky was a delicious spur-of-the-moment choice and we will definitely be going back. 4
Disappointed. Service was slow and my husband was not served what he ordered.  He got fried catfish and ordered grilled.  When they finally brought the grilled fish it was cold and much too salty. ....and I had already finished my salad (the salad was very underwhelming) They took the fish off the bill only after I asked to speak with the manager.  Manager apologized and gave us his card to dine next time.  However, I don't think we'll spend our time there again. 1
Food was amazing! We saw a sign spinner on 19th ave and Greenway that said $1.99 gyro sandwich.... I looked to my right and I saw Good Fellas Grill in the Chino Bandito shopping mall. It was probably the best decision I had made all day, after a 7 hour work day I walked in was greeted, and ordered our two gyro sandwiches. We were given large servings of soup from the owner, my bf had chicken curry potato and I tried the lentil which were both amazing. We received our gyros which were on the best pita bread I've honestly ever had, the gyro was not greasy which I've had gyros that were total opposite, the onions and tomatoes were nice and fresh as well. The facilities were very clean, they had two big screens playing ESPN, which I love, and the bathrooms were nice and clean. The owner introduced himself as well which I find very respectable. I will be going back and I recommend you try Good Fellas Grill, you will be going back for more. 5
The food is about what your expect from a typical diner/restaurant. The pies are good but not the best. Service has been good but slow. The servers always seem to have too large of sections to take care of efficiently. The front end staff seems to vanish when needed. A server finally seated us when there wasn't a host in sight. Then when it was time to pay there wasn't anyone at the cash register. Because we are honest people we waited around for her to show up so we could pay. Has a nice quiet atmosphere which is good. 3
Pros: Nice staff, attractive atmosphereCons: Bland food, misleading because it looked delicious, staff traffic to back officeDetails: Had chicken, apple and pecans salad. The balsamic vinaigrette was straight vinegar. Where do you find apples and feta cheese with NO taste? Butter served with the bread was so hard it bent the knife. Pity. 2
???beef tenderloin pho, ???spring rolls, ?? 4
LOVE this place. Best Thai food in downtown toronto. 5
Today Dr. Veena and Julie came to our home and helped my family say Good Bye to our beautiful Louie. My children and myself were with Louie holding him and loving him. At these times, one is not able to think straight, Dr. Veena and Julie were a true blessing, guiding us all in every step of the way. They were our guiding angels in my family's time of sorrow. And they made Louie feel as if they've known him forever. Thank you soo very much Dr. Veena and Julie. The Osborns 5
Only giving it 2 stars because the pizza was good. A special was written on the outside board, but when I asked about it they said it was no longer available. Ordered garlic knots and pizza and only pizza was brought out. No plates and no garlic knots. When the pizza was brought out, we were asked if we wanted garlic bread instead, without any explanation. Decided not to get garlic bread. Hubby went next door to get doughnuts to take home with us, while we were waiting for our food. They wouldn't allow us to bring a dozen doughnuts in. The bathrooms were a mess with no soap and the service wasn't good. We won't be returning. 2
Not a fan.  Tastes like gross fast food in a nice setting.  If you like chain restaurant and rich, unhealthy food you might really like this place.  As a caveat, I am picky with what I eat and try to eat clean...My experience:  Had the harvest salad (subbed the veg burger for chix) and after my first bite, I immediately did not want to eat anymore, but felt awkward because I was with a group.  Though some may like the house dressing, it was way to oily for me.  I cannot imagine what they put in it, as it tastes like it exceeds the calories and fat in any other dressing I have ever had.  Their dressing ruined a perfectly good salad. The veggie burger was ok; nothing to rave or complain about.  Ended up eating as little as possible and pitching the to-go  as soon as I got home.The apps that were ordered were also super greasy and gross (tots and zucchini frites served with lots of mayo sauces).  Pamela the server was ok.  The food was just not what I want to put into my body. 1
Great place for us to hang out on a Wednesday night.  In town for a certification class, and we had a great time.  For $13 each we played 2 games and rented shoes.  But the bowling is just the activity.  The fun is the atmosphere.  Loud pumping music made an average evening better.  The lovely staff was very accommodating.  Drag show was at 11:00, and we all clapped for the talented performers.  I have been to many vegas parties where there is a DJ spinning and lots of fun to be had, but this place has a bit of everything.  Some folks are stating the drinks were too much, but we did pitchers of draft Rocktop for $11.A great time, and we will be returning.  If you are looking for a coddling experience, this is not it.  The wait staff has many duties, but they always made sure we were taken care of.  I love to see people comfortable with their bodies and making themselves beautiful.Not for the faint of heart, but you are in vegas, go with it. 4
Great food but we sat in the bar and the two young gentleman behind the bar spent more time playing around than refilling our drinks or taking our order. We ended up going elsewhere for more drinks. But the food was AMAZING 3
This Place is okay certain workers have really bad attitudes, Michelle had the worse attitude & it was my first day coming to this place and she wasn't very helpful so I had a OKAY experience As far as Andy he is a amazing employee was very helpful,stayed overtime to help my friend with her nails such a great job but as far as the other employees I don't really care for there services! Would I come back here PROBABLY NOT! If it was the last choice on earth I probably would come back and only want my nails done by Andy 2
So the food is solid, why the 3 stars you might ask. It's all in the service. Our server had a very negative attitude and rarely came back to check on us. my server took away my tofu bowl when I was still working on it. I'm not sure if I will get a better experience if I go back again, but I'm not sure I'd go back just because of the service and the feeling we were rushed. Overall service is 1-2 stars.Bottom line is maybe it's just isolated experience but although my food was decent, the service really killed the night. 3
P.F. Chang's is decent. Not great, not terrible, but decent. They have a large menu, so you have a lot of options to pick from. Like I said, everything tastes okay, but there's nothing special or noteworthy. The decor is very nice; a bit dark and intimate. On our most recent visit, our server was very good, but it took a ridiculous length of time to receive our food. Parking is in a large, free lot, though it can still often be difficult to find a space. Overall, you'll likely find more authentic and better tasting Chinese food at Hunan by the Falls or Ho Wah, two locally-owned Chinese restaurants. 3
The kind of place I'd usually enjoy but it's bad.  Service was slow, seemed like the regs run the place and I'm sure they love it.  Being a newb it's pretty obvious I was ignored on purpose, got that... You're a hassle feel.  Got a beer and a burger,   Beer was cold and comped as I was playing poker.  Burger was pretty bad as were fries.The only reason I gave it two stars was low expectations for a bar.  I live within a block... Won't go back. 2
Love their subs so much more than subway. an original large for $3 is such a steal too 5
Dilworth Animal Hospital is the best vet clinic I have ever been to, and with over 30 pets throughout my life, I have been to a lot. They have always been able to fit me in for semi-emergencies right away, even before we were clients there. The staff really care about animals, and always ask how my other pets are doing by name. Dr. Wheelock has even called us after a visit to make sure my pets are doing well. I recommend Dilworth Animal Hospital to every single pet owner. If I could give more than 5 stars, I would! 5
If you have to wait in front of a hostess for more then 20 minutes and 40 minutes in line without any acknowledgment from the hostess then that's when you make sure you take that place of your list. Complaining to a lady manager who ignores the fact of a senior and 3 kids in line is morally unfair.  Red rock casino sure will never again have my business. 1
The prices are great and I am always happy with the way my eyebrows look afterwards. The only thing I would recommend is that you arrive their first thing in the morning, as there are usually 15 people waiting outside before they open. I would recommend this place to my friends in a heartbeat! 4
0 star! Shrimp won ton but no shrimp! Only meat inside ! Told them about that staff just say nothing ! Bad list !! 1
This location is the worst. I wont visit this Roberto's ever again, lucky there is another location near by and I go to that one and give them a good rating. 1
This is a great place to get supplies for seed starting, seeds, garden tools and supplies. They have a few organic fertilizer options but not as many as a few other places in town. Most of their seeds are their own line which is reasonably priced and grow well. They also have bareroot plants and garden transplants. 4
Friendly service. Hairstylist and partner/manager offered me drinks.TG was willing to stay later hour, after my very messy day at work, to do a color - roots touch up/ bleach on me. Great work, professionalism and patience.Chairs and waiting sofa are comfortable. Walks-in are welcome. Very friendly and courteous service.  The salon is spacious, clean and neat.  The Pandora music background is a plus. 5
Have always wanted to stay at Bellagio, but wanted to save it for a special occasion. When my husband I were married last Sept, we decided to stay at the Bellagio on the wedding night.Booked a decent deal (three nights for the price of two) and made sure we had a nice view of the fountains. This was a must, for us there was no point in staying at this hotel unless we could enjoy the fountains.The guest room was adequate, but not overly nice. I was actually kind of disappointed. Before staying here, I thought the Bellagio was supposed to be one of the snazziest hotels on the strip. As a passerby I was always impressed by the casino and lobby, so I assumed the hotel rooms would also be incredible. So the room was just ok. No fancy tv, relatively small room, and decently appointed bathroom. The fountain show was amazing though. I've never had a room with such a beautiful view. In the evening the show would come on every 15 minutes (until midnight) and you could turn the tv to a certain channel, which would play the coordinating music. Nice touch.For the money, I feel like I could find nicer hotels in Vegas. Bellagio has been a staple on the Strip for a long time, but I think other hotels are competing in the luxury four/five star resort status. I would stay at the Bellagio again, but I would probably splurge for a suite...which would definitely have to face the fountains. 4
2 cheese burgers  ( one of the burgers had bacon added)1- small french fries1- onion rings1 small drink    =25 bucks    is way too much to  dish out ,  when  IN n OUT  or Culvers  is jst as good if not  better. "i said good day  sir!" 2
Sorry but this place is bogus. The only real similarity to the Midwest eateries is the name. The burgers were average but the fries were too greasy. Worst of all the place was dirty. Although it wasn't busy, all the empty tables (8-10) needed to be wiped down.  It had been a long time since I Steak and Shaked, and unless I go on a road trip it will likely be a while until I do so again.  I ignored the subpar reviews because I had fond memories of S n S.  I learned that Yelp is your friend that you need to have more faith in... 2
This is a nice place for lunch. The whole table shared a lot of food. We had a variety of foods, from different styles of fried rice and noodles to wonton soup and crispy shrimp rolls. Everything was very tasty. Although the food was great, I would of liked it to be a little cheaper as I felt I was overpaying for my lunch. 4
My Wife and I arrived at the Venetian at midnight. We were very tired and hungry! We dropped our baggage off in our lovely room and headed back down to the Grand Lux which is open 24/7. Almost no wait time, and we got a booth right away. Very friendly staff. Got our drinks and food promptly. We had lemonades which were good but way too sweet and concentrated so we added extra water to them - then they were delicious. I had the Madeira chicken which is chicken breasts covered in mozzarella cheese and a mushroom sauce poured on top. It was pretty good. My Wife had the Cuban Sandwich which was decent. Price ~ $40 minus tip.We decided we won't eat at the same place twice whilst visiting here but if you need a quick food fix it's definitely a reasonable and convenient place. 3
I used them to clean my carpets.  There was nothing wrong with them, and the carpets are cleaner, but I can get the same technique and cleaning products for much cheaper elsewhere.  I only had one room and a hallway for which they charged over $100 and only took the guy about an hour or less.  I used them due to the good reviews on Yelp, but they were nothing special. 3
I have stayed at this hotel 3 times in the past year and a half. There was a reason for that..it was clean, had nice staff, was inexpensive, had no crowds and most of all...no resort fees. As many have stated on here, I went on here a week ago to book a room, and there it was in bold letters..RESORT FEE. You're really going to charge a resort fee for a hotel that's off of the strip? Oh, and what do we get for the wonderful $25 PER NIGHT? A measly bottle of water, some DVD's, and a long distance call..oh and terrible internet? I am disappointed by this and I hope they soon realize that this decision will turn out to be a terrible mistake in the future. 2
I went here on a Weds night with my son before seeing a movie next door. The restaurant was active but not "busy"-lots of tables open. We stood at the front door for at least 10 minutes without seeing a hostess, manager-anyone to seat us. I finally decided to seat ourselves in the bar area-which was fine but not my first choice with a 12 year old. It took another 15 minutes for a server/bartender to acknowledge us and take our order-I would have understood if the bar tables were packed but there were at least 8+ open tables. We just came in for wings-seemed to me to be a simple order. It took another 35 minutes at least to get our food-not one stop by from a server or the bartender during this time-I would have gotten another drink. I had to go up the bar myself to ask for a refill for my son as well as ask for the status on our food and then the bill. I am giving 2 stars because the food was good but the service was very much lacking. I am not one to give bad reviews but we were so disappointed that night I had to share. No one apologized for the food wait or service the entire time. 2
Cool Hispanic urban vibe.  Love the Dio de los Muertes wall art.  Great designer tacos and guac. 4
Tried sushi buffet here.. Good:* friendly staff* nice environment* quick service* dynamite , salmon & California rolls are goodBad:* Tempura - you can easily squeeze oil from it.. * sushi rolls are decent nothing stand out* limited selection compare to other restaurants* No shrimp tempura :(* No desserts 3
Very unprofessional! Not reasonable AT ALL! Moving here will definitely be a waste of time and money. Molded window seals and molded blinds,  as well as water damage all across baseboards. Have to constantly call to get things repaired. They don't fix the problem they just paint over it just like maintenance did with the mold on the windows and in the bathrooms. No window screens, so if you want to have your window open a cat or something will be joining you for bed. Don't follow up with customers profiles. Will let you put zeros as your social and get away with it. Don't remember the lies they tell so they make up new ones. Rarely answer the damn phones and sit right in front of them. Rude as hell and don't care about the people, just care about collecting their own checks.  Needs new management!!! I hate I even moved here and wouldn't recommend this piece of shit place to anyone. Wouldn't have chosen a star at all, but in order to post my review I had to. :-) 1
Good local shop.  I haven't experienced any racism like jayson and can safely say after LONG conversations with a very interesting owner that they are NOT a racist bike shop.  Madison maybe a bit on the hyper-sensitive side when pulling the race card. 4
This place is a definite pass. Seems like they cut corners with everything but it's still just as pricey as quality places. We ordered delivery and the food took over an hour to arrive, the sushi was warm, and very underwhelming. Most enjoyable part of the meal was the after dinner mint. 1
I really like this place, but I had to dock it one-star simply because the service and some of the menu items could be improved (very easily, I might add). I love the super nachos w/carne asada and the chicken quesadillas (no veggies added) w/sour cream on the side. So good! 4
Very nice laid back spot.. Awesome foods, and drinks as well. I only gave it a 4 star because the seating can be an issue challenge on weekends. Get there between 5and 6 on Friday and Saturdays to avoid standing !! Enjoy 4
First time doing an escape room.. Wow! We were pleasantly surprised how challenging and how much thought went into the planning of our room. And we were not even at their hardest room! We did the "Great Escape" room which was their intermediate room. 4 people and it took us around 1hr20min with "clues" provided by the staff. Staff was super friendly and helpful. We would return again to do another room for sure! 5
Not a very clean place. This is the first impression when you walk in here. Staff aren't friendly either. Very hard to get their attention when you need them. Food is average. The only thing that I like on the menu is Satay Beef vermicelli. Never expected much every time I come here. Only come here when it's a friend's request or when we ran out of option. 2
Went here to check it out since my coworker was singing Barro's praises. Welp, it's pretty run-of-the-mill. The crust (the most important part of a pizza) is weird and kinda spongy, but otherwise comparable to any other run-of-the-mill pizza joint. I got the Kona, which is some kind of play on a Hawaiian pizza except it has chicken instead of ham and some kind of sweet teriyaki glaze instead of red sauce. Not very good, and if I had it to do again I'd just get a traditional pizza. Still, don't think it's really worth it without a coupon or something.The staff was nice and the atmosphere if you're dining in (I didn't) seems above average for this type of place. 2
Staying at the Westin Lake Las Vegas for our annual summer trip when we craved some pizza. So I yelped pizza and Bistro came up with the best reviews so we decided to give it a try. The pizza was so good with the most perfect crust. My husband had their spaghetti /meatballs and  really enjoyed it. The food was good and so was the service. The young guys behind the counter were really nice and just friendly.... Had to find in chain restaurants nowadays. Will definitely go back when we're in town. 5
Our experience was the reverse of some the other reviewers: service was fine but food was not good. The chips and salsas were decent. I had the Al Pastor and Shrimp tacos. The problem was that I could not tell which was pork and which was shrimp - they both were chopped into the same size and tasted like overly seasoned and indistinguishable meat. Tasted my kids chicken fingers and they were dry and flavorless, straight from the freezer and microwave. I will not be coming back. 2
It was ok. Small place not so clean but thats not so bad for me. My girlfriend didn't like the food,for me it was ok.nothing special but if you are around the corner give it a try. 3
The Daisy Cafe and Cupcakery has a well thought out menu with a fewer selections than most places but they have excellent food. I have had breakfast and lunch there- both were good. I always have cupcakes when I go there and they are ALWAYS good. There is usually a unique variety of cupcakes and they barely make it home before I devour them! I like this place! Local, independent place lovely interior and cute waiters. 4
Food is ok but not that great.  Nice patio and the servers are friendly and attentive.  Prices are ok but I'd rather go to The Keg for steak as the quality of beef is much better and worth the extra few $. 3
We were looking forward to our first trip to the famous Grand Canyon and paid for the upgrade thinking this would be worth the extra money but were quickly disappointed because we were the second to the last hotel pick up, had a group of six and had to be split up.  Two teens got to together, my sister and  her  11 yr old on another seat close by but myself and my other sister had to sit with strangers as there were "single" riders that took window seats and refused to move to accommodate us and weren't really close to the rest of our group.  This totally ruined my day as the bus ride is very long and was not enjoyable not to be with your family!  I feel like the guide should do a better job with earlier pick-ups to arrange seating better knowing he had our group towards the end of his pick up.  Other than that, Adam was a good tour guide and gave us good advice for the park.  The breakfast box was surprisingly good, i just couldn't enjoy eating it. We were glad we followed Adam's advice to have lunch at  last stop because it had the best views. I liked that they provided unlimited water bottles since it was so hot.  I felt like we had enough time in the park, but wished it was shorter as we had anxiety watching our kids and other families get so close the the edge!  I can't believe there are no railings and that people don't fall over!  I wonder why they have to charge so much for the Skywalk.  It's a neat experience, just not sure it's worth the extra money.  My sister said the bathroom on the bus was pretty creepy and nothing to clean your hands with! The video monitors were annoying because they kept going on and off so it was hard to enjoy the video on the way back.  The bus was uncomfortably warm too.  I'd probably give another tour company a try for our next tour. 3
Sat outdoors - the back patio makes you feel like you're not even in Vegas anymore, it's some sort of narnia type situation.Got the buffalo chicken wings and one of their mules (the twigs and berries: think gin & elderflower liquor as the basis for a refreshingly lime ginger fuzz thing), and both were great. The people in the back of the house clearly know what they're doing. The front of the house, however, was weak. Our waitress was slow, and irritable, and I don't think it's an isolated bad apple. This is actually the second time we've been here, the first time we cancelled our order ASAP and left after it took someone 25 minutes to come over to our table and acknowledge our existence. 4
Been to Six Pence a couple of times now and have been satisfied every time.Food is good and reliable.  Fish and chips and burgers both memorable.  French onion soup was also very good.Drinks were average although there is a decent beer selection.Has both a porch and a rooftop patio for nice weather dining.Located in the heart of Baxter Village so parking is a bit of a pain - but there is a lot at the back of the building and a side door entrance.They occasionally run coupon specials in the local papers too.Good, reliable, unpretentious food - and great service too.  Knocked a star off for parking and one for the mixed drinks. 3
I have been going to Shagg for nine years. After searching high and low for someone I could trust with my hair, I found Justin. He has encouraged me to take some risks and always gets it right, giving me styles that work with my face. They always remember me by name - which is the height of great service. Looking forward to another great nine years! 5
Nice place, out of the way, this bar seems to clear out pretty early, large selection of drinks. I noticed in the local press that the owner was trying to get some outside seating arranged which the city was blocking due to code issues. However that seems to have been resolved since the last few times I've been past there's been people out in the parking lot sitting at tables. 4
The most expensive meal on the dinner menu is $20 but we were encouraged to try the 'special' filet. No mention of price by our waitress. Then the bill arrived with the bad news: $36 for the filet. Really took the wind out of our sails on an otherwise great night. Buyer beware! 2
Really liked this place.  Eclectic menu, with choices for everyone.  Mini donuts were awesome...coated with sugar, but the dough was not too sweet.  Reminiscent of a beignet.  Staff is super friendly!Only complaint...  No stouts except Guiness... 5
when i first walked into the place i was a little taken back.  being a local of Las Vegas, this was  not like every other nightclub.  it had a dark feel but in a good way,  live entertainment every so often, and characters walking around mingling with the crowd.  reminded me of a rave style place but after being there a little while it turned out to be a great place.  the music was great and although not that big of a place they did not jam pack the place like most clubs in this town where everyone is touching your shoulders unless you buy bottle service.  the only complaint was the drink prices, but other than that i would def. go back and had a great time. 4
I have been shopping last chance for years! I'm so tired of the prices raises. It's disgusting. I can shop the rack and get new stuff for almost the same price as the used garbage. I got pushed out by some blonde that speaks a foreign language.  They tell you not to stand and wait while they restock...unless the security guards think your good looking or you schmooze them then it's fine. 1
This place has changed the staff and doctors are rude.  I'm here to get two teeth pulled out and I get an X-ray now I have to sit and wait in the lobby and my teeth are killing me!!!  What happened to the nice crew of people and doctors. I was never scared of dentist till now...  But the doctor and nurses was amazing they are working on my mouth from now on!!! I gave three stars cause of the doctor and nurse 3
Great price, large selections, unbeatable helpful staff. The store is always clean and well staffed.  Check out is a breeze, you pack your own bags so it is the way you want it .  They have scooters if you need them baby seat carts and handicap carts for bigger children not very many stores have them. 5
Overall not so great of an experience at this horrible so called "Salon" as soon as I walked in there the man that works there does not leave you alone he tries to upsell everything! Completley desperate for sales and wont leave you alone until he is convinced you are purchasing something extremely annoying. Anyways aside from that I did want to get a color done so this stylist named becky did my hair she took 4 hours just for some simple highlites and a hair cut. I was pleased with my hair. But I was not pleased with her "proffesionalism" as she had none of that. She smelled like cigarretes and even went for a smoke break inbetween doing my hair and on top of that she was even arguing with her colleagues in front of me using profanity. I don't get what kind of salon the owner is operating. 1
Great doughnuts, great service, great location.  Glaze is small, simple and friendly. They have specialty doughnuts that curb your sweet tooth, and simple doughnuts and pastries.  They always give great service to me and my daughter when we come in.  Thanks for being in our neighborhood! 5
Tasteless... very unfortunate, great location but isn't worth buying.. salads has no dressing on.. chicken salad is only consistent if chicken and mayo no salt or pepper at least... I had chicken pita, the dressing on it was so blend that it didn't even taser like it had anything on it ...Hope they improve but knowing that is a chain restaurant and everything is premise and orders in .. not likely.. 1
I visited this location. His name is Eric. I tried to use my starbucks card for scan. He said that they don't accept that but i saw some kind of machine and i asked that what is this use for. He just ignored our question. I tried to ask one more time but he ignored and he just told to next customer. I had unpleasant memories. 1
I went to there for wedding anniversary. The server served gently and was nice to suggests sides for the main dish. however, potato cream soups for appetizers were cold and guessed they forgot to warm them up. Called server and they replaced with hot ones.I ordered steak with lobster, but the lobster size was tiger shrimp size very disappointed.Other things were fine. 2
wouldnt you agree that a key part of enjoying the dining experience in part depends upon the company you are dining with?!  having said that, the times i have dined at abuelos have been with my fellow co-workers, all female, and yes, we all get along!  needless to say, we had totally fun & memorable experiences, filled with great conversations, great food and good prices.  their corn chips are fresh and lite, their salsa comes in different levels of heat.  i usually request the hot salsa.  i'm partial to their chicken enchilada.  portions are just right, one is plenty for me, usually served with rice.  in all fairness, believe i need to sample other dishes, before i could rate it any higher.  found another great restaurant in chandler, az!  top3 reasons why...1- great tasting dish 2- good value  3- atmosphere (location, service, ambience) 4
Every time I have been to a church social, mainly for dinners that were put together for the catechists (religious education teacher for those of you who don't know) this was the catering service used. I cannot begin to describe the food to you. It is so good (not as good as a nice home cooked meal) but it sure comes close.The eggplant Parmesan is to die for. I had it for the first time about a week and a half ago. I never had eggplant so I was not sure what to expect.  More recently though I was privileged to eat there food again on Friday when I went to the Ordination of the Diaconate at the cathedral. The reception was afterward and they had food that represented the large majority of cultures which I though was good. 5
Typical Panda Express as far as the consistency of the food, but they can be VERY skimpy on the portions.....watch them closely!!First time I went there, I got probably 4 pieces of Bejing beef and 5 pieces of Orange chicken.....by the time I drove the 3 miles home and saw that, I was not going to return and complain, so I went online and filled out the survey to get a free entree next time.On my next visit, with the coupon in hand, they tried to skimp on the portions again......I told them that if they did not put more in the container, I was going to walk out and never return to this location again. They looked at me angrily, but put more in the container.I told them they will NEVER get away with skimping on my portions again... Only to be told " thank you, come again" 2
Was really looking forward to making the trek to Ital Vital after the glorious write up in the Toronto Star. Sadly I was a bit disappointed. Food was alright, although I felt most of the vegetables were under seasoned while the BBQ soy was super sweet. It was the service, or lack thereof, that surprised me. I felt like my presence was a nuisance as the man who filled my order didn't look at me once and barely spoke. Just nods and one word answers. Overall, super unfriendly and because of that I won't be making the trip to nowheres-ville again. 2
I was very disappointed when I came in to sell a couple of movies. I went in and the guy told me that it would be a couple of minutes and they would call me once they were ready. After 30 minutes of waiting, I went up and asked how much longer, he gave my an attitude and said he was about to get to them. Overall probably waited about an hour and a half  just to trade in a couple of movies. Went to buy backs on sunset the other day and I was helped as soon as I came in. Probably never go back after this experience. 2
Bachelorette party of 12 girls. I called to make reservations and they informed me on the phone that with a large party of our size, we would need to do a set menu. They said that the waiter would work with us on the day of to put together a menu to work around any restrictions we had. We were running a little late (you can imagine how that can happen with1 2 girls) so I called to let them know and they were very nice and accommodating. They said not to worry and that they would hold our table for us. We arrived at the restaurant and were seated at a big table in the back of the restaurant (the restaurant is pretty big). The table itself was huge and we had plenty of space between the 12 of us.So, between the group of 12, we had the following restrictions: one pregnancy, allergies to peanuts, shrimp, and shellfish. The waiter asked us what amount we wanted to keep it to and we told him to keep it around $50/person. We ended up with the following:+Otsumami assortment of edamame, green bean tempura, shishito - all delicious. The dipping sauce had truffle in it... who doesn't love truffles??+Berkshire Pork Gyoza - pretty good gyoza. Wasn't a big fan of the pumpkin dipping sauce..+Yellowtail Taquitos - delicious! +Sea Bass Anticucho and Chicken Anticucho - the sea bass was amazing (as everyone else has already mentioned). It is so buttery and melts in your mouth.+A ton of sushi rolls and some sashimi - pretty good... I would say their strength is in more of their cooked food than their sushi and sashimi. I always prefer sashimi over rolls because the rolls are usually too fusiony for me but the other girls loved them+Rio Grande Churrasco - 5 diff meats with 3 diff dipping sauces. Very good but so full that we couldn't eat muchService was great. We informed our waiter that we needed to be out the door by 9:30 PM and he made sure that the food just kept coming. By the end of dinner, we were so stuffed that we couldn't even eat all of the churrasco and had no space for dessert. We even came under budget by a little bit and were all way overly stuffed. Food was pretty good... but more than anything, it's a fun atmosphere that's good for groups. Would definitely go back with a large party. 4
There food is decent but tonight I tried the spare ribs they were like shoe leather. Extremely tough 3
You always know you've had a good night when you wake next to a crumpled up Jin's sandwich wrapper.  Jin's popularity is undeniable, and for good reason.  Two options, chicken or fish, have sustained Jin's for years, but recently, a second location has opened up.  The original Jin's cart still stands firm in Library Mall providing nourishment for the weary masses, but a flashier version has opened up on Gorham just off of State Street.  The new cart is called JD's, but don't be alarmed, you can still order chicken or fish.  In addition, JD's sells Polish sausages and Chicago Dogs.  For some, the options can seem overwhelming, but if you're lucky enough to have any cash left in your wallet at the end of a night, whichever meal you choose will be more satisfying than anything else you can find downtown late night. 5
Good food, horrible service both both the hostesses and waitresses. 2
Love this place for breakfast!  Courteous staff, great food.  Our entire family enjoys eating here. 5
Waitress we had was rudeeeeeeeee! She was rude when we got in, rude when we ordered, rude when she brought our food, rude when we told her she forgot one of our sides and rude when we asked for the bill.I went with a small group.  Food was just okay. It's pretty hard to screw up breakfast, but it happened. One person in my group ordered a sandwich. Disappointed - thoroughly. Bits of small chicken pieces which fell out every time they a bite of the sandwich.  Barely toasted bread, which was also soggy from the chicken that was probably sitting in the sandwich and waiting for the slow waitress to pick it up. Pancakes were forgotten by the waitress. When they came they were not hot, not surprisingly.  Home fries were soggy. Won't be coming back again. 1
I went here for lunch with my family, and I have to say this is the worse ayce sushi I have been to and I will never return here. First of all the server knocked over our tea and did not even apologize. Second of all the food here is not even hot it was served lukewarm. Last but not least the sushi rolls and hand rolls were served almost frozen. Worst experience ever. 1
Always consistent and quick Chinese food. Great for our date night in! Steamed dumplings and the crab Rangoon are definitely musts on the appetizer menu! 4
I went here last weekend to meet up with some old college buddies for drinks. I had a hard time finding the place since there is almost no signage and the windows are boarded up. I couldn't help but keep thinking of the episode of Always Sunny when they go to the gin bar! Haha this place is just like that! I just move to Pittsburgh from Los Angeles and found this place to be way over prices for Pittsburgh. The prices were the same as in Hollywood! With all that being said, I had a great time. The service was very good and they had a good selection of whiskey and bourbon. The place also draws a much better crowd of people than any of the surrounding bars. I will come back but I will think twice about ordering that last extra $20 glass. 4
Family owned restaurant, we got our food very quickly. Food is very simple with not much flavor. 3
I have been to five PJ's in the valley and have to say this is the worst one. I love PJ and the food is great but this location has the worst service. Every time we go we have some issue whether it's getting our order wrong, not returning to refill drinks or something as simple as making sure we had silverware. This one needs to step up the training! 3
Yummy pub-style food. Beer flights so that you can sample their many wares. The place is enormous. It would be a little hard to hear if you're trying to have a serious conversation, but otherwise, it's a crowd-pleaser. 4
This place is amazing! All their staff is extremely friendly and knowledgeable! My husband and I went to look at smokers and we ended up taking one home thanks to Maxine! If you have any questions or interest at all in outdoor cooking shes the one to see! I was so impressed! The cafe upstairs is also delicious! Customer for life! 5
Best burgers anywhere near Charlotte!  Been coming here for years since my days teaching at Stanly Community College.  I would stop for lunch on my way home to Charlotte.  14 years later, I am bringing my kids here.  They have really made it bright and cheery and still kept the food quality the same.  There is just really not much to compare to it.  Great food, shakes, ice cream, you name it.  If you read my other reviews, you will see I can get quite picky.  I don't have a thing to complain about here.  it's an easy ride from Charlotte and well worth it! 5
Brand new State of the art shooting facility for both pistol and rifle! Staff at the counter was extremely welcoming and extremely knowledgeable! The Range Safety Office (RSO) was great, very helpful with shooting tips and also policed all of my brass. The Retail store is great, with a large inventory of firearms and every accessory you could possibly need.The Best place in Charlotte to shoot!! 5
Eggs were good. Generously portioned. The service was good. Would definitely recommend for breakfast/brunch! 4
I am writing this because at this point I have now been without proper AC for over a month and the leasing office is doing nothing to fix the situation. Looking back to when I originally moved in(that is another incident I will share further in this letter) the AC has never properly worked, which I mentioned on my apartment move in checklist. I first thought "oh cheap apartments, they just have bad AC" being the self-sufficient woman I am, I shopped around and bought myself a portable AC unit on June 23rd,2016 ($300 on Groupon). As the temperatures rose throughout the valley so did the temperature in my apartment. It caped out at 85 degrees inside at 11:30pm(I have documentation) and now maintains a consistent 80ish degrees in my apartment(again I have documentation). It is now to the point I am not sweating when lying in bed with a fan directly on me, yet I am not able to walk from my bed to the bathroom without breaking a sweat. I first contacted the apartment leasing office in regards to my AC outage July 6th, 2016 and spoke with Olga. I wish I could tell you her last name, but she has repeatedly refused to give it to me. In fact she refused to give me any number to call other then the leasing office like as if there is no one above her and the people who work in the office. I found that very unprofessional and odd which happens to correlate directly with her attitude and behavior since day one of my moving into Bella Norte Apartments. Two weeks passed from July 6th, 2016 and unfortunately due to my work schedule while the leasing office is open I am not available. In those 2 wks alone I left 2 additional messages on the emergency line referencing my AC outage and still heard nothing. Fuming, sleep deprived and heat exhausted I went into the office only to hear there was no record taken of my calls and no work orders put in this was on Saturday July 23rd. I was livid and still am. I have now left a total of 6 EMERGENCY AC OUTAGE MESSAGES on their EMERGENCY line with no assistance! Bella Norte leasing staff have absolutely no regard for tenant rights (33-1364. Wrongful failure to supply heat, air conditioning, cooling, water, hot water or essential services). Jessica Garcia was on staff when I went in the next day, she listened to my complains nodding her head saying they would have someone come look at my AC unit. She gave no regard to the fact that I had mentioned this several times which was even more upsetting to me. Bella Norte has a complete disregard for the safety, health and wellbeing of their tenants. Jessica sent a maintenance man(not an HVAC Certified Tech) to my apartment to "look" at the AC unit. The maintenance man then told Jessica I had my unit turned off. I went to ask him what he did because it was most definitely on and he wouldn't answer me in fact he walked away from me. I had to run after him and stop him for him to say all he did was turn the knob on the wall. I came back into the office and explained that it was absolutely turned on. By this time I was even more angry I was dropping the F word and demanded to make a formal complaint about Olga and the incident. Jessica gave me a piece of white copy paper and said I could go outside and make my complaint, and that whatever Olga has done is not her and that I should not take it out on her. Jessica then laughed and said "you don't know how to turn on an AC, you stupid" I called her  B word and left. This entire situation should have never happened. I should have been able to call and tell my apartments my AC isn't working and there should be an HVAC Certified Tech at my house same day or next day. Why this has been such an episode is beyond me. My apartment is still not cool. Before I came to work today I stopped by to check my thermometer and it read 79 degrees at 1pm. That is crazy!! I have been staying at my boyfriend's house and even got a hotel that I used Monday night to get some proper AC and just relax from this whole situation that cost me $120.00.When I originally moved in I came with paperwork Olga gave me stating I moved in on one date and when I arrived with my UHAUL and movers Jessica informed me my apartment wasn't ready for another 4 days. I showed her the paper I had telling me my move in day was that day. She then told me it would be a few hours as I sat there with my movers. Absolutely unprofessional no apologies just rash rudeness. Absolute disregard for your tenants. I moved into these apartments from a place I was paying $850 plus utilities and at this point it has cost me more to live here then to have stayed in my comfortable COLD AC apartment in a safe neighborhood Tatum and Bell. I also paid a $400 NON refundable deposit; have you ever heard of a non refundable deposit? This is absurd. 1
Came here for brunch/lunch this Sunday; I wasn't overly hungry, but luckily everything was made a la carte, and priced fairly! I shared the chorizo meat balls with my friend (it came with 6 and a pile of shredded beets), the sauce was sweet and savory with leafy bites of cilantro. I often find anything with chorizo to be too salty, but it was just right, especially with the sweet sauce pairing. They have the healthy option to get lettuce wraps instead of corn or flour tortillas, and seeing as there was an abundant amount of free chips and salsa, I didn't miss having a tortilla-the lettuce was perfect! The free salsa and chips also came with three smaller and unique tasting salsas/sauces that varied in flavor and spiciness-it was awesome to have variety. To top of the great food and service, the atmosphere was amazing. I loved the high ceilings and stained glass, a huge rustic chandelier and beautiful well kept bathrooms. I will definitely be back! 5
I'm starting off the new year with my first official review of a Korean restaurant which fittingly is Ka Chi's newest location (they have 3 now).  Several years ago, I went to a Korean restaurant with a group of friends somewhere on Bloor St W. near Christie Pits (the name and exact location escapes me).  That was close to 10 years ago and no one really knew what to order so our experience was slightly disappointing and I didn't go back again thinking Koreans only ate spicy cabbage (known as kimchi but spelling can be kimchee or gimchi but what the heck, just say it and everyone knows what it is).  Tip of the day: if you want a better first time eating experience when dining at a new food place that has a foreign menu, bring someone who knows what to order :) A few years ago, my friend who is non-Asian (Ok he's white as snow and I'm just trying to be politically correct - screw it) moved and lived in Korea for 3 years.  Upon returning, we met up and he took me to Ka Chi on Bloor St.  It was my introduction to the bibimbap dish and it was yummy.  Since that positive experience, I tend to order the hot stone pot bibimbap dish every time we eat at a Korean restaurant.  The Ka Chi on Bloor was my first experience at their restaurant.  The dish was excellent as I chose the thinly sliced beef (chicken, pork and vegan were also available), comes in a very hot stone pot with rice plus veggies, then topped off with an egg and reasonably priced (I recall being $8-9).  The service was mediocre but my friend did mention not to expect top notch service but i would give them 4 stars overall at that time (haven't been back so perhaps their ratings have changed?).  Place was quite busy considering it was a Saturday at 3pm in the afternoon but a bit far from my normal stomping grounds so I haven't been back since.Later in the winter, we heard they had opened a new location closer to me in Chinatown/Kensington on St. Andrew St.  I took my friends there and introduced them to bibimbap.  My second experience was a tad disappointing as they didn't even fill the stone pot half way with food.  I seem to recall my initial experience being better.  Service was again average so my rating drops a notch to 3 stars.  I have since found several places which offers better quality, value and service so I've been avoiding Ka Chi ever since.A couple of days ago my friend wanted to go and told me they opened another new location in Chinatown a few months ago on Dundas St. W. (I think it used to be a Japanese restaurant called Shima).  I mentioned that I preferred other places but he said their pork bone soup was great so we went to try it out.  I wasn't in the mood for soup so I opted for the bibimbap... I should have gone for the soup.  The bibimbap was again not very good value with only half a bowl but it was ok tasting.  Next time I'll definitely try the soup.  Not sure why they got 2 locations in Chinatown cos I didn't know we Chinese folk liked Korean food so much?? If I had to choose between Chinese or Korean restaurant, I would select Chinese as there is a much wider selection of dishes on a typical menu.  Overall, another 3 star rating again for service, food and decor is nothing fancy. 3
Not my favorite buffet yet. But it is up there. They have everything you would want. The only meat that was disappointing to me was the cut of prime rib. It wasn't tender enough for my liking. Also, the seafood wasn't amazing, although I did like the ahi and salmon poke. The rack of lamb is something I would recommend. 3
Romana Barbershop will always have you walking out of the shop looking and feeling great. Larry is detailed and takes pride in every cut.Go check them out, you will thank me later Look for the red, white and blue Barber flag. 5
I have a complaint of being overcharged.  The product is  mediocre, the older woman ringing my order up, insisted on charging me individually for each cupcake, when I had a 6 pk. and a 4 pk. of cupcakes which costs $32.50.  10 single cupcakes were $36.50.  I even put a nice tip in the jar before she started ringing.  Made me sorry that she felt she just had to swindle an extra $4.00 out of me.  I left because it was busy, but, it's bothering me.  Seems there's a buy 5 get 1 free deal.  I wasn't given that, either.  Just ripped off in more ways than one.  Will never be back and hope to save you from an unpleasant experience. 2
Cute hotel, nice food court and shopping plaza. 4
I'd heard good reviews, so I stopped in last time I was downtown, but I'm not impressed by their coffee. Dark roasted, bitter, etc. If I'm looking for coffee downtown, I'd go find that 21st St. Coffee branch instead. Still, they sell a bunch of other neat snacks and stuff, and it beats a chain. 2
This place started off good but the portions have gotten smaller and smaller. That would explain why I have never seen more than 2 people in the place. For what they charge I would recommend jaburritos on rainbow... kinda sad because it could be amazing but the portions control is so strict a large bowl does not fill my 8 year old...  one slice of avocado on my bowl tonight... seriously???? I will not be back....Also... if you do not care about customer comments and you just want to say how great you are,  then keep buying your 5 star yelps with free meals... to have you argue back how great your portions etc are is just proof of how oblivious you are... your response to me is ridiculous... 1
Love the cheap flights, plane was clean and attendants was really nice.Everyone complains about additional charges but if you read the fine prints and understand their policy, then you'll have absolutely no problem. 5
I ordered a coffee through the drive-through. I asked for an iced coffee with a lot of milk. I mentioned that I like my coffee sweet. I pulled up to the window and the girl was completely annoyed with me. She asked me several times what it was that I wanted. I explained again that I wanted a lot of milk and she said something about putting more water in the coffee to dilute it and that next time I should ask for more water. Then she handed me a bitter cup of coffee. I had to throw it out. Unfortunately, it's not my first time throwing away coffee from here. Why 2 stars? Because I've had some okay experiences here, but too many misses for a 3 star review. 2
I can't believe I haven't yet reviewed this place!  It's the most convenient Chinese to my house and we'll stop every couple of months.Food is acceptable but there's nothing memorable to rate it as great.  Our household usually gets a chicken dish, a beef dish and a seafood dish.  Everything we've ordered has been pleasantly good.  Dad raves about the hot and sour soup.Service is ok.  There is no separate area in which to wait for a take out order, you have to wait in a dining room booth near the front door.  Tonight, that was a pretty chilly spot to sit!Pricing seems high so this brings down the value ratio (OK food, high prices = lower value).  Portion sizes are good so at least we get a couple of meals out of each order.If I have a choice, I go up Park Road to Shanghai.  But if I want convenience, it's Amazing Wok. 2
Stay away from this pharmacy!  I have had two prescriptions completely bungled by this pharmacy. They gave us medication that was not what was written on the prescription on two different occasions.  I also had a pharmacist tell me my insurance would not cover a prescription.  Once I told her i have not had any trouble with it for 10+ years already, and I didn't understand why she couldn't fill it.  I was asked to come back later. This was already my 3rd visit to get this rx right.  So I got a little perturbed, and suddenly, she magically figured out how to do it.  These people have no clue how to run a pharmacy. 1
No Longer a Pho Restaurant anymore even though they kept the name. Doh!  Went there after about 6 months and was very disappointed that the restaurant is now under new owners or possibly their Pho chef left.  Bottom line, PHO IS OFF THE MENU!!  The menu is now Hong Kong style breakfast, rice, noodle, with some other dishes and was rather disappointed too that the food is only so-so in flavour.  Price was reasonable compared to other places but not to Congee Queen standards.  If they kept the Pho AND added the new menu that would have been better.  Message to the Chef.  Learn to MAKE Pho!  Sorry not going back again 2
I had a mixed experience with this company. I am currently 29 weeks pregnant.  We hired them to pack and move me out of a 3-bedroom rental into our new place. In part, I blame myself for contracting with the on nothing more than an email quoting an hourly rate for packing and the move. If they quote you an hourly rate, I _highly_ recommend getting them to commit to a maximum time-frame for your project and have them provide a price list for any packing materials to be used.The two men I had for the packing were courteous and relatively efficient. I was shocked, however, at what we ended up being charged for boxes and packing material. Especially, when asked, they could not provide us any sort of itemization for what was used. The next day for the move, we had one of the same people and a new person who seemed to be about 20 with very little experience moving. Again, they were courteous and very careful in the handling of our furniture. But they were the slowest movers I've ever used. It took just short of eight hours for them to move a three-bedroom house. There was a great deal of chatting between the two movers and hanging out in the truck. The "greener" of the two movers also frequently hovered around seeming uncertain of what needed to be done next.  I was literally standing over them in the 110 degree heat by the end of it trying to get them to finish. It then took them close to another hour to get hold of the main office and try to figure out the paperwork. We had planned to also use this company for my partner's move in two weeks but, based on our experience, we will be using another company. 2
My friends graduation gathering turned into a terrible experience because of the server and manager's lack of respect and customer service. 2
Love this place! Nice to have something other than pizza or chinese delivered. The owner actually went out and bought caramel they didn't even have on the menu to accomadate my love for hot pretzels with caramel sauce! Thank you to the owner and staff. They're hot chicken, 5
Kind of disappointed this time.  My 3rd visit and it's nothing like my first experience, even my second...not getting better.  Southern food?...I don't think so.  Biscuits should be fluffy, not dense...these biscuits are so thick and heavy....Please lighten them up.  Green beans were described as basil and butter on the menu...I tasted NO basil whatsoever...they were way too al dente, very very bland...can someone please add some SALT to these dishes.  The fried tomatoes were the worse I've ever had...way too under-ripe...very hard and lacked seasoning.The service needs some improving...the wait for an appetizer is way too long.  The cocktail lacked alcohol.  Probably my last visit. 2
Located on the 64th floor of Mandalay Bay Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip where the view of the city is breathtaking.  I celebrated my 25th birthday here and we'll be celebrating my friend's 25th birthday here tonight! I love this place ~ ambiance is techie yet comfortable. 4
I've been going to Maura for a few years now and find her very professional, convenient and love the online booking. Maura listens to concerns and will work with her client's to get the most out of your massage. Will continue to schedule with Maura in future! 5
I hate to give a bad review of my favorite brunch spot ever, but I had such a bad experience last time I went in. The place was dead and we waited 25 minutes for our food. There were two of us. The chorizo was burnt and the portion was about a 1/4 smaller than normal. When we said something to a food server, he said that we needed to specially request it not be overcooked at time of ordering. And we could replace the meal next time when we first try it. Apparently we had ate too much of it. Really? Ask them ahead of time not to burn it? I love this place but this guy needs to go. 3
It's a dive of the worse kind.  Problems start at the manager and work through to the food.  I get it's a dive, but when you have young kids in the place, the wait staff and manager should not be dropping the F-bomb in their normal conversations.  I won't be back. 1
Mad Hatter cupcakes are not good.  I have tried every cupcake bakery in Vegas and these rate at the bottom.  They use oil and poor quality ingredients and their cupcakes look very unrefined (almost unappetizing).  This would be a cute place for a cheesy kid's birthday party because you can customize your own cupcake (cake, filling, frosting, and topping).  Unfortunately their cakes are tasteless and the frosting is overly sweet.  These dont hold a candle to The Cupcakery, Sprinkles, or any other decent joint. 2
It was absolutely fantastic. My ONLY complaint was that portions were just a liiiitle on the smaller side..but I guess the great food you get makes up for it. If you're in Vegas, you HAVE to eat here. 4
i was lied to about an inspection price told me $130 then charged me $300 and lied to about getting them to fill out dmv inspection  after i spent over $650 in labor and over $500 in parts the reaon i wanted to get car fixed so i could get it signed off and registered. and one day George told me mechanic not coming in for family issues so my car sat and they didnt work on it. the work was done eventually. then i called back next day and george no longer works there 1
The food is delicious but the service is HORRIBLE. Completely Unorganized , they need to learn customer service ! Other than that it was delicious ! The carne Asada tacos are the best in my opinion ! The prices are a little up there but the tacos are huge ! 3
This is probably the worse dq there is! We literally ordered 2 cheeseburgers, 2 fries. Burgers weren't even warm, cheese wasn't melted or anything. Ok cool they gave us new ones that were hot. Then it tasted gross. Like dirty meat! Idk what is up with this place but I couldn't even finish my food. Reminded me why I don't eat fast food!! 1
I called ODS 7 hrs before I was leaving to the airport on Sunday from the Excalibur. I asked the lady about what time they should pick me up since my flight left at 1 pm, she said 9:30 am and I was the last one they had to pick up. I told her how about 10:30 because I thought, do you really need to pick me up 3 1/2 hrs before departure? She told me to be outside at 10:25 at Tower 2 at the Rear Rotunda. I walked to the Concierge and asked where Tower 2 was and she told me way on the other side down through the casino. I got outside right at 10:25 and I waited until about 10:38 then I  called ODS, I was informed that the shuttle was on it's way and should pick me up in the next 5 mins. I kept looking up the way to another part of the hotel where people were getting picked up by shuttles, taxis and limos and it just didn't seem right and I expressed that to the ODS on the phone. I waited another 5 mins because I didn't see a shuttle or anyone being picked up by anything like that at Tower 2, people were just picking up their family/friends in their own personal vehicles. I called again at 10:43 and the man with ODS said, "let me call your driver". He called and I heard him say," she is at Tower 2". He came back on the line with me and said the shuttle is on the property and he knows that you are at Tower 2. I got a call from the driver with ODS  at 11:53 saying, that he COULD NOT pick me up at Tower 2 and that I needed to go where they pick up everyone, but no directions whatsoever on where that was. I said, "ok don't leave", he said he wouldn't and that he would wait for me. So, I walked all the way through the casino clear to the other side of the hotel where taxis, shuttles and limos are. I waited and waited and I didn't see any shuttle saying 'ODS' and the shuttle #3306. The driver called me again asking where I was and I told him and he said, "no I'm outback". I said, "where in the hell is outback" and I told him, " you all need to get your sh** together and you can shove your service up your a**". He kept calling me, he had an accent and obviously didn't understand how to get or give directions. I got a taxi and from the Excalibur to the airport it was 11 mins., so I was there 1 1/2 hrs before my departure. ODS doesn't know time to and from a hotel to the airport and they have incompetent drivers and customer service representatives. 1
So so nail salon. The older lady did my nails she must have been preoccupied because she didn't apply a clear top coat to my full set. Also she is a bit to mouthy. There's to many nail salons in the area to have mediocre service. 3
Pretty good selection, nice community involvement, lacking a few things from other co-ops I've been a part of. Would love to have signage denoting how local is local (150 miles or less?) and a way to get some worms for composting. Parking is limited but the place is land-locked so I guess I'll just park along the street as many metropolitan grocery stores go. As for price, uhm... I feel like people ought to realize the real cost of food. To be local and sustainable, it requires more work, more care, and to be grown on land that is worth a lot when it could be housing or retail or large-scale farms. It gives you a way to get produce when farmer's markets aren't on the streets during the summer. The way the cookie crumbles. 4
I went to ChuChai with a vegan friend as it was highly recommended on Yelp. It really didn't disappoint!  I eat meat but love vegetables too and the dishes at ChuCai were delicious!!  We ordered pad thai, vegetarian green curry, and the "love bag" (deep fried little "bags" of vegetables). Everything tasted really good and authentic, especially the pad thai. I'm a noodle snob and I swear by it! It's not healthy to eat meat all the time anyway, so all you meat lovers who want to try a vegetarian restaurant, this is the place to go to! 5
Our server was awesome, but that's about it. I ordered the ELEVEN DOLLAR!!! "Studied Abroad" mixed drink (that came in a teeny tiny martini glass) and it was completely undrinkable. Our server took it back and recommended the "Little Sheba" and it was only slightly better, but at least it was a tall glass. It ended up sitting on the table 3/4 full when we left, and that's with 7 drinking ladies that tried it and wouldn't touch it again. The food was not as great as I hoped. It was not bad, by any means, but no one's food was fabulous and the prices were pretty high for how small the portions were. Also, don't go there on a Saturday evening if you intend to have conversation with your dinner companions because the acoustics in there are atrocious...we had to lip read. Sorry. I really wanted to like this place, but I won't be going back. 1
nice lil spot if you come with someone who like to dance to salsa..... not my favorite spot in the world .... I was not to fond of the way they speak to guest I know they deal with a lot of drunk ass people but you should still have a sense of good character... Tips: go to the bar and order yourself , waitresses are rude and take forever to get you served. 2
Disappointed in the service. First off, the table we had requested for our birthday party was not given to us because they decided we wouldn't like it and didn't ask us if it was okay, they just tried to sit us somewhere different. When we finally were seated in the correct area (next to the table we really wanted) we thought the night would go smoothly from there, it didn't. We've been here in both busy and non-busy times and always had a great experience. But this time because it was such bad service we only stayed for 1 round of food and drinks instead of our normal 3-4. When we mentioned it to the hostess in a discreet manor she just said "ok". Not sure we will come back next year. 2
Nope, won't stay here again. It's an old run down hotel that overcharges for everything. No coffee in the room 3$ for a styrofoam cup of foldgers, want more than your 2 complimentary waters? That will be 4$ for a 12 oz bottle. Wait staff seemed to be inconvenienced by my requests for these items. No one greats you or says thank you. Rooms are poorly kept, tv mount broken, dust bunnies covering the fire sprinkler, Ect.... it's creepy and dimly lit, and you can hear everything your neighbors are doing through the wall 1
On Saturday we went to the Reddstone (1261 W. 76 St.) for a quick lunch.  There's a lot to say about this place. The french fries come topped with delicious rosemary and taste like they're fried in duck fat.    The biggest item of conversation was the orange soup. It was a cold, creamy, spicy orange soup with onions and nuts. I didn't like it, but my foodie friend did.    The price was expensive but the food and service and atmosphere were well worth it. The service was only OK.     I have pictures of the soup, the burger and the lovely patio on my blog (http://whatsincleveland.blogspot.com/2011/06/reddstone-restaurant-cleveland-battery.html) as well as a link to their full menu. 3
Awesome. Had some board games for the kids. Awesome atmosphere.  Bone broth and Tomato bisque were both great 5
The food is very good. Will visit again when have enough time.Will try the steak that for 2 people, it needs one and half hour to cook, didn't have enough time last night.The only bad thing is that the table is too close near each other, i wanna sit not between two many people, because thats birthday dinner, but still, they don't have any available. 4
I went here as a respite provider to two small children who have autism. The kids mom had got a coupon for half off, so she figured she would try use it. We got there right about 10 minutes before they opened. I watched the employees go inside and turn on the lights. We stood there at the door for the ten minutes to go by. Watching the employees scramble around to turn on everything in ten minutes was a sight. When they finally opened up, we got right in and got in line for a ride. We were told that they have to do some things with the machine and it would take a few minutes. So we decided to go on the train. We stood there waiting for someone, ANYone to acknowledge us, but no one did. So we just took them to the playground they have inside. They were also doing work on that. The whole experience could have been a lot better. Unfortunately it's all due to their employees lack of interest. It's okay, but over-priced for what you ultimately get. 2
My husband and I visited the store while in Vegas celebratinging our ten year wedding annivesary.. We were just looking but ended up leaving with a fantastic ring. Cher and the creww were great. they took the stone from my ring and placed it in a new setting. It is Breathtaking. 5
Agree with some others RE: the service. It's spotty.Sometimes you go in and the guy behind the counter is your best friend, very complimentary (if sometimes a little too friendly with the ladies). Today however I went in for a little snack, the falafel appetizer. It came to $1.50 and I realized I had no change, took out my debit card and he says "No way, it's a $5 minimum", "I don't have any cash" I responded, to which he said "not my problem - get out". Nice to know he'd smothered them in tahini already for me - good luck reselling that.The food is decent, there is way better in the city. The falafel especially can be disappointing as they fry a bunch at a time and serve them up cold very often. The sandwiches do get pressed briefly to warm them up but it certainly takes away from the warm/crisp of a freshly fried falafel ball. Go elsewhere. Liberty Shawarma (Spadina or in Liberty Village) is the best. 2
You don't get much for your player card status at Mirage . Wi-Fi Internet access in the hotel room is terrible; which you are paying for with a resort fee. 2
I just left the salon and won't return.  I really don't put negative reviews on anything but feel I need to.  I have been here about four times for pedicures.  My first time I had Kim do my pedicure and she did a great job with a friendly attitude.  So when I saw her today I asked if she was free.  She kind of glared at me and walked away after pointing to the pedi chair for me to sit in.  I sat there for over 15 minutes waiting and she was no where to be seen.  Not one person acknowledge me or cared that I was just sitting there.  By the time Kim came over she did not even look at me once through my entire appointment.  I told her I wanted my toe nails square and cut short but to not cut the sides with the cuticle cutters. She proceeded to cut two toe nails out of the ten.  It had been about two months since my last pedi (I usually come every two weeks) so it was obvious my nails needed to be cut.  When I asked her to please cut them she kind of snarled and was so annoyed.  She hardly filed them and the scrub at end was pointless.  My nails are uneven and look horrible. She may have been having a bad day but a pedi is a treat for me and if she is grumpy she shouldn't have helped me.  I also sat in between two elderly women who were so friendly and kind and their techs were not friendly.  I won't return to this shop.  Too dirty and unprofessional. 1
I have to say, not bad. I'm kind of a picky burger guy but these were actually pretty good. The burgers were nice and juicy the fries were piping hot and the service was quick. I will be back! 4
Good BBQ is a layback space and generous drinks. The brisket is as tender as butter and baby back ribs have a great smoke.  Your choice of sauce and don't forget to try the gooey butter cake!   It is amazing - like pecan pie without the pecans and the pie is cake!!  It's a great trial of your sugar levels 5
If it were possible to award an eatery a negative value of stars, I would most certainly have given Border Grill a negative 10. I arrived in the company of four other people, in the late afternoon after going to the Aquarium exhibit. We were all very hungry, and excited to get some Mexican food. We're from Texas, and thought it would be interesting to see how a Top Chef's award-winning Mexican food would measure up to the stellar Tex-Mex food to which we are accustomed. Upon arrival, the hostess was cheery enough, if a bit of an airhead. After being seated, we waited a full five minutes before even being greeted by a server. Following a perfunctory greeting, we were brought chips and salsa (both lackluster and bland) and had to wait another 5 minutes for water. The waiter was nice enough, but seemed to be mostly unconcerned with giving us good service, or making a decent impression.The menu itself was rather pricey. If you're at a place that charges $ 4.50 for a fish taco a la carte (with a tortilla the size of a drink coaster and an even smaller filet of Mahi Mahi), you know you won't be able to leave the restaurant without paying upwards of $ 25.00 per person/ per dish. The food is billed as "Mexican", but there were no true Mexican dishes on the menu. Everything seemed to be more Central/ South American.Let me preface my actual food review by saying that we waited a grand total of 35 minutes for our food to arrive. I was to the point of trying to eat our waiter, who had already conveniently disappeared. I ordered the chile relleno burger, with paprika seasoned fries, and a fish taco a la carte. I asked for the burger rare, because 1) it cuts down on cooking time and I was ravenous, and 2) I simply cannot stand an overcooked, rubbery meat patty. The other members of my party ordered 1) crab nachos 2) beef nachos 3) avocado tacos 4) chicken caesar salad. 1) The crab nachos were adequate. For a self-proclaimed "grill" specializing in seafood, the meat was rather bland and tasteless, and were downplayed by the plethora of toppings heaped upon the actual chip.2)The beef nachos were already limp when they arrived at the table. The meat was wholly bland, and the kitchen chose to under-employ cheese, making the overall nacho rather boring.3) The avocado tacos were a great disappointment. As said by the consumer of the food, the idea of the avocado tacos was excellent, but the actual execution of the taco was underwhelming. 4) The chicken caesar salad was probably the worst thing served. You might be questioning how in the world a kitchen can mess up that which is essentially chopped greens and a simple meat fillet. Well, when your "caesar dressing" is the taste and consistency of mayonnaise, and is literally drenching the salad, you tend to look unfavorably upon the dish. 5) My chile relleno burger was probably the best thing served. The burger was cooked to my standard, and the chile relleno itself was decent, if a bit bland. The fries were the only really yummy thing served, and I'm not sure that's something a Mexican restaurant should be proud of. 6)The fish taco was terrible. The corn tortilla (while "homemade") was bland and too thick, and the filet of Mahi Mahi was too thick, overcooked, and bland. The guacamole tasted like something you could get at the grocery store, and was heavily salted. The overall really shocking thing to me was the lack of seasoning. The chefs behind the menu are award-winning and famed, but don't know how to use simple seasoning on their food to make it palatable. The bill wound up being over $ 150.00 (when the checkbook finally made it to the table), and we paid up, left a tip, and got the hell out of there. I wound up with gastrointestinal issues later on that night. If you're looking for good Mexican food, I highly suggest going elsewhere. To give you an idea of how deeply disappointing this food was, I would suggest going to Taco Bell instead. At least there, you're only paying $.99 for a taco, and the diarrhea is cheaper. 1
* Update* They handled my issue very well, remade that glasses and ensured they fit properly, all is well, left off one star for the hassle, but very pleased with the outcome and how they handled a bad situation. well done exam was great, doctor was great, staff was kind, but i am having am experiencing an issue so i will update this review once i see how they handle it. I have a very powerful prescription, and i require a lot of aid when selecting frames because as I'm trying on new pairs i cannot see a thing! well they helped me pick out a pair of frames but now that i have received the completed glasses i noticed the lab had to bend the frames badly to fit my lenses into the frames and now the lenses sit at a sever angle on may face which is giving me head aches and neck aches ( as i subconsciously pitch my head to put things in focus) they tried to bend them back into shape at the office but where unsuccessful and then they couldn't put them back together correctly so they had to rig the frames up with a large unsightly non-standard screw!!! so i paid hundreds of dollar out of pocket for a  warped, Jerry-rigged new pair of glasses.... no a good start for my first visit to this place...But to be fair they said they would call the Lab and see what they can do.........so here i am waiting to hear back from them... so if they resolve this adequately i will update this review... I'm posting this now because i have been wearing a high prescription all my life and every other eye doctor office I've visited took much more care in the initial selection process to ensure this type of thing didn't happen... additionally i had to point out the sever warp of the lenses in the frames to them because when i received them they didn't preform a proper fitting and adjustments, they just handed me glasses and had me put them on and shake my head?? i had to ask for the nose pads to be adjusted and the ear stems ( they were happy to assist but you usually don't have to ask for that sort of thing) typically the eye care professional will look at how the glasses sit on your face and make the proper adjustments without you having to ask.. Just seemed really odd, like they have only been trained in selling and not actually fitting, but for me glasses are not a luxury they are basically a prosthetic, i cannot function without them.... maybe I've just been really lucky for the last 38 years and had above average eye care professionals...  I just don't feel like i should have to live with a strapped together, warped pair of frames just because my prescription is powerful, I've never had to in the past why now?I guess time will tell, hopefully i can update this review with better news soon... 4
I would actually give 1 or 2 star at most for their ramen, however, I really want them to stay in business and I need good ramen in Toronto! Can they do better??I am from Kyushu, Japan (where Tonkotsu ramen is originally from) so I know my expectation for ramen is too high. Of course I am not expecting a perfect bowl of ramen in Toronto. I just want a decent one. I had the Kakuni Ramen (tonkotsu base soup) the other day at Raijin.Soup is too sweet and creamy (like milk!?) and not salty enough. Flavor is not just bland, but weird and watery, too, there is no depth to the taste. I hope they are not adding dairy like milk or soy milk in it!!!!! I don't want to sound mean, but it tasted like "hondashi (katsuo dashi) in creamy corn soup (no corn, but like the sweetness that comes from corn and milk)". This is not tonkotsu ramen soup, folks... and it does not taste good at all....The kakuni, noodles, and everything else was fine. More than decent. Love their decor. Please just make some changes to your soup! 3
Just walked in and try to have an eye exam and I've been told that they are booked for the next 3 days but walk ins welcome sign was at the door. This review is not about the doctor but the way they advertise! 1
Tried their ramen and sweet mushroom bao. Definitely not an authentic ramen. Sweet mushroom bao is way too sweet. Not my taste. 2
Nothing spectacular, but you get good value for your money here. The fish and chips were pretty good, but I was less impressed with the chicken. Soaked in sauce on the outside, but dry and kinda stringy inside. They've got a nice atmosphere for a quick and relatively cheap meal though, and I'd go back (for the fish). 3
For what this place is, it's amazing. The Banh Mi is better at other places, but the Baos, squid taco, grilled chicken papaya salad and the kimchi fries are unique items that set Banh Mi Boys apart. Try the secret menu "Club Bao" (with pork belly & fried chicken). Staff are always high energy and the vibe is good. (There seems to be a West Coast hip hop bias here though, I'm more of an East Coast guy but whatever) If you live or work in urban Toronto this is a place you should frequent often. 5
Wonderful fresh baked artisan breads, desserts, and sandwiches. The soups are constantly changing; unique and tasty. One slight bummer is only having two soups offered at once. 4
Needed a quick lunch in the area so I tried this place.  Really not impressed.  What I ordered was about as basic as you could get, BBQ pork egg foo yung on rice.  But there are way too many onions, and why would you put carrots into the egg?  All the flavours were wrong, the rice was soggy, there was very little BBQ pork, and the egg had too much salt in it. 2
We have come here for many years and they can be counted on for a good job. We have had a new stain show up on a shirt or two, but they have taken them back and cleaned it up. Prices are ok and they honor coupons 4
Worst service ever and all of our food was either cold or not what we ordered. Waited over a hour for our food as well. Our service was awful as well. Bathrooms were so disgusting and un-kept. I don't think I have one good thing to say about this place. 1
What a great dealership! Stopped by out of the blue because I was caught in a pickle between the RAM 1500 and Toyota Tundra...Grifan Fair, the sales guy who helped me out, was phenomenal and made my experience worthwhile...I think I am going to go with the Tundra because of that 10.5k towing capacity (compared to RAM 1500 8.5k). I would never have known that and other stats it if weren't for Grifan's exceptional knowledge. Great guy great dealership! 5
I love this place! Whenever I'm in the area I make it a point to stop by. My go to item is the Turkey Wrap. Another reviewer said that they didn't feel like there was enough turkey on it, but I think the portions are fine. The wrap is so flavorful. It's also perfect on a warm day because it is so cool and the apples make it very refreshing. The staff is also very friendly. My first time in, the owner was there and she made it a point to stop and chat with me which I thought was nice.I can't recommend this place enough. I've been telling all my friends about it. Go there. You won't be disappointed. 5
This is my very favorite Mexican food.  I've never been disappointed.  La Favorita is my favorite along with the cheese dip and sangria.  Even the chicken soup is amazing.  The service is excellent!  There's nowhere better in Pittsburgh for Mexican food! 5
I think they have the worst fries ever.. always soggy and taste like old grease.. always. The fryer isn't hot enough and they over load them probably 2
Me and a few of my girls went to Marquee last weekend and it took a few minutes to get in through the guestlist line. We had a blast! The only negatives we could say about the club was the Hip Hop room was closed and when we left we had to take the stairs... Overall we still had a great time 4
This is your typical average chinese restaurant.  Low quality ingredients creating ehh food, but it's not the worst chinese food.  If you're looking for a quick lunch place downtown, they get five stars.  But the Subway next door would be better. 2
I have been looking to install a putting green for the past couple of years and finally selected a company...I picked The Synthetic Grass Store for a couple of reasons,  they were extremely professional and followed up when I was shopped for quotes.  Mary is who came out and helped with design and measurements, she was friendly and a pleasure to work with,  she had a smile on her face every time we met or talked on the phone. It was installed on the day scheduled and at budget.  The installers were friendly and made sure everything was clean and put back into their proper place after the instillation. The owner called to make sure I was happy and to confirm the process was as advertised...I can tell you the same thing I told him that they met and exceeded all my expectations...a wonderful company to work with. 5
This was my first time eating at Kleifelds. It was recommended by family that lives in the area. I had the breakfast special (eggs over easy, home fries with green peppers and onions, and toast). The food was very good and given how busy it was (a packed house) the ONE waitress serving everyone did an excellent job. I would definitely recommend this to family and friends who want a great breakfast and an enjoyable experience. 4
I did my "sushi restaurant research" before we came here. I'm very happy with our choice of coming here and trying their food and service. My husband and I both got their lunch special combo boxes which came with yummy miso, yummy ginger lettuce salad, sushi rolls, shrimp/veggie tempura, calrose sticky rice, and salmon teriyaki (my choice)/ red snapper teriyaki (his choice). Mango mochi dairy-free ice cream for desert. Satisfied with food quality and service!! Ambience is casual. We will be returning! :) 4
Service was great, outdoor patio ist pretty nice. We had filet mignon which was great and worth 4 stars. Unfortunately my vegetable farcis was not good at all (overcooked, far too many onions and almost no quinoa) and really too expensive ($20) for the poor quality. I would really give 0 stars for the vegetable farcis. 2
The cashiers near the women's sport section were completely and utterly disrespectful and unprofessional tonight. Young girls wearing entirely way too much makeup, Kohls needs to enforce some kind of grooming standards. The two of them must've thought they were kickin it with their homies at school or something because they did not hesitate for a second to talk amongst themselves about how working there sucked and having to pass out the scratch offs to the incoming customers sucked even worse because they had to speak to the customers. Keep in mind all this is going on while both of the cashiers have customers standing at their respective counters. Unfortunately, the receipt doesn't give me the name of the incompetent child who checked me out. I would blast her name all over here. I asked one simple thing and that was for her to not fold up the items I bought with the hangers in them. Seemed like an easy enough request that doesn't require too much brain activity, but nope. Couldn't manage the slightest of tasks. 2
I had an emergency move and just happened to find Elysian while shopping at Wholefoods. From the moment I came in they were very helpful and accommodating. The clubhouse is really contemporary and yet comfortable. The gym is always available and complete enough that it convinced me to cancel my gym membership. The units themselves were clean and fully stocked and the models accurately represented. You'll find in your search that most of these places have the same amenities (tanning booth, rental bikes, game room, theater, massage room..)  but Elysian has free Sonos wireless music with built in speakers and a daily trash service that are very nice perks I know I'll use every day.     Above and beyond that, Elysian is different because it stresses community. The leasing staff hangs out and (some) live on site to have Movie nights and Wine Wedsdays. I've been here only a couple of weeks, but already have found that the people here are great to hang out with and for the most part young professionals like myself.  Alevia Houston helped me from day one and was patient and knowledgable as well as personable. I didn't at any time feel pressured to make a decision, and was particularly impressed that the leasing agents that didn't directly help me, we more than willing to assist me when Alevia wasn't around. I've lived in a lot of upscale apartments before and this has been my best experience. 4
Not having been to Las Vegas in 11 years, I was looking forward to my recent visit. While the Paris Hotel is perfectly located on the strip across the Bellagio, our rooms certainly had seen better times. The furniture were old-fashioned, worn and cheap. One light bulb was out in both of our rooms. Both rooms had several pencil top eraser-size holes in the walls that were patched up with silicone and push pins. And while one room had a very comfortable king-size mattress, the other room's mattress (also a king) was not only close to the floor, it was uneven and very bouncy resulting in one person being awoken whenever the other person turned around.  Upon complaining, a mattress topper was added that made it only a bit more comfortable. It would have been nice to have a view of the strip but since we didn't plan to spend much time in the room we were ok with the 12th floor back view.  But at a total of $360/room for 2 nights (Sunday & Monday) I expect somewhat better.Both bathrooms had non-matching lighting. The lights over the toilet were harsh fluorescent the ones over the vanity mismatched yellow and fluorescent. One of the 4 bulbs was out in one bathroom.  In the other room the entry light was out. The shower doors had caked on hard water built up at the bottom, indicating that they hadn't been thoroughly cleaned in a long time.The casino itself was uninviting, resembling a railroad station (Gare du Nord?), very noisy, kind of grayish and crammed. And though I did not necessarily expect cheap or good food, I do expect to get a decent cappuccino and croissant from the "French" bakery for $12. Neither was.The only ray of light was the new restaurant Hexx which was stylishly decorated, had reasonable prices, friendly service and decent food. Sitting on the outside terrace allowed for great people watching as well as seeing Bellagio's fountain show. Best of all, the noise level was well controlled, allowing for conversation without having to scream at one another. 2
We stopped in to try this restaurant based on the Yelp reviews and are we glad we did!  The food was delicious!!!  We ordered the fried chicken (crispy and delish) and the short ribs (falling apart & sooo tender).  For the sides:  fried okra, collard greens, cornbread stuffing, yams, red beans & rice, mac & cheese.  The portions were generous.  We ordered a peach cobbler to go and enjoyed it on the way back to LA.  I highly recommend this place...you have to try it! 5
We went to Toronto Ultrasound Imaging yesterday for an obstetric ultrasound, and we were disappointed. The tech had the screen turned so that I couldn't see the images, although at least my husband could see. I presumed he was going to show me at the end, but once everything was done he clicked past the screen with the image thumbnails. At that point he even said "Oh, I suppose you would like to see those" and I smiled because I thought he was going to show me, but no, he clicked away from that screen and told me to get dressed and leave!He had previously explained that we don't get printed images from this appointment since it's too early to have a really clear image of the baby. And I do understand that there's not a lot to see at an 8-week obstetric ultrasound. However, this was our first opportunity to see our first baby and we were very excited to see that little blob on the screen. We had also expected to see the heartbeat since my friends/family had that experience, and I even inquired about this prior to the scan, but the tech showed me nothing at all (not even stills). I would have really appreciated even 10 seconds to see the images on the screen. This pregnancy is a really big deal for us and we had been looking forward to the ultrasound appointment so this was a real let-down for me. At least my husband had a couple of photos on his phone that he could show me later. But overall I was very disappointed.On the upside, he did confirm my due date. So at least I have one piece of useful information from the appointment. Also, I did not experience the issues with confidentiality that some other have in the past - the receptionist was discreet.Having said that, we'll definitely be using a different service for our 20-week scan. I've been to the clinic at 123 Edward Street previously for other diagnostic imaging and they were good, so that's probably where I'll go next time. 2
I have never taken pho to go but Saigon did a fairly good job. With a friend, I shared the grilled pork dish and pho with sliced beef. The hostess was super nice. She saw the way my friend blanched when I said tendon and gently suggested to me that perhaps sliced beef would be the way to go. Around 10 minutes later, with a nicely packaged bag and a coconut boba tea, we were set to go. (The coconut boba tea tastes like canned coconut cream, so your own taste judgment if you like that or not.) I had a really fun time unpackaging everything. The broth in a container, the fixings (bean sprouts, basil, lime, jalapeno) in a baggie, noodles and meat in a carton. Super easy to assemble. Taste-wise, not too bad either when you have a pho craving. There was something missing though. The grilled pork was deliiiicious. Two big grilled pork chops juicing over rice with a big slice of quiche and veggies. Mmm. However, I must disclaimer this review by saying I was super super hungry and I've been craving Viet food, which I had not eaten in over 3 months. 3
Working at the office buildings along Tempe Town Lake, I usually walk down Mill Ave during lunch to find a bite to eat. Tried all the usual places: Loco Patron, Rula Bula, etc. Today, a few coworkers and I walked in Cabin, and were blown away. They did an amazing job with the remodel. Quickly greeted by my server Marissa. She was very sweet and helpful in showing us the lunch menus. We got the calamari as an appetizer, which I usually don't care for. Usually calamari is a little chewy, but this more tender to my liking. My Mediterranean wrap was awesome and very reasonably priced. The manager, Cody, came over to check on us. Overall great experience. Will definitely be back! 5
Worked with Mark Wyant from Bill's team and he made my house buying seamless and professional. It was during the holiday end of season and we were still able to get everything done. Thanks Mark and Bill! 5
This was a real fun time. Lots of laughs and entertainment. Love that the cast interactions with all guests in a semi intimate setting. Each course is delivered between scenes and you're given time to eat so you don't miss the show. Food was pretty decent as well. Like the salad dressing and love the sauce on the chicken. Bring cash for the bar and especially for the tip. Cast/staff work hard and deserve it :)4 stars since I'm bummed there were no mojitos. 4
I am not so sure about this place... don't get me wrong, it was fun. But like many things in Vegas, I think it was mostly glitz. The waiting room was very small, and my friends and I were standing quite a bit (the last thing you want to be doing during your spa day.) My massage hurt like hell, but I suppose it's my fault for not speaking up. The decor was nice, but I couldn't help but notice chunks of wall coverings and furntiure that were missing or broken. I have been to several other spas that, quality wise, blew this one out of the water. With that said, my friends loved the whole experience... I could have done without it and would have rather put my $150 on red. 3
Went last week and this place doesn't even sell sushi anymore!!!!!! how is it a sushi bar!!! 1
I get massages as body maintenance for a very active lifestyle. Kalologie is amazing! Therapist are fantastic and extremely knowledgeable. I have a membership here as refuse to go anywhere else. 5
Seems alright to me.  I stayed in the "manor" which is the motel in back of the main casino/hotel and i paid under $50/night for four nights that spanned a weekend.  It's not the top notch service, shopping, dining that some of the other casinos offer, but since I wasn't planning to patronize any of those anyway and didn't want to pay for them, the "manor" at Circus Circus was fine for me.Nonsmoking is available.  Not on their website or numerous other outlets.  You have to phone them and ask in order to book one. 4
I just came in for a package of beer because I work nearby. The lady kept arguing with me about weather or not I wanted to by it and how close save-a-lot was. I didn't want to walk there because I was at work, and it's a short trip over to Bunny's, but I also didn't feel the need to continue to explain why I wanted it. I ended up leaving without any beer at all. Bunny's used to be a semi-regular stop for me, and I probably won't be going back now. 1
This place has ruined all other burgers for me.  The Rossini has set a standard that no other burger can even come close to reaching.  My husband and I make sure to stop here every time we are in town and have yet to be dissapointed. 5
This hotel was extremely unwelcoming. From the get go, the staff member who checked us into our rooms this weekend were VERY unfriendly. I don't know why he was acting rude, but he was flat out ignoring questions I had and pretending he didn't hear us. It was very bizarre. Everywhere you go, staff is asking to see your room key or making sure your a guest, which at first I thought was great but after the 5th time it becomes extremely aggravating and makes me feel unwelcome as a guest. If I'm paying to stay at a hotel, I don't want to constantly have to prove that I'm a guest. Note to staff: Be friendly.On top of that, the hotel itself is cheap. It doesn't know what it wants to be, the decorations are comical and gaudy and there is no common theme. Why do the staff wear checkered coats? I would NOT recommend this hotel. I come to Vegas about 5 times a year for business and love most other hotels on the strip. This one was by far the worst. 1
The chili cheese fries tastes like dog food..shoulda went to Jack in the Box next door. Save your money, the chili cheese fries were crap..and the meat looks like something you find in dog food cans. 1
One of the best sushi restaurants I've dined at in a long time. Would recommend this place to others in a heart beat who are looking for good sushi and rolls! 5
This place makes you feel like your in the mountains but your actually in the desert! I came here for MLB spring training and there were still rooms available so it did not feel like the hotel was crowded. One of the hostesses, Kaelin, was very helpful and made our experience easy! 4
I've never been here but I've had a dream I was here. In this dream...I was new. I was young. But I was also dead. Always say I love you to those who are closest to you - or else you'll regret it.2 Stars. 2
We just went to this place tonight, got there and it was closed. An interesting gentleman was outside and asked us where we were headed and we answer "here! We'd like to have dinner..."He said it's been closed for almost 2 years now! We ended up just down the block and had an amazing dinner! Not sure how Yelp is still listing this... 1
I'm such a fan of this pub. Firstly, it's adorable. Nothing feels more like home than walking into a tiny little character house for a pint. I like that they serve relatively local brews. It's kind of a mixed crowd. I like it mostly when it's empty. You can sit on the deck upstairs - or play some pool. Very relaxed atmosphere. Also - the nachos are SUPER great. Add chicken on top of them and they are DELICIOUS. 4
I have been buying from this store for years.  They have always had a good selection and decent prices.  Best of all i always liked they they knew what they are talking about and can give me honest recommendations.  Recently the glass screen on my iphone cracked so i took to them and they were able to fix it for a fraction of the the cost of buying a new one.  Thanks Paul your are a life saver as always! 5
Veggie burgers suck. Decided to try something new today... I totally regret that decision.  We got two different ones and they are horrible not to mention they took 20 minutes to get out and there were only two other tables there.  I won't be visiting there again... EVER 1
4 of us decided to give The Oak Barrel a try after seeing a movie last Sunday afternoon.  The restaurant was decorated nicely and seemed warm & welcoming.  It wasn't very busy and we were seated right away. We were put in a dark corner under one of the many TVs, but it was turned down so it wasn't too distracting.Our server was pleasant enough (at first) but seemed overwhelmed by having to wait on us and the other 2 (or 3?) tables in her station. She couldn't seem to get it together. Getting our drinks seemed to be a challenge ("the bar is really busy") and the food took an extraordinarily long time. When it did arrive the salads and soups came out with the entrees. We sent the salads and soups back...we really wanted those as a first 'course'. The food was okay, but when one of our party took a bite of his pulled pork sandwich and pulled a piece of plastic wrap out of his mouth, we really had enough. We had to ask for waters (twice) and salad dressing for a salad that came out dry. The manager came out & apologized for the plastic wrap issue and took that meal off our bill & tried a halfhearted humorous approach (though it would have cost him A LOT more if someone would have choked on that bit of plastic).This is really a nice space, but the folks at Oak Barrel need to get it together. The servers and kitchen need some serious training on customer service and how to get meals to the table in the right order (and without the plastic "surprise" in the food). 1
Everything was great. The rolls had a perfect blend of savory and spice but were rich with toppings and texture. The spicy tuna with rock shrimp roll was something I'm going to be dreaming about for years to come. The truffle albacore roll with truffle oil drizzle was smokey and had a taste with a surprising amount of layers.Finally, the Blowfish giant ebi shooter had within it the biggest shrimp EVER! The soy paper wrapping was pink - so that was fun. Definitely a great place to go and worth the value. 5
I had my first bikini wax ever here (a brazillian). Even thought I was scared and nervous everyone here was very warm and professional about the whole experience. I found Aroma Wellness Clinic and Spa online after searching for cheaper hair removal places downtown. I saw they had certain discounts on tuesdays/wednesday as well as great reviews so I decided to give it a try. (They also advertised a numbing spray which other places didn't have.)I made my appointment via phone and my appointment started right on time. The receptionist was very nice and the whole place looked and smelled very clean. I was led to a room to get ready and the esthetician (Mary) came in for the waxing. I explained to her it was my first time and I asked for the numbing spray. She told me I had nothing to worry about and grabbed the spray but there was none left. I started to get really scared and she assured me that it would be quick and that she would teach me a few breathing techniques so it would hurt less. As she applied the wax it was the perfect temperature (very soothing) and she counted 1,2,3 before she ripped so I could exhale as she did it. It really didn't hurt that much at all. She also distracted me with small talk so it went by very quickly. She finished in about 6 minutes and I was really impressed with the outcome. I haven't come back just because I've found cheaper places for hair removal (their only downside), but Aroma Wellness Clinic and Spa is definitely an A+. 4
Very nice vape shop.. great selection of juice as well as their own line of Zen juice. Will definitely come again. 5
Pizza quality is just okay. There is something weird tasting about the thin crust, it taste almost store bought. Mozzarella sticks were microwaved and almost inedible. Whoever it was on the phone that took my order didn't really know what he was doing. The kid that delivered the pizza handed me the food and the receipt at the same time expecting me to sign the receipt with no hands... He forgot his pen... Had to go get one of my own pens. All in all... for one large pizza and mozzarella sticks for 40 bucks... naahhh. 2
I miss when these guys were 'Urban Planet' bc although there's still lots of great bargains on clothes, it's almost all women's stuff.  Check it out, ladies.  Some great sweaters & jeans for the guys as well.  A very friendly & on-the-floor staff here which is a nice change.  Prices are very reasonable which makes me wonder what ever happened to this chain. 3
My fiance and I came here in the summertime and we were definitely not disappointed. Everything we ordered was up to par with our expectations. They have a great selection of oysters, we probably ordered about 3 dozens oysters between the both of us! The Sicilian sea-bass is a must try, it was cooked just right and the fish was really fresh. 4
Saturday night at 7pmwe thought it was going to be packed with long line up, surprisingly it was half empty but got full quickly, so we were just lucky. there were only 2 of us, so we ordered:1. bone marrow - was good but not orgasmic as someone else described... the green sauce/side came with it was tasty. bone marrow is oily, which went well with the bread (btw, burnt bread) 2. spicy horse tartare - our favorite dish, at first sight, my bf said, "where is the horse", then we found them underneath the fried potato sticks. interesting flavours makes up for the lack of portion. btw, server was embarrased about serving horse meat when inquired regarding where is the meat from. she shouldn't be.3. tongue on brioche - we thought we need to hit another restaurant before going home, howerver the tongue was more than filling for both of us. the meat was the tender version of ham, reminds me nothing of tongue. it came almost like Montreal Smoked Meat sandwich. a bit on the salty side. the mustard seeds were overwhelming... don't put too much.4. gin blossom - grapefruit juice + gin, it was so fresh that i actually tasted some pulp... service - more than what we expected. the lady was friendly and quick on service. they don't wait for you to ask.it would definitely make a great place for group hangout, but try to come in even numbers to avoid embarassing sitting arrangment! 4
I'm really digging this tea shop. I'm not in the area as often as I'd like to be, but when I am, I usually stop in for a cup of tea. It's a tiny space, but houses a nice variety of in house made tea blends. I didn't think the selection was really that small, but I think it's a sign of quality. Kind of like a carefully selected wine list at a restaurant rather than I "here is every single wine we could buy ever" list.Service has been lovely.  The owner is consistently a nice, helpful person, and answers questions about tea and recommends things as needed.They've got a nice variety of in house made tea blends. But since I'm a creature of habit (at least with tea) I will probably just order an earl grey or a cacao tea probably forever. I like that the cacao is from Chocosol, and that the tea tastes like some kind of chocolate magic, while still being light.I'm going to have to look into some of their tea mixology classes! 4
Was doing some shopping at the Upper Canada Mall on a Sunday with the BF. Used yelp to find a place to eat nearby since we weren't familiar with the area. Made in Mexico was one of the first places that popped up in the search. It looked like it had decent reviews, so decide to give it a try.Got there around 6:30pm and the place was not even half full. We were seated right away at one of the (slightly unusual) high tables near the bar area and given 2 long large single sheet, double sided menus. One for drinks, one for food. The BF asked our waiter what he recommended, which were the burritos (he claimed it was massive) and the fish tacos. BF decided to take the waiter's recommendation and got the Chicken Burrito ($12.95), while I decided to get the Enchilada Lover's ($13.95). We waited about 15 mins, and just as the BF was starting to wonder if the food was taking a while to come out, like they read our minds our food showed up. Our waiter asked us if we wanted any hot sauce, we said yes, so he came back with 2 small containers of their homemade sauce, a Jalapenos and a Habanero. Both our dishes came with 2 sides, since there were 5 sides to choose from, we got 4 different ones (Lime and Cilantro Rice, Mexican Rice, Refried Beans, and Frijoles Charros) so we could try a bit of each. The Chicken Burrito was big, but not exactly massive because I've seen bigger. It was stuffed with chicken and onion, refried beans, and mexican rice, but I would say mostly rice. My Enchilada Lover's came filled with chicken and topped with 4 different sauces (Salsa Roja, Salsa Verde, Salsa Poblana, and Mole), one on each. We both found our dishes a little bland, especially the burrito, and relied a lot on the hot sauce to give it flavour. The Enchilada was slightly better, due to the salsas and mole on top. I liked the Mole and the Salsa Verde better than the other two. Of the sides, I liked the Frijoles Charros, which is a bean soup, the most. The Mexican Rice was more flavourful then the Lime and Cilantro Rice, but it had frozen veggies in it, which I'm not a fan of. The lime wedge that came with the Lime and Cilantro Rice was dry and barely any juice came out of it when I wanted to add more lime flavor to the rice.       Portion sizes were average for the cost. We both found the chicken bland, like it wasn't seasoned at all. Didn't try the other meats, so don't know if those are better. I found it slightly weird we were the only ones seated at the high tables instead of with the other diners in the more traditional dinning area, because the wait staff would come over to the tables beside us and eat and chat with each other which was slightly awkward. But it might have been a good thing we weren't seated with the other diners either. While we were there, the wait staff came out 4 times with music and sombreros, shaking what sounds like maracas, and shouting "chug", which would have got on my nerves very quickly. I think this might be a better drinks place than maybe a food place. The drinks menu was as big as the food menu. 3
Had 3 tacos el pastor, steak, and chicken. Very bland in taste when you add sauce, cheeses, vegetables etc. I was thinking this would be a classic Mexican taco with an American twist but it isn't. Its like a poorer version of chipotle. 3.25 per taco was pretty expensive as well. I mean, if I enjoyed the food I wouldn't mind the price but I didn't. Save your self the visit and go to Taco Mex or Chipotle. 1
I only ever come here for breakfast but it is my absolute favorite place when you're craving a big plate with eggs, bacon, potatoes and toast.  Nothing like a warm belly to start the day off right!  I'm not sure about sandwiches and the actual "deli" portion of their menu, but they do breakfast well.  Plus, the service staff is friendly and keeps the coffee coming regularly. 4
The scheduling experience is enough to turn me off. Sorry but if you have paying customers that want to give you their business, you don't place restrictions on when they can schedule. I've attempted to schedule with Beth twice now - both times I've been told that the times I'm requesting are for existing clientele only. Good luck getting more clients Beth! I'm taking my business elsewhere. Customer service is key ;) 1
Food: 4/5Service: 3.5/5Cleanliness: 3/5Price: 3.5/5Like I've said in one of my previous post, we love Chinese food. More specifically, we love enjoying Peking Duck once in awhile. The amount of food is enormous for the two of us to go through, so we have lots of food to take home. Nevertheless, the food and the experience is delicious and it will forever be one of our favourites!When you order Peking duck, you're prepared with thinly sliced onions, green onions and cucumbers. These vegetables accompany the peking duck that comes out later throughout the evening. We didn't order any appetizers such as soup because we knew that we had a huge feast coming.As our Peking duck was being prepared, we were also brought out crepes to eat with our meal. The crepes are for making your own wraps: add Peking duck, your choice of vegetables, some sauce if you prefer, and voila! Enjoy.What I liked about the restaurant was that they served the Peking duck on two separate plates. There's nothing wrong with having it on one plate, but I appreciated having the Peking duck prepared individually for us. Is this common in Chinese culture? I'd love to know as I'm curious! :) I'm not sure if it's plated per number of guests at the table, but when unsure, I think it's fine to ask your server to have it prepared so. Won't have to reach across the table! I absolutely love the Peking duck here. The meats are so tender and juicy and its crispy skin is so delicious! With shredded cabbage, cucumbers and onions, it tastes so good. I have nothing bad to say about it! The amount of Peking duck you get is definitely for more than two people - it should accommodate up to 4 (maybe more if you have kids?), and as it comes with stir-fry/soup as well, it's definitely a huge meal whoever you're with.We also ordered fried rice to enjoy with our meal because I was craving some. Whenever I go to a Chinese restaurant, I always need to have rice, preferably fried rice :P. The dish was light and a good side dish with our Peking duck. We ended up having lots of it wrapped up to go as we couldn't finish it in one sitting, but it was well worth ordering!After our Peking duck was prepared for us, stir-fry came out a little later. Though there is the option of soup, we prefer the stir-fry. It's hubby's favourite and I personally don't like the soup very much either. This Peking duck stir-fry is one of the best I've seen. We enjoyed most of it the day after at home and it was just as delicious as it was at the restaurant!Overall, Peking Garden is our go-to spot for Peking Duck. I mean, the restaurant's name says it all, no?  The restaurant is usually fully packed with customers so if you're there at a bad time, prepare yourself for waiting. I think the service at the restaurant can be improved, as I saw a shortage of servers compared to the number of customers as we enjoyed our meal. This restaurant is a popular choice for families, groups, visitors and much more. I think that says a lot about the restaurant already! Many are return customers like us and some are new...some just drop by to pick their dinners up as well. The restaurant is a little far out from downtown Montreal, but if you can get there, I highly recommend that you try the restaurant. The Peking duck is also available in two sizes (half and full) so you can definitely try their popular dish at smaller portions! 4
Came with some frends for winterlicious. Not impressed with food and portions. Service was very good, but the food was normal for hotel restaurant. (aka worse than standard)Service 5/5Value for money 1/5Overall Satisfaction after meal 2/5 2
Excellent, low key Mexican food. Great for a casual lunch. The staff is friendly and very attentive...No alcohol served, they don't have a liquor license 5
I had good experiences and bad experiences here. The wings are great, fun time always a big crowd here. My last time there I ordered Mac n Cheese, it was good BUT had pieces of plastic all through it (like if you microwave frozen stouffers, that plastic on top) and I ordered a fish sandwich which was really dry and overcooked. I will not be back. 2
I walked around store looking for a hose for a water pump,did not see one associate so they could help,I finally  found it by myself,then I needed help,no help around,me personally would not go back to that store,Home Depot is the way to go for me 1
Great old fashioned. Finally, a no-bs old fashioned in Charlotte. That's been hard to find. The place needs to work out a few kinks - the air conditioning, class up the playlist, maybe dim the lights - but overall a great addition to Uptown. 5
Fantastic brunch/breakfast place!  Traditional dinner setting with no pretentiousness. Huge portions and fresh ingredients. Not exactly a cheap diner but you do get your money's worth. Also fast and friendly. 4
Had the crab legs, tomato salad and the sea bass.  The crab legs were good because they were pre-cracked.  The sea bass was served with the head and tail.  It is not Chilean sea bass and was not that great.  The service was really really slow.  We had a large group, 16 people, but it took over three hours.  The seats are really formal and the wait staff could not reach over the seats to get or pick up food, so they hit my chair every time.  There are plenty of other restaurants in Vegas that are much better. 3
I would not recommend this community. The office staff is rude, abrasive and unhelpful. Also they tack on extra fees not in the lease. Upon move out we were advised that they charge a extra $80 "standard cleaning fee" unless we provide a receipt from a professional cleaning company. Neither one of these things are in the lease in any shape or form. They are saying that they charge every single two bedroom unit $80 unless given a receipt. We moved out, meticulously cleaned the unit, passed the move out inspection with flying colors, we were not marked down at all, we were just told we need to pay the $80 "standard cleaning fee" I tried to work with the complex office and advise them thy can't add extra fees that are not in the lease, they refused to help, I tried working with Corporate, they stuck to their guns, they are basically stealing and extra $80 from every tennant at move out, no madder if the unit needs cleaned or not. Stay far from this community. 1
I have mixed reviews about CC Sunscreens.  They had the best price out of 3 quotes.  In fact, they beat the second best offer by 17%.  They also were fairly good with customer service.  They either answered their phone or returned VM promptly.  I had a few concerns.  First, when CC came out to measure, she didn't bring a ladder.  Luckily my house is a single story, but I had to loan her a step latter to get her measurements.  Secondly, the installation truck was broken down, so my install was delayed by a week.  Third, the installer who came out said it was the first time he had installed window screens.  Fourth, we have 2 quarter shaped windows that were built to the wrong size FOUR times.  This was probably due to CC not being able to reach the windows when she did the initial measure.  The last iteration of the screen is close, but still off by an inch in the curved portion which you can see from the inside of the house.  Fifth, SRP offers a rebate for window shades and CC told me to fill out the paperwork and she would submit the form.  I did as she asked and 4 weeks later receive the form back to me in the mail with instructions to send it into SRP.  Thanks for taking care of that one.  I think that ultimately you get what you pay for and I should have just paid the extra money rather than going with CC Sunscreens. 3
This place continues to decline...we have been increasingly disappointed each time and last night was the final nail in the coffin.  We called ahead to see if the game we wanted to watch was on there. First the person on the phone said, "I think we get that channel..." "Can you check?" "Yes, that game is on, I am watching it right now." We were there within 15 minutes,  but it wasn't on.  We were seated and 4 of the 9 tvs in our section were all showing the Ohio State -Wisconsin game which no one was watching.  I asked if one screen (any of the 4) could be switched since none of the tables were watching,  they said no.   Our poor server had a party of 18 in addition to ours and other tables (i was in the restaurant industry for years, you don't do this), so we rarely saw him. When he first came to the table we said we weren't going to order right away,  he said, "And what will you have? " Apparently waiting to order wasn't an option.    The two at the host stand were repeatedly asked how long the wait was and repeated the same answer each time,"There's no way of knowing because the ASU game is on." The biggest issue with that was that it was only on one screen in our half of the dining room,  so it wasn't impacting table turns much, but most guests just left upon being told this. Another group who came in when we did had tried to call ahead for seating and we're told they don't do that. They were quite upset to see several tables pulled together for a different large group coming in...apparently that rule doesn't apply to everyone.    The food was okay, but just okay. Average food and terrible service maybe used to fly in Gilbert, but new competition is springing up every day. We will be taking our business there and giving them a shot, because we will never return here. 1
I love this place. My girls and I are always here.  Taro balls, snow white snow ice and tea-flavored spiced pork chop are my favorites. 4
A very friendly neighbourhood bakery that serves up some delicious pastries.  Highly recommend the almond croissant (so flaky!), apple-sour cherry pie and cinnamon sugar donut.  Looking forward to trying other items on the menu! 5
The food is really good! I do have an issue with the service when sitting at the bar. Its almost like the bartenders would rather do side work than bother with actual customers. I do like the food and ambiance its just hard to keep trying them out and experiencing such below par service from bartenders. The rest of the staff is very helpful. 2
Great food. Very tasty and generous portion.Came at 3:58pm and they wouldn't serve the lunch menu anymore (which is until 4pm). Wouldn't give the wifi password as well. Only reasons not giving 5 stars 3
I loved my first visit, had been wanting to go forever based on recommendations from friends. Delicious corn bread, fabulous fried catfish (slightly spicy batter and perfect tartar sauce), Mac and cheese and black eyed peas. The best part was the Texas Pete vinegar pepper sauce on the table, perfect for my peas. Too full for dessert, although tempted. 4
The 4 star average for this place is pretty accurate.  Ate here twice during my visit and the overall experience was great.  There's already a ton of reviews so I'll try to keep this short and to the point.The good:- This place can cook a RARE burger. Thank you!- The buns are great.  Crusty and perfect for soaking up all those burger juices.- Great variety of toppings.  There's definately something to be said for getting a burger with exactly what you want on it.- Sweet potato fries were tasty.  Zuicchini fries were just ok, dipped them in ranch which reminded me of fried mushrooms and veggies at other run of the mill restos. (Side note: noticed in other reviews mention of runny ranch, this was not.)The not so good:- Fleur de Lys sauces weren't that great.  Tried 2 and both lacked the flavor to stand up to the rest of the burger.- Music was loud.  I understand going for the "bar" feel, but honestly it was hard to hear our server (or anyone else further than 2 ft from you).Other thoughts:- If you're looking for a plain burger, this may not be your place.  There's really nothing wrong with their burgers, but the thing that makes this place great is the extrordinary toppings.- If you've only had burgers at Chili's or Fudruckers type places, you may want to order your burger one doneness level up from your usual.  Those places notoriously overcook their burgers, so if you're used to their medium rare, it's really more like medium. 4
My son and I had the best service.  Our server was Mark.  My son has severe food allergies and they catered to this.  Mark was so kind, friendly and just overall great.  Food was amazing as well.  The manager spoke with the kitchen to ensure my sons food was prepared without cross contamination.  We will be back and will ask for you Mark! 5
I saw a great deal on Best Fares for a dollar a day.   It was a promotion to reposition cars.  I knew what the rate was with taxes etc.  When I got to the counter, the rental agent was very pleasant.  When he realized that I was not going to upgrade he became Mr. Hyde.  He told me that my car would probably break down if I used the air conditioning going over the Grapevine.  Maybe I should rent a V6.  No I was sticking to my guns and going with the original rate which is the only reason I rented from DollarI wanted to add an additional driver for the trip back to California.  I only needed the extra driver for the last two days.  The additional driver rate was $10.99 per day.  I only needed it for 2 days.  His reply was, you got the car for a dollar a day, what's an extra $10.99.  My answer was $55.00.  He was not happy.  So to add the other driver I have to go to a Dollar rental car site.I did call the manager on duty and told her what had happened.  I didn't want a better deal, my deal was great.  I just wanted her to know what I went through so that she could communicate this to the agent.  She was profusely apologetic and was planning to let the agent know that this was not acceptable.When you are on a budget, you shouldn't feel better if you can not afford more. 1
Won't be back.  This place was horrible. Not even kidding. Won't be back at all. The bagel was stale and tastes horrible. When I asked for a new one they just have me excuses and finally gave me a new one and the new one was still horrible. Won't be back. 1
One of the best in Koreatown due to variety of their menu - there is something for everyone.   Flavor is always intense, great sides dishes (the best kimchi on bloor - most days!), efficient service and all around great experience.  I like the fact that they have so many booths and a few private rooms so you can catch up with friends and not feel crammed like so many places in ktown.Highly recommend to anyone who is new to trying Korean cuisine and want to "ease" into it with the bibimbap (mixed veg/rice/beef in hot stone bowl with spicy red sauce)  or kalbi (short -rib) as they prepare it extremely well.Although the aesthetics of the place could be improved (some modern updates)  -it's worth it to come back for the authentic Korean and all the variety this place has to offer. 4
Music is an integral part of my life.  If I don't go to at least 2 concerts every month I start to go through withdrawals. I'm a much bigger fan of smaller venues than massive sized arenas.  When the venue is smaller the entire concert experience is enhanced because it's more intimate and you're closer to the artist.  Neighborhood Theatre can seat a few hundred with mezzanine seating at stage right and floor seating facing the stage. The sound is great and spot on.  You can easily hear every note that is played or sung.  The only drawback is that the space is a bit dated and could use a few modern touches.  Other than the decor I think this place is awesome and will definitely be back for more concerts or events. 4
I ordered the The Mother Earth Bowl with chicken. I thought I was making a healthy choice (small serving size approximately 1 1/2 cups). I looked up the nutritional info. when I got home... whopping 700+ calories.  I was shocked.  I didn't see a nutritional info. posted, but should have asked. This dish definitely was not worth the calories.I won't go back to Flower Child 3
This is what people said: I love this place! They cook the food right in front of you! This is what I thought: Oh, it must be like a hibachi place, kind of fancy, really tasty.  This is what it is like: a cafeteria where you pile raw ingredients into a bowl then line up to have your food schlepped onto a grill where it is cooked to your liking.  OK.  The food is just all right.  The first time I ever went there we made reservations (what did I know? I thought it was a fancy joint!)  the hostess looked at me like I was insane when I walked in and said we had one.  Another time I was there I ordered a gin and tonic...I noticed they had a full bar and I wanted one for whatever reason.  The waitress brought me a RUM and TONIC.  Good Lord.  I don't think anyone in the history of drinking has ever ordered a rum and tonic.  Not really worth the time.  If you're in the area, just FYI, there's a Winking Lizard a few doors down. 2
Thanks to yelp! Otherwise I would have not found this place. The service here is great and fair prices. I watched two other customers pay for their service and they both seemed happy when they finished. As soon as I walked in, another customer asked if I had been there before (no) and immediately started saying how fair the prices were and how great the service was. This is NOT a franchise. The owner is there everyday at the front desk and most of the time you deal with him direct. Incredible place and they deserve all the support and great reviews they have. 5
I have always loved The Spaghetti Factory.. the food is still good but our service was possibly the worst I have ever had. We had to ask for everything and waited and waited for him to bring what we had asked for, had to ask the hostess for items because the thing our server did best was disappear. Our dessert was served with the dirty dishes on the table and he failed to bring clean spoons. What a disapointment as we were celebrating a birthday.. 2
Always wanted to try the Thomas Keller experience. Here's is what we tried:1. Foie gras - it's nice to have it here because we are out of California. Not the best I've had but it's good with their truffle fries. The order also comes with two plates of toasted baguette which you can spread the foie gras on. Yum!2. Escargot - too salty, but very unique having a puff pastry on top. The flavor would have been very good if it wasn't too salty. 3. Oysters - LOVE them. There were different kinds and all of them were so good. 4. Mixed greens - love the taste of their red wine vinaigrette. 5. Bouchon steak - again, too salty. I always think it's not the best idea to order steak at a French restaurant, but we just wanted some meat...6. Sturgeon confit - good flavors! Seafood here is worth a try. 4
The food and drinks are blah, but the service is always great! Happy hour and trivia are always fun at Skip & Jan's. 3
I was expecting this to be a grat dining experience, but was very dissapointed. The staff was unprofessional and you need a firecracker to get their attention once you order. For a restauarant which is trying to present an upscale environment, there was much lacking. They could use some linen on the tables and could at least balance the table which rocked from side to side. When mentioning that to the waiter, he seemed unconcerned and shrugged his shoulders. Salads were alla carte and was the smallest salad I have ever been served. It was fresh and tasty, but for the price should have been more than a taste of a salad. The bread which accompianed the salad was 3very small pieces of dried out non tasty bread the size of a quarter only a little thicker. It tasted as if it was a week old piece of bread which has sat out for the entire week. The waiter also did not seem concerned when this was mentioned. About 1/2 hour after the salad was served, we caught the waiter to find out if our dinner was lost. He cleaned off the salad plates and procceded to remove the forks from them and set them on the table saying we would need those for dinner. We had to ask him to take away the salad forks and bring clean forks for the entre. I believe again, at this price point, that should have been done with out asking. One of our entres was the lobster mac, that was light and delicious, The second entre was pork butt on paperdelle noodles. This was horrible. The meat had no taste, the sauce was straight sour cream and the dish had a funny taste. Later the person who ordered this did not feel well so the left overs were thrown away for fear of food poisoning. it took over 40 min after the entr for us to get our bill and another 15 for him to collect it. At no time did anyone inquire if we liked our dinner or if there was anything else they could get us. We were not offered dessert althogh there were some good sounding offers on the menu.For a bill which came to $100 with a tip added in, I expect much better food and at least mediocre service, neither of which we received. I will not try this place again in the near future. I hope they can fix their many shortcomings as Medina can use a good upscale but not overly pompous restaraunt that provides excellent food. It is ok to be iventive, but they need to rethink a few things here and train the staff. 2
After reading the reviews here I was a little iffy on checking out a car here but decided to take my chances because well.. car shopping sucks.. period. This isn't my first or second time buying a car so unfortunately I know all too well how wonderful the process can be (sarcasm) However, I'll say this. I walked in, told them what I was looking at online, showed them the price quote, took for a test drive. Wonderful car salesman Dwight answered all my questions. He was straight to the point and didn't try to feed me a bunch of add on or things I didn't want. This was by far the best and easiest car buying experience I've ever had. I didn't feel like I had to have a showdown with the car salesman. After he showed me everything with the car and help me set up my blue tooth, I drove off the lot a happy new owner of a Ford Fusion. I'd highly recommend Bill Luke to everyone and if you're worried about getting a bad car salesman .. ask for Dwight. He's good! 5
Love this place. Pizza, pasta, stromboli, wings, garlic knots......can't go wrong with any of them. 4
Burgatory is okay. The first time I went here I made my own burger and got it to go. It took them a really long time and when I got home, I realized they left off some of the toppings that they charge extra for. :) The next time I went, I got tacos. These were delicious; however, the service was awkward. Our server would walk by our table, slowly, as if he was going to check in with us....but would just end up walking away. Lol! I also got to try a milkshake. The amaretto one had good flavor but the texture was off since the pieces of almond were a little large for a drink. Overall, I'm not really impressed with this place. It's fine, but there are better places. I prefer BRGR. 3
We were staying at the Boulders resort which is only about 2 miles away from the restaurant. We found the restaurant on Yelp after having tried the restaurants at the hotel (which were overpriced and the food was just ok). Forgot our waitress' name (I think it was Corina) but she was super friendly, offered suggestions and explained the dishes to us- we weren't too familiar with Brazilian food. We tried the Feijoada and the Picanha, both dishes were delicious! Service was fast and friendly! Would highly recommend this place! 5
I am not optimistic about this location, since I was a fan of the previous occupant as well (an Indian restaurant), which obviously didn't survive. The interior is unremarkable, but I can't say the same about the food! Their hummus is fantastic, as is their falafel and lentil soup. For lunch, my favorite thing is the kefta kabob, which comes with hummus, rice, and grilled vegetables. Delish! Mohammed et al. are very courteous, and, when I have ordered takeout, the orders have always been completed promptly. I hope this place makes it. After all, where else can you tell a dining partner to meet you "in de Nile"? Go ahead. Say it out loud. You'll get it. 4
The burgers are delicious!  The beer selection is admirable! The service is garbage. My husband and I took a seat in the "lounge" to wait for friends.  We ordered 12 Oz beers because we were planning on staying a while to drink with friends and wanted to taste different types. We were served the 20 Oz beers. Not wanting to waste we drank them. We decided we wanted a snack. They have an extensive appetizer menu but we wanted to try the burgers. Not being too hungry,  we split a burger "el machet". (Rememeber we were planning on filling up on tasty beer and hiting the strip. Doggie bags are not good luck on the game floor) It was tasty but not very spicy. Just tasted like an average good burger.  We were hoping for something with more heat. Our waitress must have decided we were cheap since we split a burger and never came back for refills or to check on us. In fact we couldn't get anyone to refill our beer. I guess it was good the burger wasn't spicy! Finally the waitress unceremoniously dropped our check off without saying anything. We paid, left, and took our money else where. Joke was on her. Alcohol always spikes the bill = bigger tip. The next wait staff enjoyed our money. If we wanted a full meal we would have sat in the dining room. If you want good service and multiple beers go somewhere else. If you want to be judged on your order by the world's most mediocre waitress,  this is your place! I'll withhold her name for class ;) 1
I tried their burger a while back, it didn't seem to me that it is that much different than what I would get at MacDonald?  May be Shake Shack has it more juicy but taste wise, it is just the same as the rest of the burger places.  I wouldn't go out of my way to look for them if I wanted to eat a burger but if I come across one and I happen to be in the mood for one then I would give it another shot! 3
My mom likes to visit Magic Wok whenever we visit Toronto.  I can see why.  They have multiple tanks filled with fresh seafood.  This is like any typical Chinese family style restaurant.  All group tables are round and the smaller tables are square.  It was loud and the restaurant was pack.  We were seated rather quickly since they had the big round table available.My family ordered a variety of seafood.  Two extremely huge lobsters, two dungess crab, conch with fried tofu, snails, fish, chicken, veggies, and steamed oysters.  The lobsters was the best.  They were served Hong Kong style with cheese.  I haven't had that in ages!  The favors were full and I wasn't thirsty after the meal.  Usually Chinese restaurants uses way too much MSG, but this place was okay.  The only problem I have with this place is they charge for sauce.  That's right.  If you ordered steam fish, they'll charge you for salt, soy sauce, ginger, and the scallions.  I'm not kidding.  I wish they let me take a picture of the "sauce" menu.  That way I can post it.  Who the hell charge for sauce?  This is why this place only gets two stars. 2
This is the worse place in the city of Las Vegas to live in it is overpriced unorganized and the maintenance crew are lazy nothing gets fixed there are roaches just a horrible place to live if you want the worse residential experience Las Vegas has to offer you can consider the stone gate apartments 1
I was excited when this place opened, the west side needed a cool hang out bar. Unfortunately out of the four times that I have been there, I have been disappointed.The bartenders do not know how to make their special drinks, one bartender forgot to add the cranberry to the cosmo, which another bartender noticed and fixed.On other occasions a few of us ordered some of the other special drinks, such as the champagne drinks, again, less than desirable.The one time we went to try their beer, since it had finally been brewed, we ended up walking out because the waitor straight up ignored us for 25 minutes and as we were walking out he caught up to us in the parking lot and started yelling for us to come back.The food sounds impressive on the menu, but its not.  For the price I would rather drive over to the Great Dane in Hilldale/Fitchburg.We will continue to frequent Babes for drinks instead of the Vintage.   The vintage has potential and I hope that they correct the various issues. 2
The only reason I didnt give this restaurant a 5 star rating is because of the service.Servers were not very friendly and were slightly rude. We actually noticed them looking at the customers and sort of making fun of people. That  was a big turn off for all of us. It seemed as they didnt want to spend too much time with customers, they were more interested in watching the belly dance performance :-)The atmosphere and music are great, belly dancers are beautiful and very good performers. They serve a 6 course meal, which I really enjoyed. My favorite was definitely desert: chocolate, cinnamon and pastry.. it was heavenly.Overall tasty food and fun atmosphere, but servers ruined what couldve been a great experience. 3
Amazing wine selection (hundreds of bottles).The meatball was very good.Salmon was so so. Over ambience, service and food was good 4
This place has the best fry bread I've ever had, and I've had fry bread many times. The  chips are also excellent and were served warm. The prices are reasonable. We will be back. 5
This place holds true potential, against its behemoth contender across the street, Sneeky Dee's. Decided to go, following reading a review on a blog website, and was inclined to see what the early buzz was all about. Unfortunately the place has yet to catch on, as at 11 15 on a Saturday, the place was barely bumping. Two semi DJ's took their turns at the mixing, and was overall un-pleasurable, as one of them, was spinning classic hip hop, and the other, who would randomly take over was spinning club jams. Very jarring. Apparently they serve food here, and apparently its good, Mexican/Korean fusion, but the place does not beg to be eaten at. Its semi resto, semi bar/dance floor, and is darkly lit enough to muster courage to dance with that strangely out of place ginette throwing it down harder than she should. Either way though, I dont know if they change the decor for dining hours, but it would not condone a taco feast, it barely condones a grand tour, and for a place that boasts potential character, it seems pretty rough around the edges. Drink prices were pretty on the ball for a saturday. When Goldslager, and Jager are going for 3.50 a shot on saturday, you know the bar is trying to pull in the thirsty traveler, and i guess it worked. But only for a bit, one or two mason jars of PBR later, and we were on our way. Back to sneeks, if only for the nachos and the crowd. 3
I love this place!!  I've been all over town looking for a great place by either my mom or I (we love to go together) but every where we've been is just not up to par.  I happened to notice when they first opened and we said why not.  So glad we did!!  This place is always, always clean, everyone is always really nice, and they all seem to do a wonderful job!!  Harry is my mom's favorite but I've had a great experience with everyone I've seen.  Something else I've noticed but no one else has mentioned, is that they don't use the harsh chemicals so it's never stinky so I can bring my son when I can't get a sitter (and, when I do, they're always really nice to him too!).  Unfortunately, I don't always get to go as often as I'd like but when I do they always remember me, ask about my son and Mom (and my Nana when she was still alive) which is just one of those little things that make you feel like you're really appreciated as a customer. 5
It's way over priced for what you get.  The burgers are good the frys are soggy and undercooked and they're not shoe-string like advertised.  You can go to Hamburger Works and the best burger in Phoenix.  You can get a "great big one" with everything including a large 1/2 pound of fresh beef for much less than 5 guys charges.  I also didn't like having to buy frys for 2 for $3.00.  A small burger, frys and a drink cost almost $13.  I tried it once but I won't go back. 2
Awesome food awesome prices! Jennifer was an AMAZING server even though we were very indecisive! 4
Went back for a quick dinner, had an amazing time. Zach was working and made the experience very pleasant. Again, food was delicious and prepared in a timely manner considering the time of day and how busy they were. 5
Can't say enough about Juan and 4 Points RV Service! We are doing a home remodel and living in our 5th wheel. The converter was having issues, smelled of melted plastic and was hot to the touch, kept tripping when the AC came on. I called several mobile RV services and left messages that were never returned. Juan answered the phone, advised that he was booked for several days (which I can totally understand in AZ during snowbird season), schedule and appointment for Tuesday 11/15 at 2:00. He called that afternoon and said he would be a few minutes early, he arrived, listened to my concerns, went through some troubleshooting steps and then completed the repairs. He was courteous, explained everything fully, was helpful with advice on how to do some things more efficiently than we were doing them and the price was beyond reasonable. Very satisfied with the service and value! Highly recommended!!! 5
This place is terrible!! I got SO sick from his place. So did my son and my husband. I will NEVER eat here again. 1
Great customer service. They really care that you are satisfied as their customer and will make it right if you aren't. Best methodology/technology behind the carpet cleaning process. PURT is a great product for pet urine/odor/stain removal, and they use a black light to discover any trouble spots from pet urine. 4
My meal (Burger) was good, but my wife's short rib hash thing was inedible. The dish lacked flavor and the potatoes in it were still raw and crunchy. We didn't see our server for about 15 minutes after she served it, so by the time she came back we were over our experience and just wanted to leave. 2
I want my money back. This is probably the worst Chinese food I have ever had. I ordered the general gau's chicken yesterday and it was not even edible. I ended up throwing it away after eating one piece. There's almost no chicken and what was breaded was really saturated and soggy with the sauce. The rice was boring and kind of mushy. The eggroll looked and tasted store-bought and it seemed cooked that way too.  I really wish I could get my money back. I would definitely not recommend this place to anyone. 1
There was something weird about this place. My cousins and I came here cause we hella wanted pizza. We where looking at the menu for a long time cause it was our first time and the cashier wasn't very helpful. They didn't have thick crust because they where out of it. And the whole time the cashiers where just so annoyed! It didn't bother me until the girl brought me my garlic roll things and I said thank you and the girl didn't even smile or say you're welcome . There's just something unprofessional about this place. Ya feel me? The pizza was okay. The ranch was okay. We're very picky about our ranch. The garlic things where okay. Maybe We'll come back. Probably not. 3
Sushi Review Only. It was completely by chance we found this place on a Saturday that our first pick sushi restaurant happened to be closed and was looking in Yelp for another Sushi place nearby. This place at first didn't appeal to me knowing it was located in a food court but we took a chance because it was open and near by. I have to say it was the best choice for sushi and thank goodness our 1st pick place was closed.  First, it's located in the below ground food court/shops where Marshalls is located. It seems to be a relatively new building with 85% of shop space unoccupied ghost town-like without tenants. Tucked in a corner, the place is run by a very friendly Korean couple that serves truly amazing sushi. They take pride and care in making and presenting the food. Of all the over priced sushi places around the GTA, this by far takes the best taste to price award for Dragon rolls. We ordered the Red Dragon Roll and Small (30 pcs)Sushi Platter. The quality, quantity and taste equals any of the best sushi I ever had at drastically more costly restaurants. The sushi rice was made at perfect temperature with excellent texture, moisture , taste and stickiness. The fish was very fresh with a nice large thick cut-no skimping. I give it a 4 instead of 5 stars is because although the Sushi Platter tasted amazing, there were too few pieces of actual "fish" sushi.  By far their best deal are the dragon rolls which I will order a bunch instead of sushi In the future. Now on whenever going to downtown to fix a sushi crave, This is my go to place. 4
Referred here by a former boss that has use them for years. Very happy with their service. Reasonable estimate. Good service. Didn't feel pressured or up-sold. 4
Based on  the Charlotte agenda review of Thai Taste, I decided try out this place. I ordered  Chicken Pad Thai as a carry out item and was told it would take 10 minutes. Food came out in  less than 10 minutes.  I thought that was unusually fast. Got home and ate and the food sucked! It did not taste fresh at all. The noodles seemed old or had been sitting a long time. There was also an overly powerful vinegar taste. I couldn't find the egg in my pad Thai plus there was a weird grainy texture as well that didn't taste like ground peanuts. Considering this was my first time at Thai Taste dilworth, I was definitely not pleased! 1
My mom and I were spending a girl's night out and decided to check out this restaurant prior to the Pirate game.  We planned ahead and got in line via No Wait, as I anticipated this being a popular spot on a Friday night.  We arrived at the restaurant and I checked in as the app instructed me to do.  The hostesses seemed overwhelmed already (it was only 5 pm) and not one of them politely greeted us.  One asked me if I selected indoor, outdoor or no preference when I registered online.  I said, I'm sorry I didn't as that wasn't an option when I got in line.  She looked super annoyed, rolled her eyes and said, "That's what I'm asking you." So I apologized again (something wrong with this picture here...) and requested outside.  At that point, there were four parties ahead of us.  We waited another 15 minutes before our table was ready.  Once we were alerted, I returned to the hostess desk, informed them that my table was ready.  At this point, there were 4 employees standing at the desk, not busy serving other customers.  One said, you have to now check in with the outside host desk.  Having never been there before, I did not know where that was exactly, so I asked if someone could show us.  One employee, also seemingly annoyed (I'm sensing a pattern here...), lifted his arm and literally pointed at the front door.  Incredulous, I said I needed someone to physically show me the way - not point outside.  We were then  directed outside to the appropriate area, and the next hostess was far friendlier and lead us promotly to our table.  The table wasn't actually ready, as there was still debris and remnants from the previous diners.  So the hostess bussed the table and we settled in.  At this point, it was 1 hour and 45 minutes prior to the start of the game - plenty of time to enjoy the beautiful weather.  We were greeted fairly promptly by our waitress, she was very friendly, and our drink orders were taken.  We acknowledged that we were going to the game.  It took a solid 15 minutes for her to return with our drinks and take our dinner order.  She apologized for the wait, and we said no problem because at the point we had the whole night ahead of us.  That turned out to be the shortest wait of the evening.  And our waitress became less pleasant and present from that point forward.We ordered three apps total and a salad.  Our first two appetizers arrived 30 minutes later (?!) and at that point our glasses were bone dry.  We asked for water, which took another 15 minutes.  It's important to note that while the restaurant was somewhat busy, not all of the tables were occupied in our area and it appeared to be well staffed.  It took another 35 minutes to receive our dinner (remember a salad and an appetizer of tacos), and we were starting to get very annoyed.  My mom's salad came without dressing, so the waitress went back to retrieve it.  Not sure if she got lost, but that took an unnecessarily long time as well.  Unfortunately, the game was fast approaching, so we hurriedly ate (not at all how we envisioned this going) and asked for the check.  We also asked for a take out box, as the portions were very generous.  Our waitress served two tables, going in and out, before finally bringing us our check. Guess what, no box.  She served two more tables, in and out, before taking our check and bringing boxes.  At this point, we were 5 minutes from game time, very frustrated and certainly not relaxed.  The food at Jerome Bettis Grille 36 was tasty and generously portioned.  However, the staff was hugely disappointing from the moment we walked in to the moment we hurriedly rushed out.  Despite being well staffed, it appeared disorganized and poorly managed.  The host staff was incredibley rude and the wait staff was not attentive or responsive to our very basic needs.  I will not return to this restaurant for future pre-game meals, nor would I recommend it to anyone interested in spending their time wisely.  Jerome - the city loves you and we are proud of you, but your restaurant staff is letting you down.  I can't imagine these are your standards and you are going to need to act quickly to turn this around before the next influx of sports fans unknowingly settles in. 2
Great place to grab a quick lunch or dinner. Nice family restaurant. B4 is the best!!! It is an older place but the food is great!! 4
First time to this place.  Have driven past it hundreds of times and always wondered if it was any good.  Well my kids were jonesing for a smoothie and we were right down the street so I figured we would give a local business a shot at our ridiculous smoothie obsession.  Upon walking in it was obvious that they were going for the "Central Perk" vibe...it was homey but cool.  That's about all I can say in a positive sense.  The place was way under staffed and those who were working seemed overwhelmed and disorganized.  We place our orders for three regular sized (medium) smoothies which were advertised to be made with nothing but fresh fruit.  We were all anticipating a great drink.  After waiting about 15 minutes for our drinks (which seemed to be the norm for all customers) we were extremely underwhelmed by what we received.  They were definitely not using fresh fruit; it must have been some kind of concentrate as there was no hint of any real fruit in the drink.  Second they added a ton of ice to the drink and didn't even blend it well enough to consume through a straw.  All three of our drinks were lousy...I didn't finish mine.  The people working there seemed very nice but did not deliver a good product in a reasonable amount of time.  Three medium smoothies were $20.  I may have hit these guys on an off day but will be sticking to Jamba Juice in the future. 2
Walked in the front door and it smelled so fishy my wife and I left.  It was a Friday night and no one was there except one couple, I wasn't impressed.  The reviews indicated great sushi but we couldn't get past the fishy smell and the lack of people.  It's also very stark inside with no atmosphere. Not really sure about the food but not my cup of tea.   Hope this helps someone else make a decision it seems like the other reviews are plants. 1
Great pizza place! We've been going here for years and I recommend the Bianca pizza with ricotta. The staff is very accommodating and the atmosphere is comfortable. Whether dining in or ordering to go it always good. 4
Today I was scheduled for a nail repair from a gel service I received Saturday morning. This nail spa has a 3 day nail repair policy. My polish chipped Sunday night. I called this morning & I was given the run around. After the excuses I was told to come in at the end of the day. I arrived 10mins early & sat for 30mins past my scheduled time for the nail tech to come make more excuses & tell me she was booked for the rest of the day. I said what about the 3 day policy & the appointment I was given for today?  I'm where I was supposed to be when I was supposed to be there & my chipped nail still isn't getting fixed??? This is poor customer service & bad products at its worst!! The appointment setter then told me she could get me in on Wednesday, but that's out of the 3 day policy & she would have to see if I would have to pay. I told her of course not. I am at my scheduled appointment at the time you gave me after rearranging my day & sitting for over 30mins. This situation was handled in the most unprofessional matter w/complete disregard for my time. If quality products were used, my gel nail wouldn't chip a day after having them done. Needless to say I will not be returning to deal w/the confusion & bad customer service. I've received better for less. Thanks, but no thanks.... 1
(I am writing this using my husband's account) I've been to Hissyfits a few times, and always find something cute for my baby boy that is worth buying.  I've only looked at the infant clothes, so I don't know anything about the kids' clothes.  They're very selective about the brands they take here, so the clothes are mostly from nicer stores.  I've heard them tell people they won't take any Carter's clothes, unless they're really cute.  They have lots of Gymboree, Baby Gap, Polo RL, H&M.  There's not much crawl-around-the-house clothes, so if you're looking for baby basics, this may not be the place.  One BIG problem I have with this place though is the service.  The check-out counter is extremely cluttered (as is the rest of the place) and if you're just trying to make a quick purchase, good luck.  If there's anyone in front of you in line and they're doing anything but plain buying (like checking on merchandise they have for sale or collecting cash from their sold items) it will take forever.  There's no sense of urgency to get to the next customer, they just take their time.  I almost always leave in a bad mood because of this.  They probably don't like me because when I finally get to the front of the line (after debating over and over whether I should just leave) I probably have a pissed off look on my face...and I'm a really friendly person!To sum it up, I will return because I like the clothes, but will do so grudgingly. 3
Sloppy service but great margaritas. We were amazed at the abundance of wait staff and still no service. They all seemed preoccupied, even the bartender who wasn't able to clear the bar after guests left. Really the only reason to patronize this establishment is on Tuesday for $5 top shelf margaritas. 3
I visited the Tempe location for the first time a few months ago.  While I enjoy the large variety of items and cleanliness of the store, the staff is lacking in basic customer service skills. They act like they are doing me a favor, rather than the other way around. Especially when I bring in items to consign. I'm treated like a 4-year old. The staff is aloof and unfriendly. On my last visit, I asked the woman in the back (sitting right next to the restroom) if there was one I could use.  She said "yeah, but the key is at the front desk".  Guess it was too much to keep a key in back, or call the front for me? Why do they keep it locked at all? Felt like I was at a gas station!  Needless to say, when I walked back to the front desk, no one was there and I had to wait several minutes with legs crossed for the woman to return and give me the precious key.  All the while, the lady in the back was sitting there watching me wait!  Ridiculous! A return visit from me is not in their future.  Their loss. 2
Great Thai offerings.  Get the Tottie spring rolls.  Four tasty rolls that you roll in fresh lettuce, cilantro and mint. Good to share for a couple.  Dinner after that will fill you up. Wonderful Asian decore and pretty decent, but not great service. 4
I made the mistake of ordering the wrong height barstools.  When I called to request an exchange I was told they don't make exchanges, that it states right on the back of my receipt.  Well since the salesman never tells you this & just says sign & initial it is too late.  1star is too good.  If I could give 0 stars I would.  I will NEVER buy from them again! 1
It's ok. It's always noisy when I go there.  The wine by the glass is limited, and one of the two Chianties they serve is below average. Beer selection is fine. Service can be a little slow, so don't if in a hurry.  I've had a few of the non pizza dishes and I'm not really sure how to describe them except for not much sauce and piled high with a mystery meat. Stick to the pizza. 3
I'll go easy because they just opened this location.1)  The onion ring batter won't stay on the onion.  The onion was a bit raw too.  Try soaking the rings for 24 hours in buttermilk.  Then coat twice.  Season the flour with garlic and pepper.  Works for me!2)  The happy hour menu is weak!.  Pretty much chips and snacks type stuff.  Nothing good like sliders etc.3)  The kids mac & cheese is out of a box.  Really guys?  It takes two seconds to make mac  & cheese from scratch.  Go to allrecipes.com if you need help.4)  The burger meat is good in flavor but the burger lacks seasoning.5)  The menu is way too big.  A scaled down menu with better quality would be better.6)  The nachos are nasty with that queso cheese.  People love traditional nachos.  Stack them high and layer them with cheddar.  all the toppings.  You are a sports bar.7)  IMO.. drop all of the steaks etc from the menu.  You're a sports bar.  Leave that to Mastros and Flemings.  People want GOOD bar food in a sports bar.Bottom line....  love the atmosphere, food is OK, beer was cold, price is a little high for what you get, menu is too big, quality of food is OK.  What would I do?  Interview a new fresh Chef to bring in some changes.  Good luck.  I'll stop by again for a happy hour and give you another try.  Cheers. 3
I've tried almost all Persian restaurants in Toronto and by far Darbar has been the best one! It was my third visit here on Saturday. As usual, my husband and I ordered the Soltani dish to share. The Barg tenderloin veal was juicy and delicious. Kobideh was good as well, specially I like the herbs they mix with the ground meat. Prices: The prices are higher than all other Persian restaurants by around $10, however, I believe the food quality and the vibe of the restaurant is superior to other Persian places and because of that I don't mind paying $10-$20 extra when I am there. Portions: I am not sure if I am right but I think their portions have shrunk since the first time I ate there two years ago! Correct me if I am wrong! :) Will go back maybe in a couple of moths. 4
Been devoted to Raul's hair care for 10 years now. He has taken me from dark to blonde, to dark again. He has become a great friend, and always makes sure my hair is healthy, and looking great. He is also brilliant at extension work, the best in town from what I have experienced growing up here. Thanks for all your dedication Raul, keep up the great work! xo 5
Tres bonne nouriture. Souvent nous le commandons par telephone et allons le chercher. Avons mange quelques fois sur place. Deco sympathique. Sieges moins confortables avec les coussins. Mais la nourriture vaut la peine. 4
Really wonderful bread. The challah was perfect, and the french baguette a close second.The cupcakes were not great--maybe a bit stale? But I forgive them. I will be back soon for more challah! 4
I hate that I have to waste more time on this terrible company. I'm only doing this to hopefully save someone else the learning experience we had to go through. They rented us a condo that hadn't been cleaned, didn't have a working fridge and a few things were broken. I let them know it wasn't clean they said they would send someone (nobody showed up) so I had to scrub literally everything while 9 months pregnant..there was dog pee on the walls along with other things (I have pictures). The fridge was broken for 10 days and they made me take care of it, I had to go down and deal with the people to try to get warranty work. The apartment was infested with German roaches which was by far the worst deal of it all. We battled for a year with these disgusting things. So when we moved out they tried to keep our money for stuff that was wrong with the place before hand! It took almost 2 months to get my money back and I had to threaten to pursue legal action. I wish I would have done my research but now I know what kind of company to run away from. They are horrible to get in contact before, during and after using their services. RUN AWAY! 1
since my last review, we have not seen one rat in our home... which I am very grateful for. They completely remodeled our kitchen with new walking, tile, cabinets and a sink... it looks absolutely phenomenal. However, we now have the small roaches from the sewer.. I have only seen 2 so far but I'm kind of irritate at that..  ugh.... 2
Complete garbage. Today marks the third time I've spent over an hour in the office to have nothing more than have my baby weighed. Terrible bedside manner, long wait times, and totally unprofessional. Not much else to say 1
I always enjoyed the chicken Caesar salad until tonight.  Something has changed.  Cold chicken with a new dressing that was not the same for $16?  SMH?  Was praying the new ownership was the old ownership.  Not pleased. 1
Not even worth rating! I ordered a baby arrangement through Teleflora and this florist sent something completely different. They substituted every element of the arrangement, including the color and design.They refused Teleflora's request to redeliver. Teleflora did not tell me who they were, the envelope on the delivery card did! The arrangement they sent was cheap and ugly, a total disappointment from the Premium arrangement that I ordered and paid for....What a scam!You don't stay in business by ignoring your customers and letting them stay unhappy.Thank goodness Teleflora is using another florist to refill my order. 1
Servers,and pie are great.....everything else is lukewarm, tasteless and definitely overpriced.   Sad, as we would love to have a good restaurant near our home... 3
While I loved the pedicure I received, I didn't care for the staff. One of the ladies starting gossiping about another client right in front of us, and when she realized we'd noticed, she simply laughed and clued us in as to why she was talking about the girl - I found it very rude. My friend and I were also pressured into writing reviews online (while we were sitting in the chairs!), and my friend left hers on Facebook....the owner checked for it right after my friend hit submit! I don't think I will be back. 2
The steak was ridiculously bad. Chicken was OK. The salsa was so cold it made my whole taco seem like they pulled it out of the fridge. My 7 year old summed it up saying "This tastes like poop!" 1
The patio is probably the best in Calgary, with fantastic views of the river and downtown.  For scenery it's a 5-star.  But the food and service need some work.  The burger was excellent, but the sides were terrible.  I would have been happier with a side of Ms Vickie's potato chips than the bland and tiny portion that came along.  My friend ordered a side salad which was essentially the lettuce and tomato on the burger chopped up.  Hardly appealing.  Service was pleasant when it came by, but that was pretty rare.  This place has great potential, but I won't be going back unless it is just for drinks and a view seat on the patio. 2
Was craving some Mediterranean food and had heard some good things about Bunky's  . What I had heard was definitely correct. I went with my boyfriend he got the lamb kabob and i got the chicken plate. We both got the lentil soup. The server was very friendly even when my boyfriend knocked over his water.The lentil soup had really good flavor and was a great start to the meal. Our main dishes were awesome the chicken was flavorful and had really good seasoning. The bite i had of lamb was also very good my boyfriend wished it was a little more on the medium side but everyone has there own preference. Veggies on the plate had a great grill on them. Overall it was a great meal we will definitely be back again. 5
Very rude staff. Went twice, both times had bad experiences. Never again. 1
THE BEST!I dropped my iPhone and broke the glass on the back.  The guys quickly fixed the back and charged a very reasonable price.  These guys are super friendly.  I can't recommend them enough. 5
Have driven past this place for over a year and finally made my first visit today! Cutest little cafe. The front of the cafe is quaint and cozy, boosting some lovely kitchen & misc house ware items for sale. As you make you're way through the cafe there is another area showcasing various items and then additional small tables in a semi-private room. I can see it being a really good spot for meeting a study group or something of that nature. The menu is small, with the focus on speciality lattes. I indulged in a Nutella latte and it was delicious. I think I'll try the toasted almond latte next! I also grabbed a peanut butter cookie and it was the perfect amount of soft and crunchy. I'm glad I finally got to check this place out and look forward to my next visit :) 5
Pros:  Pool area, location, colorful.Cons:  Rooms leave a lot to be desired, price for what you get.If you like this type of retro-hotel, just stay at the Valley Ho.  They do it much better.  The rooms at The Saguaro aren't very nice.  They tried, but there are a lot of details that are missed.  Don't get a room on the lower level -- the only curtains they have are black out curtains so if you don't want people being able to look in as they walk past you have to pull the black out curtain and now your room has no natural light!  This really bothered me!  Just put in a sheer curtain for goodness sake.  On our last night a group of 20 somethings were staying next to us.  They had a VERY loud party all night long.  We called the front desk MANY times.  They would not do anything about it.  We finally were able to sleep after 4:30am!!  That was NOT cool.The location cannot be beat if you are staying for Giants spring training.  And it's right there in Old Town so many choices of restaurants and bars all right there.  If you want bottled water and don't want to pay $6 for the water in the room, you can get bottled water from the 5 gallon tank in the fitness room - bring your empty bottle and fill it up!  Just sayin....If I ever stay here again I will make sure to ask for an upper level room, but I'm thinking it's not likely to happen. 2
Went here the other night with a friend. While the location is great for those of us who live in south end, I was not impressed. Friends who went last week warned me that it was meh-- expensive for what they got and nothing special. But I decided to give this place a try anyway. I was sorry I did. The inside space is pretty cramped, and there's basically one long communal table and then some small tables in the back. I got the hungry miso ramen which had no flavor. The waiters were friendly enough and were very knowledgeable about the menu. But for a main dish, I was very sad about my experience and wish I hadn't paid $12 for what essentially tasted like a bowl of water with a small amount of pork stuck in it. 2
So I have been here on a few occasions and well worth it. So much that I joined the wellness program. $59 for an hour massage monthly is a deal!! I had two separate massage therapists and both were wonderful. The only complaint I had was that when I got undressed the room was a little cold and the bed was not heated. I was relaxed fairly easily and soon forgot of the small chill factor. Well worth every penny and have enjoyed every experience so far! 4
A little disappointed in this place. One of those situations where all the little things add up to make an overall underwhelmed experience.First we were sat at our table outside on the patio there was dirty silverware on the floor under my chair. Easily overlooked but whoever cleaned up after the lunch shift should've caught it. And whoever opened for the dinner shift should've caught it as well.Then our waiter brings us waters... I ask for straws and dish of lemons. He brings us back straws holding them in a bar napkin so not to touch them which is nice. But when he gets to the table he sets the straws down directly on the table. Now I'm not saying the table was dirty but it is an outdoors table and I am saying it was not clean enough to eat off of. So again something small but annoying nevertheless. Then he brings the lemons in a bar napkin and set them on the table as well. this is a relatively decent joint well it's supposed to be, you would think he would've initially brought them on a bread plate or some sort of dish/ramekin as I asked him to initially. Next food. We order the mac & cheese as our waiter strongly recommends it. I thought it was not very good. I sent it back. The sauce had broke meaning that I did not come out as a rich creamy sauce it was basically penne pasta swimming in bath of oil. And again this is a small yet large thing.. The flavor profiles of the mac & cheese were good. The chorizo added a nice saltiness to it the jalapenos a nice spice the penne pasta was cooked well. But yet again either the sauce had broke or there was way too much chorizo either way it was not edible. Then we order and the bruschetta trio. Again three great ideas but execution lacking. The beef and blue cheese bruschetta is a great idea and had fantastic flavor but there were pieces of meat on it that were literally not cooked. And by not cooked I mean raw. They were raw uncooked pieces of meat on our bruschetta. Again another good concept terrible execution.Then our prosciutto asparagus bruschetta. There was two little slivers of asparagus. Prosciutto had some rainbow sheen going  on with it so not sure how Quality it was. Then they use cream cheese as the spread on the bread. I mean at least use a brie cheese. What is this your rendition  of bagels and lox with prosciutto? If it is cool but I think you could make it better. From ingredients to presentationThen to top it off must ask the waiter 10 times for my girlfriend to get a sample of sangria to see if she likes it he never brought it the entire time he forgot multiple things. Not only bad customer service there but also lessening the sales for himself and the entire establishment. If she liked it who knows maybe she would've order two, I was driving that would've been $18 added to the bill. Then they were out completely of red Zinfandel by the glass. How can you be a wine Bar and not have a glass of red Zin??? And there is more but this review is getting long.. I got to say is that they've got the makings for a good menu but between the incompetence we experienced from the front of the house (this could be isolated to our specific waiter I don't know as this is our first time ) and the lack of execution in the back of the house .....with so many other choices out there not a place that I would return to. 2
I have had mixed experiences here. First up, both times the service was impeccable so that's a plus. I had lunch a couple of months back and it a great experience. Last night however it was a different story. We ate on a Sunday night so the menu was limited and the main attraction was the fresh fish display. We shared the Milos special starter of fired zucchini and it was lovely. We chose a small Branzino fish for main with Greek salad and potato sides. The sides were yummy but it's pretty hard to mess up a salad and potatoes so no surprise there. This fish was super disappointing. Not nearly fresh enough so not as delicious as it appeared. The bigger shock was the bill. To be honest we were moronic in not asking about the pricing of the fresh fish on display but it still came as an almighty fright. I expected it to be an expensive meal but I didn't expect to pay six times the average market price for a fish! I guess the moral of this review is know what your are going to be paying - ask for the price before they gut and cook it - and make sure its fresh that day for the price you'e paying. 3
I'm torn because they have such a great bar, but the service is terrible.  How do you not notice customers walking in when your standing right there chatting with friends?  15 minutes before service is why probably why your not earning many tips, just an fyi. 2
Three stars perfectly sums this place up... nothing memorable, but nothing bad either.  The atmosphere is surprisingly nice (very clean- always a plus) and the service is friendly.  Americanized Chinese with all the usual suspects on the menu.  General Tso's shrimp were okay but lacking in flavor, same goes for the soup and other dishes I tried.  Decent prices and food for a neighborhood joint, but I'd head to Chinatown for more authentic and flavorful Chinese.  I would not come back, but that is mostly because I live on the exact opposite end of town. 3
Experienced better but what more can I ask for! I went here after gym and got the peanut paradise with soy protein. I can't complain because it was really good. I also ordered a chicken caesar wrap which was okay. So you think that this place is healthy, ummm not at all. I went on their website at home to see how many calories was in the wrap and the protein shake I ordered, I immediately put the wrap in the refrigerator and only drank half of the smoothie. However, they do have shakes that are only 200 calories, which I usually get. The only good thing about this place is it's across the street from CSN so if you want something quick and on the go. They also have all kinds of different smoothies to choose from. If your hungry they have wraps, salads, sandwiches, and they even serve breakfast. 3
I came for happy hour and it has been my best experience on the Vegas strip. The food was good but what stood out was the service. The hostess was friendly, the supervisor went around to tables to see if people were happy with their meals but our server, Michael, was the BEST!!!! If you can request for him-DO IT. I've had enough bad restaurant experiences to really appreciate a good one in Vegas. I will definitely come back 5
Interesting atmosphere. OK food except the prime rib which was horrible. Will not be eating there again 2
This is a very late review but I like the fact that they're helping cats so I figured I should write my experience. :)Came here a year or 2 ago. It's a very small cafe since half the area is used for the cats, and with customer in there - it can get a little cramped. But still, the staffs are extremely nice - everyone was in a good mood (how can you not when there are fluffy kittens waiting to be pet).The menu was extremely reasonably priced. I got a cheese cake and hot chocolate. I'm pretty sure they import the cake from somewhere, but nonetheless it was good. The hot chocolate was made by the staffs and it was pretty good as well. I would definitely visit again and recommend any cat lovers to visit. 4
We bought our Lazy Boys recliners here in June 2014, the were ALL very helpful and friendly, we choose a custom fabric that had to be ordered. We were told 6 -8 weeks for custom orders and much to my surprise  they were done in 4 weeks! My husband and I also  enjoy the clearance room from which we bought a throw rug, the manager carried it out to the car for me! Love this place, I drop in often to see what's new. 5
Really not impressed. The sushi rolls were too big to eat properly; I almost choked a few times. The rolls also didn't hold up very well, and usually fell apart on the way to my mouth (which is maybe a good thing, considering my previous point). The fish in the rolls was also not cut properly - it was basically one giant chunk of salmon instead of easy-to-eat smaller pieces. Really not an enjoyable eating experience.Most annoyingly, the service was terrible. We were waited on briefly by our waitress, who we never saw again for the rest of the afternoon. At least, not stopping by our table - we saw her sitting a few tables over eating her lunch. Our drinks were empty for 30+ minutes and we were staring at her, but she never came to help us out.Given the amount of sushi places in the area, there has to be somewhere much better. 1
Great middle eastern food in a nice atmosphere.  Warm and friendly staff.  Tried the kebab sandwich with lentil soup. Loved both. The tahina and date dessert was also delicious.  Surprisingly good bar for middle eastern place.I'd go back if I were local. 5
Just stayed there 3 nights and love it! Non smoking building works great for people like me who don't enjoy getting secondhand smoke. Only thing not that convenient is that u have to go outside walk to Aria if u want to gamble. It's cold out there.... 4
If I could give no stars I would. I paid $5.34 for a burger that was so cold I would be skeptical to believe a rumor that it was ever warm. I brought it back, got my money back from a manager that didn't seem remotely abashed, as if it was normal routine at this Burger King on Bell Rd and 7th St. 1
What an awesome concept - healthy, affordable, and fast! I had the cobb salad with steak and seasonal blueberry rosemary lemonade, and my boyfriend had the BBQ ranch wrap with chicken on honey wheat tortilla and traditional lemonade. Everything was fresh and delicious, and the portions were big (my salad was dinner last night and lunch today). This is a much needed option for take-out after work, and they open early for a protein-packed breakfast and picking up lunch on the way to work. We'll be back often! 5
I've been to the Broadway Cheesecake on President Kennedy so I guess this review only applies to that location. Anyway, what I like about BC is that they offer mini cupcake versions of their cheesecake, so it's smaller than a slice, which is sometimes too heavy. I had the strawberry white chocolate cheesecake, and well, it tasted like cheesecake. It wasn't GREAT by any means, but tasted pretty average. Next time I come, I'm definitely giving their food a try- the menu looks pretty appetizing!The staff were super friendly and McGill students get 10% with their student cards! 3
My first time using an airbrush studio and I loved it!! Book with Harley. She is so cute and nice. Easy experience. The tan looks great and for first timers it was only $20! I will be booking with her again :) 5
I have been looking for a used 750. I have searched and searched. My name must be at every dealer in Vegas. A few of them have reached out to be with a car they found but It had so many miles. I am searching but im not desperate, I still want and good running car, in good condition. One of the last dealers I stoped by was Desert BMW. Within one week Desert had reached back out to me and had a car on their lot. I went down the same day and they pulled off what looked like the impossible. Good job guys and keep up the great work. 4
Family fun!  Located conveniently close to my neighborhood.  There is no better place to spend the summertime in Las Vegas than in water.  My 4 1/2 year old daughter loves the kid area,  and all the smaller slides,  but is tall enough to ride on a lot of the bigger slides as well.  The best part is the Lazy River,  Wave Pool, and sunshine. 5
Used to be a big fan until they cut down taxpayer trees. Food and drinks still good, but respect is out the window.  I wish them well, but lost my business. #phxfail 2
Great snacks, friendly staff, and the best caramel corn on the planet!  For some reason yelp thinks my review is too short and simple, but there really isn't much else to say other than the local and natural ingredients. 5
I honestly like Spring Rolls, but the service at this establishment was kind of poor. I went to the location at the Fairview Mall to catch up with friends and try the "All You Can Eat" option which sounded pretty cool. Our waiter was nice...at first. He told us about the $25 buffet style dinner (my friend and I had never had that before, our other friend had tried it) and we all got that. FAIR WARNING: If you go with a group EVERYONE has to pick either all you can eat or ordering dishes. Anyways, food started rolling out and honestly it was a GREAT experience! You can literally try anything on the menu as long as you finish it and everything is portion controlled so you have room to eat more. Here's where things went a little left. I have a super fast metabolism so I get full fairly quickly but I obviously wanted to get my money's worth. After every plate I would take 5-10 minutes to digest before ordering again, obviously not trying to waste by ordering too much. About an hour in, my group wasn't getting served as much and we were waiting up to twenty minutes to be served. The waiter seemed annoyed when taking our orders and was clearly avoiding our table. It bothered me because he knew two of us were new to the restaurant and first impression are so important. Anyways, we finally get desert and they have these bite sized brownies that I really liked. Again, fast metabolism so I wasn't trying to eat too much too fast. When I ordered a second round of brownies, I noticed they were basically thrown on the plate. Even though they were cube shaped they had an obvious top side and he clearly wasn't worried about presentation when he sent them to our table. This was really passive aggressive behaviour on his part and by then, my group was ready to go. We tipped an okay amount given the service and he seemed annoyed that we didn't give that much. I thought that was pretty extra, considering he avoided our table so much. So yeah, service sucked but I enjoyed the food and didn't get sick (I also have a super sensitive stomach) so I would definitely return and have ordered from Spring Rolls since then! 3
We were seated at the worst table this location has which is right in front of the kitchen door.  It was like a strobe light shining on our table as the wait staff ventured in and out of the kitchen. The food was served hot but was just ok in terms of flavor. The lasagna had to be the thinnest I have ever eaten and was just one layer thick.  Service was ok but nothing special. Don't envision going here again 2
I've been coming here for over four years now for my hair cuts. Jenny is the only person that I trust with my hair. You can show her a picture or describe to her what you want for you hair and she'll do it ten times better. Jenny is your go to hair stylist.I've never gotten a manicure or a pedicure here, but the place is very sanitary and they're very proper when disposing and cleaning the mani and pedi area. The whole staff is very nice and so caring of everyone who walks through their door. 5
Do not go for dim sum, I tried custurd bun, beef tribe, curry squid, shimp dumpings, meh, nothing tasted right. On the other hand, their sushi was decent, I especially liked their tempura, it was very crunchy and overly greasy. Rolls and sushi was your normal AYCE quality, no suprises. I will go again for AYCE sushi. 3
I purchased two new tires from this location and the store manager, Shannon (male), recommended I purchase 4 new tires because all of them were "equally"warn out. The previous week, I had an oil change at goodyear and had my tires inspected and they recommended only changing the back tires. Additionally, i received a second opinion from the discount tire near metrocenter (where I purchased brand new tires in June 2014) and they said the same thing. So I took my car to discount tire on 15th ave and bell because they were the only ones that had the type of tires I needed  (or else id of gone to metrocenter) and Shannon agressively pushed to have all 4 tires changed. When i said i wasnt interested in having all 4 replaced he looked rather vexed. After I went back in to pick up my car keys after the rear tires were installed, i approached Shannon cashier station and i ask for my keys and he literally just walked right past me and didnt even acknowledge I was there. I stood there patiently waiting and after 10 mins of just standing there like an idiot someone else brought over my keys. I didnt like the low level of service at this location and Shannon should brush up on his customer service skills which is sad to say because he's the store manager. From now on, Ill stick to the metrocenter location. At least there they acknowledge your existence. 1
Time: Two weeks ago.Setting: BackyardScenario:  Ahh, my toe!  Man I must a have a bigass splinter in here or something.  I inspect the toe and find nothing but a little blood.  I limp around the back yard for 5 more minutes.  Still hurting.  I remove flip flop and inspect.  Ohhhh I seeee, a mofoin roofing nail has fully penetrated my flip flop ...wonder how that got into my yard and subsequently into my toe.  THANKS  First Quality.Conclusion:  You can keep the three stars 'cause my roof did come out nice.  My toe says piss off. 3
Herd so many good thing's about this place ,and that they had lots of celiac options. The place looks nice ,and when you arrive and look to your right you see a giant menu. At the bottom of the menu is says "all items can be made gluten free". Holy hell was I so excited to see this . My husband says he would like a gluten free poutine the lady who was not taking our order but another lady says "there is no such thing" . Alright then he was hoping we could share . I was confused since they advertise that everything can be done gluten free on the menu in giant letters. Then I ask if they have gluten free buns for smokies the one girl says yes . Then we start ringing it in , the girl who said "no such thing" then says they do not have gluten free hotdog buns . They will put it on a burger bun . At this point there are people behind me so I just say fine .  When we get our food the smokie is nothing special . I could have bought a better one from the grocery store and there was just so much bun I didn't finish the thing . Things to take away from this . Train your staff better . Make sure your staff actually knows your inventory , maybe have a management member on at night to handle staff. So they don't come off as rude . Also don't say everything on the menu can be gluten free if that's not true . There are better places to get burgers I won't be coming back . 1
I really wanted to give this place 4 stars because the atmosphere was great and the clam chowder was delicious. However, my girlfriend and I waited up front for at least 5 minutes while waiting to be seated and the food was a little over priced. Our waitress was very friendly and we enjoyed our visit. I'm guessing its worth stopping in during the busy lunch/dinner hours, but in between (when we came 3-4pm) is not the ideal time for service. 3
Come here to try the ramen. Ramen are good but service is not that great. Maybe if the server is more nicer I'll come back 2
Being a Chicago pizza fan Amore was the first pizzeria I checked for Chicago pizza.For me true Chicago Pizza is Giodrano's, Lou Malnati's and Gino's East. It is difficult to find true Chicago pizza outside of Chicago. Amore does a good job with their pizza though, especially if you can't travel all the way to Chicago!The stuffed pizza is huge and heavy. The outer crust is about 2.5 inches thick (or should I say tall), nice and crispy, the bottom crust is relatively thin and chewy but manages to hold all the ingredients. There's plenty of cheese and all the other toppings tasted fresh. Their sausage is particularly good, having a nice sweet taste of fennel. The sauce has a nice chunky texture and balances sweetness and tanginess pretty well. The pizza is greasy, at least if it has sausage (due to the huge size and amount of toppings) but also very satisfying, believe me if you are hungry and think you can easily eat a normal 14" pizza, you'll probably only be able to eat half of the 14" Amore pie.Note if you order a stuffed pizza to eat in or take out, the pie takes 45 mins to cook.The indoors sitting area is decorated with all sorts of pictures and memorabilia from Chicago, overall pretty clean and good service.If you want Chicago pizza in Las Vegas, Amore is probably the only real choice (along with Rosati's maybe, and I'd say Pietown but it's closed for now). Their pizza is big, has plenty of toppings and is very satisfying. It's the next best thing if you can't travel all the way to Chicago. 5
Financing department and service department are the two most dishonest and disappointing departments ever.  Here's the story...........  I bought a 2009 Maxima from them in December.  I got what I wanted, traded my truck that was falling apart for a newer, nicer used car from Horne Kia.  I went in there with a loan from my bank already approved so I didn't need their financing.  I went in there with the loan approval number and was happy when they told me everything was good and they would get the information about my new car to the bank so they could complete the loan.  They didn't.  They opened a new loan with my bank so that they could make some money off the new loan that they started.  Now, this normally wouldn't be that big of a deal, aside from it causing my credit to be run again, but they lied about it to me, which is unacceptable.So, with the purchase of my new, used car, I get a free oil change when it's due.  This brings me to this last Saturday, when I brought it in for it's first oil change.  I made an appointment for 9:30AM on Saturday to do a basic oil change.  My wife and I drop it off and they tell us it will take and hour and a half to an hour and 45 minutes.  No problem since they seemed rather busy, we'll go get some breakfast.  So it's after 12:30 and still no call, I figure they may have forgotten to call us and we just head back there since it's been three hours.  Much our dismay, we get there and it's still in the same spot it was in when we left.  I go into the office, which is now virtually empty, and speak with the service advisor I dealt with earlier.  He tells me that they had to go get an oil filter from a parts store since it was a Nissan they were working on and they were a Kia dealership.  Well, that makes sense if I hadn't made an appointment 8 days earlier and they weren't expecting me.  But here's the real kicker; a 2009 Maxima takes the exact same oil filter as virtually every Kia from 2008 and before, as well as some 2010 Kia's.Apparently this service advisor thought I wouldn't know this, as most people wouldn't, I'm sure.  When I asked him again what part it was they had to go get from a parts store, giving him the chance to be honest with me, he lied again.  Therefore, I presented him with this information and he instantly turned quite sheepish, not knowing what to say.  I proceeded to tell him that all we wanted was some honesty and they obviously don't deliver that at this dealership.  My wife and I walked away and he had nothing to say.Case and point: NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH THESE PEOPLE. 1
I'm torn. I came here a few years back and I felt like Pittsburgh royalty. It was great, clean, and quick service. Then I came back a few days ago and the waiter was so sloppy; he was covered in stains. He looked like he just wrapped up his shift at Long John Silvers. I ordered the same cherry and bourbon reduction Chilean sea bass dish I ate years ago, but this time they made the rice cheesy and piled on Granny Smith apples. First rule of fish - you don't have cheese with fish. And come on with the apples and cherries piled over a white fish, the tart level was off the charts. I will say that the fish was cooked perfect so that was a plus. And I do like their Sunday brunch. But overall, the quality now does not reflect the hefty price. The building is a Pittsburgh gem, but sadly I think it's nothing more than a tourist trap now. 2
You should consider giving your employees a raise. Then they won't have to take change out of customers consoles. 1
Pizza and meatball sandwich is delicious, portions are big, good service. Now my go to spot if I want a pie. 5
New private practice however the dentist originally practiced in fountain family office.Dr Ramsey conservative and caring in his approach. He is genuine and approachable towards All of his patients.I followed him to his new practice when I "uncovered" he left. If you want quality, affordability and desire to keep your teeth looking the absolute best see Dr Ramsey.Past, present and future patient unless he retires :( 4
Nice place to go. Location was convenient and clean, cars were prepped and easy to access. The salesmen seemed eager to talk but very pushy. He kept tying to close before I was ready but answered most of my questions.  Price ended up to be reasonable. It's just annoying because he begged for a great review (which I gave), and he now calls my cell 3x per month asking for referrals. I work in sales and this process with riverview just seemed unorganized. 3
My friends and I came here before a show for dinner. We often go to Barrio Coreano, which to my understanding is under the same umbrella of restaurants as El Catrin, and we absolutely adore the place. To be honest, we were surprisingly disappointed by the food. We ordered one of the pork tacos, the mushroom tacos, and the shrimp and lobster tacos. The seafood one was probably the worst one of the three. The shrimp was flavourless and just covered in cheap chipotle mayo. The mushroom and the pork tacos were greasy but in comparison to the other one they were fine. At the end of the meal, the server did take off the shrimp and lobster tacos which is great service on their part. We really appreciated that.The patio and restaurant interior are gorgeous. Too bad we didn't have the food to enjoy it with! 2
Visited Egg Works this morning with my boyfriend and had great service from Amanda! Awesomeness. .. Breakfast was excellent. We definitely will be returning. 4
Visited Big Daddy's for dinner tonight and I originally wanted the crabfish broil, as advised on Yelp, I asked if they had it but they didn't so I was opted to choose something else. So I ordered the oyster po boy appetizer and Big Daddy's Mixed Platter as the main course. With a price of $35 i was severely underwhelmed by the size of the plate I received. Your standard dinner plate side, the half lobster was smaller than expected and the fish was lacking in flavour, there were only 2 scallops, and 3 fried shrimps with a side of cauliflower and carrots. The Po boy appetizer was pretty good but overall the entire experience was a bit lacking. There was barely anyone in the restaurant yet our server was still slow at times. We also couldn't sit in the dining area because it was closed... Service 3/5Taste 3/5Value 2.5/5 3
We stopped at Peachtree for a glass of wine and appetizers. The place was comfortable. Unfortunately though not only was the bartender cranky but he made us feel like we were a bother to him. Then we order sweet potato chips which were $9. The chips were burnt and was about one cup total. So overpriced and bad quality.  Couldn't recommend this place to anyone. 2
Overall a fun experience but short lived.Of all of the machine gun-rental gun ranges I researched in Las Vegas for my boys bachelor party, this was one of the few that actually responded to my emails and had one of the lowest priced party package machine gun rentals.My buddies and I went for the $110 Party package which comes with one magazine each person for 4 machine guns + two shots of the 50 caliber Desert Eagle. The regular price is about double this but with two magazines instead of 1 but I figure this would be good enough since we were on a budget.Michael is helpful some has lots of crude and sometimes rude jokes. I like the older gentleman who helped us. He was a lot more professional.The day we went, their AK-47 was not available. Darn, cause that was the one gun most of us wanted to shoot. Instead we shot the grease gun, MP5, UZI, and a Tech 9. All were fun especially the grease gun.When we left, a group of bachelorettes came in to shoot the machine guns.This place is overall very professional even though it's all dudes. The ladies that came in after us looked like they got treated professionally. They are very fast and efficient but we didn't feel rushed. I even took pictures and videos.The other place I would consider going to as a result of my research is Discount Firearms but they are a little more expensive. The Gun Store did not respond to my emails and when I called, was no help at all.The cons about this place is that there is no SAW. Also which is the same with all the other Vegas gun ranges I found is that you can't just rent a handgun for a day and just pay for bullets for some rec shooting. You have to rent "packages" that come with a limited amount of bullets such as 40 rounds. 4
I have been a loyal customer since 1999. Makes me sad to right a bad review but since high schools closed their campuses Steves place has deteriorated tremendously. I went in as usual for lunch ordered my sub and returned to work with the wrong sandwich. I ate it upset but so hungry after picking off the dreadful items. I called spoke with a nice man who said come in I will write ur name down. I did and 4 people playing around in the back told me I need to speak with owner which I said no problem and their response was he is out of town. They all thought it was funny and I was so upset. If Steve's crazy sub ever goes out of business it will be because of the horrible customer service from his teenage and one grown man who seem to not care if customers ever comeback. Steve please read this and several others I have read that your staff needs to go. I hope someday I will be treated as a customer and maybe even get the sub I paid for. 2
Came in the middle of the day to do a routine screening for a new job. When I showed up, there was just one other person in the waiting room. 30 minutes later sitting in the waiting room, the person before me is still here, and I still haven't been allowed to go in to pee in the cup. What does it take to hand over the cup and stick the label on it?  Oh, and she tells me that if I leave, it's an automatic fail. How many hours will I be here waiting?Also overheard receptionist being rude to a customer on the phone as I walked up... Finally got called back there.  No other patients were in the back of the clinic, so I don't know what the hold up was, and there were a couple of techs milling around. The lady that actually handed me the cup to pee in was nice though. 2
Took my car in for brake service. Service was quick, honest and straightforward. Pretty much all I can ask for in a go-to mechanic. Really solid experience, will be back. 4
I had the pleasure of eating at The County General this Sunday, after reading a lot of the write ups about this place in Toronto publications, I was excited to eat here.I arrived with my girlfriend at around 730pm and was told there would be a 15 minute wait for a table. I happily obliged to dine at the bar. The decor and ambiance of the bar is warm and welcoming. I especially liked the liberal use of wood throughout the place.The menu is small. I ordered some kimchi and a wedge salad to start. The kimchi was nice and spicy and the wedge salad was well prepared. I also had the County Drive In--a maker's mark/cream soda concoction that was refreshing.We ordered the White Bean Meat Ball and Chicken Thigh Sandwich as entrees. The Chicken thigh sandwich was out of this world. The buttermilk battered crust was so crispy and had a real unique friend taste to it. The avocado cutney was also very fresh and limey--just the way I like it. The bun was also fantastic. Overall, its a very well-crafted sandwich and all the flavors were balanced. The same goes for the White Bean Meatball--served open face on a piece of crusty bread. My girlfriend couldn't believe something so delicious could be made without meat.Overall, this is a nice addition to the neighborhood and I wish them great success. I hope that they switch up the menu more often because I definitely like to see what else they can put out. 5
I feel betrayed.  My second visit to Harlem Underground was a disaster, and I'd been talking it up to my dinner companion for weeks.  I actually feel embarrassed.  At first I thought maybe I'd just ordered wrong, but my friend had what I had on my first visit, fried chicken with waffles--the house specialty, and was distinctly unimpressed.  I had the turkey meatloaf, feeling in the mood for something less egregiously unhealthy than fried chicken, and it was terrible.  Dry and bland and sort of chewy.  It was improved by a nice though small side of steamed spinach with a slightly sweet (maple syrupy?), buttery sauce, but that wasn't enough to rescue it.  We both had a side of mac and cheese, me because they were out of sweet potato fries (odd, since earlier that afternoon I bought sweet potatoes at the grocery across the street).  It was not totally awful but it tasted like it had been sitting around for a while.Two things rescued it from one star: the service and the red velvet cake, the latter of which I doubt was made anywhere near the premises and even a bit dry, but nonetheless authentic and delicious.  Thank you Liam, our charming and on the ball server.  I hope the lackluster food doesn't screw you out of the tips you deserve.I'm eager to see what other reviewers have to say, because clearly my experiences are wildly inconsistent. 2
awesome looking theatre!  I love the way it's laid out.  We went to watch a "Lead and Succeed" business seminar and it was cool.  Food is really overpriced though. 4
I've been to a fair share of buffets, for brunch, lunch and dinner. And I have to say, there's no beating their price. I mean, come on - $6.99 for a dinner buffet and that included a fountain drink. At least that's what it was when we went earlier this week. I don't know how long they've had that price going or for how long that price will be around for. The place looked okay although we sat at a table that was directly underneath a light fixture that kept turning on and off sporadically throughout our dinner. There really wasn't anything super special about the place, aside from the price. The food was all right. Some things were too salty, and that's something since I when I went, I was PMSy, wanting that salt lol. I didn't try any of their sushi or noodles so I can't comment on that. Their dim sum was decent and so was their crawfish. Overall, decent. Nothing too exciting, their selection was okay, but there are other places with more. Maybe it's better on the weekend. It's worth trying for the price. 3
BEWARE OF THE BAIT & SWITCH!!!!!  I was shopping for the Mazda 3 and was shopping many dealers and everyone offered me the same price for my trade except Berge, they were $2,500 low and wouldn't budge. They did offer me a "very agressive price" on the new Mazda so I called their bluff I said i'll buy your car at the "very agressive price" and i'll keep my other car, after a pause on the phone the salesman Tom said he'd have to check about possibly some better financing than I already had, about 30 minutes later one of the many sales managers called me and said they made an "honest mistake with their price" and the new price would be $2,500 more than originally quoted... coincidence?  I think not.  Needless to say I moved on and purchased a Toyota which is probably a better car in the long run.If dealers would just be honest they would have alot better reputation.  They had their offer on the table for over a week and nobody noticed the numbers weren't right.....please 2
I emailed and called several places on a Sunday night and 10 minutes later I get an email from Dave the owner. The next day he was there to look at our dryer and all it needed was a bit of TLC and good as new. While Dave was there he looked at the washer and gave great instructions on using it. Then charged way less than quoted. Dave you're the best! 5
I have been eating PF Chang's forever, well at lest the 16 years. Food was great here like normal, but the service sucks Planet Hollywood PF  :-(. Wish I would have said something to the manager but they were to busy :-( oh well. What is funny is we order a specialty drink and it wasn't delivered until after dinner wasn't done. 3
Love Ru's the only place I go for sushi! Great food, service, and prices. Always clean and fresh. Been going there for over 10 years and it still is my #1 go to for great sushi! Everyone I have introduced to the place to is now a huge Ru's fan!! Highly recommend! 5
I love this company! For years I paid for baseboard sprayers, that might as well have been spraying water .. & probably were! Finally! Real pest control! No bugs in my home! My garage & outdoors have white sticky traps & keeps everything where it should be!Aaron, my tech is very courteous, concerned & professional! Always calls a day ahead to remind me & he is always on time! No complaints here! 5
This place has good food. Nice and clean. However......with an exception of a few lovely  waitresses and cocktail servers, the majority were a little on the ILL TEMPERED side. One shoved past my company, wasn't nice and seemed to have a bit of a nasty a RBF. Another tossed out wings down after saying, "hey, is this your food?" Otherwise, it was great. 2
Good service Ron is really helpful! The staff are friendly. Helped us to print out flyers on time. Life saver, it is cheaper than the convention center. I recommend it ! 5
The food is very greasy, almost disgusting. I was so hungry and yet still could not finish my food because it tasted so bad. Don't eat here unless you stay in the hotel and absolutely need food asap. 2
Make the appointment there accessible great hours fast efficient and handled well as I direct my needs comfortable and satisfaction 4
When you come here, stick to what matters and don't deviate.The brisket and ribs are fantastic.The pork is very good.The chicken is not my favoriteThe sides are pretty good overall - Mac n' Cheese is very good.Hush puppies are excellent. 4
Love the decor, service and the ribs are probably the best in Montreal. 5
This has to be the worst home depot location for customer service tried to back gal of paint that they messed the color and they would not return it so now I am out $30 2
Food was good (my wife had the bleu cheese burger and I had the  Margherita pizza), service was prompt and friendly. Noise level too high to have any conversation. Might try it again but not on a Friday night. 3
Not a very well taken care of facility several games not working and a funny smell.  We waited an hour to get our entire party of 8 into a laser tag game. While waiting we were victim to 2 of the arcade games not working. The employees were all very helpful, that's the only reason I'm giving them 2 stars. So back to laser tag, when we purchased our tickets for the game, there were only 2 others sold. When it was time for the game we lined up but the game was oversold! They first offered an additional free game, in 2.5 hours! We were not willing to wait that long, so they gave us free drinks and a voucher to come back again.The laser tag employees were so apologetic and kind, again the only reason  I'm giving 2 stars. I have to give an update... Before we left they gave us 100% refund and additional free laser tag vouchers. Good customer service 3
They are usually super busy on weeknights. I was put on the waiting list the first time i went there with my friends (4 in total), and they are kind enough to give you a call when they have space for you. But by the time they called, it's already been more than 30 minutes. The place is small with canteen style seating arrangement - means it's difficult to sit in groups. The servers are very attentive and friendly. I ordered the spicy ramen (comes with 4 different spicy leve) with xo sauce (yum!). You can also choose the texture of your ramen (hard, medium and soft). All the ramens (except vegetarian) comes with pork,chicken and HUGE chunk of cabbage) They also have 2 vegetarian options.The food came very quickly after I placed my order. I am not too crazy about the ramen noodle, maybe I should try hard ramen noodle next time. The broth is thick and super drinkable. I am not too sure about having a mixed of pork and chicken bits in my ramen. They feel like fillers to the ramen just to make it looks like there's a lot of ingredients in it, which I think is unnecessary. Dislike the huge chuck of cabbages in there, which is way bigger than the pork and chicken is you managed to fish out some. They have those loyalty reward card that allows you to collect stamps for every ramen you eat there. I am not too sure if I will ever be able to get a bowl of free ramen from them especially since there's so many other ramen places around the area. 3
ever heard of organic nails? they are awesome!!! lil pricey but ill take it 4
We just moved to Mesa and were happy to hear about this place. We love Mexican food.  We were looking forward to a green chile burro enchilada style.  The meat in the burrito tasted like canned meat and was gravy like.  The rice and beans tasted like canned food too.  Not authentic at all.  We did not finish our food but ate a lot of chips and salsa which weren't bad.  Finished our drinks and left.   I am not sure why everyone raves about this place..... They must not know good mexican food.  We won't be back. 1
Service was not great what so ever. Food was good but it was taking a long time for the steaks to come out. Whenever we would " request " a specific type it would never come out, and we would have to ask 3-4 times until it eventually came out. 2
Meh, it's OK. The world famous salad is just OK. Service is good though. 3
Hubby had $11.50 Berry French Toast with White Peach Palmer tea ($3.50) and I had Small Chicken Brick. Both choices were very good. Nothing particularly memorable otherwise. 3
Very nice salon!! I went here for the first time this weekend and they were so friendly and they answered all my questions! I had a full set white tip done for only $25 dollars and I just paid $5 more for the gel overcoat! :) My nails are perfection!! Not to big for my nailbeds and just perfectly done! I told the lady exactly what I wanted and she did exactly as I asked!!! Salon was very clean and this will be my nail salon from now on!!! 5 stars all the way!! :):):):) 5
This restaurant has excellent food, great music and good service. It would be better if the venue was bigger but I guess the layout makes it trendy and unique. 4
I saw this show back in september of 2011; and while the clarion casino needs a better parking lot, and the inside of the casino has a odd odor that lingers you should see the Illusions by Jan Rouven.Jan Rouven is much better than that all full of himself cris angel. Whatever hotel he may perform at; see the show as you will like it. 4
Came here for my b-day with hubby.  Loved the salad bar !  I agree with the other reviews you must be a meat lover to fully enjoy it.    I was so stuff I did not get a chance to try the flank steak or top sirloin.   I do agree with the other posts the swordfish was too dry and salmon was good.  I usually like my red meats medium but I found out they were to well done.  I  ordered it medium rare instead.  I also had the passion fruit chocolate mousse for dessert.  It was delicious very much different tasting. Never had anything like that before.  Overall the place was really nice and service was very good.. Next visit,  I  will just order the salad bar and fish instead. 3
Dry Cleaning Cost: Fall Coat - $15, Tuxedo Shirt - $5, Sport Coat - $8.   I expected it to be high but this is egregious.   You pay when you pick up your stuff and now I see why. 1
YUMMY! Had dinner here our first night, then breakfast the next morning, and breakfast again the next morning. The wait staff is awesome! The GM indicated they had a re-do about 3 months back and everything is made from scratch, even the jams. Back to the original recipes. Great food at a great value! ENJOY! 5
I tried placing a take-out order over the phone and kept getting a busy signal for over a half hour so decided to just go there to see what all the fuss was about.  They are in a small location in the same strip mall as the new Frys store. Arrived at 7pm on a Saturday and the place was packed with 15+ people waiting to pickup their takeout orders. We went right up to the counter and told the gentleman that we had a rather large order (feeding 10 hungry adults) and he told us the estimated wait time would be 35 minutes. After placing our order he revised the amount of time to 45 minutes.We returned and waited another 15 minutes and the place was still packed (keep in mind that they do not offer table service). The wait was well worth it as all of the food was excellent with generous portions and fresh ingredients.  Everyone was very pleased with everything we ordered from the crunchy egg rolls to the General Tso's chicken.  The consensus is that we will be ordering out from My House a lot more in the near future as even though we ordered numerous dishes, their menu is very extensive. Good advice is to give them 45-60 minutes to complete your order as they seem to be overwhelmed with return satisfied customers. 5
Yelp needs a no star. Because this is what  these people deserve. Headed back to Chicago and what a surprise! My flight is delayed. Just like it was on the way to Vegas. Lady at the counter here was VERY rude and she started complaining to her co-worker about taking her Pen. Talk about being professional in front of customers. Spirit is definitely an airline I will not ever fly. Sorry Southwest. I will be back soon. 1
The worst food I had in a while seriously The " carne asada " on the grill was chopped Into itty-bitty pieces that had a non meatFunky taste  and more of the same with The chicken. This place did  have a long line At 4pm on a Monday but I suspect this will end in a couple of months after people see for themselves that it's place is not even ok.Oh yea the men's bathroom was dirty also the main floor was dirty as well it looked like  place lacked a manager . 1
I have gone through the drive through several times and I have always been greeted with the friendliest staff I have ever experienced at a fast food restaurant.  Combine that with the amazing food, this restaurant is now my favorite burger place. 5
With ribs, wings, coleslaw, beans, bread, onion ring it is such a good deal for under $30 in a friendly environment restaurant!!!  Ribs are excellent tasting, we love it!!!  Definitely, we go back and try their sandwiches!Restaurant are very clean and tidy even washroom!!! 4
A few days ago I purchased two vegetable egg rolls to go at a dollar each. They were very tiny compared to other places I would go to. I didn't think they were worth a dollar. 2
The owner is very friendly and attentive. The food is good. Some items seem overpriced. Also, charging for salsa is as irritating as a hamburger joint charging for ketchup when you order fries. 3
They are still closed!!!  This was a must do on my vacation. When I called, they  were supposed to be opened by now. Very dissapointed. 1
Two words: crunchy rice. I'm sorry, but for $15 a roll the rice shouldn't be crunchy, and it should stick together enough to get the piece to your mouth. Nigiri wasn't helped by the rice either. Fish quality seemed fine, but the art is in the rice and this was a failure on the level of grocery store sushi. I would suggest spending your $60-$75 on some quality ingredients and cooking for yourself. 2
Liked the Caesar salad with fresh anchovy, and the thin crust pizzas were OK, but considering this is such a well-known spot, we expected much better food. Several things lacked salt or just overall flavor, such as the fettuccini and the shortrib w/ gnocci. 3
I like Penny's Place. I believe it's a old school staple in Mint Hill and has been around forever. I'm sure it lives on it's regulars that come in for breakfast and lunch each day - some older men from around town.  From the outside, it looks like it would be very darke, since there aren't really any windows, but it's well lit inside. They have old tin ads and signs posted all over the walls. Pretty quaint. The prices are dirt cheap - literally you can get breakfast or lunch for under $5, but the portions are small and the menu isn't very creative. If you don't want to spend much and have a few extra minutes to spare, this is a good alternative to fast food. I don't think I'd take my kids there, though I'm sure they'd enjoy the signs. 3
I would give them no stars if I could. My son and husband just came home with uneven hair. Please don't go here if you need a decent haircut. I could do a better job, which isn't saying much. This is not the first bad haircut we have received here, but this is the absolute worst. Christina was the only one I would recommend and we haven't seen her lately so I'm not sure she's still there. Don't waste your money, these women have not been to school. 1
Great design (probably one of the most interesting restaurant I've been in a while), very interesting menu, but not all the dishes were a home run. SALT & PEPPER CALAMARI - perfect - home runTUNA CONSERVA - pretty tasteless - needed helpBRAISED PORK SHOULDER - Was very good, but not exceptionalFRIED BANANA SPLIT - hmmmmmm....interesting, maybe deserves another tryFriends had Sushi and Miso Cod....not really goodAnd a very disinterested service didn't help the experience....So I would try it again. Maybe it was just a bad night. 3
My husband and I stayed 10/2 - 10/7. We had such high hopes... upon checking into our first room, we notice a nasty stench of sewer. I sprayed the room, thinking it would pass. After a long day of traveling we opted for a quick nap. I puled back the sheets, only to find mold on the bottom sheet. I spotted housekeeping in the hallway and asked for a new set of sheets, she obliged and handed them over to me. I changed the sheets and went to lay down, something on the headboard catches my eye... YUCK! There is a substance, what appears to be dried semen going down the head board. My husband and I packed up our stuff and headed down the the front desk to ask for a new room. I spoke to a manager, and told him what we had found. He was extremely apologetic and moved us to a "premium room". We trek to our new room. A quick look over of the headboard, things are looking better. We decide to relax in the sitting room for a bit before heading out to lunch. My husband on the chaise lounge, myself on the couch was some news. What I originally thought to be a scuff mark on the wall in the sitting room, RIGHT ABOVE my shoulder, turns out to be blood. Yes, someone decided to take their blood covered fingers (3 to be exact) and wipe them across the wall just above the couch, and below the painting. I jump up and hop in the shower, unsure if I have some random strangers blood on my back. GROSS! I march back down to the front desk after showering, and wait my turn in line as to not cause a scene. I discreetly explain to the clerk my issue, I inform her we have no desire to move rooms again and would appreciate her sending someone up to clean the wall. My husband and I spent about an hour outside of the room, and came back to find it cleaned. Other than the nasty bodily fluids on the head board and the wall, I do have to say the room was nicely appointed, the bed and pillows were extremely comfortable, the black out drapes very efficient. I must also add this was probably one of the quietest rooms I have ever stayed in, we travel a lot, this requires several hotel stays a month and we loved the shampoo, conditioner and body wash in the shower. 2
This place is just OK. I think it suffers from the "too many items from too many cuisines" syndrome. A simpler menu would be nice. Atmosphere is so so. 3
Late night fun with buy one get one free sake. Sushi is good fun place to be plus it's open late so that's a real plus 4
We had heard so much about Giada. The only five stars this restaurant gets is for the service staff starring Rocco. Everything was underwhelming. We had the veal and chicken, just ok. Best part of the meal was the bacon wrapped dates. Would not return. 3
The best thing about Liquid Planet in Cleveland Hts is the big tank of water and free water cups. Their location (Cedar-Fairmount District) is a fashionable part of town home to students, doctors and professors.$6 for a toasted pita isn't bad, but it's not exactly cheap fare either. It's a good place to get smoothies in Cleveland, I'd say. Located across the street from Aladdin's, Bruegger's Bagels and Starbucks, they have a lot of competition for light lunchy-food, but they seem to be doing a decent business.I can't help but wonder if they hire people to work their based on their looks; because the ladies behind the counter are all young and conventionally pretty. (That's not really something I'm cool with, as everyone deserves an equal shot at a job no matter what they look like, but it could be a fluke so I won't make any accusations.)Oh, they have free Wi-Fi, by the way! Pictures as always on the blog: (http://whatsincleveland.blogspot.com/2011/07/liquid-planet-cleveland-heights.html) 3
I can never find anywhere to sit at this place - and getting a parking spot takes a bit of luck, too! Outlets are few & far between which makes the Lazy Loaf a no-go for studying (for me, anyway.) Service is (with very few exceptions) just brutal - I worked in coffee shops for years and years, and I know the vibe that most of these employees are giving off - burnt out, tired of repetition, and not given enough incentive or praise to care. There doesn't seem to be much in place in regards to an efficient system of operation... drink orders are scribbled down on a scrap piece of paper, and I'll never forget the time I ordered a latte and sat waiting for 15 minutes while nobody touched the espresso machine. It was sooooo awkward, although they were very apologetic once they realized they had immediately forgotten.Beyond that, the food is AMAZING! Delicious soups & sandwiches, and one of the best baked goods displays I've seen (the chocolate explosion cake is my absolute nemesis, but I have also been seduced by the nanaimo bars more than once as well as  the carrot cake loaf... sigh).Also, lots of children every time I've gone in.  Lots and lots of children. 3
I'll give one star for the salad which was good, both our steaks were so gristly and fat there was no way we could chew them The very condescending waitress proceeded to tell us how they had to have fat to give them flavor, as if we had never had steak before. They were $30 steaks, at least an apology from the manager would have been nice. Will never go near the place again and will certainly tell everyone we know to avoid it. We are still seething over the treatment! 1
BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!! To all parents: if you are buying a computer like I did for my college student, you might be buying a factory defect. I bought a top of the line computer for my daughter who goes to UNR and after 6 weeks it stopped working. The geeks squad cannot fix a laptop since they don't have a "clean room" they have to send it out for repairs. it will take 3 weeks!!!!! So now I have to buy a new computer because best buy won't stand behind their products and just return it and give her a new one. I don't know about you but I would expect more than 6 weeks of use. Now, if you bought their e xtended warranty they will fix it?! Extortion or bribery? 1
damn fine! I was cold as hail in this place, and my fingers got nice and grubby, and the guy working was hella helpful, nice, and knowledgeable. cheap records! hipsters stay away! see you next year Resale! Hope you're still there!! 4
If you have been to Morton's and other pretentious steakhouses, you are in for a treat.  This place is very retro steakhouse, almost corny.  I love it. Steaks are great salads are build you own with ingredients delivered to the table.  The outside looks like a windowless bar but the inside is warm and inviting.  Is that Bogart in the corner with a martini? 4
I have passed this spot hundreds of times but being a creature of habit, I have never stopped to try, opting instead for Fenwick's (Oh! Fenwick's-- must write a review!)which is almost next door.  When I found a coupon in our Citipass book for a free sushi roll, I decided to give it a try.Unassuming atmosphere, which I appreciate.  Generally, when I dine, I am looking for a food experience, espeically in this price-point.  They have a very limited wine list, and a very limited beer selection, no cocktails!  Which, again, is all fine... who can't enjoy a Tsing Tao?We ordered a spicy tuna roll, a summer roll (special roll of the evening), and a crunchy roll.  My husband enjoyed all of them.  I, on the other hand, don't love spicy mayo on all of my rolls, so I enjoyed but did not love.  But, for the price, it is definitely worth a try.  I fear I have turned into a sushi snob :(Our service was fine.Tip-- Wear a sweater!  It was freezing in there! 3
I'm writing from South Florida and I am very satisfied with my service. My technician explained everything thoroughly and answered all my questions. Since the first treatment, I noticed the lack of ants on the outside of my house. 5
Kelly's cafe has the best breakfast in Brunswick.  The crepes are out of this world. 5
The Asian food was decent here for Las Vegas. This restaurant seemed to be tucked away in the corner of a mini-Asian shopping mall. For a Thursday, it wasn't too busy so for our party of 10 or so, it was easy to get a table. You can get authentic Vietnamese food and I hear the sandwiches are good. I haven't tried the Thai food, but I don't know how I feel about Vietnamese chefs preparing Thai so I'd steer away from that.I was just visiting out of town but the meal didn't seem all too pricey. Plates are big so I recommend sharing amongst others. Try it if you're sick of Vegas buffets! 3
I am torn, nay heartbroken with this place. I absolutely love their food however I absolutely hate the "everything is a la carte ordering," every server stares at you like a deer in the headlights if you stray from the menu in any way, and special orders definitely upset them. I hate it when the server refills my glass, touching the glass I drank from to the pop machine where other glasses that others drank from have touched. disgusting. They never come back to the table to check until you are almost done eating, and do not understand the "salads and appetizers come before the meal in america" concept. Their staff is not knowledgeable about their food or what drinks are available, our server was so confused about the beer selections, we skipped the beers, she lost herself some money there. she did not suggestively sell anything, if i was her boss she would be re trained or let go. She was offended by us and proceeded to talk s**t to one of her other tables about us and how "difficult" we were, because we asked questions? really? The table whom she engaged in conversation, were two servers from one of our other favorite restaurants, where we spend a lot of money on a weekly basis both dining in and taking out. Because they engaged her in this conversation and were so vocal about what awful human beings we are, and because they proudly announced "we work at Petie's" we won't be eating there anymore either. Service is consistently bad, always has been, every six months or so we give them another chance, every time we are disappointed, we will not be back. I have been in the restaurant business myself for 22 years and I work too hard for my tips and my customers to waste my money here. We did leave an almost  30% tip. she has to make a living somehow and we aren't douchebags despite what she said. 1
I am extremely disappointed in the security of this place. Yesterday we were at the pool with some friends. An iPhone was given to a waitress and then the phone just disappeared. Been almost  24 hours and some how the waitress at the pool must have got lost on her way to security. We have a handful of people stating that this waitress with dermal piercings located on her left top wrists and on back was in possession of my friends white iPhone. I would maybe expect this to happen because its free on Saturdays but for a valued employee to put the hotel at risk and the people who stay here by stealing from a mother of two, is beyond me. I would warn any visitor to watch your belongings and credit card information. Read reviews and google this place you will find there is more than one case. Sadly she may never get her phone back with pictures of her babies but hopefully this review can help someone. We have tried to even contact security today and still no luck. I would like to know how a phone in a hotel could vanish? 1
This is a popular place,here for fish tacos, they were very good Been here several times and would come here again,they have patio seating if you prefer  to eat outside. 4
Do not rent from here! I made a reservation from my boyfriend to rent a car, they would not let him leave without getting the OPTIONAL insurance despite the fact that our credit card covers rental cars! I emailed customer service to dispute this and they said to have my boyfriend talk to a manager upon returning the car. He did and they refused to do anything. I called customer service and they refused to do anything! They basically told me it's too bad and the woman on the phone was horribly rude. Screw Dollar, I will never rent from them again. 1
I wish I could give a negative star for this. It is really the worse card ever. The tap never worked since the first day I used it. I have been using other cards with the same merchant with no issues at all but using costco card the security apparently barred every single tap transaction. After the first time it happened the customer service assured me that it would not happen again. And it did for another 2 times. When I called the customer service, they could not answer me. Customer service is lousy. The card is a waste of time. 1
Two Michelin StarFive Diamond RatedThe food was alright, it's not something I'll crave again. The real Pablo Picasso art was impressive though. I had the 5-course tasting menu.Chicken croqueta with a tomato based soup: It was a good sample of Julian Serrano's tapas restaurant in Aria.Main Lobster Salad with an Apple Champagne Vinaigrette: It was good.Pan Seared Scallop: one of the better scallop dishes I've had. The crispy outside soaked up some flavor that made the dish.Foie Gras: Not the way I prefer it, but was alright.Turbot with Asparagus in Hollandaise sauce: It was very plain.Quince (fruit similar to an apple and a pear): the sorbet and drink were the better variations.www.anitaeat.com 3
Brought my bike in for a fitting, the fixed me up with some quality used parts and a new seat to get me up and riding comfortable. Very friendly service from top to bottom, and had my bike ready by the time my daughter finished test riding hers. Great first experience and I will definitely be coming back here even though I'm moving across town. Many Thanks to Randy and his entire crew!! 5
Mahin was amazing! We had a girl's night-in last month to celebrate a milestone birthday.  It was part lesson & part performance. She started the evening out with a dance-floor style lesson to teach us some belly dance moves. We had a blast learning to shimmy & shake! She even brought a basket of hip scarves with dozens of silver & gold coins for us to wear. I can definitely see how it would be a great workout out! I can't wait to try out one of her Saturday afternoon class. Mahin then changed into a sparkling performance costume & put on a little show for our group. I think we all wanted our own pair of finger cymbals by the time she was done! We had a ton of fun & it made the evening an extremely memorable occasion. 5
I was referred to Adrain and have been beyond thankful for his shop! He is reasonably priced and does excellent work. There is nobody else in town that I would take my vehicles to. He is an honest, trustworthy, hardworking guy and runs his shop the same. I refer anyone and everyone I can to him and do not plan on going to any other mechanic for as long as I am around. 5
This review is based on my visit on August 3rd, 2015.Due to an event I was a part of, I had to meet my party at the restaurant about 15 minutes after they had gotten there. When this happens at other restaurants, the waitstaff will see and immediately take the drink order (if they're not already helping another table). This was not the case here. It took our waiter five minutes before he saw me and came to ask for my order. I decided to order the Blueberry Kale Salad ($11) and added shrimp ($6). What came to me was a small salad with only a few, small pieces of fruit and four, yes, FOUR shrimp. They were not large, jumbo prawns. They were rather small, and at $1.50 each shrimp I was not happy. The salad was just not worth the $11, even though it did have what I can only call "fair" flavor. Overall, even on a week night, this restaurant did not have good service. Additionally, their menu prices are not proportional with what they actually put on the plate. Fortunately, the flavor is there and they have many intriguing dishes that I do have an interest in trying. 2
Celebrated my 50th birthday here December 7 with a party of ten.  Our experience was fabulous.  We arrived when the doors were open...we were going out that night and wanted to take our time, eat, and enjoy!  That we did!  The staff was wonderful.  Everyone really enjoyed their meal, the service, and the experience.  Can't wait for the next special occasion!  Yes, the location is not eye catching....and the decor...I'll say...vintage, but I love that old style! 4
I had purchased an online coupon quite a long time ago.  I made the appointment to attend the class certification, however I missed the class and called to reschedule.  When I called to reschedule I asked to speak to the manager.  The lady manager said she would have to look into the matter and said she would call me back.  She never did and I called back and left another message and never heard back again.  I would never go here if that is how they treat future customers.  I plan on taking my business elsewhere. 1
The convenience of staying in the hotel attached added a star.  White bean flat bread for the starter.  Well prepared with relatively high quality ingredients.  Commoner burger exceeded expectations.  Service was excellent as well.  Only criticism was the bar was crowded and quite noisy.  Decent drink selection. 4
Decided to try this new place today.  I ordered the sweet pork enchiladas since it was the daily special.  They came with rice, choice of beans and a small salad portion.  Usually with these assembly line type places the food is only luke-warm.  And.. this place was no different.  The beans had very little flavor and the sweet pork tasted like it was covered in sugar.  It is almost a carbon-copy of Cafe Rio including the bright colored chairs. 2
I have eaten here 3 times. Twice I had to remind them that they hadn't taken my money after they gave me my food. Once they were out of catsup? These were all in the drive thru. 2
After paying $80 for one adult and 3 kids, the kids and I were not impressed! Would not recommend eating dinner here. I should have taken a hint when they weren't very busy! 1
I had their corn beef and cabbage at 400 in the afternoon.  Don't bother.  In my experience cabbage should be a vibrant green, soft but with some semblance of structure remaining.  An olive green heap is not the desired outcome.  Alternatively, the beef should be tender enough to cut with a fork, my first hint was that it was served with a meat knife.  Just my opinion. 1
Avoid this and Nobu at all cost if you really love your sushi and sashimi.I was served frozen Tilapia when i ordered Tai.   I know my sashimi!3 star michelin prices, for the price i get fresh wasabi and top grade shoyu in Japan. 2
Stayed for three nights and this hotel had literally everything we were looking for during our stay in Montreal.The location was perfect as it's right between downtown and Old Montreal.  We did a lot of walking and this was a great spot.Our room was fantastic, literally no complaints.  We enjoyed the free hot breakfast every morning and the staff gave us a lot of free drink tickets for the happy hour each evening.My only complaint would be that they seemed to be having a lot of problems with the elevators while we were there.  Probably just bad timing, but it was a bit annoying to wait 10+ minutes just to get downstairs. 4
Michael Wade was my attorney and was able to get my case settled quickly and professionally! Communication was great and I would definitely recommend him to others! 5
Food: 2.5/5Service: 2/5Atmosphere: 4/5I went for their summerlicious lunch menu. It was rainy today and we sat outside on the patio, so the seats were a bit wet and damp, but overall the atmosphere and the decor of the place was very dainty and nice. I think the patio would be a great place to eat at on a sunny day.I ordered the sautee shrimps for my appetizer, the mussels and frites for my entree, and the apple cinnamon divine for dessert. All of the above tasted just average. I would say the shrimp was my favourite, but the portion was small (possibly because it was an appetizer only and it was from the summerlicious menu?) I got to try my friend's kale salad and sloppy brisket melt as well. The brisket was a little better than the rest of the dishes, but once again, nothing special. The apple cinnamon divine was a rice butter cake with apple and cinnamon, which tasted good, but too bad it was served cold (I'm not sure if their intention was to serve it cold though).The main reason I gave this restaurant such a low rating is mostly because of their slow service. They were all nice servers, but it was difficult to flag them down. We even got up to the little bar area that they had to ask for cutlery. When we were able to flag them down without having to get up from our seats, we had to ask several times for our condiments. My friend ordered juice, which only came after we reminded them and when she was half way through her entree.I probably would try other brunch places before I come back again to give it a second chance. 2
I think the market is okay - fresh vegetables, meats and seafood. The hours are brutal (hard to get to after work), and there aren't enough ready-to-eat food stands. 3
Secret pizza is a hidden gem inside The Cosmopolitan.  If you're looking to get a quick slice of pizza before heading out on the strip this is the place to check out. Best slice of pepperoni I've had in Vegas! 4
We reviewed several steak houses, and based on Yelp chose this one. The environement and staff were welcoming and accomadating.  We showed up with three more guests on on the reservation.Service was fast and professional.  All of the steaks and food was very tasty. The sides like cream spinich and the, Flemming potatos were memorable.  Great for a business meal, meal with friends, romantic or even with family. Most certainly will go back, when in Charlotte 5
Not really impressed. I ordered bacon pancakes...right... they had jalapeno bacon in them and not just a little. There was too much to finish. If that was the way they served them they should have said so. Server apologized that everything took so long and then disappeared. I finally went up and got more coffee myself. They did not appear that busy and there were 3 servers on but everyone got crappy service as far as I could see. Maybe they have another dining room I don't know about that they all went to. When I complained about the jalapenos (she should have asked why I only ate half) she took it off the bill. The manager never came out, no one said anything when I got up to get more coffee. They might need to hire more help. 2
I would love for this location to be more consistent but my order is only correct half of the time. The drive thru line is quick, typically. Even with 6+ cars. I enjoy iced coffee but the brew they use here seems to be either too weak or so strong it's nearly in-drinkable. Maybe it's the volume they do, this place is always packed. 2
Decent dry cleaner, but overpriced. They do have a next day option, which is nice. If you're willing to wait an additional day, the competition in the area is significantly cheaper( almost 40-50% cheaper). I would recommend this dry cleaner if you need an article or two cleaned overnight, but that's it, due to the astronomical prices. 3
Good sushi...we especially liked the chef specials and the salad.   Eclectic atmosphere....has a French cafe type feel. 4
Paid $155 for extermination in a block wall, all said and done in about 15 minutes. 4
Tony did an amazing job on my door dings and even buffed a scratch I had. It looks great. Highly recommend! 5
I went into Gravity Pope looking for a pair of comfortable work shoes. I had a 95hr week coming up at The Royal Agricultural Winter Fair, most of it spent standing.  The sales woman suggested I try on a pair of camper's, which I've never worn before. They've  been the best pair of shoes!  By the end of the week, I had sore legs but my feet were in great shape. Gravity Pope have great shoes, really impressive stock plus staff who are efficient and knowledgeable.  The sales woman, Mel, really knew her products. Thank you - I will be back. 5
My new discovery and new place for boba tea.  I tried their mango fluffy snow with mocha, bananas and condensed milk ~ it was yummy! But I will go with red and mango toppings next time. 4
Was recommended to Brenda by my previous balloon sculptor from the East Coast.  She saw her work via the website and told me I had to hire her.  All along the process Brenda worked with me and walked me through the steps to ensure I was choosing the right decorations for my party.  They created centerpieces for all my tables and did a wonderful large balloon arch in the entry to the room.  Brenda is responsive and cares about her business and I highly recommend her and Balloon Happy AZ for any affair. 5
Kitchenette with burners, refrigerator, and microwave. No silverware, flatware,or pots/pans. So not sure which parts of the kitchenette I can useWhen I inquired w/ the front desk, they laughed, offered styrofoam plates/bowls, and plastic cutlery.I can't remember, how does styrofoam do in the microwave...?At least there were no dead hookers stuffed in the mattress. 1
Needs work. Definitely needs work. There are times when the service is great and times when it's not so great. I would suggest management training. And at night, it seems as though the food was made house beforw. It's never fresh. There are a few employees that always seem to be working when I come in to order.. and then there are some that seem pretty lazy. Also, there's never toilet paper available in the small women's stall. I also feel unsafe in the bathroom with something stuck in the door. I'd rather it lock behind me. I know it's inconvenient, but it's also safer.Also, there need to be more service people with better attitudes. There are a few but not too many. 3
Rounding up from 2.5 stars.I stayed here on a business trip a few days ago, we were here for a trade show which took place at the hotel.I've been to Vegas several times and stayed at different locations throughout the strip so I think I have a good idea about the quality of other hotel rooms. First off I give this place 5 stars just on location, right in the center of everything. I wasn't expecting much from the room since it was their "least" expensive option. I walked in and was pleasantly surprised. The room was cute and the bathroom had a large bathtub and separate shower. It also had a mini fridge which I always find convenient. However, whomever cleans this room must be a group of blind workers. The bathroom mirror had disgusting toothpaste splatter that could easily be taken off just by wiping! The sink faucet had the same marks...use a sponge! Then I was looking forward to a nap when I decided to fluff my pillows there was a giant makeup stain on one! Do they not change pillowcases every time??? Gross! Then I took a shower and couldn't get cool water, it was boiling hot (and I typically prefer hot water) I couldn't even rinse my hair. Awful just awful...Oh and $28 early check-in fee! 3
Extremely disappointed by the lack of respect given to us today at the west side market. Bought salsa and a quesadilla, came to $9.50 and we paid with a $20. The girl at the counter gave us back 0.50 we said we paid with a 20 because that's literally all we had with us at that point. The girl said no you didn't. They all were very rude to us. Called the owner they gave us our change. Then they gave us our bag. But then the girl followed us around the market place and then accused us of taking food saying they gave us tamales in our bag and we didnt pay for our food. Will never recommend to anyone 1
My daughter and I decided to try Babbo for lunch today based on reviews and friends recommendations.  The hostess was less than friendly when we asked about being seated at a booth.  The waitress was nice and took our order quickly. My daughter order a pasta dish and I ordered a pizza.  It took forever for our food.  My pizza was not even warm. I did not want to complain since my daughter treated me to lunch.  I think Babbo has been the only upscale Italian eatery in the area for some time.  We recently visited Pomo Pizzaria down the street and it was soooooo much better.  I would not return based on the service, wait time and of course the food. 2
We love this place, genuine taste of the cuisines and great service 5
Excellent Chicken on the Rocks!! I've had their shawarma before too and it's delicious :) pretty small place too so it can get a little tight and slightly uncomfortable when it's crowded. 3
Comfy, groovy, easy-going coffee house that invites all the neighbors over for great tasting coffee & some mellow live music. I wish I lived closer because this is the type of coffee house I could spend lazy hours people watching, unwinding & sipping some of God's nector. Love the mix of contemporary art & old fashion lounge chairs. The location is as important to me as the taste and the taste is on point. Creamy, sweet, mild iced Americano was a perfect compliment. Food is also served here but I can't speak to that...yet! I'll certainly be back. 4
Breakfast was fantastic biscuits and gravy they have real red potato hash browns really good. will return again 4
Good food but odd that they lost my lunch order. Thanks to those manning the counter who realized I was waiting and filled the order on the spot. 3
First off I would like to point out the Airline we are complaining about initially was cheap.  So we should all reflect on what happens when you buy anything cheap it usually falls apart, doesn't work or in any form just is useless.  Well this sums up this company in all aspects as you can easily find reports of Airlines falling apart or flights that never worked out or about how there Customer Service is useless.  My wife and I were flying out of Utah back to AZ this past OCTOBER which seems like a late complaint but really this was just when we have finally received a response.  July 20 after October flight we have finally received a response after a flight was canceled to be moved to the following day.  We were told initially that food hotels or any out of pocket expense will be overseen by the company and paid to a extent.  Now we were staying at our parents house so that wasn't a cost for us but our dogs back in AZ were costing us 75$ a day for each to be cared for and that's what we submitted for and also one meal.  As of today July 20 we got the response that they were declining any out of pocket expense as they suggest this was a obligation of the traveler.  OBLIGATION for someone to pay out of pocket on a day that was not planned for because of the plane again that was not operating correctly.  I would extremely CAUTION people who buy cheap things and Allegiant is one of them. 1
I have been coming to Jay for a couple months now and been getting the best haircuts from him! he does amazing work. Jay is always fun and the space is awesome  Anyone looking for a great haircut, come here- for sure! 5
This place needs to adjust their touch tunes jukebox. Michael Bolton is the biggest buzz kill to end an awesome night. 1
Can Yelp please allow me to give 0 stars?This place is absolutely disgusting. I feel terrible I suggested going here just because I was lazy to go on Hwy 7 to Demetres. We ordered the crepe with ice cream. I have NEVER seen crepe so thick and hard. We didn't even eat the crepe and just ate the icecream. The crepe looked like DEAD SKIN. Sorry - it may sound disgusting but imagine eating that.The steam milk with flavour shot was way too sweet too. Only their cakes were decent. I'll give them that.Don't go there, unless you want to eat dead skin on a plate. 1
Checked out Landry et filles during Just for Laughs Bouffons Montreal. Had the ploye- probably one of the better food truck offerings out there. Original and delicious! 4
This is my 'tried and true' place whenever guests come into town.  Good food, good beer, good ambience.  The pub tips with mashed potatoes are very good!  I have heard that their classic mac n' cheese is quite good.  I love their stout, but it isn't for everyone.  The ambience isn't too loud so you can here what your friends are saying.  Staff is friendly.  Indoor and outdoor seating.  Nothing bad to say about this place. 4
Horrible service. Waited in line for 30 minutes to make it to the front to have employee "Armando" have me step to the side to help someone with only a purchase. Arrived early to my appointment scheduled at 3pm. Spent 45 minutes passed that to finally be attended too. Never will come back. 1
Horrible coverage, horrible customer service!  I would never ever recommend anyone to Sprint!!! If your thinking about signing a contract think again. I would go to any other carrier!!! 1
If not for the appetizers and dessert, this would be ranked much lower. Outstanding vibe from the restaurant, and excellent hostess and wait staff. Appetizer pizza, grilled edamame, and Caesar salad were superb, but the entrees disappointed. The special meatloaf had an unpleasant aftertaste, the roasted chicken was bland, and the salmon was unpalatable. As stated by others here, desserts are creative and fabulous, especially the sno-balls. 3
Bar owner is a piece of work. Sends people to get arrested when bar is underpopulated to cause attention to his bar. Much better places in the surrounding areas including blind pig and paninis. Don't waste your time at this low-class, messy sloppy bar that will waste your night away. 1
Neat setup with a pool and waterfall on the other side of the dance floor. Vegas priced drinks, but enough bars to keep the wait short. The dress code was a bit relaxed, lots of sneakers and jeans, but they had a great dj. 4
Discovered this place when my best friend and I were craving Thai food and were just scrolling through the yelps.I definitely agree with the good reviews this place gets, the food is great and for a great price!We were the only ones there on a weekend at dinner time, so this place definitely doesn't get the traffic it deserves, but its definitely one of the city's hidden gems. TheI even went back and brought a group of my co-workers here. We all had the lunch special that comes with a spring roll and bowl of soup, all for about ~$8 and they loved it too.The only negative thing I have to say is that the waitress that served us (both times I went) was not very courteous with us. She just takes our order and leaves, no smile. Once there was a piece of plastic wrap in my friend's cup; we told the waitress and she just took her cup and exchanged it with no apology. But this is sort of expected and common in a lot of asian restaurants, so I wasn't too surprised. Just a thing to keep in mind. 4
Probably the best Sate Chicken Sub I've ever had.  The staff puts a tremendous duty of care into there art.  They are the real sandwich artists. 4
I usually love Pizza Hut, but after visiting family members, I have a different opinion.We ordered online. We ordered a custom pizza. It took really long for them to deliver it considering it was pretty close... When we got the pizza, almost every thing was wrong.Wrong crust, wrong sauce, wrong toppings.We were a little disappointed over how long it took to get the pizza, but even more disappointed about how the order was completely messed up. 1
the service was great, staff is awesome.the food, it was ight nothing out of this world. 3
If I had never been to a Brazilian steakhouse before, I would have still thought the service a bit slow.  However, having been to Fogo de Chao and a couple of others like it in Atlanta, I know how good it can be and this doesn't measure up.  If you are paying big money on the strip you should match or outdo anything in Atlanta, so to see this fall short is really disappointing.  Someone in Vegas set this thing up and is just going through the motions. 2
Am I allowed to give zero stars?? This place is the rudest and we are in Pittsburgh. Asked the bartender what the best special mixed shot they had was and he looked at another bartender, looked back and said "uhhhhh I dunno" then walked away. Appalled to say the least, way to appeal to new customers 1
This place is an insult to any establishment that describes itself as a hotel. It would have been better if Expedia had done a better job, thx to them I'll never use Expedia or this hotel.Anyway, There is nothing classy or professional about this rat hole. The only thing that is improved is the casino floor and even that is a joke, you can't even check in without poker tables and hi smoke of cigarets right next to it, the whole casino floor is aligned along side of the front desk.From valet to employees insight everyone was in a rush and it seemed like no one cared. They were rude and unprofessional.My floor had 3 elevators and each elevator takes you different location, each time I took one I was lost, each time I walked to the elevator someone was asking me for help. Guys I am telling you if there was an emergency I would never made it out. Not only that they were confusing but way to slow.Parking garage is a joke, signs and directions in it are unreal. We went out to movies and came back right at midnight, for 2 hours we drove and couldn't get a parking spot. Called down the front desk and even the operator refused connecting me, she ( Kim ) i think told me to talk to the security, I had to tell her over and over I have no security problem. Then she went on and told me that the hotel manager Leroy was to busy and I was told that they had called the desk and they will park our car, I actually went down just a few minutes before and the same man, an African American gentleman Robert that works the pm shift refused to listen or take my car, 3 days in a row he refused helping me out, it's not like I don't know about tipping he just told me if I am not a high roller no valet, maybe he had issues wit families and vans. That gentleman alone ruined half of our vacation alone at that place because when we came to check in he didn't even want us waiting in the car while we check in. Anyway after we went insight I told my wife and our little girls to wait while I talk to the front desk manager Kevin Eller. I really don't know what would be the best way to describe his leadership skills, he stood there and lectured me about that if they sold out there is not much they can do when the parking lot is full, when I asked him why did I purchase room with free parking he just ignored me. When I complained about the valet and room he it was like he didn't listen all he was doing is his stupid computer and then he go's, I guess I'll take off your hotel fees. I looked at him and said that's perfect for 4 nights in this rat hole this is what you think I come for, he said there is not much more I can do. I walked a way.Someone rated this place 5 stars and he posted 5 pictures of the view, well If a free diner can do the trick and that's how you enjoy your home then whatever. I just would never ever even look at this places way. This place is not fricken 1
I will never take anything to them again. Took in a laptop that I was told would be done in a week and 6 WEEKS LATER I got it back and it still wasn't fixed!!! The owner lied repeatedly about what was wrong with it, when it would be ready and who was working on it. He was also very arrogant and rude! Additionally, the technician is not allowed to do anything unless the owner is there. He couldn't even print me a receipt for the money I paid up front or give me a list of the repairs they supposedly had made . 1
"Meh.  I've experience better." I find this fairly overpriced for the quality of food.  I think that the decor of the place and the witty menu drive up the "like" of this place b/c it's modern and fun... but it all comes down to the food, and it's not something I'd think about again when I leave, but I wouldn't object too heavily if someone asked me to meet them there again.  They staff is nice, when it's busy they're a little slow.  The food is spicy, like the guacamole and house salsa - I like spicy, but it didn't really add flavor, just made my mouth burn enough to get a second margarita (which was strong - good, but strong w/ low-end tequila, yuck.. paid the extra $$ for better liquor).  The pico de gallo, my alternative to the spicy salsa, was as bland as they come so I settled on "virgin" chips.  Everything is just mediocre and pricey... meh. 2
This place is"ok" but there's not enough on their menu to go back. If we do, we'll call to make sure their chicken pot pies are ready since they didn't have any baked when we stopped by. My husband had to"settle" and wasn't excited about the choices. Very reasonable though!!! 2
Very similar to the chain Friday's in America.  Huge portions.  Didn't like that they wouldn't substitute even though what I had requested was the same price and I even offered to pay an additional fee.  Food was decent, nothing that left me wanting for more but decent.  Friendly servers.  The decor is a bit dark, could definitely use a bit more lighting. 3
Love this place great service and good food. Pretty girls don't hurt either 4
Really bad service. Shuttle to and from airport requires many stops with changing busses as well. Not a good way you want to start/end ur vacay 1
Eh. Service was quick and pleasant. I guess I was expecting more from the food side of things. We had the wings- they fell off the bone just by touching them but had overall good flavor. I was most disappointed in the price for the amount of food when you order from the "big/dinner portions". I had the pork chop, which was served with mashed potatoes. There were 5 bite size pieces of pork served with approximately 4 tablespoons of potatoes. The plate itself was 4X as large as the food it held. The pork chops were good, but not enough for ~$30. I don't care how "good" something tastes if my stomach doesn't realize food had been put into it. I shouldn't spend ~$95 for drinks and food but then leave hungry. I was not impressed. 3
Very nice resort but be careful when booking a room. I am a Starwood lifetime gold member with over 400 plus stays to date. Never have I been charged for a room until I checked out, until staying at this property. I have been charged prior to arrival before but it is made very clear when booking. This resort gave no such warning. Be wary when booking 2
The pizza is pretty good. Especially at 2am. But when it takes over an hour for delivery, no thank you. I shouldn't have to call 3 times to find out where my pizza is. Then when he finally showed up he asked for a tip. That's the best way to not get a tip. 2
I only give this place 2 stars because I gave their neighbour Fantasy Swingers Club 1 star.  I suppose they should get an extra star because there were actually people at this club unlike their neighbour.While this place looks much nicer than the next door swingers club Fantasy I didn't bother wasting my money on this place either.  There were creepy guys hanging out front.  Just what a girl wants at the swingers club (rolls eyes)   The guy at the door was extremely rude and after being put off by Fantasy I was in no mood for bullshit.  You'd think for a place as dead as it was all but the creepy guys they'd be more friendly and inviting to get an attractive female through the doors.Not impressed with the Sins of Sin City!! 2
My veal scaloppine was terrible, like tough shoe leather and over salted. The tiramisu dessert was good, but could not make up for the horrible veal scaloppine. 2
Took our mini golden doodle here. He had bad matting on his legs and beard, which we discussed with the groomers before the appointment. We asked that they make an attempt to remove the mats without shaving him to the skin but understood they'd likely have to buzz some areas down. Two hours later and we picked up an unrecognizable dog. They shaved his entire body, including his back which the groomer acknowledged was not matted. Seems like no attempt was made to accommodate our request whatsoever. Needless to say, we won't be repeat customers. This place is the Supercuts of dog grooming, but worse. 1
O-VER-RA-TED! Un-freakin-believable. Went last week for an early dinner to beat the crowd. Took forever to even place the order, but okay at least we're seated. The waitress comes over (Asian chic) asking what we wanna order, speaking so fast (like an auctioneer). Clearly she's in a hurry. we order our food and it comes out fairly quickly. Shrimp... then crab.... some fried catfish.... then a sudden halt. Where's the crawfish? Asked a waitress to check on it after waiting at least 15 minutes. She said "they're working on it, it should be right out." 10 minutes later, still nothing. Ask another server - "it's on the ticket so it should be on the way." ANOTHER 15 minutes and at this point we don't even want it anymore. I mean seriously, it took us less time to wait to order and eat everything, and still no crawfish. We ask if we can cancel the order since it's taken WAY too long. Great no problem... then the bill comes and they still charge for the crawfish! Ayuh! Wave one down again and they take it off - no apology... nothing.As far as the taste - it's not all that. If ya'll are from So. Cal, don't waste your time here. Go to Boiling Crab in L.A.  Save your time and money for the craps table - at least you'll have a fighting chance. This was a lose/lose situation.Hot n Juicy Crawfish? I wouldn't know... it never came! 1
I had a really good lunch here today.  The steak special was a sirloin served with crab risotto that had real chunks of crab.  The sweet potato fries were nice and crispy, some of the best I've ever had.  The blueberry bread pudding for dessert was lovely, and my lunch date, who has recently lost some weight but has a Friday cheat day, ordered it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream that turned out to be three fantastic, house-made scoops of deliciousness.  Service was good as well (if a bit of a  downtown cliche: beautiful 22 year olds in Lulu Lemon tank tops).  It's a nice, high-ceilinged space with good downtown people-watching. 4
Stopped on a whim driving by. 1:00for lunch. One couple was leaving when we arrived and no one else was in the place. Another couple arrived 10 minutes later. So only two couple and it took 10 mins to get a menu. Server didn't know what beer was on draft.   We ordered a beer and a coke. Took another 5 mins to get both and the beer was flat. They offered a bottle of the same beer then came back and said there was none cold. Finally got that settled and looked at the menu. Decided in a Reuben, pulled pork and hand made chips. Took 10 more minutes then was told they were out of pork and chips. So parm/garlic wings it was. We were in there 45 mins before the food came up in the window and the waitress took it to the other couple who of course said it was the wrong food. Waitress took it back to the cook who told her it was for us. There were only the two tables!! She got it to us. The Reuben was good but the fries were way over salted. The wings had shredded parm cheese and garlic chunks on top but were impossible to eat like that. When you picked them up everything fell off but the wings were cooked nicely and were a good plump size. Not those small shriveled kind. If they are newly opened maybe they just have to work out the kinks. 2
The employees were incredibly kind and even offered me something that was not available at the counter. I wasn't incredibly impressed with the flavors and felt there was some ingredient that I just didn't like in many of them. Not to mention, many of the ones I tried were very rich and I love rich flavors but I wasn't crazy about any of the ice creams. Maybe better luck next time- also felt the scoops were bit over priced. 2
Great chocolates made by real artists! Shanterial isn't adorable and so helpful and informative! 5
Great little neighborhood bar. The food is great and service is prompt. Can't beat the fact that it's walking distance from my house! It does get pretty loud and cramped for space on weekend nights though as they regularly have a DJ and I have even seen a band play one night. Still, great little cantina. 4
Cheap good food, with good mix of Korean food.  They have a great "Donkatsu" or Pork Cutlet dish, which is very popular and often gets sold out.One of the great things about Oh Geul Boh Geul is their great variety of banchan (Korean side dishes).  I regularly visit Oh Geul Boh Geul whenever I need my fix of Korean food. 4
Ribs were awesome. Great smoke flavor. Brisket was grisly and dry. 5/5 for ribs, 1/5 for Brisket. 3
This is for customer service, not their products.  I need a replacement for a broken part of my kids' playhouse.  The website 'Contact Us' link doesn't work, just an infinite loop where it requests you to log in over and over again.  That would be ok if their customer support phone line worked, but regardless of it being during their 'business' hours (8-11am  and 12-5pm Eastern time, M-F per their website), you can't get a hold of a human and there is a message repeating call back during our normal business hours. Someone isn't doing their job.Update- Someone contacted me from Step 2 and sent me a replacement part free of charge. The initial experience was still frustrating, but I'm glad they stepped up and fixed my problem.  I'm not sure if they have their phone line working yet. 3
I ordered a meal online for delivery and the food didn't arrive until 2 hours later (I live 4 minutes down the road). When the food Did come, it was cold. The only good thing was the energy beet juice I ordered. Pretty good stuff. 1
This place is right on the border of Kensington and Chinatown, and easily overlooked (I drove by it).  The outside betrays what's inside; a very nice, clean and recently renovated restaurant.  This is a refreshing change from many of the other establishments located in this general area.We ordered the pad thai, tom yam w/shrimp and green curry.  The Tom Yam was a bit too salty for me, but they don't cheap out on the shrimp like a lot of place do; they gave 4 whole shrimp!The pad thai w/chicken was also good.  Not as tomatoey as many places often make it.  I can almost imagine the chef at those establishments going through lots of ketchup for that dish!  None to be concerned about with this one.  Finally the green curry was very nice.  I would say my favourite dish.  We also got ginger tea + honey as well as a thai iced tea.  All said, less than $40 with tip.  Pretty good value considering a lot of other Thai places would charge much more for the same dish. 4
Dropped my fork at new location on Hualapai Way. While we didn't need a reservation, due to a large party (20+) if we had arrived any later we would have had to wait or sit at the bar.  Since the bar looked nice, had plenty of seating and had one plasma tv, the bar would have been acceptable.Atmosphere in the room was very nice: upscale but unpretentious.We were brought bread which was ok, but nothing special. Skipping the appetizers this evening, we jumped right into the main event:A bow tie pasta with garlic and eggplant dish: Nothing extraordinary but edible. Would we get it again? No.A double bone veal chop with roasted potatoes (special): This was excellent! The veal chop was perfect and the potatoes were just crispy enough to make me want more.Dessert: The Spumoni Pie looked tempting but was a little disappointing.  The cream puffs, however, were outstanding and should be a featured item. Service: Could have been better. Slow and not very attentive. Perhaps partially due to the large party, but definitely could use some improvement.Will we go back? Despite the mixed reviews, we will be back to try another pasta dish, possibly get the veal chop again if available, but definitely to get the cream puffs. The restaurant is also known for fresh seafood, which needs to be tried (and reviewed here). 3
Decided to give it a try on the way home tonight. I placed an order online about 3 hours before my pickup time. When I got there, no one acknowledged me, and when they did I waited about 15 minutes for my food. Not sure what the purpose of an online pickup is.. there was also about 5-7 people working in a fairly empty restaurant 3
DO NOT BOOK WITH THESE GUYS. Two very rude movers showed up late, told us to wait ten minutes, then left in the truck without saying anything to us. When they finally answered our phone call, they said there was too much stuff, and that was that (note: we had a very normal amount of stuff to move for a 2 bedroom apartment). We were left stranded on moving day. Really, they were just too tired to do the job. DO NOT BOOK WITH CAREFREE MOVERS. Company is very sketchy, and likely a scam. We still haven't been able to get in touch with the company (I don't think it's even a "company") 1
Good food.  Large soup is VERY large!!  Our first visit & we are not well acquainted with Vietnamese food but will return. 4
I recently had my 21 birthday and booked Entertainment Unlimited to DJ at my party. I had talked to him we worked out types of music and a playlist that would best fit my party and it's theme. He got there on time and was set up before my party guests showed up. It was the best party I've ever had, he was interactive and got everyone dancing! Overall it was a great time and I would be happy to recommend them to anyone. 3
We are returnees to Arizona but previously lived in the West Valley so I was hating the idea of finding a new hair stylist. Luckily, my daughter has been seeing Amor at Altered Ego for her hair and she suggestedthat I schedule an appointment with Amor also. So glad I took her recommendation. This is a wonderful salon, Amor is very sweet and easygoing. Amor is outstanding in her skills, she knows exactly what you want and what will look good for with your hair. Amor did a beautiful cut and color on my hair at my first appointment with her. The prices were reasonable as well. The salon is very relaxing and the staff is friendly. I am so happy to have found my new stylist on my daughter's recommendation here in Tempe. Thanks Altered Ego and Amor for a great day!! 5
I have to keep my gushing delight contained. Just go there. Everything about this house converted to restaurant/bar is fantastic. Fluffy (not thick or thin, not pizza dough as we have known it) crust breakfast pizza, Sunday omelet station manned by the owner himself. Bottomless Mimosas - $9 with any food purchase. Same deal for Bloody Mary's. The staff is super friendly without being super smothering or obnoxious. They have a great selection of micro brews, wines, a full bar, and frequent diner punch tickets. Buy ten drinks or food items - get one free!To everyone at Hob Nobs, thank you. You have a wonderful thing going! 5
I'm an artist and a huge fan of the surrealist genre of art so I have bit of appreciation for the odd or weird.  Having said that, I have to admit this show failed to really impress me.  It focused a lot more on Criss Angel than cirque du soleil which was the most disappointing because I'm not really a fan of his.  I did enjoy the dancing and the costumes, but that's about it.  I'd agree with some of the other reviews that the magic tricks were a bit tacky and cliche, and Criss definitely talked way too much during the show. 2
Visited this location tonight for major back issues. I am completely out of alignment. Dr. Nick was great. Gentle, informative, and friendly. The staff is concerned and friendly. I've had multiple experiences with The Joint locations and the convenience and friendliness is outstanding. 5
Disgraceland is a great dive bar so set your expectations accordingly. This used to be my go-to place when I was in my 20s and lived in the neighbourhood so after a bit of a hiatus I was excited to visit the old watering hole. The place remains unchanged and still has a good vibe. However as someone else noted, I was disappointed to see that many of the original food items have been removed. The menu used to be AMAZING and the thing that kept me coming back. Now that it's different, I probably won't be visiting that often. 4
Good coffee doesn't necessarily need good space... but in most cases they go hand in hand. Cafe Falco is just a delight to sit in. Spacious, and minimalist but still warm-- now that's a good combination.  When I visited it was quiet and calm which provided an ideal environment for me to do some work. However, I did visit an hour before closing time, so I have no doubt that was the reason. I ordered a large coffee ( I was given 2 choices, a small or large) and it was served in a Japanese ceramic cup which was a nice change. I ordered the coffee of the day and it was strong but not overwhelming.  Coffee is brewed with Siphon Coffee Makers or vac pots which I had never seen before and because it was my first time having coffee made that way I can't really say how it particularly changes the flavor of the coffee. Regardless, the coffee was great. Didn't get to try their food (which I hear is really delicious) but they had small snacks like cookies at the counter. Overall, a cafe that I hope will stay around for a very long time. 5
My sister was on Oprah for her fabulous job as a Wine Angel, so we decided to celebrate over dinner at Florida Cafe.  I've always wanted to try this place however it's downtown LV and it's quite a drive from my house.  The service is excellent, the food is delicious and the ambience is family friendly. Ohh and everything at such a reasonable price.  Highly recommended! 4
Full of loud post-clubbers late at night, the poutine itself isn't amazing but it's filling and good for the post-bar stomach. Not a huge fan of their gravy - it's heavy and gelatinous but it does the trick when you need the fix. Their chili poutine is filling, but I find their pork options way too much even for my appetite.I ate there for a pre-theatre dinner with friends. I remember feeling really heavy and quite frankly gross while Maria sang about the hills being alive. From this, I learned that Smoke's is only really good when you're tired & tipsy - perfect for stirring a greasy, heavy, appetite.Also, keep an eye out for the Smoke's on Wheels truck, touring Toronto 2
Great place !Good service, knowledgable staff, quality items. 5
They took very long to serve me and my family, food was okay... portion size and price were bad as well. I would not come back here. 2
Ordered several six cheese type bagels, fellow asked if I wanted them sliced, of course.Big mistake, the bagels were cut so uneven I had to throw several out. Next time I'll sliced them my self 2
Good service and average pho was average. But the one thing that threw me off was the Che Ba Mau. As the name defines (three colors dessert), we usually are able to distinguish the three colors of this dessert, which consists of coconut milk, red or yellow beans and green pandan leaves jelly. But the one served in this restaurant was plain white. It was impossible to distinguish the presence of any jelly or beans. Also, the "coconut milk" they served didn't taste right either. Two of my friends ordered this dessert also and we all didn't feel well halfway through the drink. To cut things short, if you are craving a good pho and che ba mau, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant. 2
They installed the WRONG spark plugs in my vehicle, which I later found was the cause of engine knock and a rough idle. The owner is a coward who is unprofessional, belligerent, rude and likes to use bully tactics when he's safe behind a phone. Trust me and the rest of the reviewers here... Save your money, hair and lifespan of your motor by either driving or having it towed to a local dealership or some other reputable auto mechanic who respects and knows your vehicle. 1
Thus far, my one beef with Toronto has been the apparent lack of really delicious ice cream shops (they have Hagen Daz and Ben&Jerry's in supermarkets, but not stores with their entire line of flavours). That's why I was super happy to find this place! They have a wide variety of flavours and they all look delicious. My husband had the Lemon Sorbet and it was light and frothy and yummy. I had the coffee one with fudgy bits of chocolate (I forget the official name of the flavour) and it was, so far, the best ice cream I've had in the city. Yum! 4
First of all we wanted to try this place for the first time and we just purchased a groupon so we decided to go. We were excited at first the bread and salad were good but the meals were ok nothing spectacular for the price. Our major disappointment came when we were ready to pay, the server was less than pleasant when we handed her the groupon, then when she brought back our revised bill she marked a 20 percent gratuity on it! Really?!?!?! A tip is based on your service and not on what you think you deserve. Her service was ok at best and being in the restaurant industry we were going to tip her on the entire amount but since she wrote it in the credit card tip line we decided not to tip her on the entire bill! Needless to say we will NOT be returning! I will be sure to spread the word! 2
Wow... what a change in 1 year.  We had a great time a year ago when we celebrated my birthday there.  Decided to book again, despite all the negative reviews.  They told us over the phone we would have a room by the pool with a private patio.  We were on the first floor no where near the pool and our patio wasn't private.  It was open and most people were walking through it as a shortcut rather than following the sidewalk.  They keys didn't work, so we took this as a sign that, this room wasn't for us.  They offered us another room, closer to the pool upstairs.  No balcony or patio, but that's fine.  We got up there, and there was a pair of goggles under the entertainment center from previous guests that we noticed right away, little hairs in the shower tub, and even though we tried to ignore it all... the last straw was the 4 long hairs on our pillows as we got in the bed to sleep.  We called FD and they offered us a refund.  We are now celebrating our 1 year anniversary NEXT week at a different resort. 1
My husband and I ordered 2 speg and meatball dinners. When we got home we had 1 chicken parm, even though we paid for our original order. It's too far to go back and to tell the truth It wasn't that great anyway. Make sure to check your orders b4 you leave. 2
I was surprised how the food has changed since Chris owned the place. I had a meal and ordered fried rice at a added cost instead of white rice, the rice sure wasn't fried rice. The owner still plays Peek a boo and doesn't walk around to say hello to the customers as Chris did. The food is par and the sushi is OK, but Rochelle N. wasn't eating at the restaurant when Chris owned it for the service now isn't that great, they stand around and talk instead of being alert to the customers needs. 1
Yummy! Forgot that I was in the desert for a minute! Maine lobster roll was amazing...I'm a RI girl, and usually don't order lobster unless I'm back east...but, I definitely recommend visiting the Maine Lobster Lady. 5
Came here around 7:30pm on a week night .... packed.... waited for 45 min as they do not take reservations. If you go as a big group- good luck! you wont get seated unless you whole group was present. Food was delish, a little expensive .....and portions were on the smaller side.  Place is really small, service wasn't too great. Maybe they should hire more servers. Had to wait for awhile to get water and for refills. 4
I hate paying for food that isn't good. Nice vibe but that's what you're paying for! Food is just ok. 2
If you want quick, helpful, or professional medical services - DO NOT GO TO THIS URGENT CARE!! We were looking for a simple procedure for our son that we asked if they could provide upon arrival. Of course the response was yes, but three hours later we did not receive any help and were turned away with a useless prescription that was no longer medically prescribed. The doctor hurt our son, didn't apologized - laughed about it even. The front desk and nurse were rude, doctor didn't wear a coat and had a nose ring. This place is terribly run and we have serious doubts as to their medical capabilities. 1
In life not everything goes perfectly, but if ever I have had an experience of people whole heartedly working to make things right, this was it.   Matt Melone was incredible and his manager Mike Jameson too.  I flew to Arizona from Colorado to purchase a used Toyota Tacoma truck from Matt Melone.  Matt picked me up from the airport in the new truck.  It was a warm day and when I went to put up the air conditioner, it didn't function properly, it just blew air.   Immediately upon getting back to the dealership everyone went into high gear to fix the problem.  Matt took me to go get something to eat, and took care of the bill.  They ended up replacing a whole part, which couldn't be done until the following day, but they paid for a hotel room for me and offered to pay any expenses I might have, and they made sure I had breakfast.  They also provided me with a loaner car.   They even went so far as to pay for my hotel room in Flagstaff and offered to pay for my dinner too, that next night on my way back to Colorado.  They also reduced the purchase price to help us even further!  The reduction helped pay for my plane ticket out there, which was a wonderful and exceptionally thoughtful consideration.They truly bent over backwards for me, and what could have been a complete nightmare, they did everything in their power to make it not so.   I saw that this dealership has had negative reviews in the past.  I asked Matt about this and he said that they have let go of everyone from the top to the down that was responsible for the poor running of the dealership.  New people have been brought in and they are determined to make this a great dealership.  This was exceedingly evident.We need to get another car in the next few months, and we will be calling Matt Melone to help us find one.  It would be a pleasure to work with them again.  Thank you Camelback Ford!  Happy New Year!  Warm regards, Ann Brumby 5
A to Z Valleywide movers made my move a complete nightmare!!!!!!! They showed up 3 hours late with only half a crew  so we ended up moving in a Monsoon. First the owner John insists that his guys start as early as possible when we wanted them there at 9 so we agree to 8am. I am glad we did not agree to the 6am he was pushing in the heat because the movers did not even show up until 11am! We requested 4 movers and only 2 show up late. Eventually an hour later the 3rd shows up and then a few hours after that he has to go back to his half way house or he is going back to prison. So my boyfriend and I are left moving everything ourselves with just 2 movers from 8am to 10pm. We were in miserable pain from this. We had to do almost all the work ourselves to meet our moving timeline. We could not get our chicken coop moved without the help of 4 movers. John was told this repeatedly yet still failed to provide the movers we needed on both occasions.  John promises that everything will be finished and he will send four movers over the following day to finish moving the final items and the chicken coop at no additional charge. Again they were late, they didnt have the right number of guys and that they were only there "to move the chicken coop and then we have to go to another job" my boyfried became irate, called John and said they would not be leaving until they had actually finished the move they promised to do. John acted offended like his business problems were our fault and kept saying he wasnt charging us for that day....yet we had already paid the $1000 quoted on the move with four movers that should have been done in 6 hours not 18 hours with 2 movers and the customer getting stuck doing everything themself. I do not trust this moving company and will certainly never ever use them again. The movers also broke our rocking chair, birdbath, garbage can, candle holder and dining table. I told John about this and he never cared to follow up and have anything fixed. He promised to emal me a repair request form ...and you guessed it---I NEVER received it. John is a complete liar and I would not trust a word out of his mouth! 1
ech mixed bag...I think Re-Store is a good charity but their donation process is poor.  It takes +- two weeks and having to upload pictures, having my items vetted for approval for donation and giving details and dimensions so Re-store's people's jobs are made easier isn't my cup of tea.  We don't work for re-store but my building has an enormous trash dumpster.  I'll put it there instead. 2
As a kid, my family and I would make an annual trip to pick apples from our local apple orchard. Although it has been years since my last trip, I was somewhat disappointed with my experience at Eplegaarden. The overall location was extremely close to downtown Madison, but the selection of apples was quite limited. Although it seems as though there are rows and rows of apples, most of them were the same two or three types. This may have been because we went a little early in the season, but even then, many of the trees seemed quite picked over. Also, make sure to bring cash or check because they do not accept debit or credit cards! 3
We stopped in because we happened to be in the area, although I wouldn't normally visit a development with the word "Village" in it.  Of course I have a pretty hard time passing up $0.50 PBRs too.Fist off the PBRs hit the spot, at that price I'm sure they're dispensing enough of it to maintain it at the peak of freshness.  We also had a few Moretti's for $1.50, another bargain but I don't think that's a daily deal.We shared a little house/side salad.  For $5 I'm not sure I got a lot of value out of that.  Just a clump of greens on a plate.We then split a 12"  BBQ Chicken Pizza for $15.95.  That's probably the most I have ever paid for a pizza that size.  It was good but it certainly hasn't had me dreaming about it ever since.  I'd be just as happy with a frozen California Pizza Kitchen pie for $5.  Actually I'd be happier because then I'd have enough money for 22 more PBRs.Normally we would order a large pizza so we'd have something to take home, but only some pizzas are available in the large size.  This would lead one to believe that the pizzas are made ahead of time.  Who knows, but I think it's sort of a dumb way to set up the menu. What really caught my eye though was a parmesan chicken sandwich that I saw sitting on the counter, wow, that thing looked tasty!Atmosphere?  Not much going happening on a Sunday afternoon.  A few trust fund babies at the bar sort of made me hope that's not the normal crowd.In summary I found the food to be okay but not worth the price.  Factor in the cost of the beers though and you'll come out even on the bill compared to most other places. 3
So . . . this place certainly has a lot of buzz and I was relatively excited to check it out. Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed. I had to laugh upon walking in - they offer peanuts while waiting in what was a prodigious line - we arrived at 1230 on a thursday - and they had a sign warning patrons not to leave with the peanuts due to allergy concerns. This was a deviously clever sign despite the obvious failure in logic because I spent the 10 minutes in line trying to figure out how that didn't apply to people IN the restaurant. It went by pretty quickly.I ordered the cheeseburger with "everything." Plus jalapenos. Paired it with the cajun fries. It was aggressively mediocre. The fries were lukewarm and soggy, and the "cajun" was evidently just a healthy dousing of lawry's seasoning salt. At least that was how it tasted to me. They also couldn't seem to conquer the common burger problem of the soggy lower bun. Mine was like a wet sponge. The flavor was decent, though. The biggest problem I had was the crowd and the noise. We had to wait to find a seat, and then got the ass and the cock bump numerous times from other patrons snaking through the tables to get their food or refill their drinks. Every thirty seconds some poor soul would scream an order number out at the top of their lungs, causing another rush to the counter. I won't go back. I like In-n-Out. 2
I work in Town Square.  I Love Burgers is an attractive option for my co-workers and I because of a hefty 40% discount.  That being said, I can understand some of the negative opinions of this place because it would be too expensive to eat here with any kind of regularity.What I like about this place is the variety of burgers and you get a generous sized patty.  Unlike most fast food burger places, I feel full eating a burger without having to get fries.  My favorite burger at this place is the BBQ Burger - bacon, onion straws, american cheese, and bbq sauce.  On the downside, I don't like the butter-brushed bun, but it's a minor quibble.The milkshakes they offer are excellent.  The blueberry panshake is my current favorite.Overall, the food is good, but unless you work in Town Square, you're probably better off just going to Five Guys or In-N-Out. 4
Ordered tuna rolls and dragon rolls and was pretty disappointed :( They changed owners and it was noticeable. Neither roll was tasty. 2
My group of four visited tonight for the first time.  I have to say it was just ok.  I love the concept and the atmosphere but the service was lacking.  To be more specific, it wasnt our waiter, he was great.  Insead, it was the kitchen staff and their mistakes.  First, we immediately got a table (yay) and we ordered our drinks and apps, the apps arrived before the drinks.  Ok, not that big of a deal but there was more.  Second, we ordered our meals and two of the four dishes arrived before the other two.  Both dishes were cold and the other  two did not arrive until the waiter noticed and had to go to the kitchen and start all over.  The food comes back and was incorrect and the cold meals originally delivered were simply reheated.  Have you ever had reheated duck?  I don't recommend it. 3
Matter of fact, I love pancakes. I cannot find words to express how much I love pancakes.Mildred's Temple blueberry pancakes are never physically attractive, but they are graceful and beautiful that makes the roof of my mouth moan the most perfect moans. The pancakes evidently know nothing about properties of beauty until my tongue quivers. That, folks, is how I view happiness. 4
I had a real good experience here.  being from hawaii we got no olive gardens  I have to say hands down excelent customer service and great food selection  I opted for soup as a starter and they do refills on it.  shared the tour of Italy with the wife ,  they even seperated it for us, big thumbs up for that.  great deserts too. 5
RE360 is an excellent leasing company. They are always quick to respond to maintenance requests and resolve the issue in a efficient manor. The staff is professional and returns phone calls in a timely fashion. I would recommend leasing through RE360 to anyone looking for housing. 5
No AC!!! It was horrible for the amount of people that were there with no AC and about 300 people crammed into this place with only a ceiling fan for ventilation. Even the lead singer commented on how hot it was. I won't go there again for any event!!! 2
Service was great; food good! Patio awesome, sangria yea!!! They have recently been voted best in accommodating "large groups" but I may have to disagree on that... They don't even split checks, my biggest con. Especially since we had a party of 16, some ppl didn't even order entrees or drinks. So we split it ourselves. 3
Gave this place a try on my most recent business trip to Toronto, since it seemed like a good break from the chain restaurants in the area. Wow, was I ever wrong! After taking our drink orders, we waited nearly 30 minutes but the waitress never came back with our drinks or to take our food order. We finally went inside (we were sitting on the patio) to find a server, and someone else came out to take our order. When the drinks and food finally arrived nearly a half hour later, they got two of our orders wrong, and forgot to bring a plate or cutlery. We had to go back inside to find the waitress when we wanted to leave, since we'd been sitting for a good 20 minutes after having finished our food (which was bland and rather unappetizing, to tell the truth) and nobody came by. It took the waitress three tries to prepare the bills correctly, and she kept asking for more time. I've never seen such awful service. After we finally complained, one of the other servers came out afterwards to apologize for the two "new" servers, but after waiting nearly two hours and spending twice as much as necessary on mediocre food, I'd already decided never to go back. 1
Not a bad place for a burger and a drink, but not great either.To summarize the pros and cons of my experience:Cons: 1. Sticky tables, 2. Dirty looking silver ware 3. Cool beer, not cold beer.Pros: 1. Good Food, 2. Nice and attentive staff 3. Sports on TV 4. Free WifiI went to the Roadrunner off Buffalo and Washington around 4:10 on Saturday 4/6/13. I walked in and sat myself as a sign instructed and was promptly greeted by the Manager on duty. He brought a water and he took my order. I asked for the 1/3 lb Angus Burger and a draft Sam Adams Boston lager. I prefer draft instead of bottled because draft is colder, usually.Looking around its what you would expect from a local's oriented sport bar. Dim, sticky and sports on TV. The table I sat at was pretty sticky and the silver ware, though clean, had a lot of water spots on it and looked a little gross. They had Wichita vs Louisiana on, no volume though which was ok with me because I think Charles Barkley's voice is annoying. Also they didn't have the captions on so I had no idea what anyone was saying, but I don't really care that much about it.About another 3 minutes later I was brought a bottle of Sam Adams Boston lager instead of a draft by a very kind waitress. Even though I ordered a draft I didn't make a stink about it  because hey, beer! Taking another look around, the place was clean and if you like antique-ish looking cowboy stuff and garb this place is your mecca. There are cowboy hats, western style art and nick-nacks on the walls; even rusty looking horse shoe light fixtures. Also they had a sign that said free WiFi, which is all ways cool.Now to the important stuff; the food and beer. The beer was cold but not cold enough, I'd honestly have to say it was cool. You know a beer is cold when there's condensation on the bottle, a good example is when you bring out a glass of ice water and there is moisture on the outside of the glass, that means its cold on the inside. To say the least it was cool, tasted warmer then my water and therefore like crap. Any savvy beer drinker knows, especially those that prefer Sam Adams, that a good beer temperature is between 39 and 45 degrees; mine tasted more like in the low to mid 50's. Yuck, but I still drank it because I'm a man, and a man never wastes beer. I ordered another hoping for a better one, but I was disappointed again.The burger was good, very slightly pink even though I asked for well done, and was served on a perfectly toasted bun with too much lettuce and two slices of tomato. With half the lettuce off, the burger tasted excellent; the fries were also good and had just enough seasoning unlike other places that pile on the salt.The price for a burger and two beers was $18.32 with tax. That's $4.50 a beer and $7.95 for the burger. Not great but not bad for Vegas, I'd say it's the average around here. If you go there Mon-Fri between 11am-3pm you can get the burger for $5.95. 3
Great place to shop if your looking for high end brands. Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Burberry, Jimmy Choo, and much more. I have to say that the Forum shops has done many changes, from store closing to store re-modelings. And best of all they are opening an H&M in the middle of November...can I get a heck yes? That being said it took over the FAO toy store that was, I think 3 stories, so imagine H&M being that size...Say HELLO Flagship store and great deals. Great places to eat too from Roku Sushi (crab meat roll is yummy), Joe's, Max Brenner (awesome cookies I might add), BOA, and much more. Also, the Forum Shops have a great food court but a tad bit pricey. As for parking, it is a pain to look for parking and getting out after a concert is a major pain. Your better off taking a cab or valet. 4
My wife and I went out of our way to eat here after hearing about it on a business trip in florida of all places.  We were highly disappointed, she had a bland plate of house recommended spaghetti, our kids had what appeared to be microwaved burgers (though we know they weren't) and i had a meatloaf that could have been served on the pondarosa buffett.  We did order dessert because that was what semmed to be their speciaLty.  I enjoyed a nice chocolate cream pie and the wife.was dissapointed when hers (just like mine) showed up with more mmerange than pie.  I have heard a lot of buzz about this place in variuos circles, but we wont eat here again or recommend it either. 2
I seem to be on a burger kick lately and looked forward to trying Create.Like Cheeburger Cheeburger which I recently visited for the first time, Create challenges you to...well... Create your own burger. With plenty of cheeses and toppings to choose from, as well as a choice of buns, there should be something for everyone here. Where I tip the cap to Create, however, is that they do have a few "pre-Created" (?) burgers on the menu for those that aren't feeling creative.I went with the Impressionist, which had jalapenos, spicy mayo and pepper jack cheese.  Overall, a tasty burger, although I felt it could have been warmer (temp wise, not spicy wise). Not sure if the toppings may have cooled it off some.Since I'd just been to Cheeburger Cheeburger, I kept comparing the two burgers and had to say that I like the Cheeburger Cheeburger burger a little better. The sweet potatoes fries were actually a little too sweet, but I loved the regular fries.Never having had frozen custard before I went with two scoops: the flavor of the day, Cake Batter, and Chocolate.  WOW.  The frozen custard just blew my mind and my stomach is still happy.Service was super friendly and helpful.  And the prices were quite reasonable. More $$ than fast food but certainly less than other area burger specialty restaurants.The burning question - Would I go back? The frozen custard tipped my answer to YES.  My burger tip: Create your own with a couple toppings and go for the 1/3 pound. I bet that would have increased my enthusiasm on the burger.When I go back and get Creative with my own burger, I'll update my review. 3
I'm a huge Dunkin donuts coffee lover! With this location, it really depends on the day you come though for good service. There's been a couple times where I've asked for things like "a little ice" and my cup was so full I couldn't stick a straw into it or "black coffee" and have been handed a cup full of milk (both on weekdays) However, Weekend mornings are great. The staff is helpful and sweet. Great, clean atmosphere, really nice place to sit and catch up with friends. 3
It's our first time at Jasmine Buffet. The size of the restaurant and food selection took us by surprise. When you first walk in, there is a beautiful fountain. The food selection was from traditional Chinese buffet items to bbq ribs and chicken to pizza and chicken strips. Something for everyone!  But the best is the hibachi grill. Choose you mix of vegetables, rice, noodles, chicken, steak, beef, crab, shrimp and more...all cooked to order!  Enjoy! 4
What a great find for BBQ in Pittsburgh. Great atmosphere. Awesome staff. A great casual place with awesome food. I will be sure to come back. I recommend everyone get the dirty fries appetizer. 5
kelly, your review is totally right on. i actually wasn't going to write about it cause i thought, ugh, i went there on so many dates in college, i'll probably never go back again. i mean, it's good for what it is and where it is. and every college student looking for an affordable, nice date locale should go here. but if that's not you, pass it up. and hit the tutto on king instead.ahh... memories... 3
I've been there once.  I did happen to go on a night they were offering a 5.99 anything on the menu (ups the value point) special.  I took that chance to get both a big chicken and cheese quesadilla and big meaty burrito.  Both came with chips.  The chips were good but the salsa bar was of the refridgerated variety.  While that's obviously good toward keeping things fresh, the problem was everything was so near the freezing point that you couldn't each your chips with salsa.  The excellent queso stepped in for a save.  The two entrees were bland and the seating area left much to be desired.  All in all, it's not bad but not so good as I'd want to return.  It's a home grown effort with out the million dollar budget chain restaurants use to get the details right, I know.  It's when a small mom and pop's joint still manages to get the details worked out, you have found a winner. 2
For starter, I had a very basic salad: lettuce, mini tomatoes and a bit of parmesan. For main dish, I ordered a tartar.  Unfortunately, the restaurant doesn't offer fries so my main dish comes with the same small portion of salad I had before.  Speaking of the service, the waitress was nice, but fast to fill up our wine glasses.  In short, no more than an average experience. 2
Was looking for a place to get a glass of wine after a concert on sat night.  Wine loft looked like the place. Seat yourself but we didnt want to take all night so we went to the bar. After 5 minutes and yes I time these things...we had to flag down waitstaff to ask do we have a waitress. Oh year guy behind the bar will be over.So he finally makes it over with virtually no greeting and a bar towel in his hand. No small plates available on sat night after 12. Ok i guess you have to send the cook home sometime. The wine selection was weak. Their best wines were not even close to being the quality I expect. The price was in line for a great location but with the inattentive service and lack of class why would I pay 17/glass for a 2md tier cab?They did not have a selection of decent red blends.  We walked out without ordering. 1
Stopped in here for some drinks and food before we left. Not disappointed! I know practically nothing about beer, so I had to make my selection based on where it was from and the name. The beertender brought it over to our table and poured it for me and talked me through what it was and the tasting notes. I had the mussels, Belgian White style. They were tender and incredibly flavorful. The portion size of the mussels blew me away! There were so many, I couldn't finish! Which was a shame, I know. Mussels were served with a delicious loaf of a mild sourdough. The sourdough was perfectly balanced as to not over power the broth. Also had the truffled potato perogies. Don't pass these up!!! They were served with a topping of caramelized onions. Unreal!!! Service was great and food was amazing! Try the Pinot blanc wine. 4
Went to try the shawarma the other night, and was less than impressed. Curried rice also struck me as a bit odd. Originally from Thornhill, I can say it's very easy to find multiple options for superior shawarma 30 minutes north of this place. Have not tried anything else on the menu: this is a review of the shawarma dinner only. 2
I find Mexx looks nice but tends to be mediocre quality and high prices.  This store has a lot of sales but I have been told by a manager there that their items are sourced from different places and often are lower quality than those purchased at the main stores.  I have had issues returning goods here and find the customer service hit and miss.  They're alternately very nice and very rude.  I won't be shopping here again. 2
Truly a hidden gem in Tempe!! Charlie is absolutely wonderful and her salon is chic, clean and the employees are all great. I was offered a bottle of water as soon as I stepped in, and was greeted so warmly. I didn't have an appointment but they were able to fit me in no problem with only about a 20 minute wait time (totally normal for a walk in btw). Dee cut and styled my hair, and she went above and beyond to cater to exactly what I wanted! I love my haircut and I will definitely be back for a color job. Did I mention a shampoo and deep condition add-on is FREE?! They also have top of the line salon products for purchase! Charlie honored the 15% off my first cut which brought it down to only $15. You MUST check this place out, definitely one of the most affordable and chic hair salons you can go to! Not to mention it's local, and I love to support small businesses. Charlie's is a wonderful and relaxing experience with great results! Thank you Dee for my amazing haircut and styling! 5
I was craving a good burger for lunch today so I looked to my fellow Yelpers to direct me to the best place in Beachwood.  The Pub had the highest rating and I've never been there before.  I love good food and I love trying new places so I was sure it was going to be a win-win situation.  Unfortunately, it was not.I called in my order for carry out and the gentleman who took the order was very nice so no problems there.  He even repeated the whole order back to me to be sure he got it all correct: a traditional burger done medium-rare on a brioche bun with cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato, and basil aioli to be served with the standard chips (fries).  Perfect.  He said it would be ready in about 10 minutes- which I was super happy about as I was quite hungry by the time I ordered it.  No one was at the host station when I arrived, and there were only about 10 to 12 customers that I could see, but there was a server at a nearby table that called over and said she would be right with me so I just waited there.  A couple minutes later another server came to help since the first one hadn't freed up yet.  I gave the gentleman my name and he came back with my bag.  i paid and left.  When I arrived back at the office I was horribly disappointed with what I found.  They forgot the basil aioli so my burger was completely plain in terms of sauce (and there was no courtesy packets of mayo or mustard in the bag for me to throw on it in the absence of he aioli), the tomato stem was still playing an active roll in the tomato slices life, and when i cut the burger open it was overdone.  Definitely not the amazing burger experience I was hoping for.I still gave it 2 stars instead of just 1 on the grounds that they do have a diverse menu, the staff I encountered all seemed pleasant, and they had a super quick turnaround time on carry out orders at lunch time- which is rare in the Beachwood area.  Based on the other reviews, I want to believe my experience was just a fluke but I'm not really sure if I would be willing to potentially waste another $11 for one burger on the attempt. 2
The food is good but not excellent. They have a range of spicy and if you cannot handle a super spicy food, don't even ask for number 1! The place is nice. 3
Great waitress, great food except Taco's, service outstanding, price just okay. Noise with groups. But we will return, and soon! 3
The good: Internet price matchingThe bad: Everything else.I was shopping for a 75 inch plus 4k LED TV, and had my eye on a Sony 79 inch model for $7k.  The reason I went in is because of the no sales tax option. Anyways, I stared at it for about 5 minutes assuming someone, anyone might offer to help me. But nothing. So I went to a register in the TV area with 4 salesman standing there, and finally asked them to help me. I was assuming they work on commission but now I'm almost certain they dont. They said they were going to call someone, and I waited another 10 minutes and finally left. For a $7,000 product I kind of expected the most absolute basic minimum service, but I didn't get even that. It was a slow time of day, 11:30 am on a friday, and they werent busy at all. 4 of them were gathered at a cashier helping no one, and at the same time no one was available to help me. Very strange. Ill find somewhere else to spend my money I guess. 2
What is not to love about half-priced wine on Wednesdays?  I love the atmosphere here.  It is dark and sleek, very upscale.  The prices reflect that!I have eaten dinner here before and while it was delicious, it was bit too pricey for what I received.  But, for a nice bar and some finger foods, this is the place!  The flat bread pizza with fig, arugula and prosciutto is perfect for sharing with a friend.  I am not a carnivore, so I remove the prosciutto from mine.  The crust is crispy, the figs are heaven!The salads are also delicious-- the local heirloom salad is my favorite.  I love local foods, and this did not disappoint.--They also have great draft beers----Napa Cellars Chardonnay on Wednesdays is $6/glass... can you say DEAL!?----The bar is quiet.  A great place to catch up with a friend, or to plot revenge on an ex-boyfriend (hers, not mine)--The bathrooms are fantastic!  Love the faux crocodile floors!----Awesome outside seating----Park on the top-level of the parking deck that is attached to Southpark Mall, and it is an easy walk over... or valet-- 4
This company was very unpleasant to deal with - not only did the job take considerably longer than quoted (originally quoted 4-5 days but took multiple weeks for the tiling, many more to get issues fixed), but the crew sent to my house damaged stainless steel appliances and pieces of furniture. They also installed my upstsairs toilet wrong, resulting in water damage to my 1st floor ceiling - business owner stated it could have been coincidence. We had to hire a plumber who concluded it was how the toilet was reinstalled and get the owner to pay for our insurance deductible. The crew was late and also didnt show up multiple times on the job stating they hadnt been paid for their work. We were not happy with some of the workmanship and had to threaten to file a complaint with the ROC to get the owner to come to our house to view the work. We are still dealing with white grout (supposed to be mocha color) that the owner said was due to the reflective property of the grout (but grout in same vicinity is correct color). 1
I warn anyone considering this place to stay away! The property manager Rachel and her staff, are the rudest, most unprofessional and disrespectful people I have ever met in my life. They will seek any opportunity to steal your money and then tell you it is your fault. I will be filing a grievance with the property owner and pursuing legal action. Rachel will lie any opportunity she gets and then say " Well it was your own fault". Absolutely the worst!!I wonder how she sleeps at night?She antagonized the wrong person this time. 1
Sash and Bustle is a modern bridal boutique carrying a range of wedding dresses, bridesmaid dresses and accessories.  I went here with one of my bridesmaids on -yet another- dress hunting experience and I ended up finding exactly what I had been looking for all along - simple (but not too simple), modern and reasonably-priced wedding dress!  (My problem all along has been expensive taste but not wanting to fork over a ton a doug for one day...)I purchased my dress here and am very excited. So far, it's been a pleasure to deal with the girls here!The most expensive dress in the store is about $3000 and there's dresses in the ~$900 range that are beautiful.The bridesmaids line are also gorgeous!  I will return when it's time to dress the bridal party. 4
I eat a lot of Asian cuisine and it's probably the one food I go out for in abundance. It's a bit of a hole in the wall, been around for a long time from what people have told me and is well known.  Prices are good, food is rather average.Some dishes stand out, the green curry prawns is quite exceptional, the inverse of that is the pad thai, a mushy disappointment each time I've tried it there.  Service is good and the food comes out fast. Good selection of beers as well.  I'd rate Spicy Hut as cheap and cheerful. Go for cheap reasonably good food, don't expect anything remarkable and  you'll be ok.6/30 2
Horrible lady named phelita was arguing with me with what was on the food just bad spot don't eat here 1
The only reason I am giving this show 3 stars is because I am a huge Mindfreak fan, but I was dissapointed with BeLIEve. I was hoping for more (like what he does on his show) but it was all crazy with some random story line that was just so confusing to follow- if it ain't broke dont fix it (regarding his tv show and sticking to that!)I was sad because I was looking forward to Criss Angel, not this...other than that there wasn't a lot of interaction with the audience, and the sidekicks on the show were just not cutting it! 3
Cute place, kinda tucked away. The food was okay. I got bacon, egg and cheese biscuit and he got some sort of chicken biscuit with a not so appealing sauce on it. I got food poisoning after visiting. So we won't be rushing back. 1
We went for dinner on Sunday evening.  The restaurant was not crowded, and it was Memorial Day weekend, so perhaps everyone was traveling.  I've been going to Avanti for thirty years and always had a good experience.  This is the first time that I was so utterly unimpressed and even commented that I would not be returning.  Not only was the food mediocre but the service was impudent at best.Our waiter asked if we wanted drinks.  I asked for a listing of wines by the glass, and he basically refused to give me a written listing.  He asked whether I wanted red or white, and I said red.  My friend said she preferred a red zinfandel and asked if they had zinfandel. I said I would like to know something about the wine I was ordering, and the waiter said they had a good Rombauer in both cabernet and zinfandel and described it in glowing terms, adding that they also had house wine.  He mentioned $8 and we thought he was talking about the Rombauer.  We ordered the Rombauer - one cab and one zin.  When we got the bills, the wine was $18, so we asked if he had billed us for two glasses.  No, he said, the Rombauer was $18 a glass.  I said "you didn't tell us that" and he said he was sure he had....  Well, we looked at the wine list by the glass on the way out of the restaurant.  The Rombauer wasn't even listed, and they had no wines by the glass for more than $15.  We felt the whole thing was a rip-off and will not be returning. 1
Horrible.  Terriyaki chicken was inedible...pad thai and mussaman curry was fair.  Service was good though....Very disappointed! 1
Mandy in the lobby bar is fantastic! The atmosphere is relaxed and loungey , a DJ plays great music. Service is always excellent they just need to stop serving glasses of wine from bottles that have been opened the day before. 4
Ask for the Chicago style spices on your pepperoni pizza!! It will blow your taste buds!! 5
The fish and chips are great as well as the fish tacos.   Service was quite poor though.  Only saw waitress once since ordering our food. No waters on our table and would've had another beer.  Oh well. 3
Amazing, better than any Indian restaurants I've tried in Calgary, spicy butter chicken and great fish pakora.  You guys should open  restaurant 5
Good place to go after shopping to get a quick bite with the family, this place was surprisingly family friendly and inexpensive. Our waitress was sweet and prompt. She recommended the chicken quesadilla and it was really good. I wish I would've tried the wings though after seeing other reviews. 4
During my recent trip to Vegas, we made a point to stop at three restaurants including Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill. I had the New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin and it was worth every penny. The flavor was outstanding and the pork tenderloin was tender. The sweet potato tamale with crush pecan butter was a perfect side for the tenderloin. The portion sizes were also good. I was satisfied and a little full when we left the restaurant. A couple of notes:1) Reservations are NECESSARY at this restaurant. We made the mistake of showing up for dinner at 7:30pm on a Tuesday night, only to find out that we would have to wait until 10:30pm for a seat! So we had to make a reservation for the following night, which threw off our agenda a little. Just be sure to make your reservation at least a day ahead, and they will secure it with a credit card.2) if you want to have dessert, you may want to skip the assorted bread basket that they bring out before your entree arrives. It's hard to resist, but you won't have room for dessert if you eat the breads. They are filling. 4
This is my favorite local restaurant. I absolutely love their scampi.  They are huge!  This is a nice place to go for good service and great food. 4
Horrible. Out of chicken at 5 pm on a tuesday? Bad management if any here. Spent s $40 on 11 drumsticks, 3 wings and 2 thighs on a 16 piece meal. Then all the breading fell off the chicken before we could eat. Very greasy and very sad. Either kfc don't care or this manager don't care... it shows 1
Great service, great beer, fun employees.  Food is okay, too.  Often they will hold guests waiting for seats to open and then fill for a large group that is coming in - often over an hour later.  (even waited for a table, ordered, ate and the other party had still not arrived)Other than the wait when there are many open table tops, it's a good place to have a good beer! 4
We came to Clubhouse today for the kids eat free special which was a good offer. They serve breakfast all day which is awesome and have really good drink specials. My kids and I had breakfast and my SO had the build your own burger. The burger and fries were average nothing special. The breakfast was good though, I had pancakes, eggs and bacon. My only complaint is that our waitress sucked. She was kind of rude and standoffish... Making us feel like she just didn't care. Other than that everything was good. 4
I waited outside for 45 mins just to get told hat I wasn't able to get in , the staff played around like fools throwing candy into people's mouth , do not WASTE YOUR TIME OR EFFIRT COMING ESPECIALLY IF YOURE A TORIST 1
The food was great but the service was horrendous! Lorraine was totally rude and had a disgusting attitude ! I will NOT be back 2
Best pizza! Very convenient from the house. The menu is great. Chicken fingers, chef salad, pizza and a pitcher of beer. We hit this place at least a couple times a month. Only suggestion would be to add a few more beer on draft selections than just bud light. 4
Airline and Security staff were somewhat more pleasant than I recall during previous visits. Dining options have improved. A group of three had three different entrees for lunch. Everyone was happy. 4
Hubby and I love this place and a regular haunt for us.  My Hubby's fav: adobo fried rice and spam musubi.  My favorite: pinakbet and Thelma's special.  This is a must try for anyone craving Filipino food. 4
My biggest problem here was expectations everyone had set the bar so high. So I was expecting something much better than I was. Wasn't terrible. But wouldn't  say it's the best second-best in the nation I had the Two meet combo with pork ribs and pulled pork. The ribs were okay. Nothing special. And the meat involved on. I'm not a fan of vinegar barbecue sauce. So the Georgia peach was my favorite. The cornbread was good. The atmosphere was really cool. Overall Its too bad the expectations were so high I think I would've liked it better. 3
I can not count how many times they have "not received " our doctors prescription. This time I am three days out of an appendectomy and my five year old has an ear infection with a ruptured ear drum. I have a friend drive over from the EAST side to pick up her prescription and ---- you guessed it ---- they have "not received " it. Never. Again. 1
I have to say, I was a bit bummed that the last night we were in Vegas, we were not going to a club. But lo and behold, we practically ended up at one. Bond has a nightclub-esque feel to it. The music was awesome, the go-go dancers in their lil boxes were cute and had a cute theme going on. And being a girl, there were places to wander and sit since it's in the casino. The LED lights behind the bar were an eyeful, in a good and bad way lol. There was a wide array of people hanging out there, drinking, dancing and having an awesome time. And must say, their drinks were on point. They were surprisingly moderately priced and yummy. Their signature Cosmo was an orgasmic mouthful of a drink.  Love this place! This is now going to be a go-to spot for me :) 4
Great restaurant and great atmosphere.I had an awesome great time with friends.I loved the tapas and the excellent paella.I can't wait to come back soon. 5
I was torn between giving Jack's 2 or 3 stars.  I have eaten here at least 10 times of times, and I have never been blown away, but they're pretty consistently okay, when it comes to Jewish style deli food.The dining area is pretty clean and very open, and during the brunch and meal-time rushes, it's packed.  It's the go-to place for non-Kosher Jewish-style deli food in the Heights neighborhoods of Cleveland's near-East side.  It's competition is Corky & Lenny's, which is about 5 miles and 20 minutes away, which is better in my opinion, but not by a lot.Let's start with the service, however, which has never been great. We have had some okay service, but mostly sub-par.  It's like they train their servers and bussers to keep a straight face and hide in the back in between forays out to the dining area.  If I were to rate the service on a scale of 1-10, I'd give it a 4.As I said the food is perfectly okay.  How can you screw up hot pastrami or corned beef, when all you have to do is heat it and slice it and pile it on rye ... no complaints there, but it's certainly no Slyman's.  I saw a lot of other reviewers really liked their matzoh ball soup, and I don't get what they see.  I find the soup bland and the matzoh ball even blander.  It tastes to me like chicken bullion consume and a salt-free matzoh ball.  I wouldn't waste my time or ingest the calories.  I really hope that no real chickens had to lose their lives for this soup, because their flavor got lost along the way and their lives were lived in vain.I also saw a lot of people comment that they liked the pickles; again, I find them very bland ... essentially salt-brined cucumbers.  It's rare to find delis that make really good pickles, especially since they have to make so much to meet the demand of a pretty busy clientele, so there isn't time for them to really sit and soak up the vinegar and other flavors.  I usually pick up one of the pickles from the plate more by habit, and I almost always set it back down after the first disappointing bite.I will say that their breakfasts are perfectly good and their sandwiches are fine too - fine, not amazing.  Unless this is your only exposure to this style of food, I can't see why anyone would rave about it.  If I weren't so lazy, I'd avoid Jack's all together and drive the extra 20 minutes to Corky & Lenny's in Woodmere.I'll go back to Jack's again, but it's doubtful I will ever do so with great enthusiasm.  The food passes, but it doesn't inspire, and it all feels like you're paying $1 - $2 more than it's worth. 3
The pantry was great came from a long trip had a great lunch will go there again great service and clean 5
Pro Misting was outstanding from first contact through follow up after the installation. They are professional, do what they say they'll do and are polite and thorough.   I highly recommend their services.   Scott T. 5
Not a huge fan at all. I heard great things about this place and my expectations were high.I got a cupcake that completely fell apart when I took a small bite it was pretty dry.I bought a dozen cookies and they were hard and also dry.The pepperoni bread was pretty good.Does not live up to the hype. 2
Great experience using simple electronic! Answered my call, set up Maurice to come by the same day forEstimate, and came back a few days later completely prepared, on time and job was completed in the time they said! Maurice was awesome - completely trusted he was doing the job as if it was his home! WillDefinitely be recommending and using themAgain for next project!  Really appreciate finding a derive company that actually provided exceptionalService!! 5
I have been successfully treated by Dr. Xiao for 2 very different conditions.1) I suffered a CTD / RSI hand/wrist injury due to my profession.  Rehabilitation doctors are not trained to detect minor amounts of inflammation and use a pain scale of 1-10 to quantify a patient's condition, or use expensive and uncomfortable diagnostic tests.  For a minor inflammatory condition, hand therapy and anti-inflammatory medicines were the prescribed course of action.  Unfortunately, a minor onset of more inflammation from overuse is not detectable by the hand therapist either, who is also trained with the pain scale.  Dr. Xiao is an expert detecting minor amounts of inflammation and could identify both where and how I sustained it.  She used a combination of deep tissue diagnosis and healing massage, herbal remedies, and acupuncture to remove the inflammation.  Now, I am working with both Dr. Xiao and the hand therapist to build muscle and function.  I have regained a tremendous amount of strength and am well on the way towards a full recovery.2) I had a persistent skin irritation lasting over a year that my dermatologist could not identify and prescribed steriodal creams for.  Dr. Xiao recognized it right away as an energy imbalance in the liver channel.  She used a combination of herbal remedies and acupuncture and cleared it away permanently after 4 months of treatments.She is easily one of the best diagnosticians and practitioners that I have ever met, and she truly loves her work.  I cannot say enough about how she has dramatically improved my life. 5
I discovered this place while I was on vaca in Hawaii. I was so excited to find that there was one in vegas. Originally I was going to give a 4 star review, but the hostess was so bad, she cost them a star. As I walked in she was texting on her cellphone, openly. She rudely insisted that she could seat my party until they were all here, even tho I said they were parking the car and walking in. She showed us the table and literally dropped the menus at the table. When I made the reservation I specified I needed a hair chair so before she left I requested a highchair. She barely glanced back and said they don't have highchairs they have boosters.  My son cannot sit up by himself yet, so he could not use the booster. This is a Japanese BBQ place, so I could not assist with cooking, I had to hold my son throughout my dinner. Besides the useless hostess, the food is amazing here. The happy hour will only give you about a dollar off, but considering how many dishes you typically order, it's worth it. Don't be cheap with the meat! The hanger steak is about $7 but totally worth ordering at least 3 servings!I went back in a few months later per the request of Aki, the VP. The "manager" Tracy was so resistant to help us. She only stopped by to review the bill embarrassingly in front of my guests. Tracy felt that a $12 discount compensating for my previous experience. That's ok. I won't have to waste anymore time or money at that place. 1
Met a friend for coffee and a sweet there last week and we both loved it! Coffee and teas were tasty as were the delicious vegan squares. Staff is really friendly. A great experience overall! 5
Take the time to drive to How's road for breakfast.  Dirty interior, average food.  One is afraid to imagine what the kitchen looks like. 2
So I got an message from Ken the same day I posted this review. He apologized and said "I could definitely put a free medium sub credit on your account and encourage you to try us again?  Thank you for the feedback!"I responding telling him I would try again today.... I guess I will update again later.Once I got over the fact that a hot sub would not be hot (its warm), and the size is not the same as most sub shops. It wasn't great, but it wasnt bad. So I will upgrade it to three stars. I have to admit that some of the options are a nice change of pace from the usual places I order for lunch. Hopefully they can make some changes in the future. 3
This is a great local restaurant. There's always something new to try on the specialty drink menu it's creative and delicious. We started with a chorizo quesadilla. It was just spicy enough to wake up your taste buds and let you enjoy the flavor. then I had a pear sandwich.  Huh, pears? Okay you're more traditional. Try the meatball sub you can't go wrong. Then we finished it all off with a piece of tiramisu the size of my fist. We were going to sit on the patio and see how many cocktails it takes to go from lunch to dinner but there is that thing called a job that I have to go to. Will be back for the food, the drinks, the service, artwork...it's a great place. 5
This hotel is probably meant for little kids or for families that want the Disney side experience of Las Vegas. As a twenty-something this hotel was unpleasanbt. I hotel hopped several hotels and this was low on the list.I had a smoker's room which a queen sized bed and an abysmal view of a cement wall and a sewage pipe. They had that restaurant where people insult you and your family and a dirty humid feeling casino on the ground floor. I ate breakfast at one random small restaurant near the entrance the day I left and spent as little time there as possible. The walkway leads to the New York New York hotel and is near the big attractions but a little further away (pretty much on the border of the main hub of activity)They do not accept cash for anything and I had to pay a fee for some silly reason as well. But I excluded that fact out of my rating otherwise it would have been 1 if I held a grudge. The other rooms might have been better since again I'll say that the hotel is catered towards families and I took the single smoker's room to attend my sister's wedding. The hotel has a view of the strip and the neat roller coaster from the NY hotel but unfortunately the shoved the smoker rooms in a little hovel of a corner somewhere in the dungeon! 2
Respectable employees and food. If there's an issue with the order, they will make it right. 4
We drove past the restaurant on the way to a different Indian buffet, but thought we should give it try. I had 2 kids with me who are somewhat picky eaters so when we saw pizza the kids were excited.First we noticed there were no meat dishes so my son was disappointed (hoping to see butter chicken) and the pizza was too spicy for my other kid. For the price I paid for both kids was not worth it. They didn't eat enough to justify the price of the buffet for kids. Even though the spread of foods was larger than some buffets I've seen the selection wasn't that great. Some of the naan bread was not fresh (some tough and hard I had to pull with my teeth).My son did enjoy the sweets, but most likely we won't go back here again for the very reason there was no meat. 2
I tried to make a reservation for my wedding with Michael Rosetti and he was so rude to me. I dealt with him through email and on the phone and he was especially mean and sarcastic on the phone. I told him not to even bother, I didn't even want to do business with them. I have no problem giving money to people who are nice, but someone who talks to you like they don't even want your business? Well, they ain't getting it! This was the first bad review I wrote on a company, but I feel these things needed to be said. 1
Second stop on mini food tour of the Container Park.  We shared a combo plate of three tacos with chips and rice and beans.  For the tacos, we picked the al pastor, asada, and carnitas.  All three were good, but too drippy/runny to be great.  (Warning: Be prepared to make a big mess!)The highlight was the horchata which was the cinnamon-iest I've ever tasted, and I mean that in a good way.  However, a word of advice.  As those of you may have tried the silly cinnamon challenge will know, cinnamon does not dissolve in water.  That means that all the tiny particles of ground cinnamon sink to the bottom pretty quickly.  Just be aware of that, and give it a good stir pretty often with your straw to avoid a sip of cinnamon sludge. 3
Decent, reasonably priced gyro. One large hunk of fat in the pork gyro (lamb sure, but pork?). Flavourful enough, but could use more tzatziki. 3
How to start? Got to Monical's at 7 on a Saturday night. Waited 5 minutes at the hostess station to be seated and the restaurant was fairly empty.  The hostess gave us a fine table and was super friendly.  And it stopped there. Really! We waited another 10-15 minutes for ANYONE to take our order, offer us water, acknowledge our presence, something! Nope.Several servers were cleaning other tables, sweeping the floor and reorganizing chairs throughout the restaurant. Not one noticed a table of 6 people. Other customers received their food, so somehow a server noticed them at some point. Finally, we just got up and left. And NOT ONE SERVER NOTICED! So I can't rate their food because how would I know?  We did have a wonderful dinner....somewhere else. 1
My favourite bar in Montreal that I have experienced, yet.I went on a Tuesday around 8 PM and it was the most crowded bar I had found! That's what I look for, though. The more crowded, the better.I took a seat at the bar and was enjoying the music (GREAT MUSIC. The Hives, The  Strokes, some Daft Punk!), when I was soon handed a quite large menu of drinks! Plenty of variety with mixed drinks in well-sized mason jars, cocktails, and a variety of beers, Bacardi, Tequila, and so much more. They will make any drink you tell them to, if you have a special request, so don't be afraid to get creative.I started off the night with a regular sized Blue Caillou (mason jar drink). Terrific taste and watching the bartenders' drink-making acrobatics was much fun. However, it hardly gave me a buzz at all. So, next was a shot of Bacardi. And next, a shot of tequila. I forget which it was, but the bartender said that it was 2 months aged in a barrel and it started with a  "C." Was a moderately priced one, in relation to the other tequilas. Shot prices are not listed on the menu, but I would say, depending on what you're getting, it could range from 4$ to 9$.I left giggling like an idiot and smiling all the way home. That's a pretty good sign, right?If you're sitting at the bar, ask if Fred is working that night. He was my bartender and a delight to talk to and be served by. 4
After my first visit here last Friday, all I can say about this place is that it's just ok. It's relatively new (occupies the space that used to be the ever-missed Blvd room), so it's decorated nicely and was nice and clean. It was normal-club type pricey but luckily me and my friends planned ahead, got on guestlist and went early to get in for free (note: anyone can get in free before 11 on Fridays, not just the ladies, which is nice). Otherwise I'm assuming it may have been anywhere from $10-$20 for cover. The music was sort of disappointing: it was a lot of outdated top 40, mixed with R&B, neither of which I am a fan of. Plus, there were no drink specials and were also quite pricey, $6 for bar rail and $7 upwards for import/premiums, so make sure you either pack your wallet, balance your credit card or fill the tank before you arrive! To sum up, if money is not a factor for you, and all you're looking for is a fun night out with friends, I would definitely recommend this place. 3
Good food, but service was slow. Overall a big improvement from the previous Molson restaurant. 4
I liked this place till we just witnessed two colored males be denied access after driving a long distance for a friends birthday because they had Jordan shoes !!!!! Really.... Unbelievable they did bag their pants, no color claiming, they were better dressed then us... I could not and will not recommend this place for the casual dresser who wears BASKETBALL SHOES!!!! 2
It's a pity I have to leave lower stars, because I do like the building and the staff is friendly / restaurants are great.My Low stars comes mainly from the fact that the two times I stayed there, I paid good money to get premium views in the best rooms and even checked in ahead of time to make sure that we got the views -- but promises were not kept and upon arrival we were put in different rooms. This last time, it caused us to stay in our room almost the whole first day waiting around for them to put us in the room they promised us in the first place.The second thing that got me a little concerned is that both of the rooms we had this last time had seriously stained sheets, and it's obvious what kind of stain it was.. gross.Overall, I wont be staying here anymore, which is unfortunate -- again, there is a lot of good potential here, so long as they clean their act up in these areas mentioned above. 2
Worse service ever!! The waitress sent the wrong food and drinks even we had been waiting for 2 hrs for our order. After all the long waiting, of course we had to wait for the check, wait to pay, the waitress told us we supposedly to pay 18% of tips! WTF! Won't visit this restaurant ever again! 1
Eat here fairly often and food is always consistently good. Casual dining room and also great for takeout. 4
Food is alright. Ambiance is boring. Service is always great though! Good happy hour menu. I do like that they have a bar area with a couple of tv's. I just wish they had better food options (like sushi) and a better ambiance. 3
Fantastic food and service. Reasonably priced and everything we ordered was exceptional. A great evening. 5
Ate here last night for a large birthday party. Ordered a NY strip steak and specified that I like it well done, no pink whatsoever and that if they needed to butterfly the steak then it's perfectly fine (cutting the steak in half to open up the center). When I got my steak, I cut into the center and it was entirely pink and immediately blood gushed out all over my plate. The reason I prefer well done, is because blood makes me incredibly nauseous. I asked the waitress to correct it and she took it back.  Brought it back out about 5 minutes later and it was barely a change. What surprised me most is that they didn't just start a new steak and bitterly cut it as I had requested. Instead, she came back out with the same steak, now almost entirely black!! The inside was well done of course, but my steak was a completely dry, chalky hockey puck. I just boxed it up and took it home for my dogs. I understand that when asking for a steak well done, it will be dryer than usual. But because of the constant on and off the grill my steak at elephant bar was like jerky. Will not be returning. 2
The food that I had was really good. I got the Chicken Penne Pesto and my friend got the fruit de mar. Mine was delicious and my friend also loved his dish. The only downside was that two of the mussels on his seafood plate were closed (as in you cannot eat them because they're poisonous). If he had not known that, he could have gotten really sick. Also it was not as if the chef could have missed the closed mussels as they were carefully placed around the edge of his plate. The service was also pretty slow but not excruciatingly bad. Overall it was good and I actually would come here again (my dish was Delish) 3
Didn't honor my coupon (2 days before expiration). Reminded me of the grief I got trying to use another coupon couple weeks prior at the drive through,,,didn't get the discount then either. Guess these coupon books are just junk mail. I'll go get something healthy next time instead.  Aside from the grief, this location is average at best.  Disappointed. 1
I was excited about having Vietnamese food here in Gastonia. The service was good and the food was good, which earned this review three stars..a fair amount of stars..how ever..the food is way too overprized. I ordered a vermicelli bowl combo which was $11. The bowl was too small and the amount of food given was also a small portion for the amount paid. I only had maybe 3 pieces of shrimp and two pieces ofpork and small amount of noodles. Everything else was just shredded lettuce and two egg rolls. I make vietnamese pho at home and a pack of vermicelli noodles averages about $1-$2 and can serve up to 4-6 people. The other ingredients is not that expensive either. I wont be going back because they are charging Charlotte prices. This is Gastonia, the market is different. Please lower your prices or you willfor sure lose customers. If your prices are lowered, more people will come and customers will return. I willreturn and I will bring my friends. 3
Loved the avocado egg rolls. Unique flavor. Kahlua cheesecake was out of the world! 4
Once again, I had a great experience at this Dolce' location.Just got a fabulous cut from Ashley. She gave me a little more bangs, really made a difference for the look we were wanting. She and Marena are great. 4
This restaurant was not one of the best.. It was way overpriced.. Food was mediocre.. The ambience was nice however. Would not recommend this. Try something else for Indian such as the Indian Masala Bistro. 3
I have lived here for 7 years. I have to say that I've seen good and bad times for this complex. As with any complex. There's a reason I've stayed so long. Despite the occasional scorpion, there isn't a bug issue. My neighbors are friendly, and issues with troublesome neighbors are addressed quickly. Most important to me is that I rarely hear my neighbors inside my apartment. The walls are very thick. The stray cat issues have been resolved and they have cracked down on keeping the grounds looking beautiful all the time. This last summer and so far this year, the pools were always beautiful and clean. If I have any complaint, it's those pesky scorpions and some of my neighbors are hard on the chairs by the pool. Those need replacing too often. 4
Avoid if you're headed anywhere off the strip. I was going downtown to meet up with family. And I get it - downtown is FAR compared to other hotels. But if your drivers don't want to go there, don't offer the fare. I usually just grab a taxi but the last time I was here, a taxi to Paris was $30 so thought I'd give a shuttle a chance. I made a point to ask when the next shuttle would be going downtown before buying a ticket and was told the shuttle was waiting across the street. Headed across the street, only to be told to wait at the #8 sign for the next bus...and proceeded to wait for another 45 minutes. I don't even think the shuttle driver would have taken me unless I put up a fuss asking when my shuttle would be there. Left the airport @445pm, stopped at Venetian, mirage, TI, then to circus circus (@522), Stratosphere (@526) and finally downtown @540. FYI - the shuttles don't seem to be assigned a route. They are told which routes to pick up based on the number of people waiting. It irked me to tip my driver since he didn't even want to go downtown. But I've worked the customer service/tourist industry for too long not to. Tipped him $10 for a fare that was only $9. Whatever. Just glad to be off that bus. 1
We went to the pizza making class.  It was amazing! There was so much food that we could hardly even eat our pizzas, which was not a problem because they had boxes to take yours home. Wonderful history lesson, delicious food, a very intimate setting, and some fun characters. All in all well worth it! 5
This is a great little cafe in a terrible location, but I hope for the best as businesses try to resurrect this area.  I hope it sticks.The cafe was cute and comfortable.  A small bar area seats about 8-10.  A back patio is great if you happen to be out with your pooch and want to stop in.For a late dinner, we were presented with a dinner menu that had about 5-8 choices for the day.  Everything on the menu sounded good.  Snooty food....my kind of food.  A dinner salad preceded our meal that was mixed greens with a raspberry vinaigrette with shaved Parmesan.  Not bad.  Not much to it, but not bad.  For my entree, I ordered the portabella mushroom stuffed with corn risotto surrounded with red beet and cabbage slaw.  Sounds amazing, right?  It was bland.  Could have been a fabulous meal, but it was definitely lacking something.  My mom ordered the black bean zucchini burrito.  It looked beautiful, but again, the taste was lacking.I give them an A for effort.  The cafe is great and the menu presentation is awesome.  The food just needs some more flavor.We need more places like this in the area.  I really hope they stick around. 2
Overall meh. I ordered pork souvlaki pita meal to go and wish I had not.The food was mediocre at best. I got pork pita sandwich, fries and salad. The porc in the pita was premade and slightly warmed up however that was not the excuse for the pork to taste like I am chewing on pieces of rubber covered with tzaziki. Salad and fries left me for wanting more as well. Fries were fast food style, premade and prepackaged tastings like something from Burger King not a greek style eatery. Salad was also premade very early in the day or perhaps even the day before. Lettuce was saggy and so was red onion that usually keeps better. Green peppers in a greek salad? I guess red peppers are too expensive :(. Luckily, there were couple of kalamata olives and some feta cheese so it can be called "greek". And no rice. For $13.74 tax in, I will not be returning to give it a second chance. There are much better take out places in the hood for $10. 2
My review is about the Brazilian wax I got done by Kathy (I'm pretty sure...) She was sweet as heck, but maybe a little too sweet. She didn't want to make me feel uncomfortable I guess, so she rarely asked me to open my legs wider, move my leg this way, hold this, etc etc. I'm pretty sure a lady knows what she's getting into when she takes of her pants for someone to put hot wax onto it. I had to tell her, "don't be scared to tell me how to move!" But still, she seemed to hesitate. All in all, it took a lot longer than I'm used to and she left various small patches. Good price though, compared to other Brazilian waxers around town. 3
Hhgregg is the worst!  Where do I even start.  I purchased refrigerator, stove, and dishwasher in February...   Saving money was not worth it.  First, the delivery guys come in said the refrigerator will not fit.  Well i did the measurements and it would.  They spoke spanish to each other.  All of the sudden the refrigerator was damaged and the did not let me see it. Delivered another on Sunday.    Second, they got the stove in,  they supposively shut off the gas as my valve is in the basement.  They claimed it could not move the stove all the way back, that i need a gas company to move the line.  This was all done on Friday.   Monday, I go in my kitchen i smelled gas.  Called the gas company to find out HHGREGG did not use the shutoff valve but loosed a bolt.  I watched them, what did i know.   Then i got Mertz to come to move gas line.  $135 later to find out they can move the stove back.   Thirdly, they put my dishwasher in crookedly.  They had to come back.  They unscrewed one side and shoved it in.  Then the disposal kept backing up in my dishwasher. I called they said that was normal.  I said no it is not.  The same guy came, moved one piece said should be good.  Heck no, called again, they made service call again.  The,people never called for time range, i called they said it is scheduled and no time. That i cannot call until after 530 if they do not show. Then called nothing, called the next day. Finally they got someone there.  He said it was hooked up wrong a suppoively fixed it.  Guess what it was not fixed and seriously another repeat, no call for time just got off after an 1.5 hour time, mostly hold and transfers.  No time again.  They to call me and suppoively sending me 100 dollars, better not be a gift card.  Bc they cannot pay me a milloin dollars,to EVER shop at another HHGREGG again! 1
Food was very good but service is below par. Wasn't crowded at all but still took forever for someone to seat us. Just a person yelling across the room telling us "Someone will seat us soon" I recommend it for the food but don't be in a hurry to be seated. 3
Bad service + bad message = canceled membership.  If the lazy girl you set your appointment with says she will match you and your girlfriend up with who you've had before and then you get the therapist that your girlfriend has had multiple times and she gets the new girl that sits in the chair the whole time you look like an idiot.  Then when you bring it to the girls attention at the front desk and get attitude - really?  I get it, I wouldn't be excited about working for $10/hr either but you didn't get drafted for the job you choose it so give it a little effort and check your ego when someone has a complaint. 1
Service was great, atmosphere was okay but the food was sub par. I ordered the avocado eggs Benedict with home fries on the side. The eggs were overcooked and the hollandaise sauce was definitely not made in house. If I were ever to come back here. I would go with a different choice. 2
I visited Brar today for the first time with my family. We were told that we would have to wait for 40 mins but were given a table in around 25 mins which was impressive. The decor and ambience is appealing for an Indian buffet restaurant. I was pleasantly surprised when they clicked our picture and printed it for us as a family day gift.We were served by 3 servers(as per name tags: Aman, Khushvir and Manpreet), all were quick and courteous. Would like if they interact more with the guests rather than just clearing plates. The food was average, nothing exciting. Ample options available for a veggie person. What I liked:-Shahi Paneer: Was really delicious. Paneer was soft and fresh. -Fried rice: The fried rice had a nice schezuan flavor.  -Pani Puri: Was mouth watering. One if the best that I've had in GTA. The dosa, chilli paneer and veg Manchurian could be a lot better. Another suggestion I have is to keep the plates at multiple locations instead of having it only near the soup section. Overall was impressed. Would give 5 stars if the food quality improved. Everything else was perfect. 4
A south france style place. Had the Prefix menu with garden greens salad, sole, and some custard no quite like creme brule. The rice and vegetables were good and buttery! It was really hot in Toronto, and they had the front wide open and no air conditioning. Other than that, it was pretty good! The staff was good, but forgot to bring out half of our desserts, until we asked for them (when the other desserts were all finished). 3
Terrible service. I've been here two hours and haven't gotten my appetizer yet. I will never come back here. 1
DO NOT GO TO ZEN DOG. Had the worst experience today with my little guy. Dropped him off and initially was told they're not busy it shouldn't take long. After 4 hours I decided to call and was told he would be ready in about 30 mins, but they'll also call me as soon as he's done. About hour later still no phone call so I reach back and they say he's been ready. They said they told me 30 mins he would be ready. However they did not call me like they stated. Now for the huge problem. Once I pick up my dog I set him in my car and notice blood all over the place. Not just a little blood. He was bleeding so bad all over my car seat. I picked him up and ran back into Zen Dog and asked what did you do to my dog? The groomer then states "Oh no I thought the bleeding stopped." I say what do you mean you thought the bleeding stopped? Why didn't you tell me you cut my dog? She then proceeded to tell me it's normal when you cut the nails sometimes you hit a vein. I've been taking my dog to the groomers for 8 years and not once has my dog ever bleed. In any case I proceed to ask her why you didn't tell me you cut my dog before I left? She was trying to cover it up by keeping my little guy longer till the bleeding stopped so I wouldn't notice she hurt him. When I called her out she then told me she had no clue it was bleeding. Just a few mins ago when I walked in she made the comment, " I thought the bleeding stopped." Obviously she was lying to me she knew all along. I know accidents happen and I would've accepted that, but the fact that this so called groomer did not tell me when I picked him up that she made an accident and cut his nails to short which made him bleed is unforgivable. I can't tell you how much blood I had all over my car and my clothes. Not to mention my poor little guy suffering. I had to end up taking him to the vet afterwards to get his paw bandaged up. Please do not take your dog to Zen Dog. I will certainly be reaching out to the owner on Monday. Like I said accidents happen, I get that, but she tried to hide it and did not have the courtesy to tell me she made a mistake. No, she let me put my dog in my car to get blood all over the place. And didn't even bother to bandage my little man up. Poor little guy must have been in pain. Do not visit Zen Dog.... 1
Food was great!First time trying this place out for lunch and definitely won't be my last. Service was friendly. Will recommend this place to friends and family. I had the chicken teriyaki plate I believe.Great job 5
never try the smoothie. worst one i ever have with full of water, sense of yogurt and bit of berry. 1
Mama Mia Too wants to be a good restaurant.  It is a charming place inside, and the staff seems very earnest.  It wants to be a place where regulars go, sometimes with friends, to enjoy fine dining.  The food does not meet those expectations.  My own sense is that the volume of business is not enough to produce excellence from their extensive and ambitious menu. 2
We had a fantastic experience here! We went on a Thursday evening and with the misters on, it was still very pleasant sitting outside, even in June. The wine list was extremely affordable - most between $25 and $60. For Scottsdale, this is a steal! We shared an appetizer and a main entree. The appetizer was delish. Grilled bread (perfectly grilled, not so hard that it hurts your gums) with three spreads - an amazing goat cheese and marscapone, eggplant, and hummus. Also, they serve house bread with a great sun dried tomato butter. For our entree, we shared the fish special, which was a sea bass with artichokes, fingerling potatoes, and spinach. Fantastic. The service was also great. I've come to expect any service in Scottsdale to be rude but  this place wasn't! Maybe we were lucky, but I enjoyed our experience. 5
One of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. Delicious, fresh  food and a huge variety of menu items makes this a must visit. I love bringing out of town guests and first timers there and seeing all of them consistently leave happy. My wife and I enjoy a warm welcome from the owner each time we go, as do many of the regulars, making it feel like we're guests in her home. Been going for almost 8 years and have yet to be disappointed.  Simply put, Lang Van rocks. 5
Although the Japanese Friendship Garden is very beautiful and serene, i am disappointed in the ironic unfriendliness that my family and i were treated with. I suggested that we come here, bc i wanted to show my cousin who was visiting from out of town the few spots in Phoenix that promote diversity and culture appreciation. The first surprise was that there was a fee to enter the park; i would think that such a small public area would be free entry. You can not spend more than 10 minutes walking around this garden so i think charging $7 per person is ridiculous. Secondly, my family had brought a picnic and our dog to enjoy lunch at the garden (before leaving we called to ask if dogs were allowed, and we got no response). However, upon entering we were greeted with the sign that says no dogs or food. This is an outdoor space, why can't dogs be there as well?? Anyways, our visit was cut short because we were told that our dog was not allowed in the garden. All-in-all, i will not be returning to this institution. 2
I just check in this place and we sign in for 2 , after us we have other 2 in line . There 3 white guys came and sign in after us and the waitress took them into the table right away and no ask who came first ..... WTH is this consider discrimination ? Or what ? Then we were seated after 10 mins with other guests.... I known you are famous , your people don't care about customer services , but this is just happening .... So Asians please avoid this place for next visit.... Raise your voice if you are not a white people..... After eating pho... A basic Vietnamese beef noodles soup is suck ... No taste , no flavor.... Don't order it ... If you want to waist your money 1
I've been going here for three years. My experiences are usually very good. I usually get a pedicure, and they do a good job. 4
We usually go to Don & charlie's for ribs, but we just got finished eating two racks of baby backs cooked right in front of the store. The young lady doing the bbqing has been out there all day long. Saw her this morning and went about 4pm to get some. For $21.00 these were as good as any iv'e eaten at Don & Charlie's. Coked perfectly and meaty. Anybody who hasn't  finalized Sunday's or Monday's holiday meals should give them a try. 4
The French Toast and the various omelettes here are good; I've never had any issues with soggy bread or undercooked eggs.The atmosphere is pretty nice, but seems like somewhere your grandma would frequent; their main demographic is the elderly snowbird-type that come to Scottsdale to flee the cold. The waiters and waitresses are actually a little snippy; I've gone 3 times, and every time my waiter has spilled my drink because they slam down the cups. They also wait quite awhile after getting drink orders before a) bringing you your drinks, and b) getting your food order.Overall, the food is pretty good for a light brunch, but I'd probably rather go to Denny's or IHOP. 3
Sage Fried Chicken Benedict!!! Please just order it and indulge.  It is sooooo fattening, but it is a once in a life time experience.  I loved it, but could only eat a 1/4th of it.  It could feed three adults, but is worth it.  A must try! 4
I came here while visiting, and I must say, this is a charming, well-priced, boars head meat-stocked place to have lunch.  Patrons ranged from nearby office workers to teenagers.  I ordered up a Doughboy on sourdough based on a recommendation and was slightly disappointed.  The amount of meat and cheese they topped it with were inadequate, and their inability to offer real avocado on their sandwiches (instead of the pathetic spread they use instead) was rather disheartening. That being said, the macaroni salad was decent, but nothing special.  At least my chips and drink turned out how I had hoped for.All in all, I appreciate the spirit and friendliness of the lovely people who own and operate Cheese 'n Stuff and what they try to do.  However, I would not come back here for anything other than to say 'Hi'. 3
Its a nice club open air with swimming pools there are two levels of private areas overlooking the pools. The club and bar are small and the dance floor small. It great you have plenty of space where you can relax and talk. Best to go on warm nights total outdoors. Atmosphere is relax and recommend this club 4
Best pizza in town!  I live at 19th Ave and cactus so it's a drive for me to go but it's worth it.  I've been  coming here since I was in high school and I miss the old man  who used to run it but his son took over.  I've never had a problem here and have carried  out and eaten in its a great place! 5
I've only heard fantastic things about HOP so my friends and I celebrated a birthday here.Friday night is definitely super busy; the 4 of us waited about an hour for our table, but we didn't mind.... beer helps :D. They definitely have an amazing selection of beers on tap and a great variety of wines. We were finally seated in the upstairs seating area (there's 4 tables for groups of 4-5 there) and got our orders taken fairly quickly. Food came a little slowly, but it didn't bother us. We ordered our own dishes and sampled around the table. The BBQ Pull Pork Sandwich was deliciously saucey...a little on the sweet and salty side, but with the bread it was fine. The side of fries it came with was just a fantastically huge artery-clogging portion. The Steak and Wild Mushroom Pie had the perfect crust but I found the filling much too salty. I did like the mash and veggies it came with.. but it wasn't the best I've had. I liked the Tortiere pie better. The meat filling had more spices and the jalepeno chutney had a sweetness that balanced the salty filling. Service was good and waiters were friendly. They were a little slow (even after most customers had left), but I enjoyed it enough to come back. 5 stars minus 1 for the salt monster that invaded my pie. 4
This review is for the 5pm vigil Mass only.  If you like touchy feely Protestant worship songs, and don't find projected song help in large print on the walls an annoying distraction, then you may like this Mass.  I had to actually leave the Church after moving to several different areas after Mass in order to find a quiet place to pray.  It was very loud and chatty; but again, maybe having quiet Communion with the Lord after receiving the Eucharist is not your own preference. I would not return to this particular Mass but I would give it another shot for the daily Adoration and Tuesday confession. 2
Amazingly fresh and delicious with lots of gluten free options. The natural beef and black rice stir fry was outrageous (not gluten free). My wife had the Panang Curry and based on the rapturous look on her face, she enjoyed hers as well. 5
Good Korean flavors. Meats are good and relatively priced ok. May need to up their ban chan cups a little so people don't have to keep asking for Kim chee . Service has been good to average the three times I've been. Overall a good spot for good Korean food. My lady friend loved the free macaroon with the yelp check in. 4
Caviat: This review pertains ONLY to the vinyassa flow yoga classes, and I am a yogi who is interested in the mind-spirit-body connection that yoga provides in addition to the outward health benefits. Trufusion's take on yoga taps a familiar trend of teaching yoga like a workout class - more contemporary music, less focus on holding poses, more movement and less spiritual connection. They, like many other studios in Vegas think it needs to be 85+ degrees to practice yoga. I am soooo tired of trying yoga classes in this town and ending up sliding all over my mat because the studio or instructor thinks yoga can only be practiced in heat "to properly warm the muscles and prevent injury." I have been very athletic throughout my lifetime and have always been able to perform without injury in weather that was cooler than 85 degrees. How you may ask? By warming up! Ujjayi breath is designed to warm the body from the inside, and since when is it bad to do some light work and stretching to warm up before diving right into vinyassa flow? Sliding out of a pose because you're perspiring will cause more injury than a lower temperature I promise you. As great as you are at inner concentration the spiritual side of your practice is hampered by the frustration of not being able to hold poses and worrying about sliding into an injury, and listening to the loud music from the hard-core workout classes in the room next door. Would 75 degrees and some warm-up be a bad thing? Is everyone in such a hurry that we can't take 10 minutes to warm up? I am not opposed to sweating in the least, but I go to the gym regularly to soak my clothes - not the yoga mat. I really don't understand this trend at all, and if anyone has any enlightenment to share on the subject please do. In the meantime, if you like sliding around and struggling to hold poses, like many people apparently do these days (especially the younger crowd, check out all the 5-star reviewers here), vinyassa at TruFusion is definitely for you. Just wear a long shirt and long pants, or plan to break your practice many times to dry off with a towel if you want to hold poses and practice comfortably. Or you could just not give 100%, but then why go in the first place?Update - Raised to 2 stars as the instruction seems sound, but the vinyassa instructors I've had so far (Alicia, Jennifer, Randall) all LOVE the heat - though Randall's class is a little less intensive and closer to the floor so you are able to stay below the blasts of hot air from the heating unit above. Heather's yin class is in 85 degrees as well, but slower so not as bad. 2
Food was really greasy and service was non existent. Maybe it was an off night, but overall not an enjoyable experience. There is a lot better Mexican food in this area. No need to go back here except for drinks. 3
The restaurant is nice, however the service is horrible. Atleast from the person my boyfriend and I got. Not only was she rude and very short with us, but she also was inconsiderate of the fact that we didn't like the food. When the food came out all of it was gross. We could have gotten better pizza and wings elsewhere (and for cheaper). We also ordered and appetizer, which was by far the most disgusting thing i've had. The taste was so irony. Definitely will not be going back or wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. What a waste of time. 1
mmmmmmmmmm. These guys have good salsa!! dont get the standard one, you have to ask for the habenero one! I had the pork street tacos and they were good. I give them a 4 out of 5Service is ok but theres always good looking people working.They make a ton of margs but I've only tried the standard. They have a full bar but its mostly Tequila. Good selection, my favorite was Cruz Tequila. The bartender recomended it and knew quite a bit about all the other tequilas.I would go back again for drinks and chips and salsa 4
Great fresh food. Friendly staff and clean restrooms. The gas is usually the cheapest around. 5
This was the worst service experience I have had in my entire life. Stopped in mid afternoon on a hot summer day with my wife. We were hoping for a drink and a small snack. Before we were seated the manager informed us that they were only serving the tapas menu, which was fine, and we expressed our desire to order food. There was one other table occupied inside the restaurant and we had the patio to ourselves. Apparently our waiter had to cut his smoke break short to attend to us. He came and took cocktail orders and said he would give us more time with the tapas menu. At no time on this 30+ Celsius day were we offered or brought water. When our drinks arrived the waiter placed them on the table, turned around and disappeared back inside immediately and without a word. We assumed someone would return, but were ignored on the patio. We sipped our drinks and eventually finished them. After several more minutes of waiting my wife went inside to tell them we were leaving. The manager offered to send the bill out. The waiter brought it out with a charge for French Fries that we didn't order. He told us it was Quebec law that their liquor licence required a food order. We told him we intended to order food, but didn't have the opportunity as he never asked us. We also told him we had no intention of paying for food we didn't order. He told us we could wait for the fries or not, but we had to pay for them. He lied and said he asked twice if we wanted to order food. When we refused again to pay for what we had not ordered he told us we could pay or just be thieves. We asked to see a manager. When the manager arrived the waiter continued to lie and say that he had asked twice if we wanted to order food. When we told the manager that this wasn't true he grabbed the bill, crumpled it and told us to "f$!& off". The manager was extremely apologetic and very nice. He comped our full bill. However, I cannot recommend strongly enough to not go anywhere near this place unless you appreciate comically rude and terrible service. It was like something out of a contrived Food Network show. 1
Another Las Vegas buffet which means another expensive. The Spice Market Buffet is my favorite one, They have the foods that I know of. It's cheaper than The Buffet at the Bellagio and Wynn. I came here twice. Once before the make over and one after the make over. Both times weren't busy. I would come here again to see the other items I haven't gotten to try. 4
This place is very pretty and smells amazing, but the service is pretty consistently lacking. The phone etiquette is terrible, and while having my nails done, I listened to staff gossip with a client for 30 minutes, hardly a relaxing experience. This place could be a spa haven if done well, but it's really just over priced and does not deliver. I am left feeling as though Civello wants your money but does not want to put in the effort to make your experience a positive one. I will stick to my local nail salon. 1
Went here opening day. The memory still sticks with me how poor conditions the animals are kept in.I asked where the giant octopus was and the staff said that "He passed away". I wonder why... I feel bad thinking that these poor animals are out here in the middle of the hot ass desert in a fish tank. It's pretty sad. I'm not going here again cause it breaks my heart every single time. 2
I love this place.  Every year at Christmas they have Santa on a Saturday and Sunday.  We went for the second time this year.  The Santa looks perfect and is super nice and patient.   Mrs. Claus is there as a helper to hand out candy canes and take photos if you ask her.  There is no professional photographer, but as long as you have your own camera you can take all the photos you want and not pay a ridiculous sum for prints.   They had free popcorn and hot cider, two reindeer on loan from the zoo, and best of all there is no line.  They have a huge selection of Christmas trees and Christmas decorations.  It's like a winter wonderland in there.  The staff is knowledgeable and helpful, and while I'm not a gardener myself, I'm told their plants are great. 5
I emailed concierge regarding all the yelp reviews I've read and was upgraded to one of the newer rooms--thank you Gina.  I felt like a king compared to renting at the Freemont. The room that was assigned to me was not ready so I was given another room higher up with the t mobile arena as my view --thank you Amy.There was some construction noise in the casino area, you will need to inform checkin and get a separate key if using the small but almost adequate, not a whole lot of placed to dine but breakfast at Primrose was great!Workers and staff are extremely friendly!  Although I don't travel to Las Vegas often I f I'm staying on the strip I'd definitely consider the Monte Carlo. Can't wait to see when it is officially Park MGM.Some shade at the pick up area across valet would be appreciated. 3
I ordered from their seasonal summer menu. Curry grilled chicken breast. A little wait before we got the food. Chicken was well seasoned, freshly cooked and moist. Came with cold couscous salad which was ok but not the best. Used venue for gatherings for work. Good place to have a drink or two with colleagues. Straight sodas not recommended as they are a little on the flat side. 3
Not what I expected. The hummus was too dry with very little flavor. The fries were also flavorless. My expectations were that you can serve "healthy" Greek cuisine by adding some spice & seasonings. Those were the only 2 items I have tried at this time. Positive: The product BRANDING & GRAPHICS were on point. Just wished the food was. 2
The bf and I both had the tasting menu. The soups were disappointing. I had the sweet corn and boy had the hot and sour. I was super excited for my soup and it tasted like nothing. Literally, nothing. I could barely taste the corn. I then tried my boy's soup and it was too sour for me.The main course was alright. It was beef, chicken, and lobster. The beef was very tender but like another reviewer said, it's covered in teriyaki sauce. Paired with the other items, this ended up being too sweet for me. I actually preferred the chicken more. How can I ever have Panda Express Orange Chicken after having this stuff? And you know you love Panda's Orange Chicken!!! Anywho, Pearl made their chicken mm mm good. I can't say much about the lobster since I rarely eat it. All I know is that the bf said that it wasn't high quality and he was disappointed in the lobster.*I forgot to mention that their fried rice was the best I have ever had! Rice cooked to perfection with baby broccoli and other vegetables I didn't care about. Baby broccoli! Woo! The dessert was a tiny chocolate raspberry cake and it sure hit the spot. I didn't *love* it, but it was good. Good service, could be better but no real complaints. I will say that at the end of a long filled gambling Vegas day there is nothing like a cozy romantic dinner with your partner in crime to smooth over a spanking at the tables. We were seated at a booth and while they were super comfy, my baby was like 4 feet across from me. I felt like we were in the Grand Canyon of booths. So if you are looking for a romantic dinner out, go somewhere else. I think it's a good place for groups though.I enjoyed my dinner there but probably won't go back if it were up to me. 3
Locked myself out of my home late on a Sunday night. The locksmith arrived around 20 minutes after calling and I was in my house in no time. The locksmith was courteous and the interaction with the person at the office was great as well, they made sure to call me and ask if everything was going ok. If I need a locksmith again I would not hesitate on calling them. 5
Short and simple review. GO HERE. Katsu was awesome and the service was fast. Only gripe was the parking lot. But once you get in, wow. 4
Nothing special about it. The rice tasted old. I might try it again. But its nothing to compare with cafe rio . 3
So I felt like Thai and decided to check out this place. I'm giving two stars because of the chunky peanut sauce which was delicious. We order pad thai and fresh veggie spring rolls.  Now I've never had tofu in the rolls so I was surprised for a minute but didn't phase me when I was examining it.... then I took a bite and there was this taste that I couldn't not shake.I started taking out all the tofu because it was unbearable and I'm not a huge fussy guy but I couldn't take it at all, like the taste was just bad.... real bad! The pad thai came and I could smell the tofu, THAT tofu before to taste it and I was like 'maybe I'm imagining things'. So I took a bite and there it was BAM in my mouth. I literally took 2 bites and asked for the bill because 'that taste was all up in there'.  Never tasted tofu like that before and I actually thought tofu was tasteless... Guess not*Service was good and fast and the chunky peanut sauce was great.  Hope others have a better experience. 2
The lasagna is very good, and you must try the Italian birthday cake.  It is expensive, but service was good. 4
Wasn't very happy at all, the guy didn't seem whatever about his job and the freezes we ordered were already melted and runny and didn't taste great at all. Will not come back and Will make sure my friends don't either 1
Came here after dinner for a drink and to check out the view.  The ride in the elevator is amazing enough, but the view from outside is outstanding, you can literally see everything in Vegas.  Only drawback is that it's at the Rio, and obviously very far from the strip.  Hint: we took the free shuttle from Harrah's, which was near enough our hotel, to get there which took about five minutes and cost us nothing.  Worth checking out, and those witchdoctors sure looked good! 4
C&L's is actually more like a 2.75 in my book, but sadly that option doesn't exist. Aside from the draw of the nicely preserved horseshoe-shaped counter, their matzoh ball soup, cabbage soup and potato pancakes are all wonderful-better than Jack's Deli, in fact. However, basically everything else at Jack's is superior, from the meats to the coleslaw (do not even get me started on C&L's sad excuse for coleslaw), and the prices are better. 3
The room was comfortable and the staff syrupy friendly...  However, the internet is not at all what i'd expect for the price of the stay. Last night I finally gave up on waiting on ages to load and turned off my device.  They are very funny about another thing which they don't tell you about.  At 8:00 A.M. they turn all the AC units off.  So if you're sleeping in plan accordingly.  I wont stay here again.  I can get a room just as comfortable at a cheaper hotel and have equivalent or better internet, and have full control over the AC. Oh, I made one call to order dinner from down the road....  Charged 1.61.  For real.......  still charging for locals calls! 2
Staff are accommodating but the selection is mediocre and the prices are ridiculous.  I agree with an earlier reviewer that it's absurd to charge $XX for a glass of wine you can find in a supermarket.  When you tout yourself as having the best wine cellar in Vegas, you need to go a little deeper than Cakebread.That said, you can find some interesting things in the wine-racks.  Interesting, but priced at restaurant prices, less 15%.  That's not interesting to me. 2
Help me kick my Friday night off right. Walked through the door to a comfortable atmosphere. Greater by a wonderful waitress and not rushed to place our order as we enjoyed a meticulously made Old Fashion and a house refused peach martini. As our drinks soothed our pallet we were served an appetizer of burnt ends with Korean BBQ sauce and BBQ slaw. These delicious bite size morsels melted in my mouth and served as a nice prelude to the enjoyment to come.  The brisket was recommended and served with BBQ corn with an infused BBQ butter along side on some creamy and lite macaroni and cheese. The meat was full of flavor and so tender that it dissolved in our mouths. I enjoyed the Friday night prime rib with loaded baked potato. The a 12 ounce piece of meat the portion seemed huge. The flavor was filled with the effort you would expect in a slow smoked prime rib. Once we finished our meal we slow rolled next store to enjoy a movie. That is how you end a stressful week. Thank you. 5
Good customer service but the food is another subject. The kaula pork is marginal, needs more flavor and spice. With a few Hawaiian restaurants around the Las Vegas-area, they need to step up the quality to get a better review... 3
This place is pitiful.  Not sure if the people in the review have ever had good food, but this place isn't it. Got the sampler platter of perogie and they were clearly  made out of cheap and pre cooked materials. The meat was grey and I didn't risk trying it. Everything was over salted. We also got the kelbasa and the cabbage rolls. Also a huge mistake.  The only thing out of the wholemeal that was eatable were the fries. Totally disgusting.  Wish I could  give it a negative review. 1
I stopped in here for lunch on a weekday and ordered a chicken/avocado/bacon sandwich and a hefeweizen. The sandwich was delicious, with fresh, well-cooked chicken. Got a side of potato salad which I was happy to see wasn't just a mayo overload, but was well-balanced. The hefe was good, nothing extraordinary, but perfectly hit the spot on a warm day.Service was quick and courteous, but again, on a weekday lunch there were not a ton of people around, so I don't know what it's like during a busier time of day. I walked out well-pleased and would certainly come again. 4
I went here with my dad who was visiting on the weekend and it was disappointing. My dad is a huge hockey fan, and sports fan in general, so he makes it a point to visit sports museums and Hall of Fame locations. He said this was the worst of those he has been to. While the amount of memorabilia is impressive, it's organization is horrible. The displays contain pieces from different players, different teams, and different eras. There is a small attempt to organize by NHL and by IIHF, but that is it. There is no order to the displays as you walk through each section. You are in one section which has recent inductees, and very old.  The interactive section is tiny, with extremely long line ups. I can't imagine being a parent with a kid begging to play one of the two games available, it would be a horrible waste of an hour waiting to play. I would say this place has so much potential - it's a good size, it has rooms that could be organized into teams, or eras, or something, but none of the potential is realized. I will not be recommending this to any friends or family visiting the Toronto area. 2
I hate to give bad reviews but this place missed on several points for me.  First off walking in I was nearly overwhelmed my the amount of incense in the air.  Way, way too strong!  I tried several dishes and most were bit bad but my favorite, chicken tiki masala, was way too "tomato-y" for me.  The only thing I will praise them on odd the nan was fresh and hot.  I just wish there was something worthy to dip it into! 2
Nice dogs; underwhelming hair.  The atmosphere is pleasant; the salon dogs are cute; the front desk and manager are friendly.  The purpose of a salon business - delivering a good haircut - is just not fulfilled.  I got a not-flattering, un-chic haircut - uneven lengths included, from Ashley ($60.)  She used lots of smoothing product, which hid the uneven-ness in the salon.  I then returned as my hair was still looking like two different haircuts on the ends and one side was longer than the other.   On the return visit, the owner was unpleasant.  She said that my hair "texture" was why the hair was "uneven."  I would simply say that ragged layers and one-inch length differences are not hair "texture".  After wearing my hair in one classic style for many years (bob), they could not do this basic style to make it look nice, after several tries and my unending patience.  While I don't mind paying at all for a GOOD cut and usually do use well-regarded salons, I would not recommend spending your money here.  The time and frustration spent is not worth it; it's going to be several months before my hair can grow enough to be fixed properly and before I feel ok about looking in the mirror.  Spend it at a true "high-end" salon where, for the same cost, maybe even less, the experience includes a great cut (defined as one that looks good AFTER six weeks and without tons of styling products to make it work) and empathetic staff. 2
I received a flyer on my door that said they deliver. Went online at 7:20 to order for delivery and it said it wouldn't be delivered until 9:08. I thought that was completely ridiculous so I called at 7:24 for pickup instead. The assistant manager answered the phone and advised me that delivery would take about 45 minutes, not an hour and a half as suggested online. I asked how long would pickup take and was told it would be ready in 15 minutes. I didn't actually get my food until a half hour later, and by the time I got home, it had been 45 minutes and I could have just ordered delivery. When I complained to the assistant manager, he said they had new kitchen staff and I wasn't the only one who had to wait for my food. He did not offer any empathy or offer any kind of compensation. Eating here is a complete waste if time. This place used to be good, but now that don't care about their customers. Be wary, the kitchen staff is new and can't even keep up with cooking ordinary chicken gyros on time. Not the kind of place you want to eat at, unless you want to wait an unnecessarily long amount of time for an average gyro. 1
Best place for  pizza anda beer in the north! nice lounge, family friendly, italian food. prices are very good! 5
Pros: nice staff. Good breakfast buffet. Cons: Wifi did not work. Only one elevator was running. No hot water for showers. Coworker made complaint and was told to let it run -- there was a 'green hotel' card in the bathroom. The shower could has used a good scrubbing. Room service available but no menu in room. Nothing of interest close to hotel, have to drive a few miles. 2
Great vape shop, hidden gem on Charleston. Went in out of curiosity and was very impressed. Giant juice bar with loads of options. Tons of mods and attys and everything vape related you could need. All their staff is very friendly, got to try some new juice flavors and chat and they definitely live the vape life. Went in just to look around but i left with some new juice flavors and a charger. Prices are on par with online deals, I'll definitely be back to buy more mods or to just chill at their juice bar and chat with their crew. 5
Showed up here for coffee about 9:45pm...We could tell the staff were cleaning up and were not really interested in new customers. We placed our order which was actually quite simple (3 lattes and a chai) and the girl took our money dropped the change on the counter, finished wiping down her display case and then made our order... Not cool!!! For $5 coffees I expect better service than that. 2
They have delicious food and great service! This is definitely one of my favorite places to visit for pho. 5
This place is really good, prices are decent, and a very cozy atmosphere I must say. The only thing that stopped me from giving it 5 stars is that I don't like when they deep-fry all their hot dogs. That just adds more grease and fat to all the other toppings you order with it. Good for a cheat meal once or twice every few months. 4
Great food up and down the menu with arguably the best French Fries in town! 4
A great place with great food, Moshe always make you fill at home and the prices are fair, highly recommend. 5
Okay, I didn't eat anything but hot pretzels and I was there with a huge group after a wedding and all we did was drink beer from enormous glass boots. But that was great fun, so it wins four stars. It's a perfect stop on a pub crawl. It has personality. I could totally imagine it sucking if you were stone cold sober or hungry or in a different place than I was. 4
I love love love this place!!! Delicious food, friendly staff, and reasonable prices! My favorite is Hot Lover. Spicy rolls are good and nigiri sushi are also very good!!Only negative thing I can think is that their food is on the salty side. But servers are very good at refilling water ;)I will def. go back (hopefully soon.) 5
Was in Tempe on a short visit, stopped into My Big Fat Greek and had 3 varieties of hummus, a garlic, red pepper and another i can't remember. All three were delectable, flavorful with 'love'. Actually was quite stuffed just on the hummus trio order. My main lunch item was the Greek salad, see photograph. Vegetables fresh and dressing balanced. Overall a wonderful lunch dining experience. Can't wait to go back someday and have dinner ! Our server was very jolly and attentive. 4
We enjoyed the meal wife had the chicken kabob and I the grilled ribeye with blue cheese and a red wine sauce it was good but I prefer my steak plain didn't like the fact they don't have any other drink choices water or wine or beer being a non drinker leaves few options. It's a nice place but in truth without the 50% off coupon I wouldn't have ate here. 3
Yummy! If you order the Pad Thai ask for the original (withTamarind) to avoid ketchup. Sweet server, comfortable atmosphere, and well priced. 3
For 10 dollars a month it is a good gym. However when I decided to cancel my membership because I wanted to go to my old gym I came in and filled out the paperwork to cancel. 2 months later I will still getting charged. I went back in to this gym and was told no one ever entered the cancellation.  Isn't that convenient. I received an email right after I cancelled with a copy of my cancellation form that I had signed. The person told me I had to come back next week because the manager was out of town.  I came back the next week and spoke with the manager Alvin. He told me it was cancelled and that I would be receiving my refund in 7-10 days. Then he just turned his back to me no apology.  I never received my refund. 2
I dragged some friends here last, last Sat, originally to just check out how busy the place was, since we were close by. Then we saw the people eating the chicken through the windows. It looked so good! So we ended up lining up as well. The place looked really crowded, but everyone in the line on the left side were waiting to pick-up their food. The line on the right side was the order line, which was a lot shorter. We started lining up to order around 5:30pm. It took us almost 10 mins to get through the order line and order. All that was available when we were there, were the Original Large Fried Chicken and the drinks. It was suppose to be a snack for us, so the 4 of us split 2 orders of the Original Large Fried Chicken ($9.99 each). There were 3 flavours and 4 spice levels to choose from, we went with one Pepper Salt and the other one Less Spicy. It came with 2 free soft drinks. All that was left by that point was Diet Coke, so we took 2. Then we waited for our order for a bit over 30 mins, getting our chicken around 6:20pm. It was really hot and stuffy in there with so many people crammed together.They have a limited amount of chicken they sell everyday. So at around 6pm I saw them put a hand-written sign outside saying they were sold out for the day. Guess we were lucky, we got there just before they sold out. There were still a few people that didn't see the sign though, and walked in only to be turned away. The chicken did taste pretty good. Really juicy considering they were chicken breasts. The bags the chicken came in didn't say which flavour which chicken was though, I think. Or we were so eager to eat, we dived right in without noticing. But I think it might have been the Less Spicy we all liked more. One of them definitely had more flavour than the other.  It's worth a try but not worth such a long wait. Its also a little on the expensive side, considering its just one large piece of chicken. In all honesty, them serving it in a bag and claiming no cutting service to preserve the juiciness of the chicken is a little gimmicky. Had that large chicken been served on a plate at a restaurant, I don't think it would have received such hype. I might try them again when the full menu is out, if there isn't such a long wait. Their Fried King Oyster Mushroom does look interesting (I love mushrooms!).On a side note, my sister went after work on a Wed. And there were almost no line to order and she waited about 15mins to pick-up her food. So avoid going on weekends if you don't want the extra long line-up. 3
Fantastic pizza I love this Mom and Pop place. I wish we had more of these places and less franchise restaurants. 4
Unless you've been here before, let me warn you about the "unspoken house rules": 1. Order first (do not try and sit down).2. Wait for your food while standing.3. Find a seat (if one is available).Under no circumstances should you sit down before placing an order. And if the place is full, don't try and sit down without food in your hands, unless you want to be made an example of.My wife and I (who frequent restaurants several times a week) have never experienced anyone quite as rude as the woman behind the counter at this place.  We had never been here before and when we walked in, my wife sat down at a table and I went up to place our order.Little did I know the house rules (see above) and after the people in front of me ordered, the obnoxious cashier pointed to our table and to another table (of newbies) and said to the person who just placed the order: "you can either sit there or there", with the tact of, say, General Patton. She never asked us to get up or explained the "unwritten rules" to us.  An "excuse me, but you need to order first before you sit down" would have sufficed.So, my wife got up and we walked out of this place. The food could very well be good - but with waitstaff like this woman - there are plentty of other places around town with not-so crummy service that I'd prefer to spend my money. 1
Kelvin is a true professional! Great businessman!I dropped my phone earlier today and began searching for repair techs over the web and found him and told him what happened and he told me he could be to my house in 25 minutes to fix and was the best price in town. He came to me I didn't have to wait for an appointment or drive across town to him.Fast, efficient, professional, friendly, great price - what more can you ask for!He even cleaned my phone and I asked for another repair and nothing of which he tried to sell up to me to generate more revenue/business, it was my call with no pressure.Only 3 weeks after dropping my phone a second time after replacing my covers & during a bad winter storm I had to call Kelvin again & he was at my doorstep in only a couple hours when he was out of town earlier in the day.I wonder if I should tell him I've just dropped my phone a third time?! 5
I went here about a month ago and have a lovely time. The atmosphere is really nice - smart but casual. The waiter was really welcoming and helped us choose a really good bottle of red and didn't make us feel awkward when we ordered one starter and one dessert to share.  I like! 4
I love this place. Located in the arts district, this place gives off the vibe that your entering a wonderland of strange and fascinating oddities. And their 'elixirs' are innovative and reasonably priced! This bar has the whole package. Great cocktails and beer selection, chill atmosphere, amazing people, and an outdoor area underneath the night sky. I will definitely be frolicking here in the near future.Their menu changes seasonally, which gives you the chance to try new things! They're always coming up with eccentric and innovative elixirs! 5
The good things about this hotel: i.)It's a great location centre stripii.) The rooms are comfortable and decorated with modern decoriii.) Check in and check out service is excellent with a great left luggage check in.  iv.)Excellent selection of pay per view movies including many that are only out at the cinema at present. $12.99 for a movie just out.TIPS: 1.) Check in as soon as possible at 11am.  The sooner you check in the higher up your room will be and probably with better views.  We had a view of the strip on the 26th floor which was excellent.  Our friends who checked in an hour or so later were ten floors down with less of a view. 2.) If you have pictures to take back (cartoon drawings, photographs etc) you can leave these at the front desk as left luggage after checking out - saves you from carting them around all day. The not so good things about this hotel:i.)You will be charged a $23 per day resort charge on arrival on top of your room charge.  A pretty standard charge in LV but dubious non the less.ii.)The rooms are super small, although they do have two Queen beds (UK double beds)iii.)There are no children's channels on the TV menuiv.)There are no coffee/tea making facilities in the roomv.)The in room Wifi is not compatible with Apple or Android - i.e Iphones, Ipads and android phones can't be connected to it.  My husband spent a long time on the phone to their support trying to make it work (he is a techy so was super knowledgeable) to no avail.  The Internet support were seriously lacking in knowledge and it turns out that their wifi is just not compatible with these products.  Our friends had laptops and these worked fine with the wifi.vi.) House keeping is efficient but super slow.  Our son was sick on his bed and it took them over an hour to change the bed for us, which in the middle of the night with two children is a long time.All in all this hotel is okay for single people/couples who just want a decent place to sleep but is terrible for families and we won't be staying there again. 2
I am giving them 1 star and it is for the lack of quality in the salsas. Both green and red are always watery. I would like for them to learn how to make salsa since it is the dressing on the food that is suppose to give a dish flavor.  As a Mexican, it's embarrassing. Roberto's taco shops are increasing prices as of November 1st, they should increase quality of product while they're at it as well. 1
I've been waiting for Live Market to open for a while. From the moment I saw the familiar "Live" sign appear in Liberty Village, I've been waiting. They opened in the week I was out of town visiting family, so for a week, I watched from a far, watching my friends post pictures of the various things they had bought, and ate,  looking forward to being back in my hood of Liberty/Niagara so I too could eat this stuff too.Live Market is conveniently(?) located right near my gym, so I have been here three times in a fairly short time period, and it's nice to have such a great post-workout option, and really extra nice to have a close non-starbucks coffee/tea option near my house.Both times I've actually ordered food, it's been very very tasty. First time - the chickpea burger, second time, upon the recommendation of the server - Burdock Burrito (Do order this. It is yummy.) Live Market also keeps me in Silk Road earl grey tea. I've had the wherewithal to arrive shortly before the influx of Liberty Village work folks coming in on their lunch break.I often feel like the best way to tell the service level of a restaurant is how they handle minor errors. My partner ordered and ended up waiting a fairly long time for his lunch order, so not only did they make it right, they apologized, and offered him a coffee for his trouble. Smooth. Empowered staff make me a happy camper, so we just left liking them even more.They've got Ezra Pound roasted coffee, and prepared ready-to-go items, juices, snacks, and treats, as well as order-in items if you have a little more time. There are lots of locally made products like ChocoSol chocolate, Stasis Preserves, Bunner's Cookies, Sweets from the Earth treats, amongst other things. You can buy protein powder, tea, coffee, and even make up. They also have jars of Rawtella for sale, which I wouldn't call "healthy", but I would call really really delicious (since I did end up buying some on my last visit...)Service has been consistently friendly, food has been consistently good, and I feel like I get good value for my money when I go there.Things to know: They don't have debit/credit working yet, but it's coming soon. I.E., At the moment it's Cash Only. 4
No es el mejor pero esta bien,la comida buena,el servicio no tanto!!!Los dulces son bien ricos... 3
Cute place!I sat at the bar and was given a very friendly greeting &  wine menu...I don't think they "take orders" in the conventional sense:Basically, I sat there while very long line of patrons ordered their coffee & wine- I just assumed that once they got caught up, someone would check on me or ask if I'd made a choice (still sitting at the bar mind you). That never happened, despite all of the deliberate eye contact I made with the bartender/baristas...so, new people came in got their orders taken & I left.Didn't consume a thing despite having high hopes for Boxcar Social :(After I left, it occured to me that they probably expected me to join the queue to order my drink- not something I'm accustomed to once seated at a bar with a wine list- BUT  would it have killed someone to fill me in on the protocol there?! They def knew I was sitting and waiting...Oh well.2 Stars for the cute/ quaint ambiance. Greeting was pleasant. 2
One of the worst service ever. They want to choose what they want to do on you and are not friendly at all. The way they grab your hand and look at you when you tell them to fix something is ridiculous. It was my first time getting my nails done here and they did a very poor job 1
Ordered Veggie Pad Thai and was less than impressed. The sauce was a heavy tomato base that I can only liken to Campbell's Tomato Soup. Would not recommend. 2
Ugh. I keep giving this place a try. Damn eating with the eyes. Everything allways looks better than it tastes. I am a dessert snob and this place, I just don't get it. Got some pastries and they taste old and crusty. Shouldn't pastries be fluffy and flaky? I can make better cream cheese frosting that whatever sour coating is on the carrot cake I just sampled. The strawberry short cake is nothing but whipped cream. Save your money and go elsewhere. Even Smith's pastries are cakes are better tasting. 1
So its not on the menu yet but they now have a deep dish pizza that is to die for! Im from chicago, I know good pizza, they nailed it!!! Not to mention the people who run this place are truely nice, genuine and just all around good people. Even if ya walk in there in a bad mood youll leave smiling. :-)Thanks guys! 5
Don't waste your time at this wing place; the sign says best wing in town...umm I think not! My daughter wanted some chicken wings so I took her here since we were around the neighborhood. We ordered a number 2 which came with 15 chicken wings with your choice of 2 flavors (got the Garlic Parmesan and mild), fries and a large drink. The garlic Parmesan was okay and the mild lacked some flavor. The fries were decent they were perfectly seasoned. The service was okay considering the fact that there was only one person working and tables needed to be cleaned. There was one table that was clean and that's where we decided to sit. The tables didn't even get cleaned the whole time we were there so if people wanted to eat there they have to request to get the table cleaned. 2
We have visited this restaurant may time before but will not be returning. My guess is that business is not doing very well so they are cutting back on servings. We ordered the Sashimi Combination which is fairly expensive but have never seen such small slices of Sashimi. The meal was extremely disappointing. 2
This place used to be good. They need better cooks who are consistent and who know how to make eggs. The bacon here is awful. They do not cook the bacon to order. They cook a batch and let it sit until who knows when. When you ask for bacon to be cooked fresh they never cook it fresh they end up giving you the bacon that has been sitting the longest. 1
Have never actually been to this place but will never go based on phone interaction.  I called to see if there was anything available and told the lady I was waiting for my friend to get out of work so we could be there. She made it sound like we could've walked in since she pretty much just gave me a bunch of times like every half hour. Since our work usually gets out around 530, I set an appt for us at 6. Now being in the medical field, times r never a guarantee,  but I felt pretty confident that we would be okay since the times were so loosely proposed. I texted my friend and she confirmed she would come pick me up after she got out. At 6:03, I receive a call asking where we are. I let her know again, I was waiting for my friend to which she responded, "so when will uou be here?!" I said that I was waiting on my friend and did not know at this point. "Soooo 6:30?!" I asked if they were open at 7. She told me yes and then proceeded to scold me about how I should have called her (3 min after 6pm) to let her know because her friends wanted to come in. I ignored this and just said we'd be in at 7. after talking with my friend, we decided that it was too late. I called to cancel and she hung up on me. So unprofessional.  I hope that your business can just run on "your friends'" appointments because customer service is terrible. 1
Once you figure out the system of ordering and getting your food, you are rewarded with some great bbq. We had ribs, sausage, tri-tip along with Mac and cheese, slaw, beans and greens. Nice smokey flavor, sauces are wonderful!  Did not like the tri-tip but they were out of brisket so I could have been disappointed. The corn bread is worth the wait! 4
Eh, is really all I have to say.  (+ positive, - negative, -/+ neutral)+ Incense selection is awesome.  I love their stuff.-/+ Location is terrible.  I don't like Mill Ave., but at least it's close to where I live.- Poor customer service.  Don't talk to me like I'm stupid and we'll have a great employee/customer relationship.- Expensive.  Tie-dye shirts for $25?  I'll make my own, thanks.  And I don't know many people that buy smoke supplies here (I don't smoke myself). 2
Five stars because Allen is a pro. The salon is cool too, everyone seems to genuinely get along, which is rare, and smile a lot. But the really gem is Allen.From dealing with my initially not so nice ( read..pissy) attitude when my appointment got confused,  to actually fixing what i like to call my "fade" hair cut ( SUPER impressed because he basically made my hair look longer) and giving me a chic hair color that looks better each day, he is on point.Five stars and I will be looking forward to my appt when I am back in AZ for Christmas.P.S. That isn't the haircut in my profile pic. It is MUCH better now! 5
Checked this place out for the first time last week and I wasn't overly wowed like I had hoped for. I really was expecting a little more that Lis Doon Varna but it was pretty much the same. I still like the back patio area and it is still a great place to grab a pint. The bar service was good and fast....never had a dry glass...Guess I was just hoping for a more lively scene this time around. 3
Let me start by saying the service was amazing, the hostess , the server, but I'm giving them  3 stars because of the food. I'm not expert , but the pasta was tasteless, no flavor at all.  the salad and the bread sticks were good !! like i said great service , bad pasta ........! 3
Super tasty sandwiches, reasonably priced and very friendly staff. Kind of funny location but worth stopping in if you're passing by. 4
This is a la fitness gym now, and it seems like the new staff get their rocks of by informing you of that fact. I would have just purchased a membership if, it had been offered. Instead I was told," you can print a free pass at home or pay 15$ for a  visitor' pass. I would avoid this gym,,as la fitness clubs go this is one of the smallest. No hoops or pool. As a 24 Hour fitness active gym it's fine, those are smaller, but as a full size gym at that price no. They get one star and that's just because I love weights, 1
This store is see-it-from-space bright and about 5,000 degrees. And outside of coffee shops in Manhattan, I have never seen so many hipsters clustered into one space: all very friendly and VERY ready to help, mind you. I had an appointment to get my computer looked at (black screen of death, RIP Macbook Pro). The technician was quite friendly, sympathetic, and funny, but I got the sense (affirmed by a past employee) that the tech support department is very high-throughput, and degenerates quickly to helpful--but unwanted--suggestions that the sales department would be oh-so-happy to help customers find a new computer (or whatever product). I'm sure they would. Taken together, the store has a very high-pressure atmosphere that I'm really not a fan of, but the people I've interacted with are really great and good at what they do. 3
Perfect Location!! I love the atmosphere and the staff they will become your neighbor hood friends.  Great Coffee and serves all together. The place is spick and span.!! I love their top patio over looking 4th Street!! very neat!!! 5
There are a lot of things to write but the only suggestion I can give to anyone who will stay here is try to stay at Tower 2. I got a room with free upgrade but it was at Tower 1 and everything is old......from carpet to bed, bathroom, shower, all the furniture and A/C is super loud. If it is same price to stay at Tower 2, I will definitely suggest to do that. 2
Top notch service EXCELLENT pricing and very large selection - no need to go anywhere else in Phoenix !!! 5
Cafe Nervosa is the fast food version of dining in Yorkville. Don't get me wrong here I mean that literally. It is FAST. They usher you in, and get you out faster than a celebrity at Ultra, but that is what I expect when I eat here. The tables on the patio are extremely close together it may as well be a communal dinner table, but I kinda dig that! (make a note here folks.. the business that you are spilling to your friend just got a lot more public so ammend where needed!)I've had both pasta here and the pizza. Both are decent! Perfect for a post mani/pedi lunch or a pre-movie dinner.If you are looking for something unpretentious in Yorkville, wih the price point to match.. go. Would I go if I wasn't in the area? Probably not, but there are just too many restaurants to try now aren't there?? 4
The atmosphere is fun; the beers great; the decor cool. But the food was disappointing. My sister and I both had the zucchini noodle salad and there was nothing to it - I had the shrimp - $12 - and she had the steak - $14 - and we were both still hungry after eating it all. There were lots of zucchini noodles, 2 small Apple chunks, one red pepper and a handful of shrimp/steak. Flavorful but much too skimpy - super disappointing. Won't be back anytime soon. 2
This is a great place to enjoy hand made Chinese boiled and steamed dumplings! I will definitely come again ^_^ 4
The food wasn't good at all too salty or spices and just not as good and not cheap at all.Even a simple dish like the edamame wasn't good as it had too many spices on it.Nice musix though. But that's about it. Sorry .... 2
It was OK, as Vegas hotels go, but it needs some work.The room was a nice size.  The bathroom had nice lighting and a really good make-up mirror, which is rare in Las Vegas.  It wasn't too noisy, which again is a rarity.  But the air conditioning was terrible and the bed was rock-hard, so it was really hard to sleep. The shower didn't hold the water temperature and varied from warm to hot frequently  The restaurant selection is poor, particularly for breakfast.  The casino reeks of tobacco smoke which wafts into the elevators as soon as they reach the main floor.It may have been a luxury hotel in its time, but it hasn't aged well. 3
This place is nothing to write home about - in fact, I was disappointed.  The food is mediocre and definitely not in the value category - except for the huge burgers, portions are small.  Service was decent (the servers t-shirt slogans were cute and catchy!).  The fact that they're open late is the best thing about this place (although I didn't have any of the spiked milkshakes which is the only reason I want to go back) but then again, this is Vegas and there are soooo many other better choices for late night dining.  But it is way better than the only 24-hour restaurant, Carnegie Delicatessan, in the Mirage which sucked all around (and not in the good way!  LOL). 2
This didn't live up to the hype for us. Fortunately I only stood in line 20 minutes or so and I'm glad I finally got to try it, but I found it kind of bland. I can see how it might be to some people's tastes but neither my husband nor I enjoyed it much. Staff was enthusiastic and friendly, though! 2
Our bachelorette party went to Sapphire - the world's largest double strip club...I don't know how true that was, but damn, that place was big. But too crowded and too touristy, which is where they make their money, but from someone not shy about going to them (having gone to one the week prior, literally), this one was not a place I would return to. I had to pay a $25 cover, though the cab driver gave us drink tickets, and then once inside, you couldn't move freely between the men and women sides. WTF?! I was not happy about that - but I want my cake and eat it too, so, maybe I'm used to something else.  The girls were a mish mash of pretty, girl-next-door, eh, and ohmygodssheshot. And there were a lot of them - the ratio was pretty good for a big, busy club. That was the most impressive thing, in my opinion. It took us forever to find a girl worthy of a lap dance, but I blame the pickiness of the bachelorette, and the drinks SUCKED. Not only that, in order to sit, you have to reserve a table...no sitting at the bar because they're maybe five seats at each one, of course completely full for the entire time they're open. That's how they make their money, I get that, but still...pretty women would get more money from me, drinks-tips-dances-all three, if I could've sat! I would've gladly gone to another, perhaps more divey place, without the cover and the ability to have better drinks and a place to sit and watch. 2
I ordered some jewelry and there was a bit of a mix up, but Rob went out of his way to make sure I got my jewelry and even offered a discount. The piercers are friendly and professional. High quality beautiful jewelry. Definitely worth going put of the way for. 5
The terrasse is great.A must for meat lovers. Don't try anything other than steaks, burgers and prime rib because it seems like the other options are only there to complement the menu.Just a stone's throw away from the Atwater market and the canal, Magnan is a nice place for a good old fashioned steak, fries and alcohol. The service is courteous and efficient for a tavern. 3
This was an OK meal for a high cost $250 for family of 4.  The food all ranged from OK to good, but nothing was really worth writing home about - apart from the bread and butter which was yummy.  Powdered cheese instead of freshly grated was disappointing.  The service was good, the wine list impressive.  Tiramisu was small and too weak in flavour, a sad end to the meal. 3
I wasn't impressed with Sonnys burgers at all. Yes, you can load it with you usual ingredients, just the same as Harvey's. The burgers looked like the thawed frozen type. Def not fresh and home made. I also got the poutine. I enjoyed the gravy, but they don't use cheese curds. The fries were good, and the portion was massive. The chicken fingers were your usual deep fried fingers that you can get from a box at home, nothing special. I don't see myself going out of my way to go again. But if I do end up there, I won't complain either. 3
Overall a great place for small children.  But they don't let you take food in. 3
It's great for younger children, but teen don't really have much fun because it's just a small area for laser tag. But it was fun, nonetheless. 3
Perhaps the most transphobic places I've ever been to.  Requested a men's haircut and was told would pay as a women.  I explained I did not identify as a woman and was requesting a men's haircut.  Then the receptionist explain to me that I wasn't really getting it "they have men's cuts and women's cuts'.  I explained I did get it and I didn't identify as a woman and I want a men's cut like the guy sitting in the chair getting his hair and beard done for less.  The receptionist then said perhaps this is not the salon I should be at.  I requested to speak to the owner and when the receptionist came back she said in an extremely snarky way we'll charge you a men's cut.  Only to be followed by glares from the owner who choose never to talk to me and the receptionist who would no longer even make eye contact.  2016 HAPPY PRIDE.  Just wanted a fair hair cut.Reminds me to always stick to my stylist at Textur Studio that did my hair with a smile. 1
I can't say enough nice things about Tom and the folks at Floor Source.  I had received a quote from a big box home improvement store (which shall remain nameless) and was shocked at how expensive they were for cheap-looking carpeting.  I went to Floor Source and not only was their carpet much nicer, their price was nearly half of what the other quote was, and they install the very next day!  The carpet looks beautiful and the workers were fast and professional, caused no disruption or damage to the walls (which the other company couldn't promise wouldn't happen).  These guys know customer service and I'll refer anyone who asks to Floor Source! 5
Amazing place to eat. I ordered the churro waffle, which was spectacular. Great portions served here. The only issue was that there were no champagne for mimosas, due to these guys not having their liquor license yet. My wife asked could we bring our own liquor in, and the waitress said yes. So a 5 star went down to a 4, and quickly shot back up to a 5. Enjoy!!! 5
Chicken enchiladas were nothing special. The chips were odd tasting and the salsa was very spicy. The staff was very nice and there was a guy playing techno Mexican music. 2
I work very nearby this place. It is in the building where Panini's used to be. They opened some time in January. It has been cleaned up and redone to some degree. It has new owners and the menu is completely different. You've got to appreciate a place where risotto shares menu space with chicken wings. We have always had really good food and service here.  There have, however, been a couple times when we waited a little longer than we would have liked but the owner or manager has always come out and apologized/explained.As for Happy Hour, it wasn't very good but they recently made some much-needed changes. Their Happy Hour is AWESOME now! I think small drafts are $2, their tall drafts are $3 and well drinks are like $2.50. All appetizers are half off as well. 4
Coffee-wise I've only had the iced coffee, which was decent and well priced.  The food options didn't look that appetizing, and there weren't many of them, but overall the place was playing some good music, had a friendly staff on hand, and had plenty of outdoor seating in their backyard.  One commenter noticed that the stereo was on too loud, but the times I've been there it's been at an all right volume.   Maybe his review worked, and either way seems to be under control of late. 3
Same great food. Same unimpressive service. 3
This is a make your own stir fry restaurant. A friend and I went for lunch, while the place was crowded, the service was highly attentive and generally excellent. There is something to appeal to almost everyone among the stir fry ingredients - and for a couple of dollars more you can make an unlimited number of trips back to the stir fry bar. Unlike a few places I've been, Flattop doesn't make you wait - the bowl is marked with your name and table so it comes to you when ready. Also, if you're not into stir fry, you have the option to have your meal presented to you as a salad, soup, mu shu pancake filling, or with a roti prata. Also, they have a full drink menu and a selection of appetizers and deserts.The best thing I can say in this review is that I'll definitely be returning soon. 4
Popped in here one evening for a quick bite on my way home. I ordered the AK Veggie 7. Guac is standard on this burger, which is a nice touch. Other than that though, it was pretty lack-lustre. Boring bun, standard-type soy patty, and exactly one leaf of iceberg lettuce, one sad tomato round, and a floppy pickle. The fries were good though.I would eat here in a pinch, and I can't speak for their meat products, but I would never go here intentionally for the veggie burger. 2
A great neighborhood hangout.  Open all the time.   Great coffee and tea.  The atmosphere is the best especially the outdoor patio on nice days.  Great location at the corner of Bartlett and Murray. Staff is very friendly. 4
***This is the first review that I write which has a grade below 3***I hardly give 3 star review unless the place is very very terrible. So 1 star is very very very very terribleI went to the pharmacy and for a pick up of my medicine and they said the pharmacy did not hav enough pillsSo I said I would pick up what they did hav in stock and came back for the rest at a later day. However, when I came back with the receipt they said the record  showed I hav picked everything up last time. They asked me to go back and check the package again.So I did and I can back again. I brought the package with me( I forgot my receipt this time tho). They said last time I didn't bring the receipt but I bring the bottle. We can't agree on this topic so I said we should check the CCTV which is the best and only evidence. They refused and juz walked away. It was a very very RUDE to left ur customer in dust and walked away! THEY SAID I AM TAKIN TOO MUCH OF THEir TIME! THEY ARE WASTING MY TIME TOO!!!!! Of course it is my personal opinion. You dun hav to trust me. Dun take my word for it. go try it urself. Good luck :) 1
Large space for group events and great service. Food is decent as well - a good go to if you're in the area and just craving drinks and basic food 4
The first time I went in there I was very happy with the service I was provided. I tried going back a few days later. I arrived at the store just before 1030 ( when the business was supped to open) I waited in front of the store for a half an hour and no one showed up to the store to open. 2
Service was rushed and the staff didn't clear the plates often so the table was full of piles of plates. This was towards the end of the night with an hour left of service. Last call was at 10 and the staff was turning down the restaurant even though closing is at 11. The food was ok. Some special rolls were interesting but the menu was about the same in quality and selection as other AYCE places. Overall, not a great experience and would not return. 2
This place is clean and the customers servies you get is really good. the last time i was there i was going to share my sandwhich and fries, they heard this and offerd to spit it for us. 4
Great idea...  executed poorly.  I have not eaten there so I cannot comment on the food.  HOWEVER, I can comment on a few simple things the managers should know how to handle.1)  The bar tender GAVE my debit card to another customer.  My wife and I had to call and cancel our card right there at the establishment.  The bar tender did NOT comp us anything and said that she would call me when the other customer came back for his card.  SHE NEVER CALLED.  I WENT BACK TWICE LOOKING FOR MY CARD AND ALL THEY COULD SAY WAS.... WE DON'T HAVE YOUR CARD.  What they SHOULD have done was... first, comped my entire tab!  Second, called me at least once and kept me in the loop on WHERE MY CARD WAS!2)  When we went back a second time with friends, the place had all of the bar doors open to the patio including the garage doors during the winter.  My wife and several others in our party were freezing.  We finished one round and left.My suggestion....  fire your floor manager.  WHY?  If they cannot see that EVERY GUEST in your place is wearing a jacket in doors, then they do not know how to manage a restaurant/bar!  I HATE IT when people that do not know how to open and run a restaurant do just that.  If you cannot train your managers to handle people's credit cards or keep the place warm (at least room temp), then you need to run the place yourself.  You will fail...  That is unfortunate because we need a great place to hang out, watch the game, and shoot some pool in DC Ranch.Mike 2
This is by far the worst experience I've ever had with any car rental company. The agent was rude, did not to her job in checking that the car was damaged (had to come up and tell her as she didn't take a look at the car whatsoever) and I was given a filthy vehicle that had dirt in the floor mats and bird poop on the chair in the back! Before I picked up the car, I asked what the 'other' charges were on my bill (amounted to about 1/3 of the price) and she didn't know. When I mentioned the car was dirty and had a strong smell, she told me I was wrong because she cleaned the car herself.Any attempts to fix the situation with the location were fruitless as I was told multiple things by multiple people and nothing ever came of it for weeks even though I called back once a week to try and discuss the situation. I finally went through Avis' customer service who solved the issue and they provided excellent customer service.I'd like to stress the following: as a company Avis is great, it's this particular location that seems to employ rude employees and is owned/managed by a woman whom they called "Mrs. Mary" who does not seem to value her customers or giving good service of any kind. There are plenty of other Avis locations to rent from in Montreal, please choose one of them instead! 1
Korean airline was really nice efficient in time the only bad thing i can say is they turn the aircondition OFF ... Yes i said OFF in the middle of my 11 hour flight so therefore didnt get no sleep at all and they turn it off both times on my way there and my way back !!!! People speak highly of korean airlines but was really disappointed with this situation. 3
Our experience with Michael and his crew was amazing. They are professional and do quality work. The guys were in our home for for over a week painting the entire house and also painting the kitchen cabinets. It's a really big house. They have an attention for detail  and easily dealt with my type a personality. They did an excellent job for me. The crew was a pleasure to be around and I can't say enough about how Michael stands behind his work. I would hire them in a heartbeat and suggest them to anyone looking to have paint work done. 5
I stopped yesterday, first visit to Al Hamra. It was around 5 pm--I was only customer & ordered to go. I ordered chicken tikka Masala with potatoes (paid extra for potatoes), and samosa appetizer. I got home and the samosas were so oily and, evidently due to the container they put it in, were falling apart soft not crispy & flaky as I was hoping. They forgot to add the potatoes to the masala. The masala was very hot & in a plastic container, so it almost melted the container. Taste was nothing special and prices MUCH higher than other better Indian restaurants I have been to around Phoenix. I don't think it's a good idea to order out with this restaurant. Might have been better experience if dining in.. 1
Great location!! Chemical free salon meaning no colouring just haircuts, shampoo and blow dry but looks nice and clean. As I walked through the door I was greeted with big smile by one of the hairstylist. She asked for my number and after input, computer displayed how I got my last haircut and she confirmed it with me. The radio station is playing and there is nice flat screen tv for customers that are waiting. It is nice if you make an appointment but when I called they said I can just walk in today. Decor is very nice and even the staff looks professionally dressed. I would definitely come back here. They also give away four coupons to use on your next visit. 4
Craving for some Ramen! Monta is the spot to go to. This place definitely satisfies your Ramen craving. There was a long wait since this place is very small and their was 8 of us. It was worth the wait!I ordered the Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen. It was mighty delicious! I also ordered a side of the dumplings, which a must try. You can tell they make it fresh, it's not your typical frozen prepackaged ones. 4
Sunday shopping at Trader Joes and stopped in here for lunch.  We were 1 of 4 tables yet service was extremely slow.  We ordered nachos for an appetizer which took forever to be served.  The pork carnitas were good and I liked that they used real cheese and not cheese sauce.  I ordered the chicken tamale which was dried out and bland.  My husband ordered a chorizo burrito but the meat didn't taste anything like chorizo to me.  Also, the rice on both our dishes was extremely spicy and there was a hair in my husband's rice! 1
This place is the essence of middle eastern food.  Simple.  Quality Ingredients.  Great Flavors.  No Frills. 5
Spirit Airlines is the worst!  Hidden baggage fees, such as having to pay $50 for a carry-on.  This airline is poorly run and will nickel and dime you to death. 1
Upon the advice of my auto insurance agent, I had Camelback Auto Glass repair a chip in the windshield of my vehicle to prevent it from spreading. In my opinion the technician who came to do the job did not adequately get the resin to flow into all the damaged area.  The propagating crack are still visible. I would not recommend this company. 1
I must say that for a fast food location in Gastonia this place stands out as one of the best in my opinion. My food is always hot service is always fast and my drive-thru caretaker is always friendly 5
The fries is good but the burger is not cuz the beef is no taste. It just likes u take the beef and cooked it without any salt and pepper. The bun I'd crunchy and good.The services is good.friendly.Kind of pricey for what I got. I expect something good for what I pay. It is not the amount but the quality not good 3
Where to begin......Came here tonight for the first time because my cousin was recommended by coworkers. There was no wait, which is great. Well, our waitress told us this was her first job waiting tables. And although she was not terrible it showed. It was a little awkward and I'm not a fan of someone who comes to the table constantly to ask if we are ok. Onto the food: Apps.....chicken wings. Hmmmm I don't even know how to describe these. The dry rub was quite unique, not horrible but def not anything to rave about. We also had the pork belly sliders. This one item was the favorite of the evening. We opted to not have the pimento cheese on there and that was probably for the best. I'm not sure why but a lot of the items seemed to have pimento cheese..... So I had the steak sandwich. Not a fan at all. There was too much going on. I actually had one item taken off of the sandwich and it was still too much. It was really messy and not enjoyable to eat. We also had the roast turkey. Seemed dry to me but that's not really anything new with turkey. It came with hummus but we opted for it to be on the side. Honestly I don't think it would have added anything to the sandwich. In addition we tried the burger. Meh. The FF though were quite delicious. I will say that the menu is limited and seemed overly crowded somehow. Each dinner item had so many ingredients and none of it really drew me in. Maybe less is more?? For spending $75 it was one of the worse most expensive meals I've had in Charlotte. NoDa this is not what you needed nor do I think it will last. So disappointed...... 2
Came to this place my first night in Montreal with a group of friends and it was definitely a good pick. Our waiter was really cool and friendly. The food was well 4 out of 5. The meatballs were good but the arancino and antipasti plate were slightly underwhelming, but by no means bad. The main course, think it was penne with prosciutto more than made up for it. Only thing that was a negative was the front staff/manager? Even though we were a group of five and the restaurant was 85% empty, they were trying to sit us in a small table for four. Basically had to argue with the guy to get us a larger table. No reason for that. 4
Finally found my favorite breakfast spot. Best breakfeast food I've tasted in arizona. 5
I go to Starbucks daily. But this one is horrible!!! I waited in a long line for 15 minutes and they were still with the same two customers!!! I walked away without any drinks. Does anyone know how to manage a business anymore?!?! 1
I went to Red last night with friends and we had drinks & appetizers at the bar. Not only was the service horrible bit the waitresses were unknowledgeable about the wines! She simply gave me the most expensive Cabernet by the glass! The house salad I ordered was horrible. The presentation was less than great and the lettuce was wilted! I will never ever go back there again! 2
Felt like walked onto the set of "It's Always Sunny" at this bar.  Bartender was so rude.  I don't get how this bar stays in business.  It was a Thursday night with two other groups at the bar.  Takes her five minutes to come up and take our order and seems pissed while even doing that.  Then after we're finished our beer she just does not bother coming back around because she was too busy chatting to one group sitting at the bar.  I would understand if it was busy but the bar was nearly empty.  All around terrible customer service.  Will not be returning here, way too many other great bars.  I want to give it more stars because the Buffalo chicken pizza was really good!  So if you are going for the food, thumbs up, but I can't get past how rude the staff is. 1
Good food but oh my gosh the service,...... So Slow. Half of the  guests at our table are plastered. To slow and the folks are drinking to much 3
I LOVE deltaco but this location is SO SLOW its ridiculous and then food is not even that great ,they need a new manager asap I have tried 3 different times thinking maybe its time of day ,crew any excuse but now I'm done its just crap all together. 1
I wanted to like Chinita so badly, but just couldn't do it.  I live right around the corner and when I saw the signage going up I initially thought they were going for a Mexican/Chinese concept, similar to Chino Bandito in Phoenix (which btw is amazing if you're ever down in that area).  Hmmm maybe they should have gone that direction.I arrived about 6 on a Friday night to a half way full restaurant with about three other groups waiting to be seated.  There were plenty of open tables, but for whatever reason we waited 15-20 minutes before being seated.  I understand not wanting to overwhelm the kitchen with the 6pm rush, but seeing all of the open tables while we waited definitely didn't help.The waiter was very attentive and overall provided very good service.  Chips and salsa were brought to the table pretty quickly and we dove in immediately,  Unfortunately, the salsa was very bland and tasted like it came out of a jar (La Victoria sounds about right).  I asked for something spicier and the waiter brought out something that was even worse.  My dinner date and I opted for the fish tacos and the chimichanga (traditional American Mexican of course).  The fish tacos were pretty good overall, but I couldn't get past the rice and beans.  They were terrible!  Again, the beans tasted like they came out of a can and the rice was very bland.  For a Mexican restaurant, the rice and beans should be your bread and butter, but not here.  The chimichanga was decent, but you could certainly find a better one a Roberto's or other similar places.  To top it all off, the prices were a bit steep in my opinion.  Fish tacos and a chimichanga without drinks just about used up my $30 groupon. :(The only things saving this restaurant were our server and the decor.  Inside, the place was very nicely decorated and had a good feel to it.  Too bad the food didn't live up to these things.  I would probably try again in the future if the menu was revamped.  Seeing as how they just opened, I don't think it's too late, but until then I'm staying away. 2
It's true the garden patio is beautiful and the front window area is quaint and lovely but the food is sub-par.  The creamed soup basically tasted like the flour they thickened it with and the salmon was fine, but really quite tasteless. If you "dine" in TO you are getting used to all kinds of different spices, herbs and combinations of veggies with every new restaurant.  Definitely a downer for me.Although, they have a FANTASTIC corkage fee, only $10 per bottle! 2
Paid the extra for a "view room", but it was just a higher room without a view, just a condo block, maybe a room that *used* to have a view?  I went down to ask about fixing the view, or getting access to the balcony....  No joy from grumpy staffer.No refrigerator in the room.Pretty old feeling hotel. 2
Food was absolutely horrible! Service was mediocre. It all tasted like frozen or out of a can - nothing authentic. Spent about $100 on two adult meals, two kids meals, one beer and one frozen margarita. What a waste of time & money. Don't bother going, even the food court was better. 1
This place was filthy and the service was awful!  This place has really gone downhill at least the manager was friendly. 2
By far the best biscuits and gravy I've had so far. Pancakes are delicious. Worth the wait. 5
Chose Discount Tire based on reviews from Yelp. Did my research on the tires I thought I wanted. If you find a competitors price cheaper, they will match it. When I came in, Richard suggested a better tire for the hot, dry summer. The tires were cheaper than the one I suggested. They could have made an extra $150 by going with my suggestion. While I waited for the tires to get changed, I noticed how busy they were. No one waited for more than 2 minutes. The phone was always answered. Customer service is paramount. Will always buy my tires here. 5
Oh Faustos... This place has some amazing food, from bean and cheese burritos to enchiladas to chili relleno to super nachos that truly are "super". The food is filling and well priced, with a salsa bar featuring spicy carrots and onions, cucumbers, a red and green salsa, and basket of limes. Beware, vegetarians, the beans do have lard in them. My favorite item is an Egg-Potato-Cheese breakfast burrito that will keep you full for breakfast AND lunch :) 4
The burgers are amazing and ridiculously reasonable! The staff is friendly and attentive. The place is super clean! They do everything right at Players! Good drinks, great lunch specials and awesome service! 5
Great Happy Hour! Loved the DJ. Song choices were awesome and the music wasn't too loud to chat with our friends. Loved the Guac and Hibiscus Marg. 5
I just recently moved from Phoenix AZ to Los Angeles CA and if it weren't for their help I truly don't know WHAT I would have done. I've had much experience with other moving companies in the past and no other company has come close to this one! A few years ago a moving company lost a very important box of mine full of family videos and photo albums that were near and dear to my heart. After that experience I told myself I'd never hire anyone to help my family and I move. However, This recent move to LA was not something I could do alone and needed to call for some help. Upon finding this company and speaking to them prior to my move, I already felt confident and comfortable; something o find imperative when moving & especially out of state. They were so helpful and got everything of mine delivered safe and sound to its new location. I have the utmost gratitude for them and would recommend this company to anyone about to move! 5
I like this place. They do a really good shellac manicure. I read another reviewer's story about the Visa incident and it reminded me of a similar experience I had there. When I realized it was cheaper to pay cash, they told me there was an ATM next door. So I said I'd go over and get some money out. Now, keep in mind I am there once a month and several of the staff know my face to smile at me in recognition whenever I go in. But still.....when I went to the ATM one of the ladies followed me there and stood out on the sidewalk! LOL. I felt like a criminal. But it doesn't make me mad because it's likely the policy of the owner (the man who sits inside counting all the cash!) and the girls haven't much choice but to go along with it. Meh, I don't care. I always bring cash now and it's still a better shellac than the handful of places I've tried on the Danforth. 4
Came here to patch a tire with a slow leak. Told me they couldn't patch and tried to sell me a tire.   Went to discount tire and they patched free of charge.  Avoid this place. 1
Meh, meh, meh. After waiting 25 minutes and watching everyone who ordered after us get their food first, I was treated to a very generic baked ziti. The sauce was extremely sour and tasted worse than grocery store pasta sauce. My husband had the pleasure of being served linguine del mar with three unopened mussel shells. After pointing this out to the server, he said sorry and quickly rushed off. There was no offer to redo the dish, to bring up mussels that are actually open or to offer a discount of some sort. I'm appalled that the cook either didn't notice the defective mussels or just didn't care. I'm even more appalled that we were expected to pay full price for a dish that did not deliver what was promised.The only memorable things that I will take away from this restaurant are the poor customer service and boring food. 2
Monday night here is the best if you like wings!! .59 cent wings but be careful the flavors are extra but they have over 75 different flavors!! 4
My friend and I have been here a few times for lunch and our experiences have been ok each time. It never gets busy during the weekday so getting a table immediately is guaranteed. The wait time for the food to come varies though. I've tried their pulled pork sandwich and ribs with yam fries while my friend always gets the brisket burger. I do think the flavour of the brisket is the best out of the three as it's juicy and tender. I found the pulled pork to be a bit on the dry side despite being doused in sauce. The ribs were not bad and this is one of the few places that don't cook your yam fries to death. Overall, it's an ok restaurant with mediocre BBQ food. 3
In one word, class! Smartest bunch of girls in town. They all wanna be doctors. 3
Overall, we had a positive experience.  Baja Soul has a rather unfortunate location. Although they are in Birkdale, they are tucked in the back as opposed to on the main drag, so you will likely only see the place if you are purposefully looking for it. Once we finally found it, we went in and stood at the front and looked around and saw just a few diners, but no staff.  After a minute or two, we were about to leave, when someone came and greeted us.  After that rough start, the service was friendly. They serve complimentary chips and salsa. I did not have any of the salsa, but it looked good. The mahi mahi fish tacos were very good, but be warned that they are spicy.  The Mexican Street Corn is awesome.  I did not care for the fried plantains, but they were prepared fine. I'd just never had plantains before and found that maybe they aren't my thing.  I'd say give this place a shot if you are a fan of trying different kinds of tacos. The prices are very reasonable, but I think they could get more business if they would advertise more and let people know, "Hey, we're back here." 4
Fantastic place! So far we've had fish and chips, curry chicken and the Guinness stew pot pie. Always accompanied by a Guinness with black current syrup. Truly a great find and makes one miss Ireland. Great for large or small parties, patio seating and great service! 5
New place and great location for my regular biz trips to Phoenix, but they have a lot of kinks to work out before I'll stay again.Rooms are nice enough, but the furniture is cheap.  (drawers already coming off the tracks).  Nice linens. Staff overly friendly at times; self involved at others.Was upgraded to a suite, but then was charged double the price.  Trying to get that resolved took 45 minutes at check out, which caused me to be late for a meeting.  Even though I had the email with the correct price in hand, they referred to the rate as a "miscommunication" and acted like they were doing me a favor by charging the agreed upon rate.Then, surprise: an extra charge showed up on my credit card bill now that I'm home.  Called the hotel to learn it's for a phanton mini-bar purchase.Really pretty frustrating overall.Much better experiences at Downtown Sheraton and the Hyatt. 2
I purchased a groupon and came to The International Skin Care Institute for the first time for a microdermabrasion. My esthetician was Annette and she was wonderful, explained the process, and educated me on my skin. I enjoyed the treatment and purchased the VIP package which is a worthwhile deal if you get facials regularly. I have since tried their LED skin rejuvenation. Everyone has been very friendly, I've been pleased with the services, and will be coming back for further treatments to finally give my skin the TLC it deserves. Though I have had some trouble getting in touch with ISCI by phone, don't let it deter you...I recommend their skin treatments and being able to book appointments online is very convenient! 4
TENTERS BEWARE!!we stayed here for 2 nights in early april in a tent.  I am going to be fair to this resort (although I hated las vegas as a whole and also as a sum of its parts).  Don't tent camp at this thousand trails unless you want to sleep on asphalt.  The ranger was very nice to us, and took us to the one site that could possibly accommodate a tent.  As far as facilities: bathrooms, lodge, pool, etc were all really nice!  Just to know, it is located on  a busy street, but backs up to a building, and the noise wasn't an issue.  It was very windy when we were there, but if you have an RV it probably wouldn't matter.  Judging by the cement walls with barbed wire, this is probably the only safe place to stay in Las Vegas. 3
Grocery shop is good. You get a lot of kinds of meet there. But the restaurant is okayish. We had a buffet & most of the items were below par.Naans were so hard. and felt like frozen naans reheated. 2
First off I would like to state that I love pizza! There is nothing better than getting a good pizza on a Friday night with a movie. I decided tonight would be that night, but unfortunately for us I picked the wrong pizza place. The following reasons are why I will not be returning to Zella's pizza and cheese sticks;1. Cajun sticks - although the idea sounded great the execution was poor. I'm all for greasy, but when it drips down your wrist to your elbow you've got an issue. Also in order to find the cajun flavor, you have to fight through an army of salt. I took one bite and realized that one bread stick would've been a great assassination weapon against Sponge Bob!2. NY style pizza - there were two positive things about the pizza; the size was really big and the flavored crust wasn't horrible. Now I've had NY style pizza before and I know it's supposed to have light sauce, but no sauce at all! Really?! Bad choice Zella's.  Also chewing the crust was like a wrestling match in my mouth, tough! My teeth hurt after two pieces and that was just plain disappointing! Overall I would say too greasy, too salty, no sauce and way too tough. Side note they overcharged me. Boo! Time to look for a new pizza joint! 2
Good food for a good price.  I have no quarrels with the food it's service that needs immediate attention. I've dined at this place 3 times and I've never had an issue with the food but the service is just dismal. The staff needs to be more attentive to the diners I can't express how bad the service is in this particular location. 3
Came in with a group of about 20.  We had a reservation and we were seated immediately, even though we were about 15 minutes early.  Our waitress was very friendly and did a nice job taking care of such a large group.  They have a nice beer selection.  We had the Pierogi appetizer (it was OK) and I had the Italian Beef Sandwich, which was good but the beef was a little fatty.  On par with your average Applebee's in my opinion.  Likely wouldn't go back next time I'm in town. 2
Bravo is a great sports bar kind of place. There are TVs all around the room, comfortable seating.  The food is good  - lots of burgers and wings that they offer 100 flavors. Overall, a solid place to relax with friends, with good beer and great food. Awesome place to watch games and i definitely will go there again. 4
Horrible customer service..  And I went through the drive thru how hard could that possibly be??  Tortillas were very rubbery. Robertos is better 1
Best sushi that I've found in the Chandler area since moving here a couple years ago. Reasonable prices and good quality, friendly service too. 4
Don't know if this review is fair but I was at a work function and they had us upstairs and we only had appetizers. They quickly ran out of food and took them awhile to refill. Appetizers were average. I was disappointed. Maybe I need to give it another try. 3
I want to start off by writing that the service was very good, and everyone was extremely attentive even with a packed restaurant.  With that being said,it was the food that fell short. They claim the food is east coast Italian, but I'm from NY, and practically lived on Italian food, and it didn't taste anything like back home. I played it safe and tried the spaghetti and meatballs. I agree with another reviewer when she wrote the meatballs were very bland, the pasta its self was almost al dente (under cooked), and the whole dish lacked any kind of taste or creativity. And theItalian bread tasted a day old. I just want a decent chicken parm :(But if you enjoy places like Olive Garden, Macaroni Grill, etc....Then you'll probably like this place.  More so for their very friendly staff and owner/chef. 2
Would highly suggest to try this place awesome sandwiches 5
I hired Maids 2 Scrub for a Saturday move out deep clean. It was important that they showed up because the next day I was having a carpet cleaning crew come in. Maids 2 Scrub never showed up, never contacted me, and when I contacted them an HOUR after they were supposed to show up, they told me they would "check on it." Another HOUR later, they still never contacted me back so I told them to cancel my appointment.WORST cleaning service I have ever contacted. 1
I came in early this morning and didn't wait longer than 15 minutes! The imaging tech was very friendly and made conversation to make me comfortable while taking the x-ray. They also sent the images very quickly to my doctor's office making the diagnosis easier. The waits can be an annoyance if you go in the afternoon or evening but they do warn you that it is walk in only on their website and posted on signs throughout the office. 5
Food and pricing is fair. Service and table maintenance need lots of work!! I can not stand dirty plates EVERYWHERE!! Disgusting!! Obviously, the management is unaware of what guests expect. I would like to let them know that customers like to have their dirty dishes removed from the table when they are finished eating. Just sayin', but I could be wrong.They were NOT that busy that we had to endure, for the last time(!) this ineptness.Seems like an alright place, but service standards should be reviewed. There were 6 or 7 tables on the patio, and four of them had dirty dishes piled on them and no one sitting at the table. The busser showed up once during our entire meal and the servers never touched a dirty dish. Too bad, Haymaker and Tailgaters are close by and seem to be a lot more on the ball. 3
Came here for dinner on a Sunday night. There was a short wait, about 15 minutes. I came with family and we got quite a few appetizers and entrees. To start we got freshly made warm French bread and butter, which was good. We also had the chicken mousse pate and escargot. The pate tasted great, and they gave a large slab. The escargot was only ok, there were 6 in butter sauce but weren't as tasty and were pretty small. For the main course we got au poiuve steak and scallops. Both were unimpressive. Steak was thin and sauce wasn't that tasty. Fries also came with the steak and they were very salty. My mom and sister got the scallops which were big portions but were also very salty. The meal overall costed over 200$ but value wasn't there. The service was great, but overall I should've gotten more value for the meal 3
There are...things to discuss about this place. Let's tackle a review, huh? Whaddyasay......Bliss/ReBar? You are a wizard. And you put my friends under a spell. I say this because you have mesmerized them into thinking that this is the only place downtown to eat or drink. They want to go there. All. The F*cking. Time. All the time. And I can't keep up. I'm not affected by your Jedi mind tricks...or your Hogwart's spells....or your One Ring to Rule Them All....so it leaves me sitting home, having just recieved my umpteenth text from a beloved friend which reads "At REBAR!! Get your ass over here! Hurry!" and just sighing and maybe shedding one tear and deciding not to go. And then spending a night in...reading a good novel. Like Dorothy Zbornak. I just can't go as much as they do.What did you do to my friends? And why?Let's get something out in the open....you can't give a restaurant a 5-star review based on cheese nachos. You just can't. Please find the nearest Yelp Exit and use it...because you're taking up modem time. also.....this place has been open for just over 6 MONTHS. Quit bitching that it was "dead on a weeknight". It's a new restaurant! In a shitty economy! It takes time! Be grateful you have extra $$ to go out to dinner with! BREATHE and give it a chance. They are finding their crowd (outside of my wizard enchanted friends, that is). Don't take it out on the establishment because you got your roots done and there's nobody at the restaurant to notice. That's not the restaurant's problem.THE FOOD: Gotta tell ya'....while I think their food is 'OK', I'm actually shocked that the gays have made this their new home away from homo. There's a noticeable amount of fried items on the menu, and it seems out of character for the gays to build a hive around a place that serves that kind of food. I think the coconut chicken tenders are nice....but they're nothing without the sauce. The salads are good (have had the Cobb and something else I can't remember the name of) and they were decent, but they weren't mixed: they were piles of 'salad ingredients', so if you're picky, asked the kitchen to pre-toss your salad (HEY now...). Really like the chicken lettuce wraps. They're a nice alternative to chicken fingers. Have also had the macaroni and cheese. Found it very tasteful, but I do agree that it's overpriced and am not sure what the "and more" means, either.THE SERVICE: I've had some slow experiences, but no 'bad' experiences. I do NOT envy having the burden of staffing a new restaurant. It would be a daunting experience - especially in Phoenix. There is a lot of incredibly mediocre service in Phoenix. It is hard....HARD, folks, to find good restaurant staff here. It's shocking, and I don't know the answer. I think some of the staff at Bliss/ReBar needs to get a little more fire under their ass and quit worrying about looking pretty to everyone, but I wouldn't say anyone is outright bad. The bartenders DEFINITELY all have different pours. Some drinks come out like water, while others actually taste like they contain more than an eyedropper amount of alcohol. Quit being stingy with your pours!! It's a BAR! It's REBAR, to be more specific! And a large portion of your clientele is GAY. Give them strong drinks! They bear the burdens of an oppressive society! They can't get married legally! Intoxicate them and they will be loyal scouts to your establishment. Do this instead of cheating by using wizard power to trick them. Trust me on this.THE CROWD: Since this establishment has one heck of a marketing team, they get a lot of exposure. This place has been coined "The NEW Place to be Gay". I'm not sure what that means. Or what the old place was. Or that we had to 'go' someplace to be gay (The Mormons and Baptists just informed me that the 'someplace' is called hell.). Is it like showing up at a party and announcing "HEY EVERYONE! I brought GAY! Anybody up for a few rounds?". I digress...anyway...it's unfortunately the Amsterdam crowd. Often. Young twinks with a lot of hair product and darting eyes. But on the other hand, you can usually find local actors in 'post rehearsal' or 'post performance' mode there, so that's kinda nice, I guess. But it is a lot of the same people.... all under the same wizard spell. Petrificus Totallus.So yeah - it's nice that this place has had it's 3rd or 4th reincarnation and that it's going nicely. This location has been a veritable k-hole of business ventures that crashed and burned. Hopefully it'll last. But is it worth going every night? Nope. Does it really warrant a listing as one of Phoenix Magazine's top restaurants? Hmmmmm....not sure on this one. They will need to raise the bar on their menu items to convince me of that. So until the evil gay wizards decide to release my friends from their evil spell, I guess I won't be seeing them very often. This makes me sad. 3
We had an accident resulting in a massive amount of red, green, and white/clear candle wax getting spilled all over the carpet.  Greg & Ryan were able to come out the day I called.  They were timely, friendly, professional, efficient, and courteous.  They told me there was only an ~80% chance that all of the wax could be removed, and I appreciated the honesty.  They completed the wax removal and cleaned 4 rooms in barely over an hour, and there is literally zero discoloration or other evidence that the accident ever occurred.  The rest of the cleaned carpet looks like new.  They have earned my future business and my recommendation- I couldn't have asked for a better experience! 5
I love this place! My fiance And I go here atleast once a week. The portions are huge! Food is amazing. I love their carne asada. They have great lunch specials... Leticia is super nice and cares about what you think of her restaurant. You have to try their cheese enchiladas too the sauce is different And amazing!!! 5
I come in here quiet often and it's amazing! The first time I came in here Daniel M was our server and he has been ever since. We make sure to ask for him each time we come here. He's absolutely amazing. However, tonight when we came in, and we asked to be seated in his section and the host replied "sorry, he has no open tables in his section." So we're like like okay, we'll just wait until something comes available. And she looks at us and says "okay, goodbye. Have a good night." With a snooty attitude. She didn't want to take our name down and let us wait, she just turned us away. And what's worse was there was a MANAGER standing next to her and he doesn't say anything. This place is very poorly staffed (hosts) and poorly managed. Every experience I've had with a manager here isn't very good. 1
Services received:  Pediatric out patient surgery for two children.Number of times visited:  1.Recommend to others:  No.  At least not for pediatric cases.Staff courteous, knowledgeable, and helpful:  Mixed.Issues:  - Upon check-in pre-surgery staff immediately advised us that the surgeon was "running ahead of schedule" and as a result they would be "rushing" us through.  The staff quickly overwhelmed us (and we are not easily overwhelmed).  - Our children (both under the age of 8) were not treated in a manner best suited for children.  Since they are well behaved and highly compliant we felt they were treated more harshly simply because the staff could.  If they had been more visibly upset or less compliant maybe they would have been treated with a little more care and respect.  - My husband and I were bombarded with questions pertaining to the children at the same time in an effort to quickly establish a history and physical for each child.  Instead of doing one child at a time, they had us do both.  This forced us to focus our entire attention strictly on staff questions, rather than having one parent tending to the questions while the other tended to the children.  - Staff moved too quickly when touching the children.  They did not pre-announce their intentions when touching them or moving to the next step in care.  They just grabbed and did.- We found the environment to be cold and strictly clinical.  There were no red wagon rides to surgery (as our friend's child had at another local hospital), no jokes, etc.  One exception to this however was a staff member during recovery bringing them a stuffed animal.  I think she picked up on our displeasure and the overall treatment of the children.- While waiting with our children in the recovery room staff was overheard loudly discussing the status of other patients.  We had one nurse yell to another nurse (from one side of our curtained off room to the other side), "hey, how bad was that guy when he came out?!" - It was clear to us that we were just a number to St. Rose Dominican Hospital.  They wanted to get us in and out as quickly as possible.  - The only positive feedback I can provide to this experience is that they are easy to work with regarding payment arrangements. 2
Very disappointing. Our ultimate nachos were cold, the cheese was crusty and the steak was dry and had a burnt aftertaste. You could make better Nachos at home. The guacamole had no flavor it was just mashed avocado which had the faintest taste of avocado. The salsa was not spicy at all it was like watered down ketchup (but if that is what you like hey you do you). The appetizer platter was less than impressive. The best part was the cheese Crisp which was some of the worst I have had. There was a long wait, so we figured it must be good. Boy were we ever wrong! Steer clear of this place. 2
The first time I went to Howl at the Moon was with my brother.  I spent the night singing loudly along with every song and continuously requesting songs that I hadn't heard in awhile.  The musicians are very talented, but I would not recommend coming if you're not ready to sing along and enjoy the music.I felt the drinks are a bit pricey, but affordable, and the service is pretty good...even on really crowded nights.  If you are planning on going on a weekend, you might want to get there early if you want to sit down.I don't think this is a "regular" spot for most people, but definitely worth visiting every once and a while. 4
With out question the GREATEST sandwich in the world. I travel to Las Vegas at least once a month for business and I come out of the way to eat here EVERY time. In the past few years I've lived in California, Michigan, and I currently live in Arizona. Simply nothing compares to this place. I've ordered the #16 every time this year. Hot turkey, cream cheese, bomb sauce, avocado, Dutch crunch bread.... The bestI've never had anything else, but everyone I bring here orders something different and they love it too! 5
Really good food, the burgers and fried chicken are excellent. Great drink choices and an awesome atmosphere. 5
5 stars for service, 3 stars for the food. I would like to give this restaurant two different ratings because the difference between the quality of service and the food was significant. We ordered a porcini pizza and had to hunt for the mushrooms. In fact it was sparsely populated with anything mentioned on the menu. 4
Being that I'm new in town from California I had no idea who to turn to when my laptop needed repaired.  I stubbled upon this shop because it's right around the corner from where I work. I received good service at a fair price. 3
my honey was looking for a good steak house in Vegas and this one came highly recommended. Everything from the bread, to the salad and the filet mignon was to die for. nicely aged and very tender. my beloved had the porterhouse. the service was magnificent.  lovely and romantic. 5
What a great addition to the hood. I came here for some late night snacks last night and they've improved their execution immensely since their first week. The $6 negronis are great value as mentioned previously. There's something about the opaque cups and ice cubes that made things more...delicious. Three Negronis later I was in a pretty good mood. For eats, I had the buffalo cucumber (good combo), the knuckle sandwich (solid crust), and the calzones (reminds me of mini pizza pops but wayyy better). All were amazing. I think the only thing this place is lacking is a clear identity. On one hand they want to be a casual sit down restaurant for families and urbanites alike. On the other hand they want to stay open late and cater to that snack bar crowd. The decor is for the former and the ambience suggests the latter. It's a little confusing. I would also look into some crunchier bread to sop up that amazing sauce on the sandwiches. Overall, this is a dope spot. And I think it will really come into its own once the World Cup starts. 4
come here frequently but first time yelping the place. Simple menu but good fresh food and service. Prices a little high, but it isn't fast food either.  Chips and salsa are very good as is the carne asada. 4
my god after trying this place once i decided to give it another go and the food here is fucking gross as hell damn shame. 1
When I needed a battery replaced in my watch this summer, yelp suggested this place. They were friendly and helpful and very happy when I came into the store. They even remembered me when I came back a few days later to pick up my watch! I had a very good experience. So when my husband needed the battery replaced in his watch today, I suggested T-Bird. When we walked in, my husband asked the red-headed sales assistant if he could help him with a watch battery. "Not really," he said blandly. "Our watchmaker is out until November 6.""Well," my husband asked, "is there someone else you could recommend?""No.""Ok, well thanks for your help."We walked out. That guy could not have been less helpful. And that's really sad because my experience this summer was so positive. But not this time. If he had even TRIED to be friendly or even just smile, let alone make a suggestion, it wouldn't have been so disappointing. Not coming back.*Note: The guy from the store called me just now - maybe four hours after my bad review. I'm guessing they had my number from when I went there this summer? Anyway, he apologized. So I'll change my review from 1 star to 3 stars, kind of splitting the difference between my first experience and today's experience. 3
I went to this place under the recommendation of a few friends and though I have to say that this place is indeed quite yummy if you have a sweet tooth, it wasn't as spectacular as I thought it would be.The prices are indeed on the pricy side, but keep in mind that a lot of the portions they sell is, well, pretty big. A friend and I bought a $14 sundae, and when it came out, it was a bit bigger than we imagined it to be. Heck, we had three people eating that sundae and we still could not finish it (or maybe we just have small stomachs for Vegas food)! The sundae was also waaay too sweet for me, and this is coming from someone who has a mild sweet tooth! Too much whipped cream too.The frozen hot chocolate, however, was quite indeed delicious, but man, my cup looked bigger than a Big Gulp from 7-11! Saying this beverage was huge is an understatement. It was still nice, however. For a second I thought it would literally be frozen hot chocolate right from a freezer, but one taste of it made me think otherwise.If you come here, do try out the hot chocolate. However, the place isn't that amazing as I thought and I probably won't be taking a second trip to this place again. 3
Best kabob's in Madison. The service is also great. I have been here with different crowd sizes and have always left happy and satisfied. 5
Waited 45 minutes to be seen for my consultation. Only to find out they don't do what the receptionist ASSURED ME OVER THE PHONE they do. 1
Great sushi, but they were very rude on the phone when I ordered. I called this evening to place an order for delivery, and the man yelled at me that they were too busy for delivery, and hung up on me.  I ended up calling back and just placing an order for pick up, and the ladies inside were very nice. The food was great tho, good prices too. 2
The food was pretty good.  Great atmosphere and crowd. But the waitress with the dark brown hair was rude and our food waited for her on the counter for 20minutes before givibg it to us so it was very cold. Her attitude was negative.  She rushed out orders and the orange juice is gross. 3
I ordered the steak but it was when I didn't know ordering it medium / rare was the best way to have it. I ordered it almost well done which ruined it for me. Experience was nice, but I expected more since this was a " higher " end restaurant. 3
Well. Mixed reviews for this store.  Love the selection and prices. The restaurant is a nice change from the local dining scene. My only complaint is the checkout process - they must enjoy tainting a wonderful shopping experience by only having a few checkouts open and staffing them with surly cashiers.  Hate the checkout process at this store. 3
Great service + great food = Great place.   Noodle and Rice is hidden near the QT, so hunt it down.  There are not many tables, but it's clean, recently refurbished, and serves great food. We ordered two items (one noodle dish and one curry), split them, and still had lots leftovers for later.  One other thing we really liked - Really large glasses of water that are constantly filled. This was important because we selected "regular" spicy level dishes and found them to SPICY. (Loved it!) Go there, have fun, highly recommended. 5
My husband and I stopped here looking to buy a gun for me. I wanted a try a few out and see what I liked.  So we go down to the range, rented 2 different 9mm, got through 2 magazines, and a round got stuck in the chamber. So I leave the gun, go out to get the guy, tell him what's wrong. He comes in, tells me exactly what I told him, and proceeds to tell me that inexperienced females shouldn't be shooting guns!!!  He continues to berate me as loudly as possible, even though I followed protocol!!!  Their gun malfunctioned, and he yells at me! Then when I was leaving, he was just a complete a$$hole that did his best to make sure everyone in line knew that "the girl" messed up.  I didn't like the gun, the store or the customer service. I will NEVER give them my business again. I love paying $100 for someone to make me feel like a piece of garbage.  When i purchase my gun, it will not be from them. 1
I can't say I share the love for this place. It wasn't the worst but it was by far no where near the best.  For me, it's on the lower end of typical Americanized Mexican food. I was looking for something meatless, but when I asked the waitress about their vegetarian options she really didn't have any suggestions for me.  So I went with a bean burrito.And that is exactly what I got. It was a plain bean burrito with runny, salty beans and some sauce on top, with rice served on the side.  The combo came with a quesadilla and again just  totally plain.  A hunk of bland white cheese in between a tortilla.  It wasn't hot so it was chewy.  The other people in my party seemed to fair better. Their items came with rice, beans, lettuce tomato sour cream guacamole etc.  Same opinion as to quality and taste, not the worst but not great either.  In regards to service, it was ok start to finish.  The hostess was friendly and greeted us upon entering. We were seated quickly. Our waitress was nice, if not somewhat absent, as was the guy who we paid at the end. The restaurant itself was colorful and everyone there seemed happy.  The place was really loud. They definitely try to maximize the seating.  Overall it was ok, but I can't say I'd go back.  There are so many better options out there. 3
My husband and I have been wanting to try this place out as we don't eat gluten or dairy and they offer gf pizza & vegan cheese, which we are thrilled about! We ordered a pizza and wings and I will say that we both agreed they tasted great- no complaints there. However, there were 2 big issues we had with our experience: 1) They only offer 1 size of gf pizza; for an average pizza place this might be understandable but when at least 1/2 of your advertising efforts are put toward claiming to be "allergen friendly pizza place"- it should be expected that you offer more than one size pizza as my husband and I splitting 4 slices was pretty disappointing...so why didn't we order a 2nd pizza? Well, that leads me to the 2nd issue- the price...$24 for a small pizza (4 small slices) and 6 wings is MUCH MORE than a little on the pricey side. Again, while the food was good, with all the GF options coming available now, we will spend less $ getting more pizza elsewhere. Please lower your prices & offer more than on sized pizza Mandy's because we'd really like to come back! 3
I went to the restaurant for dinner and ordered the sea bass.  It was delicious and it came with a side order of vegetables. I really like this place and will return in the future. 4
7/15/2014 6:30 PMParty of three: nice waitress ALLY ask for drink request. I asked for Tomato Juice and beer. NO tomato juice only bottle mixes for alcohol. Ordered Margarita, bottle mix. Pepsi ok. Ordered 20 wings medium. Ok. Ordered salads for three,  Romain, slice of cucumber two slices of tomato hot house. Chicken fingers fried as one big blob. Popcorn shrimp again fried as blob, but cooked dark brown. Shrimp was frozen along time it was very fishy!Waitress and service from her was excellent, but worst food I have eaten twenty years. Please don't go there. Bill was $58.00 plus tip. WOW WHAT A RIP OFF. Manager never visited request. 1
Gary did a great job on my new gate. He recommended synthetic  wood and WOW does it look good. It matches my house better than I imagined! Great workmanship and reasonable pricing. Gary is the person doing the sale and the work. I really enjoy working with that kind of business. Thanks Gary! 5
The hotdogs were interesting and good. Lots of tasty combinations. The service was good too. Worth a visit if your a hotdog fan. 4
Great food and service. Really loved the beats in yogurt.You will need a reservation and you should plan 2-3 weeks ahead.Despite being upscale, the price point is very reasonable.Halal is available for parties when you call ahead. 5
One of the challenges of rating a place like this (as other folks have pointed out) is that there is a pretty diverse range of exposure to this cuisine by the others who have already reviewed it. Perhaps it was an off day but man was I disappointed. Full disclosure: I am a pho snob. There's one particular favorite spot in San Diego and no matter where I've roamed outside of Vietnam, no place comes close. With that being said, the pho here was just full of sad.  The broth lacked the full-bodied herbaciousness I really appreciate about good pho.  Now, to be fair, this is not marketed as a restaurant specializing in the pho experience but rather has a variety of vietnamese foods (banh mi, pho, bun). I had the Tea Lite Special...it was not special. Flat flavor profile on the broth. Bland meat. The spring roll was not a win. BUT when the pho came out sans fixins' plate (basil, bean sprouts, lime, jalapenos) and they charged me an extra dollar for it after I went back in and asked for it...that just put me over. The gentleman at the counter (maybe the owner???) was also pretty surly. All told, I likely won't be back. 2
This is my first post to Yelp. It has taken a lot for me to actually do this as I my self am in customer service. This McDonalds is horrible. It is filthy! I drive a lifted vehicle and you can see the floors and counters while I'm in the drive through , atrocious. I travel a lot and see a lot of drive throughs and this is bad. They're constantly out of supplies (Coffe, soda, ketchup).  I am currently sitting at a booth that half of the cushions are missing, no sign, tape or anything warning someone not to sit there. Because of convenience I try it once a month but I will drive the extra distance to another one. Please, someone raise the standards.OMG. I just checked my order. Took them 3 times to get it right...... 1
This review is based on my visit on August 1st, 2015.I really love this location. The staff are friendly and efficient, even on a Saturday morning. I ordered a Caramel Frappuccino, which tasted great, though I do wish they would have put more caramel on top! Given that it is so close to my house, I might end up with a coffee addiction! 4
I absolutely hate driving into the South End area, but I love, love, love this place.  They do biscuits right! I have had great service each time I've been here.  There can be a bit of a wait, but that is the case with any decent restaurant.EDIT: I still love the food at this restaurant, however, try to pay cash if you can. I had to remove a star because I used a particular credit card here (and had only used that particular card there) and within 2-3 weeks had several fraudulent charges between $200-$300 each at grocery stores.  Not necessarily accusing anyone, but I will say the waitress went out of her way and into the back for a while before coming back with a receipt to sign...  Use cash if you can. 3
The overall property wasn't bad, however, after receiving the property in so-so condition, and requesting the repairs be done, we realized they were never going to do anything to fix this house.  We proceeded to take care of the landscaping to make it liveable, and has the floors cleaned and polished upon moving in.  Originally, Zack told us those things would be deducted from our rent over the first couple of months to reimburse our expenses - they never discounted anything.  A year later when it came time to move, we made sure we returned the property in FAR better condition than we received it in (and expected to have our deposit returned).  I have been calling and mailing them for 3 YEARS now and nobody ever answers.  When I do get someone on the phone they simply say that Ashley is the only one that can resolve this matter, then Ashley disappears and never calls us back.  This is not legal - make sure you stay FAR away from this company!!! 1
As noted by many other reviewers, the wait staff at DDD is nothing to write home about.  I would go one step further and say that the bartender was the most unfriendly, rude person I've ever encountered with that particular job description.  Friendly bartenders get good tips--just a thought.  I will say, though, that my burger (Melting Pot--a complete heart attack on a plate) was delectable and perfectly cooked.  The cheese curds were also fantastic.  So I will be back, fully expecting not to recieve stellar service.UPDATE, July 2013:  I haven't been back!  There are so many other great places in Madison that offer fantastic food and friendly service!  I've also become attached to my thinner waistline.  Why would I go back to Triple-D? 3
Lived there for a year and a half and couldn't move out soon enough.  Where do I begin.  The apartments look nice but that's where it stops.  They are not very well built, noise carries very easily you can hear every thing if someone lives above you.  Drains clog weekly, power dims off and on..constantly switching out light bulbs from power surges.  The granite counter tops are nice but who cares with all of the other problems.  Utilities are extremely expensive easily add $500 to your rent.The neighbors are okay for the most part, however their are a decent number of kids who are completely unsupervised running around the complex, trashing the computer lab & pool areas.  Some of the dog owners there are completely disgusting leaving dog crap on the sidewalk daily.The pool area is not bad but teenagers invite massive groups of friends over and party like its spring break half of the time.  The computer lab is a joke, printer doesn't work most of the time (which is the only reason I would go down there).  Gym is actually not bad, open 24 hours which is nice.  Parking is terrible, I cannot emphasize this enough.  I have  never rented an apartment where a space is not included in your rent.  A handful of times on weekends I would have to park at Discovery Park and walk to my apartment before I caved into paying for a covered spot.  A number of times someone would be parked there only to find that the office would accidentally assign my space to someone else.The staff is friendly but incompetent.  They could never coordinate with the maintenance staff correctly.  Something would always be "misunderstood", what work orders needed to be completed, which days, which times.  It was mind boggling how the right hand couldn't talk to the left hand.  When I gave my notice to move out they changed the locks on me the next day by accident.  In my opinion the staff is very nice but just completely untrained and unqualified to manage the property which is what leads to most of the other problems. 1
My elderly mother was a patient for 2 weeks in this facility as rehabilitation from abdominal surgery. This facility is a horrible place.  It is severely understaffed, and it is obvious that employee morale is low.  You can call the nurses station and no one answers the phone.  I had to fly out from the east coast in order to get anyone to pay attention to my mother. The doctor was arrogant and too busy doing admissions to examine my mother.  She contracted c diff and no one would listen to me when I said something was wrong with her.  She had some good physical therapy, but most days it was only for 30 minutes.  Many days my mother got her morning meds in the afternoon and I was given the excuse that one nurse had 25 patients and couldn't come until then, or that it was the nurse's first day and she had to take her time. The food is awful and often arrives cold.  If you care about your loved one, don't be fooled by the nice building. My mother is now home and doing much better with home health care.  Stay away! 1
Located at the top of the restaurant strip on Roncesvalles, The Westerly is a cozy neighbourhood spot that is sure to please.  The uncomplicated menu features classic dishes done beautifully and just a step or two above others'. Five of us arrived for dinner last week and were greeted the charming co-owner, Tom, who presided over the evening with grace and warmth.We spent an inordinately long time trying to decide from the 10 appetizers and 10 mains. Each looked better than the next and made our decisions more difficult than usual. While we deliberated, a bottle of shiraz and a custom champagne drink were ordered and a basket of some of the best foccaccia I've had in a long time arrived at the table. The crust was crispy and salty and the filled basket did not last long.After a solid twenty minutes of deliberation, we placed our orders: the romaine heart salad to split two ways; steamed PEI mussels in a grainy mustard butter with a side order of fries; roasted Chicken Supreme stuffed with pulled pork (yes, you read that right) served with bacon & smoked cheddar Israeli couscous; the house burger, made with ground chuck, veal and braised short rib; pan-seared arctic char served atop Israeli couscous with lobster; and roasted halibut topped with salsa verde and served with potatoes and mussels.When the food arrived, five sets of eyes widened. The plates were beautiful and smelled fantastic.  I'm lucky enough to have friends who share, so I got a little of everyone's meal. While all were delicious, there were a few outstanding bites that I would return for which I would The Westerly in a heartbeat. The Israeli couscous with smoked cheddar and bacon was aromatic and, surprisingly, not heavy at all. The smoked ingredients permeated the little couscous pearls, infusing them with a ton of flavour.  Next was the burger which was so tender it nearly fell apart in my hands as I ate it, juice running down my hands. It came with a spicy salsa that cut through the richness of the burger beautifully.  Undoubtedly, this is a big crowd pleaser.Between the two fish dishes, I preferred the halibut. I liked the lightness of the fish paired with the bright salsa verde. There was certainly nothing wrong with the char - it was rich, not overcooked and the lobster-laden Israeli couscous was excellent. The balance and combination of ingredients in the halibut dish, though, really appealed to me and I will likely order it upon my next visit.Amazingly, we had some room left for shared desserts. I opted to split the warm apple crumble with fresh whipped cream while others went for the lemon tart. The crumble was comforting, filled with cinnamon and topped with large, buttery pieces of crumble. Incredible. Definitely a great end to a meal but I recommend sharing as it is quite heavy - otherwise you may be rolling out of the restaurant, pants unzipped.I would return to The Westerly, unquestionably. My friends and I had a great time in a charming restaurant in which we were treated well (though there was some miscommunication with a dessert, it was rectified gracefully).  If you haven't been, add it to your list and prepare for a lovely brunch or dinner! 4
This was the very first place I ever tried Boba! Didn't know what it was and almost choked on the tapioca balls...10 years past and still haven't stopped me from drinking boba.What I like about No. 1 Boba is they are probably the only place that serves it with fresh fruits. Only probably with that it's really watery, but quite delicious. The milk tea is really good! Lychee is a must try! Watermelon is my favorite! 4
Our options were Vdara or Aria but we decided to give MGM a shot since the name has spoken for itself throughout the years... Soooooooooooooooo, we were a group of 4 friends from the East coast and went to Vegas for the World Series Rugby tournament..When we arrived we were shocked when we saw the tube TV, no refridgerator/microwave and internet access unless u paid extra $!@#$%^&*. Old wall mounts and paintings and carpet..our room was of course 3 miles away from the elevators.' Room service was OK, but one day they cleaned the room and did not offer clean towels...we had to call 12 hrs later...they left one bar of soap no refills on toilet tissue..the blue/blk pillow is very disgusting do not lay ur head on it!.. When we got the fridge it was an old old old one, that was delivered on an old Formica cart which ended up taking too much of our room space...en left our drinks frozen...again at an extra charge.....We could not warm up leftovers as having a microwave is also extra $ any-who....... PROS You get the Vegas feel on the main floor with all the gaming machines The lions The buffet is clean. Location CONS No variety at the buffet No free Internet, fridge,microwave Old TV The bartender at the Centrifuge.....very rude! They change bed linen every 3 days of your stay! Wall decor pre historic age! It is just soooo overrated......not worth the $... Next time i would go for the newer hotels Aria, Vdara..and the soon to be Cosmopolitan... What does MGM mean? My Gross Motel?????????????/ 2
We were in town from Boston and went to dinner here on Thursday night. Great local beer selection as well as fun Tiki cocktails that were on special that night. The food was great, I especially recommend the appetizers and the lamb burger, delicious. I wish we lived closer because I would definitely come here all the time. 5
This is a great place to taste authentic Japanese Izakaya or Teppanyaki styple cuisine. Not your typical mainstream Japanese restaurant here in Toronto.Amazing service and the food is just awesome. 4
I have been to the bar upstairs (Harvard and Highland) many times, but I tried the food for the first time last night. Overall, it was ok but I wouldn't make the trip for just the food again. A friend and I sampled the brisket, pork and ribs. The brisket had the texture of a wet sponge - far too tender and if you didn't order brisket, you wouldn't even know that it was beef to when the cooking process began. The pork had some unique flavor, but wasn't the best I've ever had (had better off a friends smoker). Overall, I liked the ribs the most - good flavor and just about the right amount of tenderness. The cornbread was crappy - you could make better with a box of mix off a shelf. A couple of friends ordered the fried chicken and mac & cheese - I got a small sample of both - I would say both were the best two items I sampled. Also - I think the prices of the food are a bit steep - usually BBQ give you so much food that you feel like a glutton - now I'm not looking to eat that much at any time, but I feel like you are paying for the name (and name of the chef - that being said I have been to some of his other places and I do enjoy them) rather than for high quality BBQ. The atmosphere is cool, but honestly I would rather eat BBQ at a small shack with crappy plastic chairs - just seems to fit the foot better. Overall, its it good - not really - its it ok - sure - but for my BBQ desires, I'll grab food from Pittsburgh BBQ company and eat on a picnic table instead. 3

I love this restaurant!  It might be my new favorite in Vegas. I have brought two of my foodie friends and they both LOVED the food!  The crispy duck panang is just awesome ! 5
This individual deserves zero stars. Jamie is one of the most unprofessional individuals I have ever come in contact . Her business is such a disgrace to leave her brides high and dry. I have been trying to get in contact with her but no response back. Jamie continues to not answer my calls. You can continue to have my posts removed Jamie, but I will continue to repost them. 1
Probably one of the best HK food I've had in Vegas. If you're in Vegas and looking for some non-greasy HK food, check this place out! 4
I cannot believe I have not reviewed this bakery gem, this little slice of Heaven, the sugary wonder, my sweet and reliable Suarez Bakery.  Cream Horns-- seriously, the flakiest pastry shell, sprinkled with powdered sugar and filled full of the lightest, fluffiest frosting-like fill.  Snickerdoodles-- cinnamon sugar yuminess on top of an elephant ear like cookie/pastry.  Elephant Ears-- a huge treat that is as large as a 5 year old's head (really).Sugar cookies-- all shapes and decorations, perfectly sweetened to be able to eat several without feeling ill!  --- They also make these to order--- perfect for school parties that require cookies for decorating and the mom who does not bake!Cupcakes-- all different flavors.  Delicious and lovely.Cakes-- Tizzerts.  Need I say more?  Just the best cake you can put in your mouth... Our wedding cake was Tizzerts, and have had several other special occasion cakes from Tiz.Thumb print cookies--  perfect for the little bit of sweet tooth, a small sugar cookie/ shortbread like cookie, topped with a smudge of frosting (this is my go-to treat).I do not have a sweet tooth like the rest of my family.  So my go-to is the thumb print cookie but, even without a sweet tooth, the temptations of all this goodness cannot be resisted.   We celebrate milestones and accomplishments and hard days and completed projects by occasionally popping into Suarez and picking out a delectable treat.  -- Seriously, the made to order cookies have saved me for years as a room mother who cannot bake-- 5
Went to Alleycatz on a Friday for dinner after we purchased a groupon for a 3 course meal. Service was good and by the time we left at 9:45pm it was packed. The food however was just ok, all 3 courses we nothing special and by the time we paid for drinks, plus the added in tip, and tax it was a $130 meal. For that price we've definitely gotten way better food around Toronto. 2
The worst pediatric office I have dealt with, very unprofessional team from front desk to the Dr. They need a hygiene class, an ethical class, and definitely some class.nurse was doing a strep throat swap I'm doing she helped my baby's face was so aggressive and just shoved the stick in her  mouth 2
I've been getting my supplements from this place for years, since he opened, I've watched store double in size and triple or quadruple in what he offers his clients, very wide range of products and everything I've ever bought has matched or best online prices. The owner(Tom) is a great guy and does have knowledge on mostly everything he sells as he has researched and listened to clients on what to provide. Never had any issues with any freshness or quality. Suggest to all in the southend and charlotte area. 5
Toaster is broken or they skimping on the heat. Subs came in cold. Toppings were minimal. Had to ask to give me more lettuce. Twice this occurred. Avoid this one 1
I've been here multiple times and I have to say they never disappoint!I went with a friend to grab brunch and ordered two eggs benedicts, the pulled pork and salmon benedict (definitely the bang for your buck).The food came quickly as it wasn't that busy during a Wednesday brunch hour. Our waiter was pleasent as they checked our table to ask about our food and took away our plates promptly.The pulled porked benedict was phenomenal as always. The sauce on top of the pulled pork was addictive and made me want to ask the chef for the recipe. The eggs were cooked perfectly;  runny in the middle and cooked enough to hold its shape. The homemade fries coated in the homemade ketchup sauce which was perfect; tangy, sweet and comforting. The salad and the piece of fruit were a nice ending to such a delicious meal. My friend and I were stuffed by the end of it.Overall, this place is one of the best places I've been to for brunch! The stunning, comforting food and excellent service will keep me coming back for future brunch excursions. 5
Average Thai food, adequate service.  I had the Siamese Basil.  Unfortunately no alcohol is served but the waiter told me they are working on obtaining a license.  A decent atmosphere except for the grating smooth jazz (please something else!). 3
Been coming here for years also. But never done a review. The best dish is getting the souvlaki with some of the house wine. The tzatziki it comes with is meh.Over all I would recommend this place for families with older children. 3
It near my feieds palce so we come here once a month.It is very authentic mexican food.   We shared Polls poblano    it was ok but nothing as special as it sound  on menuChicken fajitas    very solid , very Flavourful and not dry or iver cooked like other place.Chip and quacamole   is amazing but pricy .sounds simple but most do make it that wellSat in the back . It ia nice and quiet. 3
Update they wanted my email so someone from store could contact me?  Are you kidding me you guys are the absolute worst business in the area.  Terrible customer service and I felt abused by the employees.  Why they have such a high yelp score is beyond me.  They should not be allowed to operate the way they do.  Zero stars is way too much. 1
the ugly stepchild of Binkleys.  I'm a huge fan of Binkleys, but they should have just stopped at that.  The fries are amazing, but I don't spend that kind of money to go eat french fries.  The sole barely had enough meat to justify serving anything on the plate.  Moreover, that minimalist portion of sole was overcooked.  Our waiter was irritating and trying way too hard but still didn't quite get his role.  I'd go back, but certainly not anytime soon.  I'd rather save my money and go to Binkleys. 2
Food was ok. Some dishes great others lacking. Service was poor. Server non attentive and un-apologetic when she forgot to enter our order. Would not go back as there are better Italian options on the strip. 2
I was there a few days ago with a group of mostly asian friends, myself i would have never chosen to go here because I hate spicy food.The restaurant was very cute , nice atmosphere, the servers were efficien,but  to me the food was boring ( I guess because I had requested my food to be the least spicy as possible), however everyone in my group loved everything they had.... 4
We went for breakfast, and it was a great time. This was a Tuesday so there was no line and the atmosphere was pretty relaxed. Loved the food. Wish I had a bigger stomach. There was such a large variety of foods, from good old fashioned American to Asian. I actually really liked having rice soup (congee) for breakfast. Made my day. I liked being able to have prosciutto and fresh crepes.One thing I didn't like was that our waitress kept looking at our receipt, which we had left of the table. It was weird and made me uncomfortable. 4
My family and I had lunch here recently @ BJ Brewery and had a great time.  I ordered Moroccan Salmon and a glass of local tap beer and my choices were awesome!  We also ordered fried calamari and avocado roll for appetizers to share.  The lunch was just perfect with great food and great company. 5
It's kind of hard to rate, because I've always had good wings and cold beers. Problem is the staff. Like someone else on here said, it's pretty hit or miss.A few weeks ago we went to BWW before a movie. We had dinner and a couple beers. We had a really nice waiter who got our order right. Food was good.After the movie we decided to go back and have a couple drinks since it was right across the parking lot from the theater and we weren't ready to go home yet. Being a Friday night, it was considerably more crowded than before the movie. We got sat in the bar area. Another group (much larger!!) was sat right after us. They had their beers before we even had a waitress greet us. We finally asked their waitress if she could find our waitress. She apologized and went to get someone.She walked over by the bar and told a waitress that she had a table. We've been waiting for OVER 10 minutes at this point. She ran over and apologized. (Our friend had noticed her earlier flirting with the bartender-she'd been standing there the whole time!!) She said she was sorry and that she had a big party of drunk people and was dealing with them. Ummm.....hunny, we saw you standing by the bar the whole time.Anyways, we accepted her apology and ordered. She brought out a round of beers and never came back. Finally we had to flag her down and she apologized again. We ordered a second round of beers and she forgot them at the bar. Not kidding. When we flagged her down AGAIN she apologized and said if she forgot us again to throw something at her to get her attention. Kinda felt bad for her, she was obviously having a bad night.We wanted our check and she was nowhere to be found again!! When she finally came by she actually told us not to worry about a tip and that she didn't deserve it. Well, duh. Their food is good but their service is sub-par. We've had a good waiter here and there, but seems like a lot of the waitresses don't have their head screwed on right. 2
Honestly, it's a filthy and horribly managed restaurant. When these burger joints get management right, there will be success stories like Chick-fil-A. The owners of these franchise operations think cutting is the way to get more $ in their pockets. Yes! In a small way! But if your business is consumer alluring and not consumer repulsive, that's when the growth potential really talks money 2
Oh, man this is good pizza made the way God intended: In a wood fired oven on a crust that is just thick enough to hold up all the toppings. We went on a Friday night and they were completely packed, which means that the oven was having a hard time keeping up with all the orders. I've had pizza at places endorsed by the Rick Steves crowd in Italy, but this place was actually better. It took quite a long time for our food to arrive, but once it did it was pizza heaven. I need to find out when they are not so busy so I can go back the next time I need some Neapolitan goodness. 4
Arguably one of the best pho restaurant in Montreal. Portion slightly smaller than other competitors for x-large size. Very quick service. 4
We went to Cut on Saturday night with a large group of people. The service was outstanding...waiters and other staff who truly want you to have a fantastic experience. Everyone is trained well and working hard.The steaks were good, but not great. If you have ever tasted real Wagyu beef in Japan, you will see that Cut steaks are not remotely similar. However, they are good (just incredibly overpriced). That being the case, the other items on the menu were excellent. Great bread, especially the pretzel (house made) and the creamed spinach was the best ever. If I went again I would order a cheaper cut of beef or simply skip the beef and order a whole bunch of appetizers with wine. 4
Not too bad of a stayRooms updated and clean. Had hot water and cable issues both nights of stay. Was refunded my resort fee for the inconvenienceBased on overall price, it can't be beat. Close enough to the stripWould stay again to save money 3
Excellent customer service but the food was a bit of a let down. I ordered the BLT, which features a fried green tomatoes, popcorn shoots in lieu of lettuce and applewood smoked bacon. Conceptually it sounded great but the execution failed. The bacon was clearly not freshly cooked and the tomato was mushy and flavorless. Overall, the sandwich was just a mess. 3
For starters no casino. What a way to start. All the rooms are so-called suites which means one king size bed and tge rooms are small. They attempted to create a "kitchen" , but no plate, silver wear and no coffee maxhine. What a joke . They only give you soap, shampoo and lotion. You want anything else you have ti call them. Its a bother. I didnt get any comps...no perks . Nobodt even offered a discount on any shows. The pool is a joke.....clised at 7pm efen on weekends??????? If you want a las vegas experience this place aint it. Priceline f#$ked me. What a terrible las vegas trip. Good news i won alittle money at poker. 2
A group of us wives got a Living Social for the 6-hour grilling and smoking class for our husbands last year. Awesome gift, huh? Nope. They all had a terrible time. One employee spent a big chunk of time in the beginning of the class explaining how much money they lose when the customer buys a coupon. Awkward! The guy had a whistle that he would blow if you talked too much, and the guys spent the majority of their time doing dishes. Lame. We were all in the doghouse for awhile for wasting their entire day. The only positive my husband said was that the guy that was grilling was nice and somewhat entertaining. 1
I have purchased 2 cars from Camelback VW and had good experiences. George sold me the second car and was very pleasant to work with.A week ago, I was in again and looking at trading in my TDI that I purchased from them. They offered me $4500 for a car that I purchased from them a year ago for $15k. When I expressed how I was displeased with it because the VW TDI scandal is the reason the car's value plummeted, they came back saying they could give me $9500 since I've purchased from them twice and they want to maintain that relationship. Today, I was told they could give me $4k and that the manager who told me $9500 a week ago either quit or was fired (conveniently). After some back and forth, they said $5k is the best they can do and They'd get me out the door at $39k in a vehicle on their site for $24,500. So not only do they NOT value the relationships with customers, they have proven that they do not stand behind their vehicles and definitely do not anticipate the VW "fix" to restore value to their vehicles. That said, George was still pleasant to work with and kept trying to get his managers to step up and be an honorable business. I highly discourage people from purchasing a vehicle here, but if you do, buy a used car and get it from George. 1
Not truly gelato (not in the real Italian sense of the word), but decent enough.They should add yummy toppings to their menu - only places with mouthwatering gelatos can get away with not having hot fudge, chocolate sauce, etc. 2
Sweet Olenka's designed an AMAZING cake for my son's first birthday. It was a carrot cake with cream cheese icing. Quite possibly the best carrot cake I have EVER had. I told the baker that my son loves animals so wanted some sort of animal theme. I also provided her with the plastic cake toppers that I wanted on it but she created the rest with STUNNING results. The price was SO reasonable that our guests were shocked! And the cake tasted just a delicious as it was beautiful!Hopefully you can view the cake in the photo section to see what I mean. 5
I've been to this place twice now.  The first time was for brunch, and I thought it was really good.  Very eclectic, with a neat mix of neighborhood folks and a wonderful breakfast menu.  So, in my head it became a breakfast place.  However, my husband has gone there several times for dinner at times when I've been out of town or unable to join him, and he always said it was good.  Last night, I was craving something a little naughty (you know, cheesy, gooey, etc).  We were having a hard time trying to decide where to go, and I happened upon the Zada Jane's website and menu.  They have a really cool interpretation of nachos that sounded so good to me that we decided to go there.  Even after hearing about the specials, I stuck to my initial idea about the nachos, with chicken on top.  Let me just tell you, I couldn't have been more pleased.  They have black beans, grilled zucchini, and corn covered in a very creamy manchego cheese sauce, topped with guacamole and sour cream.  So, it was a healthy-ier version of nachos with all of the yummy stuff that makes nachos great!  This is something that I'll order again (and again), and changed my thoughts about Zada Jane's being just a breakfast place.  It is actually a great neighborhood spot for any time of day.  The wait staff is incredibly friendly, and the chocolate cake rocked.  Go try Zada Jane's! 4
As a rule, I'll take an independent little breakfast diner over any chain and the Stanfield is no exception.Hiding out in the corner of a squat little office tower in a mostly industrial area, the place is easy to miss. Waiting for my car to be serviced,  I fired up Yelp to find an alternative to the stale  magazines and disturbing snatches of phone conversation in the shop's  waiting room. The big swing in Yelp ratings made me want to try the place out for myself, maybe settle the score.The decor is clean and new, looking a little bit like those remodeled Tim Horton's cafe style stores with faux brick inside, gas fireplace, big comfy,  private booths and a few TV's scattered around. This Wednesday morning, service seemed to favour the regulars as the servers were busy chatting with them and didn't notice my empty coffee. Wave and a nod later, and I'm sorted, so no harm.I had a breakfast that would have scored an approving nod and grunt from Ron Swanson. Good sized portion, bottomless coffee all at a price a little better than similar places across the highway in Toronto. Nice family vibe, no rush to get me out and lots of free newspapers  (the Sun, why even ask?). If I was in the area again, I'd be back. 4
The ambience is the bulk of it and the food is ok. The staff (bartenders) were great and very attentive.  The food always seems to be average. Tonight , I tried the tacos and they were less than mediocre. The steak was like leather and we gave it 2 tries. YUK! They took it off of our bill which was the right thing to do. 3
Food quality is not great, not the absolute worst.  If you're not there at the early morning special when prices are $2.30/dish, it's not worth it.  We ordered extra dishes (pork buns), which never came, even though we asked 4 times over the course of 40 minutes.  Each time the server assured us that it was just  about to leave the kitchen.  The dishes they have were clearly purchased and heated to order, which lots of other restaurants don't do. 2
This place really does have the best red velvet pancakes in Vegas.  Delicious...very fluffy!  And I liked how they have whip cream, chocolate chips and cream cheese to top it of.  The pork adobo fried rice is also really good.  It's wrapped inside a scrambled egg.  The flavor of it is perfect.  I also got the scrambed spam one time; and it's just okay.  I don't think I would get it again; probably just stick to my favorites.  I just wished the restaurant was bigger.  Because sometimes we have to make sure we get there early enough to beat the morning people planning to have a LONG breakfast.  Staff is really friendly also (oh, and I have probably mentioned this before in my other reviews; where we have noticed that when a restaurant is not busy it seems like you get bad service.  Bad meaning...slower?!  People hanging out at the back or by the bar.  Well, we had this incident once at BabyStacks since we went early.  My husband was waiting for a refill on his coffee and did not get it until 15 minutes later.  Weird, how that works; seems like a place has to be jam packed for people to keep moving).  Oh welll...still good and the price is alright :) 4
We ate at Tom's in Las Vegas for an anniversary with our parents. Between the four of us we had the 10oz fillet with lobster, the T-bone with lobster, lobster bisque, fingerling potatoes and asparagus and drinks.I personally had the 10oz fillet with lobster. I would rate the steak a 7 out of 10. Ordered it medium, it came medium to medium well with the outer part more on the med-well to well side (tough to cut, which should never happen with a fillet).Overall I would say it was a fairly good meal, not great. I would, however, like to point out a glaring issue I had with the restaurant. I would consider this to be fine dining as our bill was over $400 with tip. In any fine dining restaurant, your tables should not be placed 4 feet from the bar. I had guys yelling in my ear and was elbowed in the head (some may say I deserved it...). We did see other tables experiencing this same issue. In my opinion, this is poor restaurant layout, but something that could be easily fixed if they chose to do so. It put a definite damper on the night.Enjoy! 3
I have been coming to Dr Skabo for close to 3 years now and I have never been happier. I feel fantastic, struggled with back pain most of my adult life until I found him and his practice. The man works miracles IMO.  No sales pitch, no pressure, he is a very compassionate and smart chiropractor who will not rest until you are feeling better. I may be moving out of state and I am truly nervous I won't find a Chiro as good as him, he set the bar very high. Go see him, you will not regret it. 5
*DISCLAIMER* Awful and unapologetic service! Though many reviews offered high marks for this restaurant's food, in my book, the thing that sets the tone of the restaurant is its service. When we (3) first entered the restaurant, no one greeted us and there was a party of 10 and 2 in front us. Many people showed up after us, so it seemed that the restaurant was popular. After 25 minutes, the party of 2 left while the party before us waited an hour before they were seated. And yet even after they had just been seated, a party member had to grab the menus themselves from the front because of the lack of service. If a restaurant receives as many high reviews, then high quality service has to be accompanied with it. I don't care if the food supposedly tastes good. If the servers don't even apologize, let alone acknowledge you, why bother? 1
Food is pretty good, not gonna lie. BUT you have to make sacrifices if you choose to eat there. It literally takes an hour to an hour and a half to deliver food. Seriously. EVERY SINGLE TIME. Doesnt matter if we order at 8am, 10am or 1pm. Never fails, they take F-O-R-E-V-E-R. If you dont get what you ordered or you are upset by them delivering your breakfast around LUNCH time, be ready to have the owner talk down to you and be a total bitch to you for i dont know, just wanting what you pay for?! Its over priced. But its decently tasteful food. Takes forever. Owners a witch. And i'm pretty sure that they continuing forget to pack my extra ranch just to piss me off. End Rant. PS- I've never gone in there to eat because i frankly, i'd rather tip the nice delivery driver then the ignorant imbeciles that work in the dining area. PPS- My hot chocolate today was cold. They should call it Cold Chocolate. Or start caring if their hot chocolate is hot. One of the two would be great! 2
I have only ever done takeout. with the size of there menu  there is nothing that i can say i will go here and no where else. The sauce for the Gyro is liquidity. For Middle eastern type food i would suggest going to Aladdin's 3
Great atmosphere! Owners Frank & Alicia treat you like a guest in their home. Happy hour 7 days a week! (I almost don't want to share what a gem this place is, so I can keep it to myself.) The meatball sliders are amazing, and there's a pork chop with polenta on the Happy Hour menu for only $7!! My parents are regulars here now, and I can see why. If I lived closer I would be too! All in all, a great place for homemade Italian dishes (and desserts) that is perfect for the area! 4
Hostesses here are difficult and make you feel unwelcome. They wouldn't let me sit at a patio table to enjoy a drink and an appetizer while the patio was 2/3 open tables. I had to promise to be no more than 30 minutes so that a 'real diner' could have the table instead.  Sorry for inconveniencing you Chelsea's Kitchen. Not to worry, we left after 30 minutes as promised for fear of being asked to leave if we ordered a second drink. For a place that doesn't take reservations, you would think they would allow a first come, first serve patron to enjoy their beautiful patio. Sadly, the hostess took the enjoyment out of a otherwise lovely Saturday afternoon. She could at least smile. 2
Ok food. Prices are OK. Just an ok place to eat if you feel for steak. The ribs are better at Madison or Baton rouge. Good service. 3
If you want long lines, having to ride two buses from the airport, a dirty car, and up-selling ("the air conditioning is better in a midsize car"), this is the place for you.  We waited 1 hour in line at the counter......I felt sorry for those behind me.......looking at 2 hours.Pay the additional money and get a better experience.Sept 3rd....... 1
the restaurant is good and clean the food delicious .. i love the the marsala But it is pricey .. 3
My second time at pure and its always a good time..once you get past the door. If you're here on a busy night, do get bottle service or know someone or something that can get you the VIP treatment. the "guestlist" area was a HUGE mess and patrons are generally not very nice. it took a lot of effort to get to the front and even more to get in. But of course, once you're in, and the booze is flowing and enjoying the view in the outdoor area.....I had a great time dancing the night away with my friends. and 3 stars because there isnt anywhere to sit and the door was crazy. 3
Frankly, not great. Very low value for the price. We requested early check in (1 pm instead of 4 pm, since we had a wedding to go to at 5:30 pm), and they do not confirm or ensure you really have early check in... until you are there! For the price, it's ridiculous. Then the room... old, noisy (we could hear every second of the room next door running water, for 3 days), no coffee/tea in the room (are you kidding? There is a mini Keurig in every single hotel room I've stayed!), no min bar, 3 medium size towels in total, for 2 people!, 1 tiny shower gel and one tiny shampoo - for two people! Then the coffee, again. There is an "express coffee" service, presumably because there isn't any coffee in the room!, they say in big bold letters in the room service booklet "12$, in 20 minutes or less or it's free!". We order coffee, after 30 minutes nothing comes up. We are now late. My boyfriend calls down again and they say "oh, he is on his way". "But it's going to be free, since it's been way longer than 20 minutes". "No, WE DON'T HONOUR THAT ANYMORE". Really. We tell you we do, but we don't, just you spent 23 $ on one coffee (12*+8$ delivery+tip) and it took 43 minutes. This is a pretty bad place to stay. 2
I called Just-In Time on Monday to see if they could move a very large china buffet to Goodwill.  They were very professional and courteous and mentioned I could save some money with the Yelp Deal in place.Robert and Rick, the crew, were very professional, on-time, and very efficient.  I was so impressed I wouldn't hesitate to use them again!Thanks guys! 5
Had my heels built up and the sole of the heels replaced for $18. Work was great and the prices are very reasonable, considering the place I used to frequent charges $25 for the exact same work. Very fast turnaround (dropped off Thursday and picked up Saturday). And they had lots of cute replacement laces to choose from for 2-3 bucks/pair. Will definitely be returning! 5
Took my husband to this place for an injured leg. Everyone was great. The check-in was quick and easy, Dana (the nurse) was friendly and efficient, Jennifer ( the NP) was knowledgeable and kind, and Shawn (the x-ray tech) was cracking us up with his humor. We highly recommend this place when you find yourself in need of urgent care! 5
Years back I would always be here but went back and whoooa what a change and not in a good way :/Would give 0 stars but I can't. Horrible place to go.  Only go if you want your night to be ruined.  Rude people working there. They don't have manners they talk back to you. Very poor customer service was only their for 5 minutes. Guy working their was acting like he owned Westgate and said to go back to Phx. HAAAAA I live out west so kinda sad that they have people like this running this place. 1
Joshua and Melissa were very helpful in finding a mattress that worked for us.  We were not in any hurry to purchase one but Joshua listened to our needs and accommodated us.  We got everything we needed at a great price. 3
3.5 starsWe've been to Crave ever since it's opened. I've tried a handful of dishes there and for the most part, I've enjoyed my meals. I've also had pretty good service here as well. First time we came here, we were with a larger group, they had just opened a couple of weeks before and the manager came out to get our opinion. Nice guy who genuinely wanted to get our feedback. My previous visit, my husband ordered the lamb chops. They were all bone and my husband was really disappointed - it's not a cheap meal after all! So he bought it up to the waitress and she offered him a new meal.Most recently, I had the New York strip and my husband had the filet minion. My steak was over done and was tough to eat. Gravy for my potatoes did not taste proper either. My husband shared half his portion with me - his meal was cooked perfectly.  My friends who ordered steaks and pastas were pleased with their meals, so I was the odd one out. Dessert was good - had the molten chocolate cake with ice cream - delish! The waitress was nice - very cheery, quick with our requests. 3
I arrived shortly before 12 and was advised that they could seat me but the chef was not there until noon when they open at noon....Their sign says 11am.There were at least 5 tables already seated.  I checked out the drink menu and ordered a split which I was advised is NOT champagne.. Hmmmm. I ordered a wine and a hot tea instead.  My friend ordered a water with a straw and she did get the straw after asking about 3 more times.  Of course the bus boy not only did not speak English he did not bother alerting the guy that did if you tried to communicate with him.   The tea came in the cutest blue and white tea pots that leaked all over the place when you poured it.Actually all their tableware was a custom blue and white pattern that was really nice.  If it had fit in my purse it would have been sooo gone! :-) J/k ....sort of.I digress. I had a Soup, I think it was Tom Kha vegetarian.  I asked for the spiciest they have.  It was really good except for one root type thing that was un-chewable like a branch.  My friend said her soup was great too.At this point I was already super full but then the vegetarian curry came.  It looked great but it was so hot that it was pretty much inedible.  When I took the rest home I looked at it and it looked like he had just dumped a jar of chile peppers in there....It did taste good though...So, I guess the moral of the story is do not be cocky with your rating of spice although in my defense I always order it the hottest level at Lotus and it is always hot enough to make me sweat not cry.  This was "mouth on fire then sneezing fits after" hot.I reallize this review is not glowing but the funny thing is I really enjoyed it and can't wait to go back. The waiter did a GREEAT job handling a Sunday crowd solo. I will probably opt for a medium spicy, arrive after 12 and pour my tea with caution! 3
Worst rental car experience I've had so far.  Had a reservation 11 days in advance, but this location refused to fulfill it.  They had the reservation details incorrect from what I was told on the phone, so I had to call my corporate number to have it corrected in the system.  When the phone representative was able to correct the reservation, I went back to the counter only to be told "My manager said we are going to refuse to rent to you".  When I asked for a reason I was told "we can refuse to rent to anyone".  I feel discriminated against.  I had to walk a mile to another location to get my reservation.  I asked for an apology but still no contact from the manager. 1
Hands down, best sushi place I've ever been to. Customer service is always a must have with me and this place is all about it! Have had every server (been there that much) and they are all friendly, know the menu, and recommend the best specials! The sushi is amazing, don't be afraid to ask what's good that day because the chefs know what's up!! Atmosphere is never a let down. You find yourself conversing with the boss in no time, which makes you feel really welcome :) 5
I could not believe how bad the fried rice was it was not even edible it was all burnt and hard, the orange chicken was horrible it tasted rubbery. I just couldn't even eat the food and I ordered it from postmates while I was at work so it I couldn't even go back and get my money back for the horrible food was. It all tasted old and just so bad! 1
This is a great store and we do most of our grocery shopping here (when we don't buy a vat of something at Costco). After a new remodel the store is clean and well stocked. The employees are helpful and very nice. There is a cashier named Patricia that my wife and daughter see all the time and she is amazing (super nice, fast, knowledgeable). I would give this Fry's 5 stars except that I often shop at night and after 10:00 PM they close down all the cashiers and make you do the self checkout. That is fine if you have 2 items, but if you are doing your shopping for the week, it is such a pain. The self-checkout machines often malfunction and freeze while telling you "the attendant had been notified." Also there is not enough room to hold all the items you have already scanned, but the machine still keeps telling you "please place the item in the bagging area". Lately, if I am shopping after 10:00 PM, I'll go to Wal-Mart ... Not because I prefer Wal-Mart ... but because I know they will have at least one cashier working. 3
Tasty but price. Not a cheap meal, but I did eat there twice in one day. I might stop by one more time before I leave Vegas. 5
Haven't been here in over 11 months because of working out of town. Stopped by today and the salt water fish area has to be half of what it was before. Looks like a good supply of reptiles but not sure because I'm more into the salt water side of it. Customer service is not even close to what it was. Would have been two stars but the fact that 18 months ago the fish/live rock I bought are still thriving. 3
Even before we got through to door, I was impressed with the workers polite gesture of holding the door for us. Our server was very nice and responsive to our requests.  The dining area was spacious and modern with both booths and tables. The food was delicious and it had a very nice presentation! I got the power wrap and subbed the turkey with some chicken and was delighted with the wrap. The house roasted Crimini mushrooms were simply amazing. My friend got the winter seasonal A.M. Superfoods Bowl and even though she isn't a big fan of coconut milk or chia seeds, she really loved the bowl and couldn't stop tell us throughout the meal.My other friend got the avocado toast and it certainly came piled high with smashed avocado! Yum!I would highly recommend this place for a nice breakfast with friends or family and I even glanced at the lunch menu and was impressed with the options there too! Will definitely be coming back! 5
Fabulous place for all occasions- from a family weekend brunch to a weekend night out.  The one restaurant to eat in Montreal if you had to eat all your meals in one restaurant. Great service (even nice to the kids). Delicious food. And a menu that everyone can find something to love.And delicious profiteroles. 5
The food was ok, the prices was too high and very few selection dinner choices. Will not return, because of false statement made of another restaurant, very unprofessional 2
I ordered Rad Na Seafood and they gave me Rad Na instead because waiter did not here us correctly.  We asked nicely to exchange.  They said no.  WTF!  Never heard a resturant not willing to correct their mistake.  I also ordered Crispy duck panang and papaya salad.  Both were very good.  But waiter very rude.  No service.  Had to waive them down to get their attention.  They need to improve their service.  I guess they dont gave a f because they have lines walk out the door. 1
At first I walked in and felt like I had found the promiseland.  It wasnt too crowded and the waitress greeted me as though we were old friends. All that I could see were rows and rows of steaming buffet tables.  With that, I didnt even sit down before heading over to a station to grab a plate and begin the feast.I went straight for the sushi and it was good.  Nigiri pieces were small, but thats fine.  Its all you can eat!  I piled on about 6 pieces and grabbed some peel and eat shrimp and went about my business.  I did the same after that with orange chicken, duck, bacon wrapped shrimp, fried rice, noodles, pork sparerib, and a bunch of other things that looked appetizing.  All this for less than 13 bucks a head!Anyway, the long and short is that the quantity is crazy!  There must have 60 different items including whole crab and crab legs...even frog legs!  But at the end of the day the quality of all of these items is very, very "so so".  The crab legs would never be worth the effort as small as they are nor was the crab.  The peel and eat shrimp werent really worth it either as small and shelled as they were.  The duck was mostly bone and for the fan of frog legs they were tiny.  The oriental offerings were fair in taste.  Didnt hold a candle to a Panda Express quality even (Boy...I would love if the would do and "all you can eat deal"!)  Nevertheless, they did have some treats that you couldnt find elsewhere like sticky rice in plantain leaf which I always love!  Now there is no way that you can touch this price for all the items available!  So I have to give them kudos for that.  Its got to be great for kids to be able to try so many things that I sure as heck never tried when I was young...but if you are seeking quality along with your quantity I might sugges heading just a mile or so East to the casino...but it's gonna cost you a few bucks more for the buffet.If you are saving room for dessert, dont.  Nothing special in this department other than the soft serve which you can dump on top  of the "apple pie" (not really apple pie, but apple filling with some crust on it).  No matter how much you eat we can always save room for soft serve!Once again...the waitress was sweet and was very attentive.  I dont normally tip at buffet's but I did since she was right on top of our dirty plates when we were heading up for more.  A definite plus!!!  So bang for your buck?  5 stars!  Quality of food? 2.  Total...probably a 3 to a 3.5.  I will be back one day when I skipped lunch and just got done at the gym and am FAMISHED!!!  But probably not til then...But I am sure you'll be around since it's surely one of the best deals going.  See you then! 3
Although this seems to be a 'hydroponics' store (as far as products they carry and the culture/attitude of the place-a bit different of a feel from the 'upscale', or 'mom-and-pop' type garden centers),  it has a number of organic fertilizers and amendments (liquid and solid), seed starting mixes and organic soil mixes and other seed starting supplies useful for the outdoor organic gardener that likes to start their own transplants. They moved to a bigger location up the block last year and I haven't had a chance to fully explore the new store. They seem to carry a large selection of lights, etc for indoor growing but I am not in the market for those. It is in a somewhat obscure location in what seems like a light industrial/manufacturing area but worth the trip over there every spring to get what I need (it's also across the road from Farm and Fleet if you need any materials/supplies from there). 4
Dreadful. Had to use their services in a pinch to get a cupcake for a gluten-free friend. They had the music so loud in the store that I could not hear the clerk and he could not hear me. On top of which the cupcake was apparently disgusting. Prices are outrageous for the quality. 1
I think this restaurant location is cursed.  I ate there when it was Renegade Canteen under Robert McGrath and never enjoyed the heavily meat-centric menu.  I returned last night with friends to check out the new experience and was even more disappointed.  The food was okay at best.  Ordered the beet salad which seemed to be more lettuce than anything else (thankfully the lettuce was a nice spring mix as opposed to iceburg or romaine), but lacked in beets (tasteless), dressing or character.  I then had the short rib which for most Americans would not be a large enough portion, though I commend them for keeping it on the small side.  My food was luke-warm and just blah.  My friend had the baby back ribs which were dry and lacking sauce.  The two other diners had the lobster pasta and said it was not bad, but nothing to write home about either.On top of it all, our server was terrible.  He forgot to bring the glass of wine my friend ordered to start, forgot about the appetizer we had ordered, brought a manhattan that my friend had ordered with extra cherries, with no cherries saying they had run out of cherries (come on, what bar runs out of cherries?), and kept referring to us as "guys" which we found annoying.  My red wine arrived very warm - red wine should be served at about 65 degrees, not 80!It is too bad this restaurant can't find the right owner/chef because the space is very nice and the location near my house, and there are no good restaurants in this part of town.  There are better options out there.  This place is trying to be something it can't deliver.  I will not be back. 2
"Meh" actually sums it up really well.Below average in  almost every way.  Not horrid, just below average.   Below average atmosphere, decor,service, food quality, selection, and yes, below average prices.   They seem mayo happy, it was used abundantly in almost every single roll.  Above average use of mayo.  So, next time you are looking for a below average dining experience, something decidedly "meh", THIS is most definitely your spot. 2
Great downtown location, wonderful staff and terrific service. The food was good, nothing mind blowing, just kind or average. Lots of potential though because the space and ambience is great! 3
I love El Chullo! I grew up in Peru and I've had a hard time finding good Peruvian food in Phoenix but boy, El Chullo gets it just right! I would go more often if it weren't that pricey. I mean, considering it's a "hole-in-the-wall" type of restaurant, I think their dishes are a little overpriced. But it's delicious for sure! 4
Return customer this was my 2nd visit to the shop, even though I sat with a different barber this time I still expected the same quality of service. After getting home I realized that I had to touch up a few areas on my own and that I had 2 razor cuts, and I only received half the beard trim service than my first time so I had to touch that up as well. I was also very surprised that the guy charged me 30 bucks for this but still I didn't think nothing of it gave him a 5 dollar tip and walked out. I will be taking my business elsewhere. Date of visit 1-14-2017 1
As we walked in (my bf and I) we were greeted by the hostess and asked if we wanted to sit in the bar area or table. Of course we sat at the bar since we decided to do the all you can eat since we don't really do the specialty rolls we just do the plan sushi. If you love the specialty rolls they do have a wide selection.Order up:4 orders of Octopus1 order of Uni (so I finally decided to try it and it's totally not for me; It really taste like the ocean.)4 orders of Baked Green Mussels (good size)5 orders of Surf Clam (my bf really loves surf clam)1 Order of fresh water Eel1 Order of the Hard Rock Roll (not too bad) 1 Order of Oysters (delicious)1 order of screaming orgasm (I've had better)1 order of crab salad 1 cheesecake So yes you can say we got our money worth. AYCE $26.95 Dinner $20.95 Lunch and just add $5 for all you can drink (domestic beers). They also really do time you because the chiefs tell you that your time is up and you can't order anymore (happened to the people sitting next to us). I know the rules for AYCE but every place I have gone to has never said that to anyone. Overall the service was good, no wait time, clean, and the food was good. So yes I would recommend this place but if you have a big crowd I wouldn't be so sure because if you do decide to do AYCE you might not get your money worth since they do really time you. 4
The staff is very friendly. Service is good. Food is also very good. For guys, sitting and being able to watch ESPN on with flat screen is an added plus! :-) 4
Great food and awesome drinks. Waited over 45 minutes for checks and they were wrong. Lost seating in the cigar bar. Don't go with a group over 2.5 people. 2
Located in the basement of Organic Marketplace on New Hope Road, the staff makes fresh soups and hummus daily. Also homemade salad dressings on thier raw food and salad bar. They make healthy wraps and pizzas and have a great selection of smoothies. 5
Wow.What a meal I had last night at Daisho. From the moment I drove up to the building and took in all the people outside (in line for Noodle Bar) and the rooftop party the Shangri La was hosting on the rooftop I felt like it was going to be a sick night. There was so much energy in the building. I felt like I was part of something much bigger than me. I felt like I had "made it".Anyway, I walked up and was promptly seated with my friends. Cocktails are pretty pricey at $16 and they're no different than something you would buy at any other cocktail-focused establishment in the city. Nevertheless I did get a Man About Town and it was stiff and tasty. Here's what food we ordered:- Pork buns - pretty awesome with peameal and yolk. Breakfast in a bun!- Rice Cakes - OMG. These were like rice gnocchi in an asian tomato sauce. Incredible texture and flavor on these.- Wild Rice - least favorite dish. I found it quite salty for my palette.- Grits - Matt Blondin used to make the best grits at Acadia. These were amazing!- Apple and Bacon Salad - This dish really worked. Amazing idea, amazing presentation, great flavor profile.- Cabbage - we got this on a limb and this was actually my favorite dish. They turned one of the most boring vegetables into something truly amazing. The edges of the leaves were slightly charred, that's all I can really tell you--I have no idea what else was in it but everyone at my table couldn't believe they were eating cabbage.- Hangar Steak - served with bibb lettuce leaves and condiments so you could make your own lettuce wraps. A solid protein plate.- Chicken - excellent presentation but the flavor left a little to be desired.- Chocolate - we go the chocolate for dessert. It's like a mousse with some ganache and the chocolate was imported from france. I haven't tasted chocolate like this before.The final damage was $100pp tip in. A very affordable and truly memorable dining experience. I will be returning to try some of the larger family-style plates. 5
This place needs some cleaning!!!!!! We tried it because of the great reviews , the buffet was gross, the hibachi chicken was not bad, but just eating it in that dirty place wasn't pleasant. 2
Service Department ReviewI brought my 1997 Jeep Wrangler in for a recall part and to have them look at two other issues. My Appointment was at 8:15...I arrived at 8:00 and couldn't find the service guy that the online system arbitrarily set up for me. There were five other service reps there that could have helped me as well but my guess is that the pay is commission based. I waited till 8:15 after they paged the guy three times (I understand my appointment was at 8:15 but as you will see, it wouldn't have mattered anyway). The diagnostic was going to be 120ish dollars so I opted to just have the recall part put on...I scurry off to the waiting room and wait... 75 minutes later the service guy comes in and says "That part is on back order" WHY DID IT TAKE 75 MINUTES TO FIGURE OUT THE PART WAS ON BACK ORDER?!?!....His reply was that it had to get into the service bay first to figure that out. Which means my 8:15 appointment didn't get into the bay until 9:30. SO...He asked if I wanted them to do a general diagnostic... Since I already killed 1.5 hours waiting, I agreed. 45 minutes later and no sign of the service guy again. I get stir crazy and walk outside looking for the service bays where the Jeep might be loitering. Low and behold my Jeep is parked in the drive up spot where you first pull your car in (Not a service bay). I rip off all the little paper things they put in your car and I LITERALLY STOLE MY CAR BACK!!!Oh and a little side note for the Service Department Reps DON'T COMPLAIN ABOUT OTHER EMPLOYEES WHEN YOU ARE IN FRONT OF A CUSTOMER!!This might be nit-picking a little but this was shortly after the big dust storm in Phoenix so my Jeep had a layer of dirt on it... Well I'm assuming they would have to open the hood to do the 25 point inspection (not just plugging in the diag machine). Well when I got the Jeep back there were no hand prints around the hood, on the hood latch or anywhere near the hood or fenders. So that leads me to believe that after I told him to do the diagnostic it just sat in the bay for 45 minutes till I took it back. This part was an assumption but I feel was backed by adequate proof. 1
After living on the east coast and sampling some of the best pizza there is to offer, I was incredibly disappointed in the pizza here. I actually had decent expectations. I was wrong. First, when I received my pizza, it was cold. To the point that the crust was slimey. In terms of the tomato sauce, chef - use some salt, would you? It was bland. Salt is a catalyst in "conveying" flavor. Charred crust can be delicious; however, they have managed to make it bitter to the point of no return. And the basil. Oh don't get me started. I love basil, but the basil on my pie was rotten.  To be honest, Little Ceasars is better tasting, and I don't like Little Ceasars very much. Don't brag about how amazing your pizza is when in all reality, it's nothing to write home about. I would rather pay to fly back to the east coast and get Pepe's or Lombardi's than to ever eat this "pie" again. 1
If Possible, I would give both American and US AIR zero stars; DO NOT FLY AMERICAN AIRLINES. Was on flights both domestic and international and the flights were absolutely horrendous.  I have status with them because it's a preferred airline for work, but next time flying on vacations I'm transferring my Sapphire points to another airline.  What are the deficiencies compared to Star Aliiance, Virgin, or even British Airlines as their own partner:Lack of updated aircrafts on long haul flights, lackluster service, limited entertainment options, less professional flight crew than other airlines outside of the pilots.  This doesn't even take into account delays and lost baggage which has happened too many times. AGAIN, I SAY TRY NOT TO FLY WITH THESE AIRLINES.Thanks for reading. 1
Great times and drinks. Their pancake event that happened earlier this year was not very good. The pancakes were not fully cooked and they only had two people cooking. 3
Alright, after visiting Sweet Melissa 4 times (2 breakfast and 2 dinner), I have to comment. As the previous reviewers noted - the food is good, I'd say even "pretty good," but the service is just downright poor. For the most part, servers don't really seem to know what they're doing - forgetting waters/drinks, not knowledgeable about the menu, when you ask about a dish they respond with a deer in the headlights -  "its good!" Asked about beers on draft and she just muttered something and walked away to check. This place straddles the fence between casual and family friendly and chic and hip. Personally,  I think it suffers from an identity crisis.Any positive of the food is completely wiped out by the poor service. With plenty of other restaurants to choose from, you can do much better. Please improve! 2
If I could give zero stars for this practice, I would. I've seen Dr. Epstein twice. The first time I saw him my primary care made an appointment for me to be seen right away since my MRI showed lesions on my brain.  Dr. Epstein himself seems to be a funny guy with a very dry sense of humor.  I can see how someone can get easily offended though by his jokes.  That first appointment, he looked over my MRI records I brought in and suggested I get a spinal tap to get a diagnosis; thinking its probably multiple sclerosis.  So I had my spinal tap and a week later I was scheduled an appointment to get my results. When I went to my appointment (paid the copay), I waited an hour to see him just so can ask me if I had my spinal tap done. I told him yes, that my appointment was for the results.  Do they not communicate? So, I basically wasted my time and money going to the appointment just so they can tell me they don't have the results yet.  They should have called me at home to reschedule. They said they would give me a call within the next week.  Almost a month later, I still haven't heard from them again. I've left countless messages with his assistant, Angela, with no return phone call, saying they have my results or don't. It's a shame the office is horrible since Dr. Epstein is very knowledgeable. Go somewhere else if you need help, or expect to communicate with anyone. This is the worst office ever, don't waste your time if you want answers. 1
Naka OUT!What a great experience, I have not enjoyed an AYCE sushi experience like this in years. I was the first customer at Sushi in Summerland and a weekly visitor for 7 years, till the original owner sold the location and left for Henderson. After he left, the location took a fast and steady decline. I have spent the last 5 years in sushi limbo, trying one place after another. Then I found Naka Sushi! Not only is the original owner of Sushi in Summerland in the kitchen, the namesake Naka is behind the counter serving up the best quality and variety of AYCE I have had in years. The restaurant is well staffed and Naka is crazy fast with a happy go lucky attitude that is a breath of fresh air.You have to appreciate a Chef that is willing to say no when ordering an item because he does not feel it is up to par. When was the last time that happened in an AYCE Sushi Restaurant? My biggest thrill was enjoying some of their kitchen specialties I enjoyed years ago, but have been unable to find equal; Spicy Baby Octopus, Dynamite, Green Mussels, HOT Shrimp Heads, Etc.With the talent running this Restaurant, I would expect to spend the next 7 years back in AYCE Sushi Heaven!FYI. I joined Yelp just to post this review, so you know this comes from the heart! 4
You can imagine how excited I was to see Criss Angel. Watching mind freak, completely blown away. So for my sisters birthday I made sure she was able to catch the show. Big disappointment. The art and pieces that were placed before entering were amazing, the theatre was gorgeous, and all around comfortable. When the show started, I thought for sure this was going to be a good show. Im not use to a warm up team before the main event, but what do I know, this was my first magic show and it was amusing. Once Criss Angel came on, I was excited...but that's where it ended. Most of the show was basically a back story. And when tricks would present themselves, they either malfunctioned or were done poorly. I understand you wanting to put some back story...but going as far as making the tricks elementary and catchable to the eye!Now I'm pretty slow with slight of hand...I don't catch those things...this show was an exception to that. It's like he took the simplest tricks, dolled them up, and passed them for mind freak quality. It wasn't. Criss Angel is better than this. Something needs to change...or I fear this show will go under...fast. 2
Of the Vegas hotels I've stayed at, this place ranks above only the airport Travelodge and the only reason I stayed at the TL was someone stupidly scheduled our meeting during CES. Think 1970's motel, including the pizza delivery flyers strewn about the hallway and under your door. My room was clean and decently large and that's all the positives I can think of. Did I mention the tattoo parlor opposite the front desk? A discount is included in your fun pack when you check in.It's clear there have been improvements in recent years but in a rather haphazard fashion, so the Nascar theme area is new (and sparsely attended) but the rooms, hotel area, and casino look like they haven't been renovated in about 25 years. There were none of the typical amenities in a newer hotel/motel like flat screen TV, coffee maker, or room safe.Beware of the annoying mandatory "resort" fee of $6/day. I object to this practice as it's a hidden surcharge you discover either when you've booked or started checking in and should be included in the room rate if it's mandatory. In any event, I didn't see any resort and I certainly wouldn't have paid a cent to use it. Maybe they'll start charging us a flushing fee next?The location is at the extreme north end of the strip and none of the Vegas sights are nearby. However, the monorail and "deuce" doubledecker bus are conveniently close. I didn't ride the monorail but it appears to get you to their limited stops a lot faster but at a higher price. The deuce is a modern doubledecker bus which runs between Downtown and the south end of the strip. A 24 hour ticket is also good for other bus lines if you wanted to go away from the strip. Some major places like LV Hilton, the convention center, and Hard Rock hotel are off the strip. Patience will be needed at busy times, however, as traffic and hicks who've never ridden a bus will slow progress to a fast walk.In conclusion, if you're looking for a cheap place to stow your stuff, take a nap, and attend to your hygiene while in Vegas, you might give it a try but it ain't the Venetian. 2
Nate did a great job.  On time, quick and thorough.  He got a 10 year old stain out!  This is the first time we used Orion, but won't be the last. 5
Food and atmosphere is one of a kind. It has such fun and excitement in air everytime. The owner Jon is the most funny, kind and gracious man you'll ever meet. I suggest you shake his hand he will remember you. He is the son of whitey himself. Get a burger and you step back in time. Been the same since late sixties. Great staff. Willy will always make you smile and Amanda can write the order of entire party of twenty down in her head. No paper. Love this place. Sit next to any number of cavs fans and players.  See you there. 5
The signature tea is fantastic! We had chicken and waffles as a special of the day and it was amazing! They make their own maple bacon butter which is to die for. Ask to meet the head chef shes a sweet heart 5
This is my go-to place for organic and pastured meats. Prices are better than Strawberry Fields, sometimes by an order of magnitude, the selection is usually wider and they are less likely to be sold out of the stuff I want. Produce is pretty nonexistent yes, they sell out of milk fast but if you're in need of sugar substitutes or hard to find herbs and spices they are awesome (check back in the back by the bulk foods).Also the lunch counter makes awesome sandwiches and very good Thai food (owner's husband is Thai and used to operate one of the best restaurants in Bloomington, I think it was). I like the noodle soups especially. 4
The service at this place is quite fast. The pizza itself was not good quality. I felt kind of intimated ordering the food as it was my first time there and the person taking my order just seemed impatient and judging. I felt a bit sick after having a slice of the pizza and decided not to have the rest. I won't be returning there. 2
Went here with my girl to get a nice greasy meal before going out and honestly... Both of us didn't finish our meal. The meat on the burger tasted unlike anything I've ever had... In the worst way. The fries were also really weird. Not sure if it is the oil they use to fry the food but it was definitely a no bueno! We both didn't like any of it. Left feeling uneasy and  UNsatisfied. Won't be back 2
Most of the food was average to good. The sea bass was the best item. It was so juicy!  The prime rib was good. The steak was kind of tough though. Pretty large selection of food. Most of the dessert was very good. They even have sugar free dessert that was much better than I thought. $40 for the dinner buffet was a little pricey I think.  The line to get into the restaurant was really long, but it seems most buffets on the strip also have long lines. 3
Good company. They did a great cleaning job. They weren't in a hurry to finish, so the house was sparkling when they left. 3
I never been one to get into the cupcake craze however a friend was pretty specific she wanted cupcakes for her birthday. I chose this place over others based on convenience - not Yelp reviews. It WAS the day before Valentines day and it was crowded, soothe fore the cupcakes would be as fresh as can be. The had a nice assortment, so I chose 6 ( including their signature) and others that appealed to me but also looked impressive many of their cupcakesjusthada swirl of frosting and some sparkle. Ehhhhh4 hours later we dug in. Each Of us sampling -one dry overly frosted cupcake that for the most part kind of all tasted alike. $3.50 a pop is a bit over rated in my opinion. I ordered 2 chocolate covered strawberries at 2.50 each and they weren't even the jumbo size but the tastiest treat. Overpriced, dry and under flavored cupcakes along with staff that was a bit overwhelmed and underwhelming.  I hear there are better out there and might try those next time instead. 3
Rock bottom prices and a huge variety of FRESH bulk foods and spices, as well as lots of beyond-the-norm condiments and healthy choice items, in a pristine and easily accessible shop ... the choir in my head went off a few minutes into my first visit. Just go, you will not be disappointed. 5
I am not a breakfast person but enjoyed this restaurant. Diner style experience. Very busy but well staffed and efficiently run. We were asked three times within a matter of a minute if someone had taken our drink order. Staff was knowledgeable and the owner was walking by when I placed my order and pointed out that they their potatoes are more like cottage fries than traditional hash browns when I ordered the hash browns. Friendly staff with great, fast service. A huge variety of omelets and other breakfast fare. I am interested in returning and trying lunch. My 11 year old wanted to go back the next day for breakfast once again. 5
Replaced the glass on my Galaxy S4.  Great Service, fast, professional.  Would recommend to anyone looking for cell phone repair.  Not an issue that there was only one person at the counter - if you compared the time and service to Walmart, there would have been 40 open lanes at Walmart with maybe 5 customers ready to check out.. 5
Love the live music and flamenco dancing... hate their idea of service.  We were part of a large group, 23 people.  When you are part of a group of this size, I give lots of credit to the restaurant staff and kitchen and cut them some slack.  BUT there was ONE service for the entire group.  The server agreed upon arrival he could do separate checks since everyone's bill was the same... almost everyone ordered the $25 tapas special.  Each person ate the same tapas, paid the same for them except of course they had different types of drinks.  I'm not an exaggerator, once the bills came, the server handed some out, collected some payment, 25 minutes later gave the rest of us our bills, ours was incorrect, had to fix it but no joke 90 minutes later we finally walked out. 11 pm. The saddest part was management didn't come around and assist their server, nor show any concern.  We were a large group that brought in a lot of revenue that evening, I wish we would have felt appreciated.  How many servers do you think should take care of a 23 person top? Or atleast have some server assistance and use more than on POSI machine to close us out. 2
Fantastic service and great ambiance. Our waiter was very attentive and friendly. Sadly the food is just.....ok. My fettuccine alfredo was very bland and my husband's lasagna wasn't much better. Our son liked his chicken fingers! 3
One of the worst Home Depot in the Toronto area. I dread going to this location, and only go here as my last choice. I went here today (June 5, 2017), only because the one I usually go to didn't have a working machine to resize the blinds. I entered the store, found exactly what I was looking for in less than 2 mins. When it came to get an associate to help me cut the blinds to the size I required, I couldn't find the proper associate. The few I did see wandering around said that its not their department and they can't help me. One associated did say that he will page Tamara, who can help me, to come to aisle # 8 to assist with my request. I did hear him make the page, but Tamara was nowhere to be found. I waited approximately 15 minutes and still no sign of Tamara. I asked an associate working in the paint section to page Tamara and he said he's not allowed and that I should speak to customer service. I go to the customer service desk and as associate, while helping another customer, asked me what I needed. I asked him to page someone to aisle # 8, and after listening to me he just completely ignored me and went back to helping the customer he was already with. I waited another 10 mins at the customer service desk, hoping the other two associated at the desk will acknowledge me...they didn't. After that I was furious, so I asked a lady associate at the desk, to page me the Manger on Duty. She said  that she is the manager on duty, so I told her that I've been waiting for someone name Tamara to help me for the past 20 minutes. She walked with me to aisle # 8 and Tamara was there helping another customer. When the Manager on Duty told Tamara to help me after she's done with her current customer, Tamara started complaining how she hasn't gone on her break. The Manager on Duty once again, this time more assertively instructed Tamara that she must help me after she's done with the current customer. Once Tamara was done with the current customer, Tamara did help me. But when it came time to cut the blinds to the required length, she past me on to another associate and left, presumably on her break.Overall, an extremely disappointing experience and I'm glad that I avoid this location as much as I can. I usually always go to the one on Duff/Steeles where you can find an associate willing to help you, advice you and spend sometime with you listening to your needs. 1
I went to Kazu about a month ago, I really liked the place except the waiting line. the service was good enough. I ate shrimp burger that was not bad as well as rib chops. the rib chops were so tasty but a bit fatty. over all it was a good experience. 3
They don't take reservations so be sure to get there earlier than the dinner crowd. Luckily I went on a Sunday instead of a Friday or Saturday, so it wasn't as crazy. They also only take cash, i.e no credit or debit until further notice. For a party of four, we ordered the following: (1) Singapore Laksa, (2) Green Curry Chicken, (3) Garlic Okra, (4) Mixed Beef and Chicken Satay Skewers (5) two orders of Roti and (6) a bowl of steam rice! For dessert, we ordered (7) Teh Tarik and (8) Banana Fritters with Vanilla Ice-cream. (1) The Singapore Laksa noodles were soft, which is the way I prefer it. Their level is spicy is not too bad - you could probably survive without chugging down your water for this one! I enjoyed having the tofu, the fish slices, and other assorted foods in this one. I'd ordered this again, though if anyone has been to Gourmet Malaysia near Brimley and Sheppard in Scarborough, I'd recommend their Laksa over Restoran Malaysia's. (2) The Green Curry Chicken is a must-order whenever I visit. The green curry is spicy - so be sure to have some water ready. Still, I find it heart warming and absolutely love eating this with rice. The chicken itself is however a bit dry. If i had the option to order Green Curry with veggies, it would be my go to.(3) The Garlic Okra was scrumptious and fun to eat. The slice it up so for those who have some difficulties eating okra uncut, Restoran Malaysia makes lives easier! There was a good amount of garlic so it added flavour. While i thought it could have been less salty, my other party members thought it was just right. This bowl of Garlic Okra was gone the fastest, and it makes a great neutral veggie dish among other spicy orders. I'd order this again. (4) Mixed Beef and Chicken Satay skewers came with three beef and three chicken, along with some sliced cucumbers and a peanut-sesame sauce. Although I'm not exactly sure of all the ingredients that went into the sauce, it gave off a sweet, sticky, and sesame taste that complemented the meats well. The meats were well seasoned and not over cooked. They were easy to eat, and easy to share. (5) Another order that was easy to share would be the roti. It was soft, and went well with dipping into the Green Curry and even the Laksa for me. While I enjoyed it being soft, a party guest of mine thought the roti could have been crispier. (6) And lastly, rice may be rice, but Restoran Malaysia gives a generous portion for one bowl. It tasted like it was freshly steamed rice without over drying, and also went well with the curry! (7) Their (hot) Teh Tarik was not overwhelmingly sweet and probably "just right". It was nice to balance out the salty and spicy flavours with something sweet. (8) The Banana Fritters with Ice-cream took longer than I expected but perhaps they were getting busy around 7:30 pm. The banana fritters were not too doughy, and maintained their warm temperature. It certainly went well with the vanilla ice-cream. Their service was wonderful. I didn't have any issues and the waiters/servers (we had more than one?) came by frequently to check up on us. I would certainly come again the next time I'm craving Singapore Laksas and Green curry, without wanting to drive all the way to Scarborough! 3
Had take out and was unimpressed. Karahi gohst was bland and tasteless. Chicken tikka was better but not great. Naan was fresh and well made. 2
I was taking a solo trip to vegas and was looking to check out some shows. I'm not the hugest Britney Spears fan,but it was the only show that I was interested in. I knew that it was going to by lip synced but thought what the hey. Drinks were far over priced. $24 for one in a Britney cup. But that's not a reflection of the show, just a mention. Now for the show itself. She was amazing! It was everything a vegas show should be. After all the dancing I see why she doesn't "sing". It was super high energy. It had me dancing in the stands. If you're a fan of course you'll love it. But even if you some what like her, I think you'd enjoy it just as much. I did! 4
Desperately in need of more seating! But I do appreciate the park being separate between large and small dogs. Services like water/restrooms are nearby but I'd say bring your own bottle for sure 3
The food here is very decent. My favorite here is the lo mein, it's so tasty. Even better than panda expresses IMO. Although the service here is crappy and the servers are sometimes rude I'll still order pickup for some fast yummy Chinese food. 3
Seriously!?A friend and I stopped by to get a couple drinks and I think they forgot the Crown... Its def a dive bar, which isn't a bad thing, I liked the atmosphere. I saw most everyone was having a beer, and now I know why! Cough syrup would get you more tipsy then the drinks they poured for us. Honestly worst crown n coke of my life. Sorry, placed seemed nice but I will not be going back. 1
I used to go to LA Fitness in Pottstown.  The one trainer, I think his name was Albert, was always "hitting on my friend".  I heard he got transferred.  The other trainers we had were okay, but I really didn't get the results I wanted.The pool was often cold, too.  Oh well, I don't do gyms anymore! 2
Our first and not likely to come back for awhile.  Empty tables all over but still had to wait for text. When asked why the wait was told they just opened and they wanted to make sure the kitchen could keep up. Is this thier first resturant ? We got to seats at the bar and ordered.  I had three very small tacos - not much flavor. Husband got the carne asads burro he liked it.  Chips were mixed some stale some fresher (yesterdays) and the salsa was way to mild with little flavor. WIll stick to tried and true Euro Cafe when we want to head to downtown Gilbert. 2
The jerk chicken is very very salty. Prepare to drink lots of water! We went to eat here because the jerk chicken's reviews were great but do not be deceived. However, the mango juice was better than average. 2
One of the better chines options on campus. I like their beef with broccoli and chow fun. When I feel sick or stressed, an order of chow fun and wonton soup is my feel-better food. One thing I don't like but completely understand is that they give people different menus based on if you speak chinese or not. 4
Love the beer, but the food... not so much.  To be fair, I have only been there once and was the only one eating.  Fries were pretty good, but the po boy sandwich was really not good.Great place for really good Capital beer and probably some snacks.  Wouldn't recommend it for a full meal. 3
I hate to make a negative comment since I am a weekly regular, I come into this Rubio's nearly every Tuesday and then some. I generally enjoy the fish taco but since it was Monday I thought I would simply get a bean and cheese burrito. That was not a good decision.....One of the worst I have ever, had. I could not eat a lot of it. First it was just a little above room temp, the cheese was a little cooler, not melted or even warm at all. The temperature was not what made the burrito fall below the rating of "not good" or worse even earn the rank of really bad, it was the moisture that somehow escaped from within to make the outside wet and soggy.....I'm sorry Rubio's to have to make this post because I like this place....I'm sure or at least hope this is only an anomaly and not a sign of things to come. 3
Location, Location, Location. Food and drinks are pricey for what they are, I'm not one to complain about the price of food or drinks, but they were nothing I'd brag about. The view is what did it for me, seeing all of Charlotte while dining is a nice treat. The elevator is a bit confusing if it's your first time, but it's an issue that's easily overcome. The service wasn't too impressive, but overall not horrible. I wouldn't go there on the regular, but it's fun to bring people new to Charlotte or just visiting. 3
I have been a regular here for several years, and in the last 6-8 months this location has gone to 'hell in a handbasket'!  Three times in a row it took over 15 minutes before anyone came to our table.  Then my sons pizza was caked with flour,  it was SO horrible!  I really hope they get it together - I'm really close to being done with them, it's sad - used to love this spot!  My daughter goes to dance across the street.I appreciate your response, BUT that is exactly what you said the first time I posted a not great review and nothing changed - seriously?!?!? 1
Ok, I live in Peters, so I want local businesses to succeed, but frankly I want good businesses to succeed regardless of locale.  Good food, I was short on time and had empanadas.  Very tasty, good balance, well balanced filling and crust, nice sauce, served well, ...  The rest of the menu grabbed my attention as well.  Good beer selection, more than I expected on tap.  But the food was pricey.  I wanted to try the mole, always in search of good mole, but time and price got in the way. I'll be back, let's see if they adjust anything. 3
Love this place.  My favorite is the brisket but we always get a variety of meats and sides.  Also the butcher shop is great. I love to go during the holidays, the lines are long and the place is packed to the gills but it is now my holiday tradition.  The best place to get a whole skin on pork belly!!! 5
This place is one of my favorite places to go to in Chandler. El sol cafe reminds me of cheers where everyone knows your name (lol) literally...making you feel apart of the community. The staff are always friendly. The food is consistently fresh and delicious. Anything you order will definitely meet your needs. 5
It is good American Chinese food. Very friendly people and a good price. 3
It is in the same building as the Great Wall Buffet was. We went to Great Wall ONCE, and swore to never go again.After they re-opened under the new name we decided to give them another shot, and it was very good on that day (about 2 months ago). Yesterday we decided to go back, and here is the result: 1- Every symptom of a declining buffet. Barely warm meet and sides, sad looking salad bar, freezer burnt ice cream, bland food with tons of salt to compensate, the fish tasted like paper mush.2- the service was good, our waitress was very attentive3- priced at 13.99 a person, which is fine for a generic buffet. Unfortunately our 2nd experience was so bad that i wouldn't go there even for free 1
Was excited to try a really good burger, but was sadly dissappointed! There were only around 6 customers and it took for ever to take our order, for the burgers to be served and to give us our check. The slowest service I have ever experienced, anywhere. The burgers had absolutely no flavor whatsoever! The buns were dry. We all ordered our burgers medium well, but only one was actually medium well, the others well done. They were the worst burgers I have ever tasted. Would rather have had a Five Guys, or an In and Out! 1
Restaurant atmosphere and setting was romantic.Had the a la carte and summerlicious menu and we were not impressed. The cod fish fritters for $21 was simply outrageously bad! Batter was falling apart and didn't taste or feel the 'cod' in the portion. The bastado lamb pasta with fennel was also uneventful - pasta was cooked well but I didn't really understand the composition of this dish. Overall I didn't feel the Tuscany at Tutti Matti. 2
Probably gives Brazilian steak a bad name and should apologies. Went there for the 2for1 Rodizio sounds like a decent thing to do. Took about 40 Min to be seated with reservations, once seated we were asked still or sparkling - thinking there would be a charge for sparkles we ordered Still wooops 2 bucks a head for water, what is this Brazil! The meat when sliced looked nice and juicy, only to be disappointed with tough finger spraining work especially since they don't use quality steak knives :( The taste is like eating a burnt salt cube Yummm.. However, i still managed to eat probably 2  Lbs and drink about 10 L of water so maybe 2$ for water isnt to bad :OThe salad bar is decent nothing to crazy The Good: My wife loved the cheese bread i think she ate more of that then meat lolz Service once seated and forgetful about mentioning a water charge, which we forgave due to the great service we did receive. All you can eat Meat SaltThe best work out you can get - like sawing a rock with a spoon Conclusion:If your in for a expensive fix of meat hit one of the many awesome steak houses our fine city has - heck there is at least three two in a 4 block radius and skip this disappointment. 2
You will not find a more knowledgable, friendly, and professional guy than Chris! He's amazing! He came to my home and had my computer fixed in under an hour.  He guarantees his work, and even emailed a few days later to make sure everything was running smoothly.  As someone who knows very little about computers, I'm so glad to know that I can call Chris with any issues, and he'll be happy to help! Highly recommended! 5
I was a regular here a while ago...Their food is close to perfect, not too spicy and everything is vegetarianYUMMy fav is the mutter paneer with plain naan along side a glass of mango lassihowever, service here is not my favi really have a problem when men waiters in particular are always nice to my (now)-ex because they think he's always paying (so they suck up to him -if that's the right wording) and most of the time ignore me, yet when they find out i'm paying, all of a sudden they treat me ever-so-kindly*rolls eyes*eventually, i stopped going as much as I used to because I got annoyed when that happened..I'm probably going to go there on the weekend w/my friend and HOPEFULLY service improved...I'll be sure to give another update***NOTE: AFTER 6pm (i believe), is when they bring out the mouth watering TANDOORI MENU and the portions are pretty big and fillingand remember, they serve the special weekend & holiday lunch buffet between 12pm-3pmand the smaller weekend buffet from 10am-12noonand the weekday buffet from 11:30am-3pm. 4
Came here with my kiddos while my husband was shopping in Harbor Freight and I have to say I was surprised my how delicious their simple grilled cheese was. The burgers are great too... I love this place. 5
I have been here three times and have had a great experience every time. The service is always very friendly. I've tried the pork chop with the sweet potatoes (mmmm) and the scallop special was amazing. Sit outside if weather permits. 4
Came in with a family of 6, including one newborn, one 2 year old, two teenage girls, and us. They initially tried to sit us at a table for 4. We took one look and knew 6 of us wouldn't fit and asked for a slightly bigger table. They put us at a table for 6 in an unoccupied corner of the restaurant. After 15 minutes of eating peanuts and not getting a waiter, or water, or anything for that matter, we walked out. We've been here before with okay service. Don't think we will be back anytime soon though. 1
Amazing experience. Had taken my 3 daughters to another pediatric dentist which turned into a traumatic experience. Was referred to East Valley pediatric dentistry and couldn't be happier. Dr Johnson was patient, kind and took the time to answer questions. I definitely recommend. 5
Downgraded to four stars, because they messed with my favorite burger and turned the mushroom swiss into a truffle burger of some kind.  If you like the more pungent, earthly taste of truffles, then maybe this burger is for you.  I do not.  So, while I still like the other menu choices, the old mushroom swiss flavor was my favorite...not any more. 4
My husband and I went to Granite City on a whim after we hit the Dick's shop in Legacy Village on the same trip. After a quick look at their menu, we decided to pop in for an early dinner.Granite City is a great place to go for a meal, for sure! My husband had the peppercorn burger and I had their vodka mussels. For our starter, we had the red pepper hummus, which was delicious. All-in-all, their food was great. Their vodka sauce is amazing and paired with the toast that came with the mussels - a definite must order.Their craft beers are also quite tasty. I had the Batch 1000 and was impressed. Just the right amount of hoppiness to it.I would definitely visit this place again. 4
Good food, good price.  The cafeteria-style dining room is fun, but it can get quite loud! 3
In a half-hour visit, I learned about various kinds of teas from round the world, tasted the tea of the day and smelled a dozen more. Chose Caramel Rooibos, Marketspice Rooibos, Organic Cherry Rose Green Tea and a catalogue to go. I'm longing for a clear glass teapot and a selection of tea buds that will release Jasmine flowers. You can arrange for delivery. In fact, you can enjoy their tea by subscription - sample monthly selections by theme or by country. And of course, they carry a nice assortment of tea ware: pots and mugs, tea socks, tea balls, strainers, trays and tongs.sample catalogue listing:Prairie Garden: A stunning blend of green and white tea with rosebuds, flowers and the fresh flavour of rhubarb - evocative of a gentle spring rain. 4
Enchanted Florist did my December 8, 2013 wedding and I cannot say enough amazing things about not only the people working there, but the flowers, centerpieces, my bouquet and everything else included were stunning! They were amazing to work with, worked with my budget and I truly felt like I had the highest quality flowers! They truly saw the vision I wanted for my wedding and we're always available to help with any questions I had! I worked mostly with Kathryn for my payments/money stuff (amazing, always got back to me super fast) and Moe who did the setup/delivery of the flowers (so sweet and cool, felt like we had been friends forever) would highly recommend them for anything needing flowers in the Vegas area! 5
Luxury Suites at signature  was ok hotel. The room was not very clean and the fact that there is no self parking in the hotel is a little annoying. Each time you want the car you need wait for the valet to bring it upfront. Other than that the location is good, an underground path way to MGM,  staff was frienly,  room was big and comfortable, I have no complains. 3
I found this yoga studio through a deal site and fell in love in my first two visits. The studio is small, but provides a great community of yogis. The instructors are awesome, providing guidance throughout the class and correcting postures or  encouraging us to take our practice deeper when they see the opportunity. Both Jillian and Megan have been able to guide me into postures that I've always struggled with and had a lot of self doubt. In a single session they each were able to provide the right instruction for me to feel comfortable and find success in those new postures. 5
I love this place, every time I come I feel right at home getting pampered. The staff is very professional and friendly. They do a fantastic job.   They are always willing to do what ever crazy idea I come up with. I highly recommend it. 5
I normally don't care for the atmosphere of a place- unless of course it's really really bad.But this location is nice, well kept and is peaceful- perfect to go with friends or by yourself if you want something cheap and awesomely tasty! The menu is quite variegated and quite cheap for the portions you get. Be warned- they can be large.My favourite is the rice and curry chicken- for about $5 you get a tasty dinner-size meal and it's delicious! They also have the usual assortment of beef and pork varieties- nothing unusual or quirky- just great service at an even better price.The owners are usually there to greet you and they make the food too. They're very friendly, very well mannered and for some reason even the teeny-boppers who end up there act behaved as well.I'd highly recommend this place to anyone who wants a quick cheap and great tasting meal. Head down there, you won't be disappointed! 4
Love the menu here and the food is fresh and tasty, and the prices reasonable. We eat her at least twice a month.  The reason for only 3 stars is that the staff give priority to orders and we sit in the restaurant mostly ignored and have to demand service  and watch as many people walk out after 8-10 minutes of being ignored especially if seated at the front away from the preparation bar. Their Sake is great but getting water is like pulling teeth so we bring our own.  There seems to be no management on site and if there is, she/ he is well hidden hence the poor service for in house eating. 3
I really wanted to give Luxe more than 3 stars, but for me, it's not just there yet.  We called ahead of time trying to get reservations for 4, but were told that they only did reservations for groups of 6 or more.  Fair enough.  We showed up and were seated at some bar stools and promptly asked for drink orders while we waited for our table.  Right away, I liked the atmosphere and the relatively quiet and laid-back vibe going on.  When the hostess finally did come get us for the table, she informed us that we'd have to be out of there by 8 so they can seat one of their reservations.  It was 6:50 at this point.  We weren't really planning to stay all evening long, and I have no doubt that front of house folks in many restaurants have to perform a little mental jiu jitsu to make sure they have tables for everyone, but dang, keep it to yourself, ok?  We sat down feeling like we had to race to make decision or else risk getting swept off the stage by some clown in the corner.  And then in came one of the best waiters I've ever had, a dude named Benjamin.  Any apprehension we might've felt melted away.  Our table split a couple plates, first of which was the goat cheese fondue.  I enjoy goat cheese, but wasn't sure how a fondue of it would turn out, but it was great.  Not too rich like I imagined it would be.  One of us got a margherita pizza, which was the highlight of the food selections.  Somehow the crust had the flavor of a Chicago deep dish pizza while being only slightly thicker than a cracker.  Nice!  Unfortunately, the calamari was soggy like it had been sitting in the window too long, and the mussels were 'meh' at best.  Almost ordered the fries with truffle mayo, but another guy in the party got a burger with fries and I was able to try his.  They were thick-cut steak fries that also tasted soggy like they had been made quite a while earlier.  If we had had an indifferent waiter, I don't think I'd consider hoofing it over to Detroit Ave. again for dinner, but this guy was great and convinced me to give Luxe another chance.  I've never had the waitstaff shake my hand at the end of the dinner, and I found it oddly satisfying.  Looking forward to adding a star or two to this review on my next trip! 3
i just want to say that since i moved away from scottsdale I literally daydream about the food at this place. i am OBCESSED with their housemade veggie burger and pretzel bun and my better half loves a lot of their meatier dishes~We do miss the RIBS you guys used to have when we are in town.We love that they have one of the best local beers, Orange Blossom from Papago Brewing.You literally can not go wrong at this place...they will have whatever you want and it will be delicious! 5
I do not like pickles, but Penguin's fried pickles with Ranch are amazing! As with any good restaurant there will probably be a line, but it is definitely worth the wait! 4
The best I love how they change up the Exhibits very neat and they have amazing artists that sometimes come to.  Very organized and super clean gee's also the Staff are superb very friendly I'd say!! I would recommend coming here you learn a lot different cultures to through out the art!!! there is nothing to complain about what so ever.  5 stars it deserves!!!!! I'l be back for sure 5
The team at Retina Associates save my eyesight by properly diagnosing and treating a torn retina within 24 hours of discovery.  Drs. Miller and Novak were particularly competent and did an outstanding job of diagnosing, performing surgery and following up.  They also kept my regular ophthalmologist informed of my progress and coordinated care to minimize duplication.  The convenience of the Mentor, OH location made my experience all the better. 5
I went to Arauna without knowing much about him. I relied on the Yelp reviews and the pictures of his work. I am so glad I did. This guy is not only talented but he's cleaner than most hospitals. OSHA would give Arauna an A+. He does ask a lot of question so that he can get to know you. He is creative and actually fixed some previous work I had done and wasn't quite happy with it. His prices are reasonable and it's not about the money with him. He would just as soon politely ask you to leave rather than do something that would compromise his beliefs!!! I am returning for more work. My wife is definitely not a Tatau (Tatoo) fan but she was totally impressed when she saw his work. Talk with him, let him get to know you and you might think you know what you want but at least look at his free hand suggestions. He has no problem doing exactly what you came to have done but you just might want to see and hear what he has to say. What a stress free clean and friendlyenvironment. Oh yeah, and the music he plays is SMOKIN!!!! Thanks my friend and be well until I return...to wish you well again! 5
Beside the hostess having the personality of a rock, the service to follow wasn't to impressive either.The food was great from everyone at the table point of view from it being quiet the whole time until we couldn't eat no more.The drinks were good, no crafted beers were partaken at our table.Maybe they were having an off night..... 2
I started my meal with the tostones and a beef empanada.  They were by far my favorite part of the meal, especially the empanada.  The dough was nice and moist, a little flaky which I liked.  The filling was savory and perfectly seasoned. I highly recommend it.  For the main course I had the fried pork with mofongo.  The mofongo was good but a little lukewarm.  I'm not sure it was fresh.  The fried pork was greasy and very dry, it was definitely fried too long.  The meat was tough.  Overall the meal was good but too greasy and meat was disappointing. 3
Great food, fast and friendly service! Very affordable too. I had the potato pancakes stuffed with bacon and cheese and I side of biscuits and gravy. Very good!! 4
Excellent Neighborhood ShitHole ! Consistently inconsistent, seldom open and catering to EVERY demographic in the PHX. Can't wait to pass on this place for years to come ! Owner must be proud. Cheers & good luck 2
We recently purchased a vehicle from Geoff Williams. He was professional, knowledgeable and extremely helpful. I appreciated his willingness to let us think about our purchase. We had been to other dealers who pressured us to buy immediately. We are very happy with our vehicle and with our salesperson.  If you are looking for a new or used car, call Geoff.  We highly recommend him and Chapman. 5
I was recently in AZ with my girlfriend on vacation and was telling her about this place, because I came here one other time a couple of years ago.  I told her that it is a must that we stop and get a massage, especially since we were gonna be doing a lot of hiking and driving.  The staff is very polite and the business is very clean and professional looking.  I've gotten the hour and a half massage both times and the only complaint I have is that the time goes by too fast! 5
Wanted something different  and I got it  not your everyday run of the mill burrito I ordered the double meat  pork verde burrito and it was spiced right and I didn't want to stop eating it! Full of flavor and a little sweat to go with it. I ordered rice and beans and the rice was interesting it had carrots in it.The refried beans were not runny and had a good flavorMake a run to this boarder! 4
Dr. Paik and Jen where so kind. Location is so convenient and office is beautiful and clean. Was so pleased I chose them for me and my kids Dentistry needs. 5
Not quite what I expected. Was expecting some authentic food, but even their speciality fried chicken was not the best. However, we did enjoy the live DJ/Entertainment. Overall it was a So-so experience. 3
I should have read the reviews!.... Food terrible; I ordered the burger sliders, and after 45 minutes I received them cold and hard, my husband ordered a bacon burgers and received a dry cold regular burger. Service; the worse here in Las Vegas- we waited for an hour because they told us the kitchen was backed up. After we were seated we waited another 45 to receive our food. Our waiter came twice in the 2 hours we were there. I needed some ranch and when I asked the server he told me to ask my waiter... I don't get why he couldn't just give it to Me. I'll never come back. I recommend u take your money somewhere else where u'll get good serivice 1
Update. After that outlandish experience a few weeks ago I'm happy to say every trip back has been a huge improvement. Doors have been open and for the most part everyone's been welcoming 3
4 Stars for the colourful atmosphere, friendly staff, comfortable and fun seating, and freestyle Coke machines. 3.5 Stars for the quality of the food. Four of us shared the "Familia" meal, and it was the perfect amount of food. The whole chicken was great-juicy and flavourful. The chicken skewers were mediocre- too dry. Ordering is done cafeteria style, so it was nice to just get up and go when we were done our meal. It's an overall fun experience with good food. I would definitely recommend Nando's. 4
This location use to have great customer service when it first opened, but I'm sad to say the honeymoon is over. The last few times my husband and I have been here we have had horrible customer service and our orders have been wrong. Just yesterday (2/18/15), i stopped in to get something to eat and a coffee, not a complicated order of a bagel and cream cheese, a medium coffee with just non fat milk and a doughnut. As I was walking out the door I took a sip of my coffee and discovered it was full of some type of artificial sweetener and heavy creamer. I went back up to the counter and asked the girl working if I could please have  a coffee with no sweetener and non fat milk. She said that I had already drank from the cup so I would have to pay for another one. I showed her my receipt that clearly said non fat milk, she just shook her head and said sorry I didn't make the coffee I don't know what happened and then she wanted to know if I wanted to buy another cup. I was so irritated and it wasn't worth the headache over a cup of coffee. My aggravation only grew more intense when I reached in the bag after I got home to enjoy my doughnut and found she had put it in the bag frosting side down!! i was later complaining to my husband about how this location has gone down hill lately and he said that he too had stopped to get a coffee and a bite to eat and had received the same horrible service earlierthat same morning. I hate to say it but today we both went to a nearby Starbucks and had amazing customer service and our orders were correct!!!! It's too bad because we both actually prefer Dunkin Doughnuts coffee but it's just not worth the rude and incompetent staff. 1
Phenomenal , he goes above and beyond. I went in to get my hard drive for my MacBook replaced and was given the most reasonable price by Calvin. He got it fixed much quicker than anticipated and even took care of a few other issues. Would definitely go again and recommend him to anyone. 5
Unorganized mess. Don't believe the hype. My friends burrito had literally three small pieces of pork and my salad bowl was basic and flavorless. It wasn't cheap either. Oh and i finished my meal before my friend even got his meal which is mainly the reason for the first word of this review. 1
I'm not quite sure how this restaurant has such high reviews. Maybe my friends and I went there on a bad day. The food was average, service was ok... But then we all discovered BUGS and HAIR in our food. Not just like small little bugs... But bits and pieces of beetles. Yes, that's right. Beetles. We about threw up (and we are all RNs so you know it takes a lot to make us feel sick). When we brought it to the attention of the manager, she told us that what we thought were bugs were actually spices they use in the soup. she brought out a container of the spice and it didn't look anything like the bugs. To give you more detail, in one bowl of pho, we found the head and the body (separated from each other) of a beetle. Youcant mistake that for a spice. As long as you have eyes you can tell the difference. Anyway, we won't be back. If you decide to take a risk and eat there I would just look at each bite very carefully before you eat it. 1
Harker is my choice for servicing and replacing equipment because the technicians have been competent and friendly.  With their fair pricing,  I recommend to friends. 4
So I'm writing this In real time while having lunch here for the first time. Some neighbors recommended it and if you've ever been to Waunakee you know that pickings are slim when it comes to restaurants. So you walk in and are greeted to a very clean and friendly Mexican style restaurant. I was seated immediately and had chips and salsa all within about a minute. The chips are warm and the salsa cold and fresh. You can see and taste the fresh cilantro. The server comes over and asks me what I would like to drink and hands me a fairly large menu, he then points out the lunch menu on the back saving me from studying the menu. A couple minutes later my sprite arrives, again in a very nice clean glass. Soda to syrup mix is good. I decide to have the lunch steak fajitas as I continue to much down the chips... Lunch comes pretty quick I've taken a pic of the plate... Everything was the right temp and the food was flavorful. The rice was firm, the refried beans are made with a nice consistency. The veggies and meat had a nice char and spice. All in all a good meal, now the real test will come when I bring the wife and kids! 3
We stopped in here on Canada day because OMI, down the street was closed.We had wanted to try this place since it opened and were lured inside by their fish taco's on the display menu.We sat outside to their lovely patio.We indeed ordered the Fish Taco's, pulled pork taco's AND the calamari salad because we were hungry.The food was okay - but unfortunately there wasn't a lot of it - so we also left hungry and ended up at the Loblaws sushi counter to satisfy our initial craving and persistent hunger.The portions are really small for what you pay. I expect more than one grilled calamari tube and a small heap of 'greens' when a salad is 15$ The fish taco's had the equivalent of one thumb size portion of fish. The Pulled pork taco's we slightly more generous.Again the food was palatable, but not so amazing as to justify the portions vs. value.Have a beer on their patio, but if you are hungry, and you don't want to go broke satiating your hunger, this might not be the place for you based on what we ordered. 3
I wish I could give less than one star. The "lady" at the front desk was about as poor as you can get as far as customer service is concerned. She was incredibly nasty towards me, and that's terrible considering I could have chosen another tow yard to have my car brought to when I got into my accident. They won't let you take photos or retrieve things from your car without tons of documentation, and even after I personally provided such documentation (I think her name was "Jo") was consistently rude and wouldn't let me out into the yard for about 40 minutes, but she seemed to have plenty of time to converse with her male coworkers. She seems miserable, maybe a man would help her improve her attitude. Not the face I'd want for my company. 1
We stopped in because we were told Los Dos Molinos had good food. I am so disappointed in this restaurant. When we first walked in we thought it looked cute, then we began noticing things like the dirty tables and floors that were not being cleared. We were sat at a poorly cleaned table and given sticky menus. They dropped water and chips at our table quickly and then we didnt see our server for several long minutes. The bar was a sore site to look at. Even from a raised chair I couldn't see what alcohol they had. I wasn't enticed to buy anything. The bar counter itself looked extremely dirty as well. I would not have eaten there. The host acted as the bar tender and it was clear he was not trained as a bar tender. He was placing his hands and fingers in dishes and mixes where they should not have been. Their margaritas looked so weak that you could see straight through them. Most drinks were served out of a machine instead of being mixed by a bar tender. The ceiling had wires sticking out of it and there were fridges with open sides that looked gross. Nothing was lit in the bar. It was the last thing anyone would focus on in the restaurant. The cook ran our food to us, and it was apparent that it had been sitting for a while. The plate was extremely hot and the cheese was melted and burned so bad I had to use a steak knife to cut it. I ordered two beef tacos and my date ordered a guacamole tostada with sour cream on the side. My beef tacos were the most tasteless thing I've eaten in a while. I'm not sure how you can make beef so bland and tasteless. The guacamole tostada came with extra guacamole instead of sour cream. It looked like a plate of guacamole with a few beans visible on the side. My date wanted the sour cream she ordered and some lemons, but never even had the chance to request them as we were not checked on a single time after we got our food. Our waters and soda were never refilled, and no service was actually provided. Once we were done we waited just under 20 minutes to be able to pay our bill. We made it blatantly clear we were ready to go and nothing, no one checked on us. Their flan sounded good but I didn't want to wait an hour for an order. When we were finally able to pay, the server, previously absent until now, stood at our table with an iPad we had to pay on until we paid. We were not able to comfortably talk about paying the bill or tipping. The server was nowhere to be found when we needed service, however he wouldn't leave us once they wanted money. We left disappointed and aggravated that our date night was off to a sour start. As someone with extensive experience in the food and service industry this restaurant is pitiful and embarrassing. 1
Very cool restaurant. In the same location as culinary dropout.  traditional mexican food but infused high quality. Afforable but not cheap. Great for a date style or small group. 4
The food is alright. I was super excited to try this place, but it's not very comfortable and the food is expensive for what it is, but I do like that it has vegan options 3
Going through town I thought before I headed out on the road again in my RV that I should just make sure the air pressure was OK. The guys working there are not the sharpest tool in the shed. I thought they might be off a few pounds but he was adding more and so I asked what he was doing and he was trying to put 65 pounds into a 50 pound max tires. He said he must have read something on the tire that looked like it meant the pressure. I'm soooo glad I asked as in the heat in a remote place to have my tires blow out.Then I asked this other guy how to get to a particular highway and he started asking where I was going, commenting on my RV, why I used a map if I had a GPS and literally 10 minutes later gave me a roundabout answer to how to get there without going back into the downtown area.Run, run as fast as you can away from this place.  They might sell you something wrong or more than you need. Trust your car with someone else that actually knows about cars, especially if you are a woman. Safe to say any other place would know more about tires than Discount Tires in Mesa. 1
We go here a lot. The only reason for not giving 5 stars is that i feel there is always room for improvement. There are many Italian restaurants in the area but this is by far the best.  I have had many dishes and they have all been very good. My kids even like the cheese ravioli. Cute small location 4
Dr. Leuthner and Staff at Petcare Animal Hospital are wonderful! We have been taking our older kitty to them for over a year now. Our kitty has chronic medical needs and Dr. Leuthner has taken great care of him - helping us manage his symptoms at home & in the clinic when needed. He is very knowledgable & explains all treatment options available. The staff there are all incredibly helpful & friendly - always so accommodating! 5
The restaurant is quite small and seating is limited. We were there on a  Saturday evening and we had no problem being seated immediately.I'm assuming our waiter was new. If he wasn't he should consider a new occupation. Aside from giving us the wrong bill, we were never offered a 2nd cup of coffee, had to wait forever for the meal, for the the bill, then the correct bill, the change from the bill and of course he never asked how everything was. Now that we've gone through the negative stuff let me say the food was really quite good. I ordered chicken marsala. It came with a side of spaghetti and I should say the sauce was really quite good along with the rest of the meal. My partner ordered a vegetable and pasta dish which was also very good. Needless to say we always do the taste test on each others meal.I would recommend the restaurant. The food was excellent. The prIce was reasonable, the portions were more then adequate and I'm sure that by now our waiter is either working somewhere else or he knows what to do. 4
This was my first try at finding good Asian near me, unfortunately it was not a success.  The beef lo mein was incredibly slimy, maybe too much corn starch?  I also ordered beef pho but it was very bland. 2
Rating a one because there is no place for a zero. My 2001 Mercedes C240 was taken to Progressive Collision center for processing. The car was sent to Road Runner Collision Center for repair. When the car was returned to Progressive and I went to pick up I could not believe the shoddy repair work. The interior trim panels that had been removed were not put back in place, there was a gap of approx. one quarter inch between the windshield and the seal that let both wind and water in, the dome lights were no longer working and there were nicks on the trunk that were not there when car was delivered to Progressive. Car was sent back to Road Runner and when it came back the second time there is a bubble in rubber window seal that was not there prior to repairs. I took possession of car because we needed it. A couple days later I noted the decals on the rear of deck lid  were CLK 240 instead of C240. That fix has still not been accomplished. I have advised Progressive to get someone else to fix it as there is obviously no quality control or pride in work done by Road Runner. I have been thru Progressive Collision and always had top notch service and never a problem with repair. My advise, if you have an accident and take your vehicle to a collision repair center ask who is doing the repairs and if it is Road Runner ask for another provider. I note other reviews are positive but I can only go on my experience. 1
Big fan of Caribbean food. Normally eat at Spence's Bakery, Raps, Mitzies and Mr. Jerk. Thought I would give this place a try. Service is great and the restaurant is relatively clean. Prices are standard, about $10 for large dinners. Ordered jerk chicken and pork. I must admit, the food smelt and looked great.  The food is flavorful and spicey but I found it lacked the substance or complexity of flavors that I have grown accustomed to. Very salty, which I think masked the other flavors/ingredients. Perhaps I have become spoiled by the places I normally frequent but it also lacked the smoked taste in the meat that I am used to. Jerk chicken is absolutely amazing when smoked in a drum for a long time. Those that don't do this must have an amazing recipe to offset the loss of smoked flavor. If you have a palate for salty food this place is worth a shot. I would still rate it better than 60% of the Caribbean restaurants out there. 3
The dough issue isn't fixed IMO.  Donuts should melt in your mouth.  These lack that indulgent finish, and just putting some fancy toppings on them isn't enough. I didn't finish either donut (strawberry cheesecake, Samoa) because they were that disappointing.  Two stars for a solid strawberry filling and the iced Americano. 2
Meh. Tricolored chips? Really? Salsa? No taste except for spiciness. The $10 for the "Hand squeezed margarita" was money poorly spent for what was clearly a margarita made with a mix. The menu is sparse, with not too much of a selection and a la carte items starting at $7. The servers are clearly instructed to up sell, but we did appreciate the attention. The food came, and it was incredibly bland except for the one note punch of heat and the blanket of cheese on top. Two stars for the service, the tortilla and the portions, which are hearty. Overall, not worth the $42 for two people plus tip. Never again. 2
Went in 2 1/2 weeks ago to get an acrylic overlay. I had never had arcylics before so I didn't know what to expect. The dad did my service in less time than it took for my friend to get a basic mani (probably because he knew that I had no experience having fake nails before and didn't know the process). My nails started chipping the very next day. I didn't think acrylic was supposed to chip! They redid my nails for me at no charge, but the dad sped through the service again (the mom there shaped and polished my nails which was done okay). My nails turned out nicer than the first time but still looked a bit messy along my cuticle and the acrylic started peeling up on my nails after a few days. Yesterday, 2 weeks later, I went to another salon for an acrylic fill and the woman doing my service was a perfectionist and spend lots of time making my nails just right! I was shocked by the difference in service quality and 1 day later my nails still look good (surprise, surprise)!I would go back to Marvel, but I would be sure to have a different service provider. Over the phone Tiffany helped answer my questions and book my appts, she seems very helpful and knowledgeable, so I would be willing to try her out. 2
3.5/5Artisan Noodle is a very small restaurant located south of Yonge and Finch that can probably sit around 15 people. It is usually packed, so try to come on the off hours if you want to avoid the wait. The Bang Bang Mian was very good. It had a great range of flavours and the texture of the noodles was great. Definitely reminded me of some of the dishes I had when I was in Xi'an a few years ago. I found the Pork Jia-Mo was far too oily - the bun was soggy on the bottom because it was swimming in its own oil. Though it's a relatively cheap dish, so I suppose I can't complain too much about it. The Zha Jiang Mian wasn't as good as the Bang Bang Mian. I found it could have been a bit punchier with flavour. I would come back to Artisan Noodle, but definitely on off hours. Not sure if it's worth lining up for if the wait is going to be more than 20min... especially in the winter. Still a decent place nonetheless. 3
I took my 16 year old daughter to this urgent care last night with complaints of foot pain and not being able to walk. She had to hop on one foot down the long sidewalk of our apartment complex to the car. It was really hard on her and she almost didn't make it to the car. Once we got to the urgent care I asked if they had a wheel chair for my daughter to use and they brought one out for her. They took x-rays of her foot and it was broken. They put a temporary immobilizing splint on her foot and gave us the number for an Ortho doctor who could put a real cast on her foot. The staff were friendly and pleasant and I was feeling good about the visit until we were getting ready to leave and I asked about crutches for my daughter. I was told they sell crutches but they do not bill insurance for crutches. I didn't have the money to pay for the crutches so the doctor gave her a prescription for crutches. I was annoyed at the inconvenience of having to go to the pharmacy to get the crutches when she should have been able to leave there with them. We get to our pharmacy only to discover they don't carry crutches and suggested other pharmacies or medical supply stores. What a fiasco that turned out to be. Everywhere I called either didn't carry crutches or didn't take our insurance. My daughter had to go back home with nothing to help her walk other than leaning on me. She was crying by the time we got to our apartment door from having to hop on one leg. I feel this is completely unacceptable! I called another urgent care and found out if I had taken her there she would have left there with crutches. We won't be going back. 1
Just another normal bank but the staff are friendly and will be more than happy to help with whatever you need. Mostly come here for the drive-trough ATM. 4
This place is a unkempt dive in need of major renovations. If it looks dirty then the food is dirty. I had a corned beef sandwich, it was the smallest I've ever had, wife and daughter couldn't even finish what they ordered.The service was great, but it was a dive and dirty. 1
I had a frustrating start to the initial conversation. But afterwards the owner called me to assure his Business ran smooth n the client was happy, satisfied with the service n company guidelines. It was nice to actually receive dialog from the hands on owner , his sincere interest to reach out n personally help resolve my concerns. Thank You David for your service n personal time. Much Appreciated . 3
The food was decent, but probably not any better than something I'd get at filibertos for cheaper. It just seemed to lack flavor. The service was okay and the food was served quick so otherwise no major problems. 2
The fish nibbling deserves five stars.  It's automatic giggles from the moment your feet go in the tank.  (it's also a little startling to learn where fish can find dead skin.  On my shin?  All over my shin? REALLY?  eek).So that was a blast.  But the pedicure was merely serviceable. I will say that they managed to fit in my daughter and me as walk-ins.  We waited about 30 minutes, but they got us in - so that was nice.  And yes, the colour selection is good - although the front of the salon is so dimly lit the pale turquoise my daughter picked out turned out to be more green than blue, but she liked it, so all's well that ends well in that regard - but listen, just because I let two dozen fish dine on my dead skin doesn't mean the job is over.  My heels were still more Hobbit than Hamptons by the end of the pedicure, and the massage was lacklustre at best.The actual polish application was good for me, but my kid had bubbles and chips from Minute One.  Prices reasonable, especially for her - but in the end, the job was only so-so.  Go for the fish and go elsewhere for the pedicure.   Staff friendly enough but we arrived at the end of the day - they were tired and it showed. 2
Have bought probably 6+ Waterman Ballpoint pens here. I tend to lose them and give them as gifts. Was really happy to keep my business local as my office is a short walk away. Stopped by the other day to see about getting the decorative silver tab replaced on my pen, waited for about 15 min as two  very pleasant Canadians made thier purchases. The shop keeper was very nice in telling me that because Parker/Waterman doesn't provide replacement parts I would have to send the pen back to Parker/Waterman, at my expense, wait around 8 weeks to have it fixed (if I could prove it had been less than a couple years since I purchased) and then pay to have it shipped back. It was the next awkward moment that solidified my making this review... it was clear that the best choice would be to skip the hassle and expense and buy a new pen. I did. Online. For less than the local store. Sad, when you realize that having a personal relationship with a local vendor doesn't outweigh the convieience, savings and service of shopping online. Interweb 1, local business 0 2
I would like to thank Bobby for helping with my mortgage. The level of commitment and service he provided  my wife and I was second to none. He answered all our questions, kept is informed though the whole process, and answered his phone when we needed him! I would highly recommend Bobby to anyone this looking to obtain a mortgage, he is professional, honest, and provides excellent service. Thanks once again, and you have a customer for life!!! Said 5
Good and fast service with awesome staff that is respectful and understanding. 5
I completely agree with 1 star review below.  If you are looking for Cirque du Solei show, this is not for you.  There is NOTHING from what you'd expect to see from Cirque du Solei. The music is great, the dancing is good.I'd say one/two acts are memorable, the rest feels like "so you think you can dance" show. 2
I hate the pharmacy you have to walk in wait in long long lines and when you call in refills you get a busy signal!  I'm going back to cvs or walgreens! 2
I'd say this would be a 4/5 Review.I had made my first visit to Le Cafe Michi for birthday dinner this past week. It's hidden away in a tiny plaza off of Sheppard and Pharmacy. The place has limited seating but cute. Luckily we had made reservations. The front area has a display case of the cakes. Out of place there were also some extra goodies like handmade goods and jewellery being sold. The decor of the place tries to capture a "cafe" environment you'd find in Japan along with exposed brick areas that divide seating and the cake display case. In the back room was a private area that looked like a sushi bar. Along the hallway windows lined across the wall of the back room to appear as if you were peering into a cafe along a street.When we had been seated and settled in, we ordered 3 "dinner meals" to share. Each came with choice of cake and either tea or coffee ; Uni Don, Chyo Chin bento, and a Chirashi. In addition we ordered another sashimi set in case there wasn't enough to go around for our family of four.Food service was a bit slow but the patience paid off when our food arrived. The presentation of the dishes were delightful. The Chyo chin bento came in a round egg like bowl with could be separate into 3 sections (top layer was fried chicken, middle was sashimi sampler and bottom layer was Unagi don)... kind of how dim-sum bamboo steamers are stackable. The chicken was crisp and flavourful and the spicy mayo was the perfect balance for it; it was quite popular among my family. The Unagi-don was quite good also; both the rice and the Unagi contributed equally to lfavours.The other 3 dishes (Uni don, Chirashi and Sashimi set) probably impressed me the most. In terms of presentation the sashimi sat on a very thin layer of Tamago and definitely packed with a lot of sashimi unlike a lot fo places I've been to.Both the Chirashi and Sashimi set came with a wide variety of fish and seafood; the ones that stood out the most was the inclusion of Uni, Mentaiko (spicy marinated Pollock Roe), Abalone(I think that's what it was?), and real crab Kani. My parents loved the Yellowtail so much they ordered a second serving of it. Uni is my favourite item on a sushi menu, and I was thrilled to try the Uni don. The uni don came with rice, but it was also drizzled with this green mixture. I wasn't clear what it was but it seemed to have a little bit of spice to it (I think it was probably something pickled) and it added that little bit of acidity to the dish that made it great.Finally after all our main dishes were done, we ordered 3 cakes: Chocolate Sake cake, Hazelnut cake and the Tofu cheesecake. My sister was a fan of the hazelnut cake, but I was more enticed by the Tofu cheesecake and Sake cake. I did not know what to expect for the Tofu cheesecake, but it offered a light yet still rich texture which melted in your mouth. The flavour for the Sake chocolate cake was much more bolder in flavour than the other two cakes. It was very chocolatey and moist but small hints of Sake in it. Most definitely a cake best eaten with some coffee.I would definitely return in the future with some friends. The quality of food impressed me, and the pricing was fair. Most notably I'd come to eat Chirashi and the Uni-don again, if not to just visit this quirky little cafe. 4
Not the friendliest people I've ever met, but I guess I wouldn't be that pleasant either after working outside all day in the summer heat. The lobby is cool and clean with a selection of men only related magazines. Convenient location and fair pricing. 3
I've been here 3 more times since my last review.  Here's what I've tried so far:I love the spinach benedict.  I'm not sure if it's because spinach and mushrooms are one of my favorite vegetables, but I really enjoy this dish.  The spinach is perfectly cooked the way I like it.  I hate it when restaurants overcook vegetables and it's mushy.  I also like the cripsy bacon in between.  The english muffin is lightly toasted and not hard like some places I've had before.I'm not a fan of the kalua pig benedict, but it might be that I normally don't like pork as much as beef or chicken.  I won't say it's not good but it lacked a little favor and the only thing I've had here that I won't order again.The honey toast is really good too.  I love the thickness of the bread.  It's simple but delicious.  It's so hard to decide what to eat here because I like so many things and want to try everything, so usually I would order a savory meal and something sweet like this as a dessert.  I know I'm such a pig :-P  Who eats dessert after breakfast/lunch??I've also had the sweet cream crepes with bananas, which is a nice dessert.  They have honey on the side, but it's pretty sweet as it is.My boyfriend ordered steak and eggs which I've had a bite of.  I thought it was a really good deal.  It came with 2 eggs, potatoes, 2 pancakes, and an 8 oz steak.  The steak was really tender, but my boyfriend said it lacked flavor.  All he needed was to sprinkled some salt and A1 sauce (which was provided along with 2 different hot sauces and ketchup at the beginning of the meal) and it was all good.  It was cooked medium like he requested, still pink on the inside.Other than the food, I've never had to wait for more than 15 min for a table but I usually go during the weekdays or past 12 on weekends.  The service has always been good for us. 4
This is my own personal opinion/experience- The products are very good however the customer service is horrific. Not sure if I have experienced more curt/ borderline abusive service from the ownership/ management.  I've used Medium Rare in the past and have never been satisfied with the service. This Holiday season was no exception. Rude on the phone when placing the order and to add insult to injury I was treated poorly when they didn't have my order ready. I'm a patient and somewhat understanding person but I've had my fill of this place. I'll take my business to people who appreciate my patronage. One more thing, it is shameful the way you speak to your staff. Enough said. 2
nice place!just too packed at lunch time! 3
I honestly loved the acrobatics, costumes and performance. The host- audience interaction ruined it for me.. It became a cheap show with not very funny jokes. It also seemed as majority of the show were the interactions and not the performances. During the actual performances I was speechless, it was absolutely beautiful. Performers get 5 stars from me. Everything else does not.It was just not worth 80 $ to listen and watch 2 hosts play with themselves. Seemed as they were just killing the time on the stage. Total disappointment. They ruined what could have been such an amazing performance by the all these talented dancers. 2
I read about Nota Bene in the Toronto Life magazine and some reviews on Yelp so we ( my better half and three young children) decided to give it a go on a Friday night. As a precusor, I should let you know that we are new to the city and having spent the better part of our lives in Asia, we are used to eating at 'good' restaurants or so should I say those recommended as being good. Nevertheless, we came to Nota Bene with high expectations.The ambiance, is good. The wait staff diligent. The food good, but not deserving of an accolade of being the best restaurant in Canada. I am certain that there must be better restaurants because if this is the top then Canada has a very long way to go; internationally speaking.We started with the ceviche Hamachi - too too salty! I even told the waiter about it and he simply shrugged me off like my comments were not worthy. But honestly folks way too salty. My children and wife devoured the duck salad and they liked it so much they ordered a second. I had the scallops which were very good. My eldest son the brisket burger, my daughter a steak, and my other son a pasta. My wife had the special which was a lobster pasta. Good, but not top notch.We had a couple of glasses of wine ( at $20 for an 8oz glass highway robbery but hey, it is the best restaurant in Canada, right? - So a right exists for them to charge exorbitantly for mediocre wine)Would I go back. No. Would I recommend it?  Perhaps........ 2
The macarons here are a work of art. They have mastered these little desserts to be the perfect mix of a bit of crispiness, followed by a delicious chewy center, and then followed by a burst of subtle flavor. How can a burst be subtle, you ask? Try one and find out. 5
Our server was just a cold fish. Nothing fun and exciting about this place because of her. Food was fine...if you can't cook a burger..... I think if we had a better server we would have been more impressed. 2
Lamb Lettuce wrap 'small plate' was big enough as a meal for me! and it was delicious! Our waiter forgot our appetizer and brought our food first. We said it was unnecessary to bring it at that point, and he brought it anyway but comped us. :) 4
Food is okay considering we are in AZ.  Buyer beware!  They have a big sign on the counter where you pay the bill, saying that the 15% gratuity is NOT included in the total, yet they add it in anyway without your consent!  Shady!!!  Make sure you try to sit in the center, because if you are stuck sitting near the edge or closer to the room with the stage, the carts of food never seem to make it there! 3
I am not going to write a long review, but I will tell you not to waste your time or money going here.  The food was ok, the service was HORRIBLE.  Drive a little further to Crackers and enjoy a good meal and service.  Management/Owners you  need to get some training for your employees.I live in Las Sendas and I am surprise they are still open. 1
There isn't too much to say about G Door. It's your typical college bar with cheap beer and too many people. It's actually bigger than it looks from the outside. There are some dart boards in the middle section of the bar, and there is pool in the back room. Service is average. I like coming here more than other bars in Oakland because there is plenty of standing room and you need a table, but otherwise there  isn't too much that sets it apart from any other bar in the area though. The women's bathroom is tiny and crowded, and there is nowhere to wait if the stalls are full. Not bad, not great, but it gets the job done! 3
Using Yelp helped us find a reputable service provider for our car.After talking with  Back to Basics we were confident that the necessary repairs would be completed properly. We were impressed that the new transmission was finished in the time that was quoted.We were also impressed with the friendly and thoughful service. 5
My family and I stumbled upon Japanese Curry Zen after 5 days of mediocre, overpriced food on the Strip. It was by far the most memorable meal of our Vegas adventure. I lived in Japan for three years and make curry rice at home quite often.  This was the real deal; spicy, flavorful Japanese-style curry with several interesting additions.  I tried the tacoyaki appetizer and it was great.Highly recommended, especially if you've never had Japanese curry before. 5
DONT ORDER ONLINE. It doesn't work. I ordered, put my card detail in, got a Confirmation email and an hour 10 mins later the food still wasn't here. I called and they said the online order system has never worked and the guy who built the website took the money and ran....in fairness they did get the food here quickly after I then ordered by phone and it was really awesome. 3
First time there. I ordered a BLT the Bacon was like rubber. The bread wad as hard as a rock. The waiter never checked back after dropping if the meal. The manager Javier was great. Offered to remake i didn't have the time to wait. 1
O m G. Wow. Ordered the Caesar salad w/ chicken. $17. It took like a 1/2 hour-45 mins. Wasn't even an actual salad. Just peeled and very soggy whole lettuce leaves...wth?!! Did not come with croutons but a piece of bread that was suppose to pass for croutons. Waited a while and order the Famous Frozen Hot Chocolate...very sloppy and I was very disappointed. The tower of whipped cream fell over right after I got it and it was just melting down the sides of the glass. On top of the good things I had heard, it's just a fancy $10 ice cold chocolate milk. Might try the Serendipity in NY but def won't come here again. Paid $30 total for lettuce, Sierra Mist and chocolate milk. 1
I have been here two times.  Same server - same (unpleasant) service.  He was training someone else, but himself was incapable, slow, forgetful, unprofessional - just not what you would expect from a restaurant that is trying to be a Scottsdale classy place.  Ambiance: Nice. Classy.  Enjoyable.  Baby Friendly. Food: Decent. Smaller proportions.  I like their tomato creamy sauce and bruschetta . Service: Below average. 3
We watched football there this past Sunday and say at the bar with Alex. She is fabulous! Great bartender and entertaining and sweet for a Scottsdale bartender. They have a pretty good happy hour and was a decent spot to watch football if you don't like big sweaty dudes yelling at the TV. 5
Consistently good food, attentive service, nice decor and very attractive wait staff (:p)A go-to place to get a steak and catch up with friends downtown after a long day of work. 4
Fantastic dinner!  My wife & I had the filet mignons & crab legs.  The house bread is made in house & had a nice assortment.  Go early for happy hour & hang out at the bar for a little while.  It's worth it! 5
An oasis in a desert for breakfast places. I've lived around here since 1989 and have been amazed at the lack of a good diner or breakfast place. This place is homey like a diner, but eclectic with cool music... and outstanding food. The Corned Beef "don't call it" Hash is melt in your mouth amazing. This is my new go to place for breakfast out. I'm sure lunch is outstanding as well. 5
The food is always good and always consistent. The service is ok, depending on who I get. 3
The tamales was very dry.They had to be microwaved.Rice was dry.Refried beans were very good.Carne Asada was ok.The cashier put my meal in sideways in the plastic bag I had to turn it right side up so I could carry it out properly 2
I ate here for the first time last night.  The restaurant is clean and well lit with a friendly wait staff.  I felt that it was a little too stark.  Nonetheless, it was clean and neat as a pin.  The staff is great.I had the hot and sour soup with some lettuce wraps.  The first thing I'll say is that if you are alone, this is probably not the best dinner spot unless you are content to order off of the appetizer menu as I did.  I found it to be quite expensive.  For instance, my dinner which consisted of about 16 oz of soup, a takeout container of lettuce and a takeout container of chicken and rice with hoisin sauce was nearly $20.  Their lunch menu seems to be far more reasonable in price.  Even though I am on an expense account, I still look for good value.The hot and sour soup was ok.  I have certainly had better.  The lettuce wraps, however were out of this world.  I might go back for those alone or have them as a lunchtime meal.To sum up, points off for price-value but points added for quality of the entree.  It is certainly worth your time to check out. 3
We used to order from NYPD quite often, but this place has gone straight downhill in the last few years.We called for pick-up tonight and were put on hold. No problem, it's dinnertime and they're busy. Someone comes on the line and asks if we're ordering pickup or delivery. We tell them... and get put on hold again. Okay.The guy taking our order seemed totally clueless - probably another new high schooler they hired. He required long pauses between each item of our huge order of 3 dishes and 2 sides. Not terribly difficult, we thought.When we arrived, they tried to tell us that the olive oil that goes on their pasta is plain. Um, seriously? I'm paying for plain olive oil on my plain pasta? I can do that myself! I know for a fact they usually season their olive oil, as do ALL decent Italian restaurants. The fact that I had to argue with them about it was ridiculous. We had to ASK for some garlic and seasoning to be mixed in for us. Thanks.Next, we specifically ordered garlic CHEESE knots - confirmed two times over the phone - only to arrive home and discover we had plain garlic knots. If we'd known, we would've saved the money and just had the ones that came with the entrees. Most upsetting was the fact that we were, indeed, charged for the CHEESE knots, not the plain ones. How complex IS this?Finally, we had to actually request a side of sauce for our cheesecake, when this was never explained over the phone. Funny, since the website menu specifically states the dessert comes with raspberry topping. If there were options, maybe we should have been informed when ordering. If we hadn't caught the mistake, we would've left with... a slice of plain cheesecake. Fantastic. For nearly 5 bucks? I can get two slices for half that at Walmart, strawberry swirl included.All this for overpriced, bland food, an enormous wait time, an incompetent staff, and one huge headache. The pizza is good, sure, but the hassle is NOT worth it anymore. If this is how they run the show now, then I'll take my business somewhere tastier and cheaper. 2
A+++. We started with gumbo and a shrimp salad. Both excellent. My wife had the scallops which were done perfectly and had a nice flavor to them. She really enjoyed the succotash too which was surprising since she normally doesn't care for it very much. I had a plump piece of butterfish which was melt in your mouth along with some spicy veggies. Of course you can't leave without a piece of Emeril's banana cream pie which is as good as it gets. The service was absolutely top notch in every way and we left full and extremely satisfied. I'm certain we'll return. 5
The food was absolutely amazing here. We tried the jerk chicken quesadillas, spring rolls, chicken and waffles, bacon Mac and cheese and deep fried pickles. In terms of food, I have no complaints whatsoever! However the environment....we were sorta a big group, 8 people. It definitely isn't made for large groups and we were put in this corner where the heater was. I understand its -20 outside, but it isn't -20 inside and the heat didn't need to be on that high! It felt like we were sitting in a sauna, which sorta doesn't make you hungry. However I would definitely go back, but I'd avoid the back corner. 4
This DD used to be my favorite coffee stop, but recently the coffee has been awful and the service is bad.  The young guys that work the drive thru are rude and should not be working there. 1
Went here looking for a new place to eat for date night. What I found was not was I expected in either atmosphere or service. The place is perfect for a nice dinner out, we sat for over an hour and it felt like 20 minutes, the feel, lighting and service was above what I expected. Our waitress was great; Lucy acted like we were her only customers even though there were plenty of full tables in her area. I never had to ask for a refill on my drink, as soon as I was close to empty she was bringing another to the table, she suggested her favorite dishes in all categories and was polite and attentive throughout the meal but not overbearing. I will definitely come back to this place again. 4
I saw one of the first dress rehearsals for elvis. it was definatly a work in progress, but the show was still great. lots of originality and unique apparatus'.the show has alot of potential and has been growing ever since i have seen it.definatly a must see if you are into elvis music at all. 4
Price to food value is excellentVery hard to find places still offering full size dinner meal for under $7The food is tasty, but I'll have to say Babu is still better in both price and taste, but Babu branches are too far away.The thing I like the most about Silver Spoon is their service speed.It's WOW! not even Mcdonald can match their speed.You practically order your meal, and it's ready immediately in a sec, faster than you can pull out the wallet to pay for the take out.I totally recommend this place if you're in a rush.Oh and this is during lunch with many people lined up before me.Been here many times,  and they don't disappoint speed wise. 4
Food was good. Service was terrible. Server did not come around for about 10 minutes. When we ordered our food, we then waited for 30 minutes before asking to see our server.  He had said the ticket was "lost" with no explanation or apology. Food came out shortly thereafter. Also, beer that was ordered was not correct. We had to ask for our server again to get the bill, and then ask for him again so we could pay it. Very poor experience overall and was disappointed that this type of service was part of The Aria. 2
after seeing there reg prices we got a deal used priceline.com express deals we didn't know exactly where we were staying, but were traveling with 2 extra kids and picked a place with a pool. our deal this time was $115, normally we don't care about the pool and we get the extended stay on Lebanon church rd for $50.the room was nice and kitchen better then the extended stay, everything was there. liked that there is a seating area, and a dishwasher. was hoping to sit out on patio, at a fire pit, brought roasting forks and smores for kids, but was being sit up for a wedding i guess, no seats out there just a awning. breakfast was a normal hot foods breakfast, liked the added sectioned grapefruit, he liked the omelet bar, but it was packed, there was no where for 5 of us to sit together, at a clean table. there were 4 bar stool seats, that looked into a seating area with a tv, we sat there and let the 2 little ones sit on the floor and use the end tables to eat and watch cartoonsdon't like that you can't go straight outside or to the valet, elevator to lobby, lobby to diff elevator or steps to carreally didn't like the valet service (never really a fan) but this place was the worst   called down 10 min later took a different elevator down, across from our room. This one did end up in the middle of the parking garage, walked towards valet door and noticed our car, carrying large gifts back down, Grad girl couldn't meet us there, taking them to her, had an extra door key, loaded car back up and he put toddler in her car seat, I went over to tell them and get our reg keys.    Tells me NO we can't take our car out of the garage, they have to, ended up letting me. Didn't have it ready because there were 2 cars #23 he didn't know which one was ours. When we return got new #35, so didn't happen again....     Next morning going to leave, called down ahead, about 15 min, get down there no car. Hurdle 3 kids off to side to sit, no one acknowledges us, others come down see their cars and go, a guys comes down asks for his keys and he can get his own car, watch as they hit the curb with other cars, 2 girls who didn't call give their # and get their car. That's when I went over to speak up. They didn't call ahead and already got their car?    Oh what's your #, oh we couldn't find it? 1st why didn't acknowledge us standing there? explain the issues the night before, oh replaced the keys with #35 but they left #23 in the car.     A mgr was there asked my name, she said wouldn't charge us, for the parking gave my name but said i didn't care I just wanted to go, charged us anyway.    Finally get to leave, all 3 kids in the car, get a few blocks away look in my mirror, can't it's folded over, flip it back out (thank full we have flippy mirrors) and now has white paint scratched onto my black mirror. Thanks guys. The pool wasn't that important, next time staying at normal place and using the $80 saved form the room and parking, for an activity for the kids. AND won't have to wait for my car to comeback marked up.I don't care how nice the room was, and it was nice, and I think we did get a good deal.It's really not worth all the other hassles, esp when only staying 1 night, I'd rather stay at a no hassle get my own car basic place. 3
The donuts are hit and miss, but when they're a hit, they are oh-so-good.  The coffee is tasty and a great deal.  The service is fine; nothing has ever really stood out as especially good or bad. 3
I really wanted to like this place, because it's so close to my new house.I was sadly disappointed. The waitress was so inattentive, i felt i couldn't possibly be more important than the person she was texting or the pokemon she was trying to catch.The food wasn't even very good. I could get the same quality from mcdonalds or pizza hut. Save your money and starve to death, because that's better than going in and being treated like crap by some waitress who has reached the peak of her career.... 1
We used to go to the Cathay House and loved it.  We were in town and thought we would check out the new ownership.  IT WAS AWFUL!  We went for the dim sum and the women pushing the carts kept passing our table without stopping.  When we finally got some food it was very tasteless.  The only good thing was we had hat tea the whole time as that was all they cared about.  We told all of our friends in the area not to go back...Its a shame as we used to send them a lot of business.  We left and we were hungry so we went somewhere else for lunch where they enjoyed giving us food 1
We had a reservation on a Friday night at 6:30 and the place was practically empty. We asked for a room which had space for our legs below. Service was fine. The food was fine. Nothing above and beyond what you would expect. The sashimi pieces were a good size. The sushi rolls didn't have too much rice. My tuna/avocado tartare appetizer was bland so it tasted like a tuna roll without the rice. I probably wouldn't come back. 2
Only 4 stars because not all the vets are nice... I love Dr. Bateman, she is amazing. She treats my dogs with such kindness and answers all my questions. However, Dr. Nofal (or something) is another story. I asked her some questions about my puppy and she really didn't even give me the time of day. She looked very irritated and was rushing me out. She also didn't catch my puppies ear infection, she said he was itching because of allergies and didn't even look in his ear. I had to go back to the vet a few days later because his ear was getting really bad, which Dr. Bateman diagnosed with a severe yeast infection. So -1 star because of Dr. Nofal! 4
We had a great experience with Denali moving. All of their employees are exceptionally professional. Most importantly, this company is reliable, communicative, and truly cares about customer service. We will definitely use them again for our next move! 5
came here for summerlicious dinner for 25 for a three course meal.  food was ok at this price but not great.  tuna steak on the summerlicious menu is well done (not a fan) but the sauce is quite good.  steak was bland.  service wasd quite good and being a hotel bar decor is nice.  kind of what you would expect for a hotel restaurant - pricey and average food. 2
I'm not a person to bash business or talk bad about them...but I made an appointment to get my eyebrows tattooed with Jenny Luu ( the shop owner) and I had missed my appointment because my father passed away. When I was able to go in I wanted to explain to her what happened and I said I was sorry but she yelled infront of customers and told me I could not be serviced there anymore because I missed my appointment without even letting me explain the situation. The customer service at UC nail salon could be better !! 1
I went in with two of my friends and we were told we could not sit inside (with the place being mostly empty) because my friends didn't have their wallets on them and couldn't buy their coffee. Absolutely terrible customer service, and inept social skills. You're coffee rush, not a 5 star restaurant. Ridiculous. 1
Ok I have had a change of heart. I really like this place. I have tried Chinese food in other parts of LV and so far this has the best tasting food. I love their Wonton soup, shrimp with honey walnut and mixed veggies. My family likes the pork chop. I also like the fact they have fresh coconut which I am a big fan of. It is open 24 hours and the service is great. 4
I agree with the reviews above- this Thai restaurant is not as overrated as Lotus of Siam.The menu is extensive and somehow impressive. It accommodates to tastes from the heaviest herbivore to the heaviest carnivore, and allowing some options for the fungivore as well.My friend Linda, ordered a beer and a hot saki - satisfactory to the casual diner who orders a couple of drinks with the meal.She ordered the Vegetable Delight and I - The Tom Yu Chicken Soup with Tofu. While after sampling both dishes, they are not extraordinary to me, I will give them a thumbs up.I was a little irritated of the indifference from the three waitresses. While they were a little busy tonight Friday, it is not that they had a full house ( there were about six tables ) and they couldn't even bother to walk by our table to check how we were doing? 3
Reviewed Dish: Fish + Fries, Seafood ChowderRecommended Dish: Fish onlyReviewed during: Mon - Fri Lunch timeService Speed: 5 / 5Cooking speed: 2 / 5Food Quality: 2 / 5Food Quantity: 3.5 / 5Price: 3 / 5 ($10 for 1 piece of fish + fries)Cleanness: 5 / 5 Repeat: For the fish only.The cashier took my order quickly, even though there are 4+ people working the kitchen, it still took a long time to cook the food.The fish is quite fresh and flaky, but the portion size is very small. Unfortunately the batter/crust is mushy and not crunchy at all. Probably because the batter disintegrated upon touch, the fish had very little flavor.I got the fries fresh from the fryer, it was ok. But I would not get the fries on it's own.The container is not very big, I would not recommend to the $2.50 upgrade to onion rings/other options.There is a lot of  seafood in the seafood chowder, but other than that, it's not that tasty. It lacks either more cream or seasoning. 3
We were looking forward to the dinner based on the reviews and  ratings.  However I had some concerns as there were some recent negative reviews.  This was probably the most disappointing dinner we have ever had.  We started with the octopus and calamari. The octopus was far too salty and inedible.  The calamari was chewy and bland.  The main courses we had were the lamb and linguine with clams.  The rack of lamb was composed of about half fat.  My wife had the linguine and the noodles were hard and chewy.  When she asked about the chewiness of the noodles they took the plate back and said they would prepare a new one.  They brought the same plate back just hotter (probably in the microwave).  Will definitely never go again and will not reccommend. 1
Just make sure that you know what you picking out before you leave!I recently purchased a couch for around $250 and I know the couch is priced somewhere higher. The policy is stated no-returns on couches-once they leave the store!! I wanted another couch while still in the store but the ass. manager couldn't figure out the math (i.e. difference of the couch/restocking fee). While we were loading the couch in the truck- I looked over and she was smoking a ciggy!! Like she had done some wonderfully customer service- work.  I was feeling upset because I should have done the math work myself but again why should I do the math/pick up the couch, pay for the couch etc.... but i guess if I really wanted it i should have. A couple of days later I spoke with Tom Hagen (director) and he stated me same policy that there's no return once the couch leaves the store- point blank!! Still somewhat statsfied with my current purchase but really wanted the other couch. They need better customer service- I think high school percents and subtraction would help also! 2
I got the turkey sandwich.  Slightly small sandwich but the side dish added value and it was delicious! Nice clean, contemporary decor & good service.  I recommend! 4
Very disappointing stay.   Service comparable to two star hotel.   Could not even get a wine opener sent to room.  I Was told to buy one in gift shop.  Was subjected to search everytime i wanted to go to pool.  Pool closes at six a good two hours before most strip casinos.  Overall very frustrating stay.   Not worth it at all. Much better options in a city full of resort Casinos. 1
Ugh, lunch today was no bueno.FWIW, I've been for breakfast twice and those were decent, I got the eggs Benedict and something else that I don't remember. The point is, they were good enough and certainly not  terrible, which is why the sad, soggy, oily mess of a not-a-single tomato, lettuce, onion  or garnish cafe hamburger with salty, cold fries  that I had for lunch today prompted this review.  Far be it from me to turn my nose up at french fries but it had to be done. 3
Matt arrived when he said he would and gave us a quote before starting the job. He did clean a small amount of the tile and grout so we could see what the finished job would look like, which was very helpful. He cleaned everything up before he left and the quality of the work met our expectations and then some. I would highly recommend Excel Floor Care. 5
These guys need to get their act together. The menu keeps changing and their pho quality/taste as well. Broth lacking in depth of flavour (which, I guess is just salty water) and noodles are over cooked. Quantity of meat is so little that you can't help but feel ripped off. Too bad, I really wanted this place to succeed b/c I live so close to it. I hope they somehow get it together. As of now, I'm staying away.. 1
I had a filet mignon and it was served less than hot and undercooked. 1
When we go out to eat, my SO and I like to order different meals so that we can sample a variety of foods from the restaurant. In particular to sushi restaurants, I usually get some raw fish and my SO gets a bento with cooked foods. Here at Sushi House, I ordered the salmon chirashi and he got a bento. The bento was not too special but the chirashi was very good. The rice was well seasoned, with a  generous portion of salmon, along with other little condiments on the side like marinated mushrooms and pickled radish. After the first time, I always order the same thing. The owners and chef are Korean and so the sushi is a bit different from Japanese or Chinese sushi. 4
Three stars exactly.  There is nothing too amazing, and nothing terrible about this place.   The food was all good, with an ample amount of vegetarian options, and the roasted potatoes in particular I found to be quite good.  They do have a really big screen for sporting events, and a decent selection of beers on tap.    You could do worse than swinging by Hawks and having a couple beers. 3
I have been a client of Carol's for 9 years and would never consider having my nails done anywhere else. Her studio is clean and relaxing and she is a complete professional.  She convinced me to try the new shellac pedicure and I was skeptical because I am very rough on my toes and polish never lasts more than a week. 3 1/2 weeks later the polish is just as shiny as the day she put it on and not a single chip- I am now a HUGE fan.  In my opinion, she is the best. 5
The wait wasn't too bad, they turn over very fast. The fried oysters were a tad disappointing, very small and looked almost burnt but the taste was ok. The whole shabang seasoning was great. The sausage were very tasty as well. The portion of crabs was smaller than I anticipated but tasted great. Overall, not too bad but I've have better at other crab houses not as well known. 3
I first checked out Calgary Beerfest in 2008, when it wasn't really worth attending. Not a lot of good breweries, almost no food, poor layout, few places to sit. So I didn't go back. Until this year, that is, after hearing many good things about the current version of the event. & I am very glad I went! It's huge now, with around 100 breweries involved, & even included some wine, cider & coolers. If you really want to try as many as possible, you may need to go both days. But if you do some research ahead of time, you can hit the interesting ones in one day without having to try too many duds. Was delighted to taste Maui Brewing's new seasonal double IPA with blood orange - delicious! Sobeys/Safeway had a liquor store set up with many of the featured breweries available to take home as well. Numerous local restaurants offered various types of food: as another Yelper mentioned, there is a ton of "meat on a bun", but diverse types, at least. I was fairly disappointed to find little for vegetarians, so a huge shout out to Fiore Cantina: http://www.yelp.ca/biz/fiore-cantina-italiana-calgary for having 2 different things I could eat. Plus they did have meatballs as well (NOT on a bun, for some carnivorous variety). There were even a few desserts. I did not purchase VIP tickets as I wasn't interested in any of the seminars; I found that arriving at the beginning of regular admission was good timing, so you could actually talk to the brewery reps & not wait in too many lines. By the time I left, however, it was considerably more difficult to find a place to sit, & most every tasting station had a line. The longest lines were for the men's washrooms, however - that is a bit of a deficiency for this venue (BMO Centre) 4
Headed out to the Jerk last night for a bite with a girlfriend before a concert. My past experiences here have been incredibly slow service and so-so food. Maybe because of the recent eviction scare or maybe because they just found their groove again, last night was great! Service is still very much on Caribbean time so when they are busy, you might wait to place your order but once it's in, you are set! Drinks came fast once ordered, so did the food and...it was hot + DELICIOUS! The beef patty was perfect flaky crust with just the right seasoning for the meat, the banana fritters were sweet and not too oily, my lentil roti rocked! Even the rice was cooked well. Bravo to the Real Jerk for pulling it together and making me a big fan! 4
I went here tonight for a girlfriends birthday. Food was great. Our server was attentive but it did take a while to get our food and drinks.I highly recommend the soft pretzels with fondue, so yummy! Everyone enjoyed their entrees. I had the Sweet Corn Cannelloni; the flavors were very rich and I was happy to see they had several vegetarian options. We also got to choose a complimentary desert, and had the Monkey Bread. Sounded so-so but was delicious. Also, I love decor! Comfy chairs, that are different at every table and the gorgeous chandeliers make it feel very upscale.My only complaints would be the amount of time we waited to get our food/drinks, it was pretty loud, a bit too dark, and the portions were fairly small for the price. 3
The food are quite decent and the service is great, although it's a little bit pricey. 4
This place is fun and has Great Ribs they are tasty and melt off the bone! We had the sweet potato side with marshmallows and it was delicious!! We went here on Black Friday for dinner and it was packed but well worth the 40 min wait! We didn't have reservations so would recommend them next time. Our server Brittany was excellent and kept our drinks refilled without asking her.  We will go back again for sure. 4
The workers here are really hip.   The go with the flow even on weekend nights when the hours are the busiest.  Great place to meet up with friends and have a good time. 4
A bit overpriced. Hidden charges not listed on the menu but will appear on the receipt. I ordered 4 tacos and a burrito. The cashier asked you want everything ? I said yes. But never said it's $1.85 extra per each item! Then I noticed on the receipt they added . $1.85 x5 for saying yes everything. They put the standard dash of salsa, sour cream without asking me if I want sour cream on Mexican food. Guacamole on the tacos was more than the meat. The burrito had nothing extra on it that would warrant an extra 1.85 on top of the burrito cost. A big disappointment . Does not taste better than Taco Bell and about 5 times higher. Save your money stick to Roberto's Las Vegas 1

I admit... The food was pretty good.  However, the service was terrible.  We were 5 min late for our reservation and they made us wait 1 hour at the bar (seated after 9:30)  The hostess was incredibly rude and it took almost 30 min to get service at the bar.  When we were finally seated the service only got worse.  They didn't refill our waters or wine glasses once.  They served our first course to another table and never once explained what was laid in front of us.  They knew how terrible the service was (we have said nothing at this point) so they offered us free dessert.  But... The kicker was the $50 bottle if wine that ended up as $100 on the bill.  We were amazed so we asked the table next to us how their meal was.  Turns out they were getting a free meal due to the 5 reservation changes made by the restaurant.  Hope this place gets their act together.  Currently it's an embarassment to a hotel that's trying to be upscale.  Hype not quality. 2
Place was probably legit before it became a chain. Poor quality food, huge portions but not good. 2
We have always enjoyed coming to "The Castle" for Mexican food.  However, the previous owners let the place run down and we stopped coming.  We found out there were new owners so we went there last night.  We were very impressed!  The food was great, the service was very good and we could see that they are making improvements to both the building and the food!  I'm bummed that I missed the whole summer and not being able to sit and enjoy the view from the patio, but at least it seems that they are on the right track now! If you have been disappointed in the past you may want to give it another try!  I'm glad we did!  We really enjoyed the chips and salsa, guacamole, and Fajitas Texanas!  We added chorizo sausage to it and it was simply wonderful!!!  Everything was served hot and fresh and there was nothing to complain about at all! 4
By far worst service, wait staff, and management in the valley, poor attitude, from the front of the house to manager.. Food very average. Over All. Poor dining experience.  Don't waste your time.. Can you take away stars. ? No never mind they don't have any. 1
Very good fish and seafood, but if you go there for lunch, make sure you call ahead so that they know to expect customers. 4
Although I didn't buy my wedding dress at Beckers the bridal consultant that I had my appointment with was amazing!!! She was very knowledgeable and put me in a gown I never thought I would try on for my frame, let alone like! The boutique has gowns from many designers for all shapes and styles and reasonably priced - it seems overwhelming with all of the selection but the knowledge of their staff makes the experience a pleasant one. What I learned from my experience there led me to purchase the dress of my dreams...I'm only sorry they didn't carry the designer I fell in love with in their boutique. Beckers should be on your wedding dress shopping list! 4
I'm satisfied with what services we get here at this price range.  Seems competitive and you get a discount the more classes your child takes a week.  My son is 3 1/2 and I signed him for two classes a week and now it's almost been a month.  My goal was to get him comfortable in the water and have fun with other kids around.  What I realize is that's it's all about the instructor and they can be so different from each other.  Very early on (but after we had one terrible one who was apathetic, let my son sink under water several times while panicking cause he couldn't get up breath causing my son to be scared even for the following two lessons with other instructors) I talked to the front desk to get their feedback on what they've heard from parent reviews and I was able to narrow it down to the best instructor for my son. She's kid friendly and teaches good technique.  The place could be managed better because it seems they really should invest some money to fix some things that are started to look a bit run down. Locker rooms are not so nice.  It's like there lots of college kids working for the summer here but I don't really notice anyone really running the place.Overall it's a fun place for kids to go swimming indoors in warm water but if I wanted my son to really get serious about becoming a strong swimmer, I would look elsewhere. 3
When it comes to low cost pizza, betas everybody.  Best bang for the buck.  Twice as much as anybody else for the price. Plus it's hot and fresh from my oven. With coupons, even better!!  Twice as much cheese and toppings compared to Papa Johns or Dominos. Stuffed crust is awesome. 5
I will say I haven't had some horrific experience here, however due to the prices I won't be going back.  My first visit I took in about 10+ items in for dry cleaning and laundering, which cost me around $150. I expected it to be a bit pricey, but considering I used a coupon I'd say they are outrageous. Even then I'm the type of person who is willing to pay a little extra for good quality-- So the rating really reflects just how over priced their services are. Today I went to pick up three items I had dropped off for alterations last week; my total came to $66.75! (And that was after a discount of $22.25) When I had dropped them off I specifically asked how much it would cost and at that time they said they weren't able to give me an amount. I can say the tailoring itself looks really nice, but I would have only had one pair done if I had known how much it was going to be. As for the "alterations" I don't really feel I got what I askDefinitely not happy with the prices or the quality for the price paid. -B 2
I love this place! It's so cute Inside and so fun to see all the planes while you eat! This place is always so busy so expect to wait but they have a comfy waiting area with free coffee and cookies and you can watch the planes while you wait. The menu is large and priced good. The food is amazing! The staff is so nice! 5
Delicious pastries at a great price. Nice, simple patio too. Not sure what else to say! 5
This is my favorite beauty bar, hands down. I know everyone talks about the atmosphere being great but the service is always on point as well. I've been going here since they opened and they've only gotten better with their service! My nails always stay and they always provide unique designs if ever I can't make up my mind. I've been with almost every girl that works here and ALL of them have kept it professional, you can tell they really spend time and effort on working on you. Even though I live kinda far, I still make my way down because I always find myself unsatisfied and comparing other nail jobs to Naked's. I've also tried waxing my eyebrows here and no regrets! 5
The tacos were just as good as (almost) everyone here says they are.Delicious and easygoing. The small space, long lines and almost no seats might bother some people but this is more like a take-out place anyway. Trust me, it is worth a little wait. Super yummy tacos, can't complain! 4
For good prices, I think chinese grocers can't be beat, but you have to put up with some terrible shopping experiences sometimes. Not the case with Btrust.I had blindly offered to host a family lobster or surf and turf new years eve dinner without knowing where I would be getting the lobster/seafood, but trusting that I would be able to get live lobster for $6 a pound from someplace like T&T. Anyway, I was really happy to see that Btrust on the 30 Dec had live lobster special for $4.99! Then on Dec 31, they had BC crab for $4.99/lb! When I went there, I expected a mad house with people rudely not lining up for stuff and everything sold out, but surprise! There were lots of people and everyone was polite. Line ups were orderly, lobsters and crabs in supply. The fish counter guy was even kind enough to ask what size we wanted and helped us to fish out the biggest we could get in the $4.99 tank category. We had a great NYE dinner and on NYE day, I went to the same grocer and bought live crab for New years day surf and turf, which I also hosted. Yum yum! This was a great cap to a week of holiday feasting.They are not as fancy as T&T, but they have my vote for one of the better chinese grocers on the basis of their fish counter section, great pricing and general availability of what is advertised and the orderliness of the patrons. Now if only they were off the subway line so I can go there without begging someone to drive me... 4
I am not very brave when it comes to food, so when I ordered food here, I got the one that was most familiar to me. (wonton chicken ramen) It was absolutely delicious! Ordered to go, so they give you the soup in two different containers which I really like, because this way the wontons don't get soggy. Also got a Jinya bun, pretty similar to a pork bun, which was really good too. I would definitely recommend if you were looking for a great soup fix! 5
Very disappointed.  The poached eggs were runny.  Sent them back and got more runny eggs.  They were kind enough to not charge me as I could not eat them.  A dining companion ordered the house special breakfast omelette.  She, too was very disappointed in this expensive brunch entree.  She described it as "blah".  No potatoes or toast is served with this omelette.  At $15 one would think it would be served with a something.  Want a side?  $5 more.  Another dining companion ordered a burger "medium".  It came out of the kitchen very rare.  The wait staff seems hurried and pretty indifferent.  Still the place had plenty of customers.  I have no idea why as I won't be back. 1
The Food is GREAT! Unfortunately in the span of a Month we have had 2 company dinners there and both times we have had food poisoning. The customer service is phenomenal, the food is just great, good portions, well seasoned. The first dinner 1 person had food poisoning and we thought it a fluke, we should try this place again because everything was so good. Second dinner, 2 people with food poisoning. Unfortunately we will not be visiting again. Order with precaution. 2
Sooooooo slow! Granted it was a Saturday night for dinner, but still. It took about 35 minutes for me to get a TomKah soup, no meat. I ordered a sweet sticky rice with mango to go and that only took 25 minutes. The soup was mediocre. The rice in my dessert was greenish color and not so sweet. I opted to go here because it was super close but as long as I had to wait, I could have driven down to my favorite Thai Spices on Main and Dobson, and I probably would have still been done sooner! I didn't taste many of their menu items but from what I did have I would say this.. If you are used to great Thai food, don't go here. 2
My favorite sandwich shop in charlotte. Used to frequent one in nashville, so glad they followed me here!!! Delicious, and plenty of choices. It is a must try. 5
The company did come out and make the necessary repairs, the gate looks pretty good now. 3
I really wish I liked this place more than I do. It's close to home, decently priced and everyone here seems really nice. The problem, after four visits, is that there just isn't enough food here that is either (1) good or (2) unique.Take the weekend breakfast buffet. $8.95 for 14 items (you can see the list in the picture of the menus). With one exception (the French toast, which is good), everything here is OK... But there isn't anything you can't get from Golden Corral. And because GC is busier, their food doesn't steam half to death in the metal coffins. The fresh fruit assortment looked sad-- appeared to come out of a blister-packed container of stuff sold at the GFS store a few miles east on Lorain Road. The apple sauce and cottage cheese both came out of big foodservice tubs.I had Orange Juice. It tasted funny, so I sent it back. My wife spotted the Smith's label on the gallon jug she poured the replacement from. I'm paying $1.89 for 8 ounces of made from concentrate. At both lunch and dinner, every single vegetable side they served-- except for the fried potatoes (which are superb)-- obviously came out of a can. You can see the sad little puddle of watery juice at the bottom of the bowl. I'd just as soon not get a vegetable.The pies in the dessert case are Mama Jo's pies. Yes, they're good-- but I can buy those at Marc's at Great Northern.The salads are the predictable sad iceberg mix with ice-cold tomatoes. Other than the house dressing, everything taste like it came out of a bottle. The rolls are tasty-- but they're also "heat and serve". So what's good? What got two people to return three times? The soups are genuinely excellent. The had one or two each time and THEY were made from scratch. Absolutely worth it.We showed up the day after St, Pat's and got some of the corned beef. THAT was good. So was the cabbage. Didn't have it in a sandwich, but I'd be willing to order that. (Although Joe's in Rocky River is better.)The gyro and the Grecian platter were good. So was the Athenian platter. Not surprising, since the proprietors are Greek. I'd bet the Greek Salad is good-- probably the Chicken Kebabs (it has the same meat as the stuff in the Athenian platter).. Again, it's undercut by the large number of good gyro places around.Their lasagna (a special) and chicken parmesan was unique. The tomato sauce has greek spices. I wasn't wild about it, but it was definitely original; you might love it. (It really made me wish they had a spinach or veggie lasagna-- or an eggplant parm). There's probably more good stuff there-- but we ran out of the energy needed to keep searching. You're paying $10-15 per person (with drink, tip and dessert). That's not unreasonable, but when the results have been ordinary too often you don't feel like gambling on "Chicken-fried steak." It might be brilliant-- or it could be stringy meat with limp breading lying in a pile of library paste (that's what the sausage gravy from breakfast tasted like).I'd sooner give someone else a first chance, rather than these guys a fifth.  We'll come back for carry-outs of soup, but that'll be it. 2
Went in this morning, waited forever as the stylists chatted at length without barely cutting their clients hair.  The loud tvs made the wait unbearable. 1
Bought a blueberry pie for dessert at a family dinner. Didn't enjoy it at all. Pastry wasn't flaky, was more empanada like. And blueberry filling although generous wasn't sweet. Needs some work. Have you tasted your pies lately? 1
Pretty good food. Terrible staff. And yes they have roaches. Grossed everyone out the waitress didnt even want to go by it. Owner did stop by and bill was on the house 2
Gotta be a stoner man who loves Cheech and Chong to really appreciate the atmosphere, but if you like toasty subs with a great flavor, awesome iced tea, homemade brownies, and great mac salad, you can still show up if you're an uptight honkey.  I always find the people here super friendly, and it's funny to watch all the young punks and skateboarders stumble in and out. 4
food ordered: shackburger, chicken dog, strawberry shake, friesfood: Well.... wanted to order their smokestack burger, but they ran out of bacon. wanted to order the shackmeister dog, but they ran out of cheese sauce. wanted the cheese fries, they ran out of cheese. sense a pattern going on...?  we ended up with a shackburger, chicken dog and regular fries.... They just opened on Mon 12/29 and we were there on Fri 1/2.  Whoever does their inventory ordering should have done some damage control and gotten a rush shipment cuz it looked like they ran out of half their menu items!  from the food that we DID end up getting... the burger was tasty, a little on the smaller side. I could have eaten two!  fries were nicely flavored and crispy.  chicken dog was a bit dry, the chicken sausage was slit down the middle then grilled so lost a lot of it's juices and flavors. it was getting close to being chicken jerky...  the winner winner for me was probably the strawberry shake. very rich in flavor.misc: located outside of the newly renovated NY NY bridge area. plenty of seating inside the restaurant, but the restaurant gets very busy, so finding somewhere to sit is a little difficult sometimes. 3
Everything from the service to the food to the ambiance was on point. The quality of the ingredients is apparent from the first bite. I can't wait to go back. 5
A much smaller place than I expected but inviting nonetheless. Seats at the bar were offered and accepted. My wife had the Ginger Beef appy and found it way too salty with way more sauce than necessary. If you like ginger, you'll get lots with this order.I had the Koi Club Sandwich with a side of salad. Very small breast of chicken but tasty.Nice venue for local musicians but after our first visit, I probably wouldn't recommend it for dinner. 3
This is our go to restaurant for all you can eat sushi when we are in Vegas, and even if we're just passing through town. The variety of sushi available will satisfy just about anyone's taste buds and appetite. Our absolute favorite is the seafood salad, though. The medley of seafood and spicy seaweed will keep you coming back for more. 5
First I was impressed by the price. Then I was impressed by bell guy who took our luggage to our room. Then impressed with the room itself! It got even better with the little things that made our stay perfect. The call from front desk shortly after we checked in to our room asking if everything was ok. The popcorn in the kitchen & no problem asking for more. I love this hotel & will definitely be back! 5
Bouchon for breakfast is simply the best!!! Bouchon french toast is basically a bread pudding but there is nothing basic about it. Delicious buttery brioche soaked in a cinnamon custard then stacked and layered with tart apples. Dessert for breakfast...who doesn't love that. Added a side of bacon that was thick, smoky and crisp. Corned beef hash has nice size dices of corned beef and potatoes along with peppers and onions. Nothing like you get in a diner. The eggs were perfectly poached and completed the yummy meat filled dish. But the biggest hit was the coffee. Rich, dark and full bodied but not bitter. Our cups were kept full by the very attentive staff, a very important part of any successful breakfast.Don't miss Bouchon for breakfast. 4
Great food!!! Hip atmosphere.. It's definitely laid back. Parking can be a challenge at times. 4
I want SO badly to give Crescent Ballroom a 5-star review, because really it is nearly a 5-star place.First off, the concert venue is perfect for Phoenix.  It is small enough to be extremely intimate, yet large enough that you don't feel cramped and can step away almost enough to have a conversation while the music is loud.  Drinks are reasonably priced, and there are 2 bars that generally don't have a huge wait.  Did you say you could buy a burrito to eat during the concert? Heck yes!  The sound quality and lighting are both pretty good, and they bring in great local acts.  I think they have a concert nearly every night of the week, and tickets are rarely expensive.Second, the lounge area is pretty awesome.  There is never a cover to get in, and you can generally hear the concerts from there as well.  Most nights there is a DJ that plays some pretty sweet music, and people seem to always be happy.  There are a number of high-tops and tables if you want to chill, and by midnight people tend to create a little dance floor.I don't have much experience with the food here, but the burrito I had was pretty good and I've heard good things.  Check that out for yourself.So, why only 3 stars?  The big reason is the smoking.  Crescent has a sizable patio area in the front of the building, and it draws quite the hipster crowd.  I love hipsters.  But I hate hate hate how much they smoke.  Every single person on the patio is smoking at all times.  The problem here?  The patio has giant doors that open the lounge up to the outside, and the hipsters are essentially smoking inside.  Not in 2012, not in my book.  It kills me.Reason number two for the star-deduction: what is wrong with the grapefruit juice here?  I've been told by every bartender that it's fresh-squeezed, and I have no reason to doubt that.  But seriously, there is something major wrong with it.  I've tried it with all of my favorite vodkas, and it just fails each time.So, here's what you do.  Drop by one night, they're open until 2am every night.  Check out a concert if you can, for $10 who really cares if you know them or not.  Grab a drink at the bar and stay as far from the patio as you can.  And grab an Odell IPA, they never disappoint. 3
Awesome deviled eggs! Also had the truffle mushroom sandwich with potatoes, tasted great! Atmosphere and service also on point! 4
My fiance and I used Marcus to help us find a rental home in Scottsdale.He definitely did his homework for us.Listened to our needs and wants and found many appropriate homes to show us.He set up all appointments, simplified the rental agreement and even helped us move in!I have and will continue to recommend Marcus to anyone looking to buy or rent in the Phoenix area. 5
20 minutes in a drive thru is ridiculous.  Every damn time. The service needs to improve or this place won't make it. 1
excellent food, a little spendy. Don't sit in the tables next to the bar. The kitchen door open sand close conactantly 4
I would fire the manager of this KFC. Menu board has one price but they charge you another. 7 pm and they have no breasts of chicken and none cooking. Go somewhere else. These people are clueless. 1
Large, clean store. Lots of stock; just wish clothing was sorted by size not color. Prices a bit on the high side. 3
I really didn't want to give it one star because their food is decent (mediocre but for the price...) and the location quirky and charming, but there's really no way to avoid the low rating.We were a group of 8 and earlier during the day I called to try and make a reservation because I saw on the reviews that they do reservations. When I called I was told, "we don't do reservations, bra". OK bra, no worries. We get there and we see at least 3 tables with the "reserved" signs on it. What the hell bra? It wasn't a problem because the place was empty and we were able to sit on one of the picnic tables outside. So far so good...The three of us got there first and no one greeted us (this isn't a huge deal but...) and we sat ourselves down. We sat around and chatted for about 5-10 minutes or so. Still no one turns up. We'd like some drinks, so I figured maybe they just didn't see us enter and I head up to the bar to ask for a menu. The waitress hands me one menu, so I explain to her that there will be a bunch of us so if she could grab more menus for me that would be great. To this she snarls at me, "I will get them, OK?" And that look! You'd think I had just committed murder and was attempting necrophilia... She finally comes around, we order our drinks and put in an order for nachos for us to share while we wait for the rest of our group to join us. We got those nachos well after our party arrived (1.5 hours after we had put our orders in). Our meals came out about an hour after that - of course all separately. When a friend of mine asked if we'd be getting the rest of our orders, the waitress became snide and told us that it's coming (well, where is it?)Paying was a nightmare too - we had gotten inside because we wanted to get out of there at last - had to ask her to get us our bill multiple times and we just sat around and waited for her to run around doing whatever she was doing. Not to mention the "band practice" Wednesday nights where we had to endure a terrible sounding band hack away at their "instruments". Phew, what an experience! If you want to be irritated and not be served you should definitely check this place out. I don't even mind that service is slow and that the food is mediocre. I'm really okay with that. What I have a problem is when people treat people with disdain and contempt (especially in the hospitality industry). Hard to believe that I am using such strong words for a restaurant/bar review but they certainly are the most accurate word for the way we were treated by the waitress. 1
Exceptional service very professional took the time to do it right would highly recommend two friends and family alike really appreciate the service that was given where else can you find a free service so valuable 3
Food is pretty good here.  I usually get breakfast once a week or so - mainly the omelet, but I have tried other items.  Overall pretty tasty.  The only so-so item that I tried so far is the smoothie (blech).  They also have mochas and cappuchino's, etc on the menu but never have it in the diner.  But despite that, I would still recommend the food here! 3
The first time we went, food was good. They do need to better the service. Waitress/Servers need to be more enthusiastic and say hi to customers as they come in and not leave you unattended for a long period of time, which happened on our first visit. We mentioned the place to our friends and we decided to go again (second time in a week) and this time we were dissapointed and even ashamed we had mentioned the place to our friends. Service again from servers was bad, again they need to say hi to customers and not leave them unattended. They didn't have some of the food in the menu available. The server messed up our entire order and we had to wait longer. All in all some of the food is good, other not so good and they need better service and to have food in the menu available, if you cannot have it available, why advertise it??? Get the food and get your servers to be more proactive and take better notes of the orders. 2
had a flat on the parkway this morning - AAA sent these guys to help me out - they were able to get to where i was quickly & had me on my way in minutes - Thanks alot!  Lamont - you are  a good guy! 5
Not worth the money, I had such high hopes for this place wood fired steaks. But nothing special OK service mediocre steaks. The only plus was watching the cooks add wood to the fire and very nice ambiance. Would I recommend or return nope. 2
I had ordered my wedding cake from Sweet Indulgence Bakery almost two years ago and to this day, I easily recall my anger and irritation about what occurred.  Basically what happened was that the cake looked nothing like the cake that I had emailed a picture of to the owner AND it looked messy and crooked (think very unsmooth and crooked lines).  If i can figure out how to upload a picture, I will!  Second, she got the two flavors I chose wrong.She was very lucky that 1) we had a fantastic wedding and were in too good of a mood to be truly angry and 2) that my husband spoke with her.  I'm still pissed that we only got 25% off a very pricy cake.But as you can see, I still have a grudge.  She didn't get one thing about the cake right!I only recently joined Yelp which is the reason for the delayed review. 1
I returned from a long vacation and decided to use Supershuttle to return home.  The gentleman I first talked to  was professional and quick.  The wait was minimal because this gentleman was so efficient.  My driver was Andy and he also was kind and professional.  I used Supershuttle a couple of years ago and it was no where near as pleasant.  The employees are a plus now.  Jennifer 5
Went for Valentine's Day dinner and totally disappointed. We ordered steak tacos for appetizer, steak sandwich and steak salad. The steak on all three items was cold! It's like it had been sitting out for an hour before they served it. Flavors were bland and un-exciting. We could have easily made all three items at home for a weekday dinner. 1
Looks great- like a page out of a loft kitchen in Dwell magazine- but often what looks good may not work for the intended function. As a restaurant, the space was not utilized well- a tiny waiting bench area, a bar counter that takes up more space than it offers in function, a small lounge of two chairs and a sofa that- I guess? is for waiting, that could host tables where customers could eat. It makes for a chaotic entryway where people stand or sit around in confusion.The cold, stylish lines of the renovated-warehouse-chic dining area are not kind to sound: one can't hear their friends across the table because of the clatter of commerce and other customers. The result, you both have to speak louder. Then that bounces around, and everyone has to speak louder- and so it goes. It could be fixed with sound dampeners on the ceiling or walls, which could easily be integrated into the look. It's restaurant 101, really.The food. No complaints, really. I didn't enjoy my lunasagna, but that is more of a personal aversion to limp zucchini, and the red sauce of the sundries tomato base was too strong somehow and didn't blend well with the nut cheese on top. I wasn't alone there, one of my group had the same opinion and couldn't finish his.The bill of my group was much higher than I'd expect, and I wonder if when the hipness wears off people will realize they can make the small portions of raw food at home much cheaper, and in a quiet setting. 2
Tyrone is the best! Great mixologist! We sat at the bar for several hours and Tyrone was friendly and attentive. 5
Poor service, was told that they had to order the scrubs and they would take one week to be in.  They weren't ready after a weeks time and I was told "I didn't get the shipment in".  Was then told they would courier to my work the next day. They did not,  no communication whatsoever.  I called them to find out hours so I could go and pick up myself.  (Saturday 10-2). I showed up Saturday at 1:30pm lights off, door locked, didn't answer the phone.  BUYER BEWARE 1
First I've been coming here for the past 10 years and despite the stinkiness of the bar I have continued to go there. Tonight a lady decided to interrupt a conversation I was having with my brother and the bartender decided to take her side and kick us out.this is after I paid my tab and left the bartenders a above average tip.he told us that he was kicking us out because she was a local, you dumb bastard I'm a local also but you decided to kick me out with my family and I hope you burn in hell and your mother also. I should have known not to go into the bar because there was a Donald Trump rally in front of the bar, me being the patriot that I am said fuck it. If you want to be treated like dog shit I suggest you go to Luckys lounge on Farm Road. 1
Went there a few weeks ago and I am so ready to go back.. The first thing that you notice is the multiple televisions... and being a sports fan that is right up my alley.. The service is good and the food was great best wings I have had since moving to Phoenix hands down...Can't wait for march madness so i can post up in there and watch all the games. . 4
Went in for a simple bouquet of mixed white flowers. I stood out front, unhelped for too long. When I collected the bouquet, I asked if it could be bound as a bouquet and she said "no, we just wrap it in plastic"... The people behind us, in line... Said this shop has some of the worst service in town...  The gal brought the flowers back out, haphazardly wrapped without any moisture wrap on the stems... 2
My wife and I made reservations here for our wedding aniversary. We had three outstanding meals here in the past but hsd not been here for about two years. We expected another outstanding meal but were disappointed this time. The caesar salad had sardines not anchovies, ouch! There were also no croutons; just some crushed bread crumbs. The dressing was not a made fresh. My wife ordered the meatballs apetizer; they were very hard and not apetizing. I had the penne al forno, the baked pasta dish. This dish was dry and the ricotta in this dish was grainy and un-appetizing. I know it is difficult to find an Italian chef in Las Vegas. Hopefully they find another Italian chef for quality control purposes. 2
This place is straight out of 1985 in some ways, but that is part of its charm.  The food is decent and the salad bar that comes with every meal is very well equipped, including pepperoni bread.  The house wine goes well with most food, and carafes are inexpensive.  Cleveland-comfort-food -city!  We are starting to make this place a tradition when we are in town visiting family. 3
Love it, Guinness on tap and proper pour. Good atmosphere and friendly service.  I would recommend this for any Guinness lover. 4
We ate there for the first time last week on the recommendation from a friend. It was happy hour which has some decent prices on beer, mixed drinks, and appetizers (there weren't any special prices for wine). However, I was disappointed with the beer selection, both for happy hour and the beer not on happy hour prices. There was no amber-style beer on the menu. I had to settle for a pale ale. Also, there weren't any local beer/Arizona beer selections such as San Tan (located a couple miles north) or Four Peaks. I was disappointed that a local restaurant is not supporting local breweries. They do, however, offer a dessert popsicle from a Chandler company. We didn't have dessert so I don't know if the popsicle is any good.I've seen the mixed reviews about this restaurant's food so maybe it depends on who is in the kitchen that day. We had a good food experience and the service was adequate until the end when she was chatting at the bar and ignored us. I had the pulled pork sandwich (not dry), my boyfriend had the brisket (not dry or fatty), and our friends had the quesadilla which they loved. We also had fried pickles for an appetizer (happy hour price) and they were very tasty with the BBQ aioli. Three things would make me change my three stars to four stars:1. put local amber beer on the menu2. place TVs so everyone in the bar can see the game (my back was to the screen)3. fill up my water glass when it's empty; I was glad I left water in the car because once we paid our bill the server never made contact and I was parchedI will be back next month in December with my girlfriends. I hope they improve the beer list! 3
After returning from Hawaii, my husband is seeking out Loco Moco, which Mokis has on the menu.  However, this version was not exactly like Slappy Cakes on Maui, which, according to hubby, is to die for!  What he was most disappointed with was that the eggs were WAY over cooked.  He was hoping for the runny yokes. I ordered the combo plate and the pork and chicken were VERY good!  We may go back for that and for Mokisadas!. :) 3
Decided to check this place out, very quiet  on a Fri night.  Beer was cold, bartender friendly and kept busy cleaning and not being noisy lol. Will deffentry be back.  Thanks 4
I went here once as my friends and I tried to go to Buff Nails around the corner, but they had no openings.  The lady that runs this shops was so nice to us, although her English was not the greatest as mentioned in the other review.The spa was clean although not the most modern interior - I can see how this would turn discerning customers away.  We went with it though, and the quality of our pedicures were great and decently priced.  My friend also had her brows waxed and they turned out great. 3
Beautiful hotel, but disappointing in many ways.  You can reserve bikes, which are part of your resort fee, but they have no bikes if you have someone in your party who is disabled.  I asked for a tandem bike and was told they did not have any, and then they would call the company they use for their bikes.  A message was left on my phone later that said "Sorry, no tandem bikes with that company."  Can we really be the first family to ask for bikes because of a disability?  At least my resort fee was refunded.  One of the poolside restaurants was advertised to be open until 5:00 pm, but when we went there at 4:45, the employees were already breaking it down and told us it was closed.  The Starbucks on site is way too SMALL for a hotel this size.  The line to place your order stretched out of the Starbucks into the hotel, and then the wait for the drinks took forever.  The employees of Starbucks were working so hard, but the space is so small for them.  I finally wised up and went to the shopping mall across the street.  Many of the activities on-site are for younger kids (under 13 yrs).  And, no, your teenage daughter cannot use the on-site beauty spa!  That is for 18 yrs and up.  Thank goodness other local spas in the area will welcome the teenage girls.  And, management, the time time for resolution is not after I come home from my vacation. 2
I have been craving Boba all week, so I finally gave in and came to Koko bakery. I definitely have had much better Boba, but this place might be the best in Cleveland. Milk tea is my favorite!! I like it iced or cold, dependent on weather. Their bakery is not bad either, but overpriced!! I would recommend this place for a sweet treat after an Asian meal in Chinatown! 3
The only star I give this place is for the atmosphere and decor. The food was completely bland and of mediocre quality. A friend and I ordered prawn linguine which tasted as though a child could have made it using boiled spaghetti and jarred marinara sauce. The prawns were of frozen store quality, and even then I've had better. Completely disappointed as the  name and price range of this restaurant lead to much higher expectations. Don't waste your money, eat somewhere else. 1
I had one of the best pedicure/manicure's ever with KAY...she listened, took her time and executed flawlessly!  I even bought a gift certificate for my friend who lives locally...this place is excellent... 5
Best burgers in town. Great place to watch a game. Tvs are well positioned. Don't forget about breakfast. Best deal around. 5
Flown in twice now.  The traffic pattern system for incoming and outgoing jets is a nightmare!  Access to outer runways is practically through the center of the inner runway, so each jet has to wait until runway is clear before crossing.  Even worst, whomever is managing tarmac coordination on Sundays and Wednesdays sucks! Be prepared to be sitting on the tarmac for minimum 45min after gate pushback before plane takes off.I've gotten out of ORD and PHL lot faster than this airport. 2
A very solid joint and not a slap in the face to Greek food. I was really impressed with the size and diversity of the menu for such a small kitchen. Lots of hands working quickly allow for the food to come out hot and fresh. I really wanted to give this place a perfect score but I don't eat there often enough to call it a slam dunk. The reason for this is that I can't afford to. A lunch special which includes gyro meat, rice, and salad shouldn't cost over $10. Great place and I'd highly recommend it, but you'll only have a chance of seeing me about twice a month. Sorry to all my fans. 4
Granted this company is cheap but they are cheap for a reason. So first I get a gray Nissan Sentra I think it was and I was very unimpressed by the condition of the car. Then I'm driving on the highway and the car damn near stalls out on me and could have gotten me killed! I was close to the rental office so I took it back and demanded that I get a different car and be compensated for my troubles. I got a different car but instead of the company trying to make up for it and put me in something nicer they give me a car that had ink stains everywhere! As far as compensation goes the manger told me they would have to get it checked out as if I was making it up and after a few hours how did I know that they would call back and say nothing was wrong with the car?! Overall, I didn't like the whole rental experience from this company and never get in a gray Nissan! It might save your life! 2
Have been here for dinner once in the past week. Service was attentive, and the food good. Margarita was ok. Will most likely visit again. 3
I was visiting from Colorado for a business conference.  I had a break in the afternoon from meetings so called the Downtown Salon Phoenix to get a manicure and my nails filled.  The receptionist was really nice and got me right in.  It was so convenient to the Convention Center and the Hyatt.  Freida did an amazing job fixing my nails and was so nice and proffessional.  I will stop here any time in Phoenix to pamper myself at this fabulous salon. 5
Was in Lav Vegas on Christmas Vacation, Car broke in parking lot, fluid leaking non stop, no one to find due to Holidays. One mobile repair guy told me $500 just labor ! Spend one night in Vegas and took vehicle in Morning, $183 out the door within hour and half ! Don't look around this is the place to take your car to get it repaired specially if you are coming out of town. Very responsive, reasonable price, reasonable timing. Will recommend others. Quan the mechanic! 5
Wanted to like this more, but was not impressed. Tried pepperoni and a plain Sicilian. Line was long of course, and was hopeful due to the reviews. Very similar to Town Pizza in Highland Park LA. 3
Wonderful and big menu. Had the chorizo, lamb meatballs, potatoes, baby back ribs. Also the gazpacho was fantastic. Nice wine list and good bartender. Definite recommend. 4
I worked around the block from Beauty's, so everyday I see the lineups piling out the door.  Had lunch there a few times and everything they do, they do very well.  Still, I find it puzzling there is consistently THAT many people looking to get in.  I guess it's kind of like Schwartz's - less about the food (which is good but not life-changing) and more about the institution of it all. 4
Tasty N Healthy is a tasty, healthy, quick, clean, authentic, inexpensive, humble, and friendly option in an area otherwise dominated by pre-processed fast food chains. If you are hungry in Penn Hills and want to feel good after eating, try to find them. Located in a nondescript storefront in the Penn Hills Shopping Plaza, Tasty N Healthy is a tremendous discovery. Look for the picture of a gyro in the window. Who thought that authentic Mediterranean food could be obtained in this neck of the woods?The menu is rather slender. When they first opened, you could buy the entire menu for about $40. They have since expanded to offer daily meals. I have not yet delved into the daily meals (pre-ordering is required), but everything else is so solid that I can only assume that they are tasty, though I promise to investigate. The tabbouli, fatoosh, and Greek salads are great. Thoughts of the falafel sandwich and chicken shawarma trigger Pavlovian response as I write. The weakest link in their menu is probably the gyro. It's good, but not nearly as good as everything else.Warning: It's take-out only. There are no tables. It is a real Syrian mom's super-clean kitchen disguised as a tiny storefront. Take it, go, and enjoy. Tasty N Healthy also does catering. 4
This is an absolutely terrific place to get a drink. And be sure to get one of those fancy Slim Jims at the bar! 5
You never know with this place. Today it was, "We're out of that right now." I mean, they only have two type of house coffee and one is out. The pumpkin chocolate chip cake was oily, yeah, oily and with the light coffee I settled for, it was all half and half nutmeg taste in my mouth.Oh and its also one of those places, people with no wi-fi sit around at ;) 2
Needed carpet cleaning ASAP and A One saved the day! They sent out Fredy and his helper and they came out the same day I called and were able to clean up the dirty, dirty carpets and my rugs - they look and smell so fresh and clean! Thank you Fredy and thank you A One! I will be calling again! 5
Food was amazing but the service was horrible! I would suggest to take out don't dine in. I ordered the eggs Benedict, instead of Canadian bacon, they put crispy bacon on it served it with hash browns and a salad with a balsamic vinegarette. The two girl working there were so unprofessional from their interaction to the attire. 2
I saw Smokey Joes Cafe last year during the summer and it was ok. I like Pease Auditorium so much better. Pease is way more intimate and I feel connected with the performance.Just my 2 cents 2
Fantastic! I found Dr. Ramsey again! He was recommended to us when we moved to Gilbert 2 years ago. He now has his own practice at Higley and Chandler Heights. It is so great to have a Dentist and support staff that clearly care about the patient's best interest. They create a very comfortable environment. I just had my checkup and cleaning and I am very satisfied. I highly recommend Ramsey Family Dentistry! 5
The ambience at Fork is nice however, when I asked what the vegetarian options are, I was told by the server my only option is to order ala carte sides. I ordered a salad, portobellos and risotto. The salad (beets and arugula) was delivered first. It was good. The portobellos and risotto were my main. The portobellos were served on a little 2x2" square plate, which made it fairly difficult to eat, and the risotto in a separate side bowl. The risotto was very good but it was a pieced together, incomplete meal and I felt like the restaurant did nothing to accommodate to my fairly mainstreamed diet.  I was very excited to dine at Fork but left incredibly annoyed.  Most restaurants offer at least 1 vegetarian entree and I would have expected that at Fork, or simply a more accommodating approach, especially at their price point. 3
Wish I could rate them higher. Did a consultation with them. Liked what they presented. Price a bit higher than others but not too bad. Hired them to shape up front of house by transplanting some bushes and planting a whole new garden. A couple of days after the job was completed, all the transplanted bushes died. Told us it was due to shock. Other companies I have talked to since said maybe one or two is possible but not all at the same time. Now a few of the new ones are not doing well. Company called. Replacing new ones but lost the replanted. 3
We went here for the first time on New Year's Day for a quick dinner and it was delicious! Amazing customer service and perfect food that hit the spot, especially for a vegetarian! Great portion sizes and simple, easy atmosphere. Will be back for sure. 5
Went to Luke Wholey's with my wife and adult son for lunch on Sat 10/11. Not impressed as there were multiple problems. My wife got a glass of sovenion blanc that was only tap water cold. her. Rather than serving the two soups immediately, the soups were served with lunch and the one was only Luke warm. My wife's French fries and crab cake sandwich were barely warm and it took us well over a half hour to be served. We were expecting much more. The buns were delicious though! 2
Yummy Filipino food. Since I don't know how to cook that many Filipino dishes, Fiesta Filipino is the place to go. It's not quite like home cooking but close enough. I just love their Crispy Pata, probably one of my favorite dishes they make. I have been here a few times and finally got to try their Kare-Kare, it was just okay they over cooked the beef because it was dry and tasted a little burnt. 3
I have shopped here a few times and always find a gem tucked away in the racks. Designer jeans are my weakness and getting them here at a fraction of the price is wonderful. The 3 stars are for the selling aspect though. Now both my boyfriend and I have attempted to sell/trade clothes here and it did not go as expected. My boyfriend had zero luck and his clothes were today's styles and barely worn. My clothes were all barely worn, most of them still had tags on them. But from a large bag only 2 tank tops were taken. Both never worn and with tags on. They were from h&m and angl. Nice ish stores in my opinion. For the two items I had the choice of 6 dollars cash or eleven dollars store credit. Obviously I chose the credit. I even asked the buyer what clothes they were looking for and she said trendy styles you'd see in the mall today and for this season. Now if you walk around this store you'll understand my confusion because to me 89% of the clothes here I have not seen in any mall recently. This store is very eclectic but focuses more on the "hippy" style in my opinion. Overall it's fun to shop for the buried treasures here but don't count on selling your clothes. 3
I used to come here religiously! The food is amazing and the service is somewhat good. They could work on being more welcoming. They mostly serve Caribbean food or hakka food rather than Chinese. 3
Very Delicious! Very Creative! The Chef makes sushi into art!!! The staff is friendly. Very clean looking. 5
One of my go to Korean Food Restaurants downtown! I'm never disappointed when I go there, and the food always hits the spot. 5
Another extremely good Gun Shop! I have been here several times when I am in the Phoenix area. These Folks really have their Sh*t together. Especially since I hail from the Peoples Republic of California. They are very willing to work with you so that you can legally get a fire arm back to the Motherland.  They also have a huge and very reasonably priced inventory to boot. Time spent here usually is very well spent! Major Kudos to all hands involved! 5
service is okay. But the food is horrible. Got the chicken club sandwich and it was absolutely bad. Chicken was cold. Ordered mushroom burger and it was very bad too. Ordered almond granola with yogurt, it was eh.. Ordered spinach dip and it was okay. Overall, this place is a must skip. 2
Maybe this was just an isolated incident, but for my wife to say she absolutely hated a breakfast experience is something that I've probably never heard from her mouth. The server was completely absent the entire meal - no check-in, no coffee refill, nothing. The food was bland. One of the poached eggs on the benedict was cooked through, the other barely runny. Didn't matter too much though since the meal was only luke-warm by the time it made it to the table anyway.The owner came over and asked how things were and my wife said "disappointing," then she left and never came back. A bit later a manager came back to say it was our fault for not complaining while we were eating. Would have been an option had the server ever stopped by. Never. Again. 1
Why did they not decorate their store for Christmas? It did not seem like the Christmasseason when I was in this store.  I did not buy anything in this store  because of this.Bah Hum Bug. 2
Loved the soup.  Food is just like Yokoso at the Waterfront.  I agree with previous posters that it seemed like everyone was having a birthday!  And the loud music and disco ball were going when I arrived.  They have hibachi seating, or regular dining.  The hibachi seating was fun and energetic, so definitely not a choice for a quiet dining experience. 3
I almost feel bad giving Dean's such a bad review because they try to be a nice salon, but it just isn't.  They're great with coupons; you'll almost never pay full price for a haircut.  This explains why I got my haircut there so many times.  Each visit was more bizarre than the time before.  The last time that I went to Dean's, two of the stylists lectured me on the 'bad' product that I used on my hair (a bumble and bumble product...).  Overall, my haircuts were never good.  Mehh at best.  I've been to three different stylists there and only one of them spoke to me while cutting my hair.  That can be an awkward hour long hair cut... And the salon is dirty.  Maybe my standards are too high, but if I'm getting my eyebrows waxed, I believe that the hair should be wiped off of the chair.  Or that there shouldn't be noticeable dust bunnies all over the salon.  There are just so many better salons in Pittsburgh (MCN), please don't waste your money here. 1
No one is friendly, including the owner. Service is slow. Food is very plain, bland. Food was mediocre. Even the toast was mediocre. Our waitress was pretty good. The cinnamon roll was good. My husband liked his omelette. It is very loud. 3
I was excited about a potentially new taco spot, but HG was just ok in my opinion. The food was a bit bland, the salsa watery, and the chips slightly stale. I was happy about the margarita happy hour special, but that might be the only thing that draws me back... 3
The food is usually good. I love the hamburgers, the back bacon on a bun is good too. The only issue I have is they bring out the food one plate at a time. One time they totally forgot my 3 year olds food all together. We weren't impressed. Service isn't the greatest, but the food usually makes up for it. 3
Ajo Al's is the best. The food is great every time, and the environment is super cozy. The staff is really friendly and the service is fast. Last week I picked up a catering order and they carried it out to my car for me, helped me load it, and were super friendly and nice during the whole process.When you stop in, I recommend the chicken tacos morongo and a margarita :) 5
Cute little place and even better food! This location was formerly The Spot restaurant. I'm so glad Ta Lew moved into this place. I always get the Pad See Ew with chicken, it's my favorite! They will make it as spicy as you want. So delicious! Try them out. 5
OVER RATED & OVER PRICED...The baked goods are awesome!!  They should Stop making SANDWICHES....because they are not good at all...& it's a shame to all the Deli's around who know's how to make sandwiches.  Just stick to your baked goods. My Reuben Panini should have been a Sauerkraut Panini instead because there was hardly any meat....not good !! 2
Never eat here! I have eaten at a lot of Thai places in Las Vegas.after Reading the reviews and I decided i would try Lao Thai kitchen. Me and my wife ordered what we always order to go. The food was an abomination. I have never ate anything so putrid in my life. We ordered four or 5 different items and they were all terrible. I recommend any thai place other then this one. Im considering having the food sent out for testing it was such questionable meat. I had chicken, she had duck( we think) 1
The place is extremely small so, good luck finding a seat. We lucked out because I got there right at 3 for "Fika."We decided to have lunch and I had the bean soup w chive crepes and she had pork chop+salad. It was "o.k." Not spectacular but not bad.With this said, the coffee+dessert was exceptional! I had the cheesecake and loved it!The waitress was friendly but the owner less friendly. She sounded annoyed when I asked her a couple of questions. Maybe she was having a bad day but I wouldn't be keen to return. 3
Better Concepts by Aleta is the best hair replacement, hair piece specialist that I have ever had. Aleta takes the time to ensure the hair is properly cut and styled when I get a hair service. I leave lookin good! 5
Best seafood buffet I ever have in vegas. Not too many people around 6 pm. Better than Caesar Palace in my opinion. 5
We stopped by here to get dinner before watching a movie at the Cineplex across the road. I'm going to cut right to it: the food was terrible. My $20 fish tacos were fishy and had plasticky tortillas, and my salad was limp, over-dressed and warm. My friend's poutine was cold and had some seriously over-browned fries. We are a hungry crew, and none of us finished our dinners. About the only edible thing was the pretzels and beer cheese dip.I've been to the other two locations (10th and 17th), and the interior of this place looks much like a copy of the National on 17th. The beer list is different, but the prices are the same - $8.50 for most pints. Unlike 17th, you can't do any people-watching out the window, but there is ample parking. 2
It's good but I still like Mike and Tony in the southside. A bit pricy. 3
New Horizons Medspa- is the only place in town - that has professional staff- helpful crew- as well as a nice CLEAN facility.  Thanks - I recommend them all the time. 5
If you are looking for a good place to try various Japanese dishes that are not too westernized or improperly prepared Nami is THE place to go...Nami offers good ambiance with western style seating for the rookies or the contemporary version of the Japanese seating on the floor with the cheat hole underneath for a comfy tour du Japon....But what is most notable in this Korean owned but Japanese staff'ed pearl is that it offers quite a fresh variety of Japanese originals  such as :TRADITIONAL and exquisitely fresh sushi and sashimi ferried by their famous love boats....Moist and perfectly grilled assortment of seafood (more on this)THE BEST nabe yake featuring too many to count seafood types in this soul comforting broth with udon noodlesAND FOR the more adventurous the Dish of the Day featuring a rotation of Japanese originals.....The best time to visit this place is lunch because they offer the Robata Special... Robata Special literally translates to food found in carts near Train Stations in Japan... This consists of a seafood (choose from the iced display showcasing fresh red snapper, mackerel, tuna, salmon, squid, etc) that is grilled to a perfection keeping the meat moist... This comes with a miso dressing salad, miso soup, rice, and undoubtedly the best udon in T.O......All for less than $20  And if you still have space left... you can venture yourself in green tea ice cream or black sesame seed ice cream..... If you do try the black sesame ice cream.... Make sure you stick your tongue out to your friends.... :-POf course the Robata special is available at dinner as well but at a premium price....Their selection of hot pots is great and their Beef Amiyaki cubed and cooked on the table are not only delicious but quite a fun experience...If you'd like to try quality Japanese food but can't make yourself to seat for a 16 hr flight... drive down to Nami... 4
I'm a little bummed, not going to lie. I made a mistake ordering bruschetta and thought I was ordering what I had seen on the online menu but it was different on the printed ones... Ended up getting chicken heart instead of cannelini... My bad. Then the bartender or kitchen mixed up my pasta order and I ended up with the special instead of the lobster and egg noddles I was so excited about. They were slammed. Service was slow. But they comped by meal and 10% which was the right way to handle it. Drinks were great. 2
Guac was made without lime and thus disappointing. Ambience was so-so. Food was okay. Eat here if it's convenient but don't make a special trip like we did. 3
Would not recommend Billy W. He is not knowledgeable, childlike, and very unprofessional. I asked his opinion on what kind of seat cover and window shade would be best for my car and he was being very sarcastic and rude. I asked him what the difference was between two different shades and he responded with " These ones are newer than your's". I left my 15-year-old granddaughter by him and he kept cussing while trying to put something back while he was in front of her. 2
The staff were friendly and the restaurant was clean, but unfortunately the food was not fresh.The appetizers had been refried a couple times. You can tell because it was dry, dowy and lost most of its flavors. The Lassi was more like a juice.I ordered the butter chicken thali.  I received lamb instead which was not a big deal but I was really there for the butter chicken. They brought back something I have never seen before, a dark red paste butter chicken. Maybe they added extra seasoning to mask the fact that the chicken was just shavings off of a chicken drumstick. The skin was even on the chicken. It was dry and hard to chew because the chicken had been cooked long ago and left in the fridge. They probably ran out of the butter chicken to begin with and thought this would suffice. We will stick with Devs from now on. 2
Absolutely will not come back here.. The service was HORRIBLE... They never came and checked up on us.. We had to be the one who demanded the waitress to come to our table... When we ask them to refill our drink, she came back with soda with no ice and she had the nerves to tell us to pour it in our own cup.. Also when the waitress brought my hot and sour soup I told the waitress to hold on I wanted to scoot my 15 month away from the hot pot and she gave me attitude.. When I confronted the manager all he can do is apologize.. But as u can see he hasn't done anything about it because everyone on here has complain about the service. I will not come back here.. SERVICE IS THE REASON I WILL NOT COME BACK!!! 1
Not happy. Watch out these people lie about return and exchange policy. Cannot be trusted!!! 3
I just heard TQLA closed today and what a tragedy! I have been a "regular" there since the restaurant opened and I just want to go on record as saying in my opinion this was a management problem! Staff members came and went, if they weren't professional, customer oriented and team players they didn't stay long! Over the years I made a lot of friends of both staff and management! Managements philosophy seem to be that there job was to give direction to staff and interact with customers to make sure the customers experience was a positive one! I think this was proven by the fact of the number of regulars you would encounter on any given night, especially Thurs, Fri, Sat and Sunday. A group of us use would come in on Sunday, for "Sunday Funday"! Recently, they went through some management and staff changes, and in my opinion some mistakes were made, while some deserving staff were promoted, seemed more like they were just given more duties! Every time I asked where the new manager was, was told they were gone. I never met any of the new management, was never engaged nor observed them engaging other customer! I know from experience that the restaurant business is the hardest business to make a go in and that this time of year is doubly difficult because it is our off-season! I suggest that the failure of this establishment has more to do with the leadership or lack of, then with anything else! I am going to seriously miss all the fine people I met both customers and staff! 3
The tech could have been a bit more communicative, but he diagnosed the cause of the malfunction quickly (10 minutes), and had the repair (two new light beam elements) installed in another 10. The hardware that I paid him $109 for is available on Amazon for one third the price, but I checked this too late. Bummer! 3
This place is great! A coworker and I stopped in for lunch this afternoon and was blown away by both the food and staff.You get a large bowl from the cashier and can personally stuff whatever meat, veggies and garnish you want. Then, mix a neat selection of sauces. Finally, watch the entertaining chefs cook your meal on a large heated stone.Everything comes out fresh, hot and delicious! Want a tip? Use the wax paper next to the chicken to "stuff" your bowl. Everything will shrink when cooked and this will allow you to have a bigger meal for the same price. 5
Horrible service. Got my car towed here with a flat tire through their Pep Boys Towing. That part went just fine. My car was dropped off at 1 on a Friday afternoon. I called Pep Boys later that afternoon to insure my car had made it there and see if they had a chance to change the tire yet. He seemed rushed and annoyed said he didn't think they would have time to look at it that same day but that he would call me back if they could. By the next morning I haven't heard anything back and I had a flat spare tire in the trunk that I wanted to take elsewhere to get repaired. So we went to Pep Boys to pick it up unfortunately Pep Boys ones not open quite yet. We decided to grab the spare tire from the car and discovered they had left the car unlocked all night. At this point the employee that was inside came out because he saw someone around the car and claims they had tried to call me but must have had the wrong phone number even though I had left my phone number the day before and they should have that info on my pep boys member account. When I went to pick up my car the gentleman at the counter was looking at some paperwork and didn't even acknowledge that I was standing there after standing there for about 2 minutes looking at him as he looked at this paperwork the phone rang and he proceeded to answer it while I stood there. Finally once he was off the phone he was able to look up and acknowledge that a customer was in his store and was standing right in front of him. He then proceeded to try to charge me $50 for towing my car across the street when it clearly states on the Pep Boys website that Pep Boy members get towing for up to 10 miles for $25 when I mentioned this to him he very casually discounted it down out without apologizing. The way he approached it, it definitely made me feel like he was trying to charge me $50 for a tow when he knew I should be charged $25  just hoping that I wouldn't realize it. Shady, horrible customer service, and leaving my car unsecured in the parking lot. Pep boys has forever lost me as a customer. 1
Sorry but the food was gross. There was a bug in my food which was no biggie... But the food was just awful. And the waitress kept joking about there being a bug in my food..... 2
Although the area isn't very nice the food is yummy. Since I like to try out different sushi spots I came across Sage Sushi, so I yelped that sucker and went even though some of the reviews were low. But hey I like trying places even though some people might not like it. Everyone has their own opinion right? As my bf and I arrived a lady greeted us and asked if we wanted to do AYCE or al la carte. I am a big AYCE fan because you get your money's worth and then some. I checked out the menu and saw some new stuff that I've never seen at some other sushi places. I came upon the creamy mermaid as an appetizer, I had no clue what was in it so I asked the waitress, who was indeed very helpful. Creamy mermaid is shrimp wrapped in wonton with cream cheese and with special sauce...umm yum!! Must try: Creamy mermaid- will blow your mind if not your outta your mind. Mussels- good, has crab baked with it. Oyster Shooter's- MmMm Tako- my favorite Screaming tuna roll- chef's special, was good but too much cucumber Tako salad- with cucumber in vinegar sauce Lychee Sorbet- chunks of lychee what can go wrong. Make sure you leave room, totally recommend trying it! Overall, my experience here was fantabulous! The service was great, the chefs and waitress was very helpful, and very clean with Japanese decorations. Also, the waitresses get to wear the cool Japanese outfit. Prices are average $25.95 AYCE dinner. But if you go the day before, the day of, or day after your bday your FREE! 4
No issues at all, got the Groupon for the mini powerboat for 90 minutes. All the staff we dealt with were very pleasant, polite, and talkative.We booked in advance, they accepted our international drivers' licenses and allowed us to pay the damage deposit with credit, debit, or cash, which is appreciated as we don't like credit cards. We then filled in a short declaration for our temporary boating licenses and watched a short video, then got our life jackets, went to the boat and off we went. The boats are OK, not amazing, but not bad. The harbour is limited to 6mph anyway and the islands are a no wake zone. We didn't have any problems with it, it worked fine and they're surprisingly comfy.All in all, a fun trip out, I'd recommend. 5
Haze has it's good and bad like every night club in Las Vegas. The good thing about Haze is that it's ridiculously big. The dance floor isn't that big but at least when you walk around your not bumping into everyone to get through the other side of the club. A plus for me is that there is more than one bathroom! Say what? Since us ladies always have to wait for a stall (I have no idea why we use the bathroom a lot). But anyway, if the one downstairs has a long line there is one upstairs, which people I think don't know about. As for the line, we didn't really have to wait because we showed up around 11 and there wasn't a long line, plus it was free for us girls (the benefits of being a lady). However, don't worry fellas because they charge like $20-$30 depending if there is any performances then they charge a grip. 4
I've used Super Shuttle several times.  They are always reliable & on time. 5
We ended up at the store on Craig and the 95. It was enormous and had everything we were looking for for our new house... and at a great price. Everything was delivered by Friday (I ordered everything Monday) and no problems. I'm almost shocked with the reviews and I'm glad I didn't read this before going in... I might not have otherwise. 5
Food was great, service requires a lot of work. Next time will just do takeout.Chinese behl is a must! 4
Prices are great, service excellent, sushi is fresh! Great concept. 5
Every Friday we go there for lunch and sometimes breakfast! The food is very good. and  the owners are wonderful people! You feel very welcome and they ALWAYS aim to please!! 4
As many have said before, the wait times are the LONGEST. I am currently waiting on a delivery, which was supposed to be delivered in 30-40minutes. My confirmation email said it would be delivered in 65 minutes. Okay fine, I'm in my pajamas at this point and I've already spent the money.25 minutes after I placed my order, I finally got a call that my order was received by the restaurant - and I could expect a driver around 8:10-8:20 .....1h 40m after my order was placed online. I said "Well, that sure took a while, but thanks I guess." And the girl quickly said thankyouhaveagreatnightbuhbye and disconnected. Poor girl, I wonder how many times a day she hears that and has to bite her tongue because her job is terrible. 2
Nice ambience in store. Very good selection. Knocked down in stars because they wouldn't honor the lower price for the same item advertised at Finish Line. Right!  I always like paying Foot Locker's inflated prices for already overpriced shoes.  Finish Line here I come. 2
Perhaps I'm a corporate sell-out, but I really prefer Jamba Juice to this place. But having said that, many of the smoothie flavors here are on par or even better than Jamba Juice. What I really like about this place is the fact that it's open 24-hours, although even in the middle of the night the wait can be ridiculously long. But I'm thankful for it being open whenever I have a hankering for a smoothie. 4
Stopped in here last week with a friend, and liked it so much I stopped in again a couple of days later. And I don't live anywhere near BFG. It's that good. The first time in I had the fried strips which were cooked perfectly. The batter was excellent and not greasy at all. The chicken inside was moist and tasty. It comes with two dipping sauces. I tried the teriyaki and the honey mustard. Both were very good. Along with the strips I had the vegetable skewers, which also were really tasty. The meal came with a small piece of garlic toast and a drink.My second time in I had the baked chicken strips which were moist and tender, and because I liked the veggie skewers so much the first time I got them again. Once again they came with Texas toast and a drink. All this for under 6 bucks.During the first visit my friend asked me how these chicken strips compared to Cane's. It had been a long time since I'd been to Cane's, so today I went there to compare. Cane's was decent, but nowhere close to as good as the chicken strips here at BFG.The service, as has been mentioned already here many times, was excellent. In fact the only complaint I have about this place is that it's so far from where I live. If they ever open one closer to me I'll be in there all the time. 5
Working with Chaz was refreshing- he makes insurance fun while in a professional manner. He is not salesy at all and you can tell he is looking out for your best interest. He also is very attentive and responsive which we all need in this busy life. Great insurance agent with many carrier options! 5
Time to knock this 4.5 star overall rating down to earth. This place is not very good. I do not have any fond memories of eating this for lunch when I lived somewhere else, like the other reviewers do. Perhaps the nostalgia is clouding judgment.It reminds me of Which-Wich in the taste and type of sandwich, but with far less options and more expensive for a smaller sandwich. The bread is ok, but not good. Another review mentioned there isn't really anything interesting about the sandwiches and I completely agree. Their signature seems to be milkshakes, but that's sort of a weird thing to have in the middle of a workday during a quick lunch. It is new, and it is packed, but the service was very good. The long line didn't take as long as I would have thought, but it still took awhile. Overall, this place is ok but not good. It's generic fast food sandwiches that are equal to the plethora of other fast food sandwich options. I would not seek it out amongst others and would much rather have a good Italian deli Uptown to service my sandwich needs. 2
Their hotel very clean n have a nice and full kitchenette.. The breakfast ladies and the day time staff are very friendly and great.The only thing that need to be improve is the evening shuttle service....front desk doesn't very helpful when you arrive late at the airport... They'll let you stand freezing in the curb saying that the shuttle is on their way.. But 40-50 mins later..still no shuttle !!Other than that... It's a great place to stay in Vegas for a long term stay 3
It's barely acceptable as a greasy spoon. It looks about an unappealing from the outside as the food does on the inside. It is very cheap and it's not like the food will make you sick so if you're stuck for breakfast and you have $5-8 to blow this could be your ticket. 2
I always come here for cases for my iPhone. The store has a big selection to choose from like iPhone cases and accessories, candy, books, toys, and more. 4
First time to this Applebee's location, it was acceptable. However, our server Ricci made all the difference, she was very friendly, attentive, and made sure all our needs were met before tending to other duties. I think I found a new Sunday Funday spot. 5
Cute ambiance, but ultimately the food fails to deliver. I was pretty hopeful when I first sat down and looked at the menu- plenty of favorites available, and I was looking forward to coming back.Sadly, the food that we ordered was pretty disappointing. The rice tasted like seasoned microwaved instant. Why you would go to the trouble of properly seasoning such bad rice is beyond me. Also, the server we got seemed unfamiliar with the menu, and the owner/manager was walking around greeting all the other tables and talking to customers- yet never approached us.. I guess he could tell we were unimpressed? Good authentic Cuban is tough to find in Charlotte, but there is definitely better than this place around (try A Piece of Havana on Tryon or even better, Carlos Cafe in Rock Hill). 2
The food here is excellent.Great prices and they're pretty generous with the amount of food. Service here isn't always the best, but that's pretty typical of Asian restaurants. 4
UPDATE: I have been eating lunch at Simple Greek almost everyday since they opened. Not only do I think the food excellent, but it's only two minutes away from where I work and is extremely convenient for me. However, I must edit my original review because I have had too many disappointing experiences the last couple of weeks. First of all, Simple Greek's hours of operation are inconsistent. The sign on the door says they are open from 11am - 9pm everyday, however this has not been my experience. I have found on at least three occasions that they were closed during posted business hours.Secondly, Simple Greek is consistently unprepared for their customers. Especially at lunchtime. I tend to go there during normal lunchtime hours, typically around 11:30 - 11:45am. Every time I visit they are always out of supplies and food! How is this possible right before lunchtime? The grilled chicken hasn't been prepared, or the gyro meat is still frozen, or there's no spicy hummus or they're out of paper towels in the often dirty restroom. They haven't had harissa since the first week they were open. And last week they were out of feta cheese for 5 days! A Greek restaurant with no feta? For 5 days?!?! Why not send someone to the supermarket?Even if they do have the food stocked and ready for their lunch rush, they are still typically unprepared in other ways. There are no clean utensils to serve the food with, the tables are dirty, or the employees are not properly informed and trained - which causes delays and takes up precious time for working people on their lunch break. Lastly, the menu is very confusing. For a new casual restaurant like this to be successful it needs to be fresh, FAST and have a clear and easy to read menu. Remember, the community around you is unfamiliar with Simple Greek so it would be wise to make it as easy as possible to read the menu and navigate the ordering process. Take a clue from Chipotle, they are the king of this kind of fast casual food, and for good reason - their menu is full of pictures and is super easy to understand and they are super fast. I've seen it too many times already, a customer walks in, looks up at the crowded and hard to read menu and just stands there looking confused. An employee then has to take 10 mins explaining how it all works, what the options are, what kind of toppings are available, what's the difference between Greek yogurt and regular yogurt, what is spanikopita, etc., while a line of hungry customers stacks up impatiently behind them. We just want to order and pay as quickly as possible so that we may sit down and enjoy the good food. The bottom line is that the food is excellent, but there are a number of disappointing downfalls at the "Not So" Simple Greek that make it difficult for me to maintain my enthusiasm. I love the concept, and the staff is nice and friendly, I just wish the restaurant was better managed and a little more true to its name - Simple. 2
Review is for the Casino Bar near the stairway to the Buffet.Sorry Lilly.  You're real cute and all, and I appreciate the offer, but I don't pay for sex. It's one of my rules.I hope you and Zoe found a willing victim, though. Everyone's gotta get paid. Just not by me.Your pal,Dave 2
Phil is a man of his word if he says he's going to do it it will get done he is an exceptional business man who cares about his community I would highly recommend him for any problems with yourheating and cooling problems 5
As others have said, most of the games here are driving games, and many of them were broken. Some of the games are just plain rip-offs as well, such as their virtual bowling simulator which has messed up sensors (throw the ball down the center and it detects it as a gutter??) or their $1.50/play Operation game which ended after 15 seconds with no warning.With all that said, there are a couple of redeeming things about the place. Some of the arcade games are fun, and you'll have a lot to try if you like racing games. They also have pool tables, though again, many of them were out of order. Look in the free local discount books for some GameWorks coupons. 2
If you want trendy atmosphere and good food and are willing to pay the extra and dress up a little for it, this is a great place. I had the green curry "Thai hot", meaning the heat level was maximum, and my wife had pad thai. The pad thai was delicious, the best i have had outside of Thailand. The green curry was just so-so - maybe i killed it by ordering it too hot - it turned out red color instead of green, and the flavors became obscured by the heat. We also shared a bowl of Tom Yum soup which was good - a little too sweet, but otherwise had a lot of good flavors in it, the simple sugar in it almost killed it though. I doubt we will be back soon. 3
This used to be my favorite ayce sushi restaurant in Vegas and I recommended it to family and friends.  It had been about a year and a half before my last visit a couple of weeks ago since I live in SoCal.  The quality of the sushi was HORRIBLE (not fresh), service was SLOW (The yakitori came after our dessert), and to top it off they overcharged us on the kid's AYCE.  It says HALF price on the menu, but I was charged more than half and when I brought it up, the manager said they've always charged that way.  I've visited multiple times before and this was the first time I had this problem.  Also, if you're not going to honor the stated price on the menu, why even bother putting HALF price??  I read there was an ownership change last year so perhaps this is the problem?  In any case there are plenty other AYCE sushi restaurants in LV and I will not be returning 1
Service was good could have been a little better but seeing as it is a new restaurant I'll let being slightly short staffed slide. I had 2 appetizers spinach artichoke dip which was delicious and chicken tenders....not so much they were very dry and the breading tasted strange. The bar tender however was very good simply from the request of fruity and delicious she was able to make quite a few mixed drinks that were both fruity and delicious. 3
This was my first time at Amp 150 with Jeff Jarrett as chef. I must say it was the same space, which I do not love because you definately feel like you are in a hotel lobby unless you are seated way in the back. Also it was the same average service. There were four of us and we tried the four course tasting menu which was a really nice variety of food for the price. Since there were four of us we each got a different dish per course, giving us the chance to try many menu items. We started with the mushroom flatbread that was not the most flavorful. We had four different salads which looked lovely but the dressings needed more seasoning. We had the golden squash soup which was lovely but also could have used a bit more seasoning, loved the homemade marshmallow on top! We had the lamb, the beef sirloin, the walu and the roasted chicken as our entree course.  The chicken was the clear winner, it was tender and delicious. Out of all our desserts the chocolate pana cotta was melt in your mouth chocolate deliciousness and the brownies were not far behind. Overall good value for all the dishes you get to try. With that many they can't all be winners. 3
Excellent vegan choices;  although they offer meat choices, they do not know how to cook meat!! We order a vegan plate and a meat plate ... Couldn't finish half the meat plate it was so bad.... Otherwise , counter service is funny and amusing. 3
There is no one to greet you at the front and no one to seat you unless you insist on being seated. This is probably due to the fact that they are absolutely understaffed with one person working the tables, front etc. Once seated we were not even served water, absolutely nothing until we asked ourselves to order. I feel bad for the one waitress who has to do everything so it is not her fault, just unbelievable they have one person doing everything. Once we ordered we did not receive drinks until we once again asked for them,  or appetizers for 30  minutes. #1 rule = food quality is irrelevant with horrible service. I really hope this place gets it together because it's in a great location and looks great as well. Honestly worst service I have ever seen. 1
If you're looking for a long wait and rude service then Fastmed will be a great fit for you, however, I recommend you go elsewhere they have a state of the art establishment with rude front office staff her name is Amber! I will never go back to this establishment. 1
I'm writing this review after about 5 meals at Seviche.  I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a deviation to the standard American fare.  I'm usually with 1 or more friends and we order a number of small plates.  It's fun to share the experience - and the beer and mixed drinks are a bonus. 4
Tried the 7 day free pass - was immediately asked to sign up for 50$/m yearly membership with 1 month free offered - hadn't even tried the gym yet.  I found golds had all the equipment I wanted, and wasn't over crowded, even at prime times - it was kind of dark, and dirty feeling though , with a lot of damaged cardio equipment - so in my opinion , overpriced for my needs and taste.  There were a lot of people there who really looked like they knew what they were doing - lots of free weights , cardio machines, weight machines, cable decks, etc - even a punching bag area and boxing area and showers and sauna - a shop with supplements and shakes too.The prices weren't posted, and when I asked beyond the first person who tried to sell me the 50$/m I was told if they aren't sales, they can't even give me guidance on typical pricing , so I felt like something fishy was going on - no one asked me if I enjoyed my trial or followed up with me after - I went back to my old gym, crowded, but bright, cheaper, and they say hi when they see me. 3
Very nice looking place. Frozen burger patties with no flavor. Fresh fries and just ok. Should have tried chicken or something more fresh. 1
Really amazing place...food is delicious and produce used was of very good quality and so fresh ...staff is so warm and welcoming ...will definitely be visiting again 5
My kids are here skating an having a good time. Yes I will give a star for being nicer place then the other on Rancho but really they don't Support the Military an give a discount when the one on Rancho does. How about a little appreciation?  For this I give the rating I do. My son spends his time serving this country an my husband saying thanks sometimes is nice but OK. 2
Dear Dunkin Donuts,When someone orders "coffee", they want "coffee." You know that pot filled with delicious hot dark brown caffeine water!? Yeah that stuff!! That's "COFFEE"!!If someone wants "iced coffee", they'll ask for it. There's no need to ask every customer if they want their coffee hot or iced. Now that we know the basics, let's work on it! Don't give your customers iced coffee when they order coffee. It's their one chance for the day and you better not screw it up, it's coffee after all, how hard can it be!?Yours Truly,The Customer with unwanted ice in his coffee! 2
The bartender is sooo nice to me every time I go in... She charges me for 2 or 3 drinks, even though I have around 7 or 8. Don't worry, I don't drive home. The wings are too greasy for me, but the sandwiches are yummy. I did order the steak that was on special, and it came out wrong. But I do NOT go there for the food. I like the tequila... 3
It's one of those hidden gems you just find while browsing around the outskirts of Chinatown. Tucked away in the same area as Q Karaoke, District One, and Icy Juicy and you'll find this joint. Not really a name or a nice sign that the normal eyes could see but it's one of those places where you'd have to stick your head in and see what this place is all about.First and foremost, this place is CASH only. Secondly, this is an asian restaurant so don't be expecting top notch 5 star service.The food.Poultry and meats are prepared in the back and hung in display out front chinese butcher shop style. One of the best roast ducks I've had in Sin City. I'm not usually a fan of roasted pork belly but I'd order it here because it's so damn good. Juicy inside and a nice crunch on the outside.This place is not your ordinary chinese restaurant as you won't find dim sum or any exotic chinese or seafood dishes here. It's more for the simple person to enjoy to get in and out quickly. Prices are reasonable as well. Great place, I will be coming back. 4
Just back from my second-ever trip to Las Vegas. We stayed at the Venetian and had only a so-so experience. We arrived to check-in at about 4:30pm, well after the 3pm check-in period. Our room was not ready; we were told housekeeping was working on it, it would be ready very soon, and would we mind getting a phone call when it was ready? We said OK, put our luggage in temp storage (a convenient touch, no? Only it cost us an extra tip to the bellman... petty to complain about perhaps, but hey, it wasn't our fault the room wasn't ready). An hour and a half later, no phone call. My fiance went to check the status and not ready, not ETA. We gave it another 15 minutes and then were back in line to complain. While in line, we experienced multiple people ignoring the lines and just walking up to the counter... on several occasions they weren't turned away by the hotel staff, who seemed to think line jumping is "OK"... the patrons waiting in lines didn't find it so... and that includes those in front of and behind us. Once at the counter we voiced our frustrations and became insistent that our room be readied immediately and that we be compensated for our troubles. Miraculously, a room "became" available and we were offered $50 dining credit (which, it turns out, was noted on our account but not actually added... we had to call back at the end of our stay to have the credit applied; we'll see if it actually happens this time). My second big issue is that they turn off the smoke ventilation system in the wee hours of the morning. I'm a nonsmoker and this is a problem for me. The smokey smell accumulates in the room during that time period (about 3 hours starting at around 3am)... it accumulates to the point that we could smell it in our bath towels. While expect to smell smoke in the casinos, I don't expect to smell it in my nonsmoking room and I CERTAINLY don't expect it to be so bad that it is in the towels and in clothes that were never out of the suitcase. While overall the room was lovely, I don't think I'd stay there again: too many other options, including at least 1 hotel right on the strip with no casino, which means no smoke. 3
I would like to say i went to the Louis Vuitton store in Scottsdale and i was very unpleasant with my experience ! The associates that work there didn't even bother greeting me when i enter the door. And usually your suppose to feel good once you enter a store and excited to answer questions but nope they weren't. I would NOT recommend going to this store. They make you feel like crap, cheap, maybe even rasicst !! I will be calling the corporated very soon ! 1
Great food great service. My wife and I had breakfast here over the weekend - coffee arrived at the table in record time and breakfast followed soon after. The portions for "the bunker" (corn beef hash) are large enough that we each had a midmorning snack later in the day.We've been in a number of times over the years and I've always been glad that we've stopped. 5
Its a good store but I Gave it a one due to the part when I was being followed around the store until I had enough and told them I'm not gonna steal and showed them I had money and they acted dumb so I walked out smh 1
This is the best place for a sit down enjoy dinner restaurant...my steak was very flavorful and cooked to perfection my wife's prime rib was perfect as well...they can expect us as regulars here...Eric the manager made sure we had a great experience and he performed above and beyond...well done everyone 5
SLOOOOOWEST Bojangles ever!!! Been stuck in the drive-thru for over 20 mins now and there's no way to back out. Save yourself the struggle and go across the street to Zaxby's if you want fast food chicken. 1
Wish I could say more about this place because I live so close! BUT of the items I've had during 2 visits: lentil soup, house salad, feta pita, hummus, baba ganoush, shawarma, tabouli, falafel...ALL MEDIOCRE. Shawarma was not authentic it was a shredded up beef steak. The dips tasted like they could a been from a can. Its inexpensive but disappointing. Prob won't go back. 2
I have not been impressed with Fitchburg Vet.  We have had our dog since he was a puppy, and we know him very well.  He has always had a sensitive stomach to food, but we knew he wasn't sick because he was acting just like himself.  We kept asking the vets about it, and they told us he was sick and needed a fecal, even though his last 2 were both negative.  I finally got the best advice from Pet Supermarket (best pet store in town in my opinion) and they told us about limited ingredient and grain free food.  within 24 hours his poop was normal again.  The vets wouldn't even listen to me, and just kept telling me he was sick.  I was really disappointed that I had to go to a pet store to get advice that the vet should have known. 2
The absolute worst and I mean worst pharmacy ever, the employees are incompetent and slow and full of excuses. 2 times now they have quoted a time that my prescription would be ready and of course it's not. This time they didn't even enter it after having it for 5 hours. 1
I love Thai food and Surang just might be the best one in Vegas!!!  I was a regular at Archi's but decided to try somewhere new and success!!!  Tucked away in a strip mall, I'd never expect this place to be so good!!  Walking in, the boyfriend and I were immediately impressed with how delicious the place smelled.  We ordered the tom yum goon (hot and sour soup with shrimp), papaya salad, Thai beef jerky, pad kapow (minced chicken and basil), and basil fried rice.  Everything came out piping hot (which I'm really picky about).  Flavor-wise, definitely at least a 9 out of 10.  Only thing is that we wished it was spicier.  We ordered an 8 spicy (out of 10) on everything but it was medium spicy at most.  At least our mouths weren't melting off.  We are Thai food frequents so we will definitely be coming back.  This actually might be our new regular, go to take out spot.  Horray to finding a new delicious, authentic Thai restaurant!! 4
Recently leased a new Porsche from Ron. Great service. Professional but relaxed. Highly recommend this dealership. 5
These guys worked their butts off. Team leader was Rob. Ricky and Brett were a part of his crew. They showed up on time, and got straight to work. Got in and out of the apt faster than I expected. Took extra care to make sure nothing gets damaged or broken. They took the beds apart and put them back together. Helped us move across town and unpack all under 4 hours. They even packed all our glass dishes. All 3 were very professional and friendly. Rob took charge and did a great job. I trust them and would recommend them to anyone. Hopefully I don't have to move again, but if I do, I know who I'm calling. THANKSThe only thing I will tell you guys, because I did not know this until after ... if you plan to pay with credit card, you will get charged a credit card fee ... not a big deal, but just a heads up. Had I known, I would've paid cash. 5
Stay away, stay away unless all you care about is price. The rooms are disgusting. The water pressure in the shower nearly took my skin off and the hotel sucks. Seriously someone puked in the elevator and they just left it...gross! It's only redeeming quality is the new section that connects to the tram that takes you too the tram and the new resort Aria. Ugh...never again. 1
It had been a while since I had Italian food so the wife and I randomly picked RigaTony's and we are damn glad we did! The interior is tastefully decorated and charming and it has a cozy atmosphere without crowding the tables together. The food starts with a sample of wine and an excellent salad and bread fresh from the oven, I had the Fettucini Alfredo with a meatball and it was just fantastic! The wife had the Fettucini Alfredo with Chicken Lemon and Artichoke which was delectable!Our service was prompt (we came at 4:30pm on a Wednesday) and our server was friendly, sociable, and helpful! Good Job RigaTony's!!! 5
Tiny and cozy, with a fantastic beer selection and good service. Space-wise it was almost too small so it was a tad uncomfortable but otherwise a great pub. 4
This place was messy and loud.  The food really wasn't great and the salsa bar looked like a three year old put it together.  Overall the only plus was the tortilla chips that were free before the food.  I will not be back unless one of my friends pays for me 1
Paid for double chocolate chip cookie dough in my blizzard. Didn't even get enough toppings to consider it a normal blizzard. Eff this place. Never will I return. I should've expected this from a DQ in the ghetto town of Coraopolis. 1
My brother and I make the trek from N Scottsdale to The Drummer almost every weekend.   Jesse makes the HOTTEST suicide grilled wings on the planet - we love 'em!  Service is great and the "regulars" are pretty friendly too.  Drink prices are good and there are plenty of TV's.  One of the better "dive bars" in the area. 5
the worst meal in montreal!!!! the french onion soup was a joke!!!!! the crepes were awful!!! do not go to this restaurant under any circumstance unless you want to throw away money and time in your life you can't get back...THE OWNER AND CHEF IS RUDE AND CAN'T COOK!!!!!!!!  i wish crepe bretonne was open next door but it closed and this JOKE OF A RESTUARANT ADVERTISES THEY ARE THE SAME!!!!!LIES,LIES AND LIES!!!!!!I HATED MY MEAL!!!!!!!!!!!!! 1
10 sec in and have been stepped on twice, nearly hit by couple chairs. People are oblivious.But, once you get your drink, sit back and enjoy the music and great weather. 3
Dinner for two. Very beautiful atmosphere. Food was delicious and service was good. I will come back. 4
I've gone to this Cafe Rio around 40-50 times since August when I moved to this side of town. This trip was by far the worst I've had. I walked in at 9:52 as they closed at 10:00. Understandable that the employees were anxious to leave, but I just wanted my free salad I earned with rewards! I walked in and there were upwards of 25 people sitting around eating and carrying on. Fairly unusual. As I approached the counter, not only could I see the employees unhappiness, but I could hear them complaining about the amount of people in the store. (I'm sure the owner wouldn't complain) Anyhow, a male employee asked me verbatim "what can I do for you?" I'm not going to go into how misjudged this approach is to customer service, so I'll leave it alone. However, when I responded with "yeah can I get a salad to go please" his first response was "well this is all the rice we have left so (he paused for a second as I stared at him) I'll just give you the rest" There was about 2 spoonfuls of rice left. As he goes to scoop he looked up to see more people walk in to order and quickly changed that 2 spoonfuls to a half scoop. Sweet dude. Then, he passed it along to a young woman employee who while she was making the salad was speaking in Spanish to another girl employee complaining about the people still in restaurant. (Hehe, I happen to speak Spanish, what are the odds right?) In the end, I will say if you go here I guess don't go after 9:30 because apparently you'll get upset employees who of course didn't sign up for the 2-10 shift or you'll get half a scoop of rice from a male employee who clearly isn't in it for repeat business. Also, she forgot the lime. And if you have had the salad you know that the lime is a delightful touch that really makes the salad a "salad." 2
Burgers were alright, definitely would go back again, the fat elvis milkshake is definitely something to write home about though!  Peanut butter, banana and real bacon, may not sound that appealing but just works and is so good! 3
Such a cute trendy brunch place. I had the Bangkok Bloody Mary and my friend had the Cosmonaut. Both were good drinks. The Breakfast Pot Pie with sunny side up eggs was amazing! The crust is flaky and breaks off to perfection. My friend had the Bella Bella Benny, (one of the eggs benedict versions) with prosciutto and perfectly poached eggs and arugula. We also tried the Flight of Pancakes, with the chocolate chip, cinnamon swirl and upside down pineapple.  Everything was delish! 4
The casino is very dark. You feel claustrophobic. Also the smell of cigarette smoke is horrible. Especially compared to other hotels on the Las Vegas strip such as Wynn and Encore. The lines at the bell desk and check out desk were very long. By the pool the service was subpar. We had to wait a long time and we were ignored many times just to get drinks. Some parts of the hotel are pretty indeed and it's nice to see maybe with a walk-through. We will likely not be staying here again. 2
Wish there was a closer location or at least more then one location . :P Staff are awesome . Quick & friendly . 5
Tonight was my first time at this Olive Garden. My boyfriend and I just moved here from out of state. I've been craving Olive Garden for some time so we thought we'd go out tonight for a date night since I'm leaving for a week early tomorrow morning. We moved from a small town and I didn't think about how busy it would be since it was Saturday night. We got there and the wait was about 45 mins. It was almost an hour before we got seated. We were seated in the same section with a large party. Our waiter was Tim. He came over and got our order. He was less than friendly. My boyfriend had a big lunch so he just ordered soup and I made my own pasta. I asked if I could get half Alfredo and half marinara. He said "oooh I don't know. I'll have to check." I knew they were busy so I said if not I'll just take all marinara. We pulled up the bill on the screen at the table and he added a $1.79 charge to split the sauce. I don't understand why because I wasn't asking for extra, I just wanted half and half. He didn't tell me that it would be extra. Later on, I heard the large group next to us ask if they could switch something out and he said that it would be an upcharge. Not sure why he didn't want to tell me that. The next time he came back, he dropped off our drinks, my salad and my bf's soup. He never asked if my bed wanted his soup at a specific time, just brought it with my salad. I asked if he could change my pasta to just marinara and he said he didn't think so. He left and came back about 2 mins later with my pasta and said they had already made it. I hadn't even been able to take a bite of my salad yet. I had just enough time to put it on my plate. It felt like he was trying to rush us out of the restaurant. The salad was also DRENCHED in dressing. It was more like a little lettuce with my dressing or soup. From the time we sat down to the time we got ALL of our food it was 13 mins. I've never felt so rushed. I was so irritated. He brought out some more bread sticks and another bowl of soup for my bf.  Then he came over and put the receipt on the table and didn't say anything. I put money on it and he asked if we needed change. We said yes. When he brought the change back he threw it down on the table without chocolates. He probably realized that he wasn't getting a tip and for the first time might have realized that we weren't happy, yet he didn't say anything. As we were walking out, I asked at the hostess stand if they don't give out chocolates anymore. They said no we do, why? I said our waiter didn't give us any but it could have been because he was terrible. The manager over heard me and inquired about what happened. I explained all of the stuff above and she apologized profusely. She gave us a gift card for more than our dinner was and asked that we please come back and give them another chance. She is the only reason this is not a 1 star review. She definitely felt bad and was not happy with the way we were treated. I just wish that Tim had realized that his service was terrible. 4
I'm sure they have our pictures hanging up on the "Do Not Allow to Enter" wall of shame.  We tore up that buffet and definitely got our moneys worth or shrimp and crab legs!!!  They had a lot of good Italian and American dishes too, the desserts were lacking.  I was hoping for a rich chocolate cake or a variety of cheesecakes.  It's a buffet, no more special than any other high end casino on the strip.The lunch and dinner transition was weird and kind of a rip-off.  We got there at the end of lunch and were not allowed to enter, instead they lined up all the people like cattle and make them wait over half an hour to be able to charge us the dinner price!!!  Not COOL!!!  I recommend getting there one hour before the dinner starts to enjoy the entire buffet at lunch price 3
I have been to a KBBQ Restaurant before and understand the entire process, the host lets us know that there will be a 30-45min wait which was fine and asked for our phone number to text us to let us know when our table is ready if we choose to leave. We decided to sit inside and wait until we were called, 30 mins goes by and we notice that people that checked in AFTER us were getting tables while we sat there still waiting. Mind you there was only 2 of us which you would think it would be easier to seat rather than a big group. We decided to approach the host to let her know what is the status about our table and why is everyone else getting seated before us and she turns the iPad to us and says " I did call you guys and you never came", usually I can hold my temper but that's when I got pissed and preceded to tell her that,  "you never called us and we have been sitting inside practically right next to the host booth  and not once did we hear you call our name, you've called every other group that came AFTER and BEFORE us." All she does is she quickly grabs menus and motions us to follow her to table. She quietly says sorry under her breathe. All in all the food was good, our server Howard as he also goes by, was sweet and very helpful and helped us choose some great meats. But what really made our visit better than how it started was actually not a worker, but another customer that sat next to us, she was sweet and actually helped us out on how to cook the meats and tips and tricks. I will most likely come back again to give the service another try, but basically the hostess needs to get her act together. 3
Mine is a story of 'buyer beware.'  I have very fine eyebrow hairs and went to Julia for microblading in the hopes of having beautiful, hassle-free eyebrows.  The result is that I am emotionally distraught and aesthetically maimed with mis-matched eyebrows now because of Julia's work.I take responsibility for not doing significantly more research before deciding on someone to do my microblading, or I certainly would not have selected Julia.  She lacks close-up photos of her work, has only 3 reviews on Yelp, and not many more on her website where she can cherry-pick the best ones.  But shame on Julia for trying to convince me that her microblading on my brows looked great, and that what I was seeing in the mirror was "just a reflection" and not what my brows really looked like.  Her analysis would be laughable if it was not so flawed and deeply upsetting.I last saw Julia about a month ago for a touch-up to the original work where she promised to "even out my brows and make them perfect." She did not improve the mismatched shapes at all, but only made them darker which I did not want.  Since then I have had numerous consulting appointments with professional microbladers and have heard a consistent theme to date... that my brows are definitely mismatched with one having a high arch mid-way in the brow, while the other is relatively flat with a rounded arch at the end; additionally, I've been told the brows are over-saturated so that the individual hairs are not visible which is the whole point of microblading to achieve natural looking brows.I can only pray that my brows lighten and completely disappear over the next few years.  At that point, if they have not completely faded, I will need to resort to time-consuming and expensive saline treatments to remove Julia's work before I can have my brows properly microbladed.  In the meantime, each morning I must re-shape each brow with a brow pencil to get a closer match so that I'm not embarrassed to go out.  Needless to say, the past several months have been emotionally devastating to me and I don't know what the future holds.Julia has offered to "fix my brows" if I come in for a third appointment.  In my opinion I would be crazy to let her work on me again given the outcome of my first two visits.  The damage is done.Buyer beware. 1
Well, it's a good place to take the kids. It's not that entertaining for the adults... unless you're a big fan of penguins. It's not a very impressive zoo, the only thing that's interesting in my opinion is the recreation of the habitats of the animals. 3
I visited this spa for a fingers and toes polish change and unfortunately was not impressed. Initially I was pleased with the price (its only $20 for a polish change for both fingers and toes). I become shocked, however, when I was told that the nail technician would not be filing my nails before applying polish. I told her I had never experienced this anywhere else and asked that she please file my nails, at least a bit. She obliged but filed them very minimally. Unfortunately her polish application was also sloppy and I had to clean up the cuticle and skin around my nails myself when I got home. I do have to say, however, that the staff at the front desk were lovely. They were friendly and helpful when I called to make an appointment and just as pleasant when I called again to change my appointment time. Overall, customer service was great at this spa, however the skill level of their nail technicians (or at least the one I had) could be improved. 2
By far my favorite wing place. Don't let the strip mall exterior turn you off. This place has amazing wings at a decent price. Try the Hoisin Honey, my personal favorite! 5
Summary: Delicious New York style (super thin crust) pizza at a decent price. The Food:  Delicious Pizza. Thin Crust. Gourmet toppings.  FRESH mozzarella. Cheese quality is a huge determining factor when assessing good pizza; their cheese is amazingly fresh and delicious.    The Atmosphere:  Beautiful restaurant with a great water-bridged patio.  Eat outside. The Staff:  Our waiter was kind of a tool. He was friendly enough, but left stacks of dirty plates on our table, left our drinks empty for long periods of time, and relied on his fellow servers to run all of his food.  However, everyone else was quite helpful and friendly. 4
Our waitress and the burgers were great! Started with the spicy wings that were spicy but sooooo tasty. Buttons and bleu burger was delicious and the fries were a mix of regular and sweet potato all in. One yummy mound. They even included an onion ring on the top. Perfection! Give this place a try. 4
The prices are very reasonable and the service was very attentive and quick.  The layout of the restaurant is great as you can see the chefs at work and you can even sit at a bar that faces the kitchen for a front row view.  Having been to other ramen restaurants notably the one on Dundas St. E. this was is very good but not excellent.  The portion size is very reasonable and the noodles were very tasty.  We thought that they could have put more meat in the dishes but they were very tender and flavourful.  The broth is good but not as good as the restaurant on Dundas, it seemed to lack a fullness to its flavour and could have been more rich tasting. I ordered the spicy ramen that could have been hotter, I had to add more hot sauce to get the spiciness I wanted.We had the dumplings for an appetizer which were good, out only complaint was that they were cooked at such a high heat they stuck together and were very difficult to pull apart.We will go back again and try some different dishes, most likely the poutine that looked amazing. 3
I went here on a Tuesday morning about a month ago for the first time. I've passed by on the weekends and because it was always packed never stopped in. Finally it looked not too busy but it was still a little busy! Our waitress was friendly and prompt. The V12 tomato juice made in house was one of the best things I've tasted. The omelette I got was delicious, the fruit was fresh and service was very nice. I can't wait to go back for some more delicious food! 4
The food was pretty average - this is a touristy part of town and everything is pretty expensive. We sat on the front terrace - the back was really loud with the live music. We enjoyed people watching and had good service. The food was good but nothing terribly memorable. 3
Unfortunately, there is no consistancy in this salon.  One week, the brows were impecable...next they looked like my 8yr old neice waxed them.  Would visit again in a pinch but will not schedule unless I have to. 2
I really enjoy coming here food is fresh and tasty staff are nice.  Nice selection of pizzas and pastas and grilled selection.  The hamburger gusto and tuscan fries are really good so are the salads if you want light fair.  Good place for lunch. 4
Found this place with Yelp's help a few years ago while staying at the Golden Nugget. Great breakfast spot, cool atmosphere, great food. The truffle egg sandwich is amazing. If you're in the area, it's definitely worth the short walk from Freemont. 5
They upgraded the inside very nicely (a year or so ago) and it's modern and cute.The food is ok ...not the best. I ordered the steak and blue salad (supposed to have steak and blue cheese in it as the name suggests) they forgot the blue cheese. humm?Their wine is not worth it.  The bread is ok but every time i've been there - it took a loooong time for it to make it to the table.The Pasta is so/so.  The Pasta Martini is inconsistent - sometimes the sauce is too alfredo-ish and it's icky.  Can't really go wrong with the Italian Sausage Pasta and i like the Pasta Rustico (add the chicken to it! )  - but they are just typical fare. Sandwiches are pretty tasty.  I'm giving it a 3start rating because it's good but never sticks out in my mind that I want to go there again. 3
Very inventive side dishes! Persimmon kimchi is out of this world! The owner makes it herself. Awesome 5
Loved my anti aging facial with a chemical peel that greatly improved my skin with an amazing aesthetician. Too bad I was her last client ever at this location or I would return despite the ridiculous emphasis on purchasing a membership. 2
Wanted to treat the kids to ice cream. Was excited to try. Excitement didn't last. Won't be back 2
I enjoy their food and price but I will never wait longer than 20 min for it. Uncle Tetsu Food: I've had the original cheesecake, Angel hat, and honey madeleine. I find the cheesecake and angel hat to be very similar in taste, it seems like the only differences are the shape and the angel hat is ever so slightly fluffier (I guess from being crust less?). I would choose having the cheesecake instead because it's easier to slice and share. Both cakes are airy and just melt in your mouth from how silky the texture is. They hardly weigh anything so you'll hardly feel it at the tip of your fork. The flavour that sticks out most is a ricotta cheese (?) taste. It's very light so try not to drink anything cold/hot or eat something too flavorful before eating the cake or you'll find it flavour less. The madeleines are very different but still tasty - they are sweet and have a thicker cake texture. I wouldn't come here just for Madeleines though. Matcha Cafe Food: I was very eager to try the matcha soft serve since I really enjoy matcha in general. But to my disappointment, I felt the soft serve was more of a sorbet. The cone began melting before it was even handed to me. It tasted like it was made from frozen water rather than milk/cream. And the flavour was really lacking, I could hardly find the matcha flavour even after tasting it carefully. The soft serve definitely didn't go well with the flavour of the cone too. I think the cone had a more distinct flavour than the soft serve. My friend and I agreed that it wasn't worth the wait and we most likely won't be back to try it again. Service: While you line up you get the opportunity to see the staff prepare and cook all the food through the windows. The staff are friendly and quiet. Expect to wait a while for anything you order though. There is always a line no matter what the weather is like. Why only 3 stars? I like the cakes and the price is definitely on point but I don't find them that special to go out of my way to order. I'll usually only stop here if it's en route to somewhere else I have to be. And the line ups can be ridiculously long. On an average day I won't stop if I see the line is longer than 10-15min. The food isn't that amazing for me to wait more than 20min tops. Refrigerated or not? I prefer it NOT refrigerated. I find that after it gets cold, it no longer remains silky smooth. The cold makes the cake more solid and somehow loses some of its flavour as well. I'd rather leave it out for one night if I know it will be finished the next day. 3
Worst experience ever. I ordered online for delivery. The tracker went through all the phases and stated food was out for delivery, then changed to delivered yet no delivery made. I never received my order. I then attempted to call the store for information, they never answered the phone, I attempted to contact them for 30 mins. with no resolution. 1
Believe all the hype. I just had a cavity filled and my fear is injections in the mouth but I didn't even feel the shot. Also Mcadams made sure everything he did was pregnancy friendly. Great dentist! :-) 5
Uncle Betty's is a family foodie heaven: the sole Toronto provider of New York's famous Dreesen's doughnuts, a colourful ice cream and dessert bar, warm and fuzzy comfort food, and a small selection of beer and wine for the grown-ups in the crowd, all make this a popular place for parents and kids alike. Uncle Betty's has only been open for a few months, but it already seems to have garnered a dedicated following. We went to Uncle Betty's on a bustling Friday night, looking for a casual meal and easy going atmosphere; Uncle Betty's certainly provided both. Painted in bright blue and cheery orange, lots of seating inside, and a small patio off the front, we felt right at home. Several families were enjoying meals with their kids in tow As the evening wore on though, most of those families were replaced with twenty and thirty-somethings looking for a cool place to hang out.Offering sandwiches, burgers, hot dogs, salads, and many other of Uncle Betty's specialty creations, the menu is fairly extensive and varied. We ordered the roasted vegetable sandwich with a salad, and the grilled cheese sandwich, which was made with homemade mac-and-cheese and meatloaf stuffed inside. Their grilled cheese also comes in a pulled pork variety, which I am sure we will try on our next outing. Both meals were great, the vegetable sandwich was warm, the cheese was nicely melted, and the bread was crisp. The grilled cheeses sandwich was deemed as one of the "best ever," however, the portion size was on the small side for a $15 sandwich. Both of us agreed that the sandwich could be a little bigger, but overall we were impressed with the quality and creative effort put into the food. For dessert, we each tried a Dreesen's cinnamon sugar doughnut, made fresh on site, and although they were pretty tasty, I am setting my sights on the ice cream bar next time. It is far too bright and colourful to miss, with jars of candy toppings and a great selection of ice cream flavours to choose from.The service was friendly and attentive, and we had a conversation with the owner, Samara Melanson, as we were leaving. Samara and her husband recently opened the restaurant, and it's always great to meet the owner while dining out and learn about the creation of the restaurant and where some of the ideas for the food come from. She told us that chef Paul Lampa was brought over from Coquine restaurant, which explains the "gourmet" comfort food bent and the locally sourced ingredients. Most appetizers are priced from 6 - 10 dollars; entrees varied in price from about 9 - 15 dollars, and wine and beer was in the 6 - 8 range. And Uncle Betty's carries Kicking Horse coffee, which is an instant sell and a welcome find for this Toronto-transplanted Western girl. Betty's also offers what looks to be a delicious weekend brunch, with homestyle blueberry pancake and Uncle Betty's own take on eggs benny, which comes served on a doughnut.  We will definitely be back to Uncle Betty's to try some of the other great entrees on the menu, and  of course to dig into their ice cream bar. 3
Personally this subway is one of my favorite locations. Super clean, great staff, and best of all perfect sandwiches every time and if your clubbing, this location is exactly what you need being open till 3am on weekends. They also have wifi and are more than accommodating. 5
Great location with uptown within walking distance and parking for games are available and cheap. 5
Randomly showed up during their trial tasting event and the food was complementary :) The service was perfect! The food on the other hand, needs a bit of work. Since it was only a test trial, I was asked to critique the food and service on their printed menu. Thank you to the owner who invited my friend and I in to partake in the event! 5
went back for late night snacks a couple weeks ago. surprised to see empty spots on a friday night. my 2 friends and I shared a few things, including the hamachi tartare and the salmon aburi. loved the salmon. cool spot, happy to return again. 4
This is the second weekend in the row I've been here with my wife and 3 kids.  It's a different restaurant from a year ago, as all the complaints about slow service/seating no longer apply.  They had 2 hosts to seat people, a waitress that came to our table no less than 6 times and support staff to deliver and remove food.  Awesome service and friendly to boot.  The kid's menu rocks.  For $3.50, you get 2 huge pancakes and bacon or sausage, something other local restaurants would charge $5 - $6 for.  The Egg & I Omlette I ordered  was top hotel restaurant quality.  I'm a breakfast fanatic, live in the Chandler area, and my opinion is they serve up the best breakfast by far.  It's too bad the startup service in 2009 was shakey, because this is now 5 stars all the way. 5
I love this place. The five of us went there yesterday for dinner, we ordered A LOT of dishes:2 pound lobster (special, not on menu);dim sum basket (special, not on menu);mushroom salad (special, not on menu);spicy fried lotus root & Chinese celery;fried green beans;steamed sea bass;and a shrimp dish which the waiter recommended and is not on the menu yet.We were full and amazed by the taste. The food are all Chinese style but mixed with Western ingredients, to me it's very unique. It's not a cheap place to dine in, but for the taste and service, no complaint from me. 5
They are always so happy and welcoming and make it the best visit! LOVE this place, drinks and the employees! 5
If grease was a place, chicken on the way would win. Everything is greasy. It's not the best chicken but still edible. I mean for the price you pay, it's not exactly a steal.  The reason this has a whopping 2 stars is because of the service. The young adult who worked there had some sass. I mean I'm good with sass, like you do you but the lady at the counter was full on sassy. I ordered and said wait before finalizing my order  because I wanted corn fritters but I couldn't see. She rolled her eyes and and gave me a smug look. I also got a drink and she full on said " are you finally done" and rolled her eyes again. I get it I'm annoying but please make it less obvious. The food was GREASY and the fries was soggy and gross. The chicken was pretty good but not as good as other places. I must say that the corn fritter was the highlight. It was yummy and very delicious.I might come back but I think that you should try it and see it yourself because you could have a different experience but expect a greasy visit ( give me a dollar for how much I talked about it being greasy ) 2
Ok, yes, I've been on a Cleveland cupcake hunt.  Having experienced the likes of Sprinkles out in California, I only dreamed I could find such a shop here at home.  Mostly I've only tried cupcake companies where you order by the dozen and they are locally delivered.  So I was ecstatic when this place opened with a storefront.  The service was wonderful and friendly, and they were even receptive to my suggestion that they stay open later come summer evenings when Tremont diners want a post-dinner treat.The place is also super-cute.  Tiny little shop with impeccable decor.  LOVE the multi-colored sprinkles under the glass tabletop.  The cupcakes are also incredibly impressive in appearance.  Unlike most cupcakes with a spread layer of icing, these have tall towers of swirled icing.  They're also adorned with mini edible decorations (like mini cookies).I'm only disappointed in the actual taste of the cupcakes.  I tried the red velvet (always my barometer) and the cookie monster (so cute!), a chocolate with blue vanilla icing.  I wasn't impressed.  Cake was a little dry, and neither red velvet nor chocolate had much strong flavor.  They were bland.  Icing was not sweet enough for me, but for reference, I love grocery store cakes/icing.  I've got quite the sweet tooth.  So I decided these were not worth the calories.  If I can resist cake and icing, I think that's telling.  All this said, my friends enjoyed their vanilla/vanilla and cookie monster cupcakes.  So to each her own.I'm more than happy to pay $2.50 for a large scrumptious beautiful cupcake.  Unfortunately, I will have to keep searching... 3
Nothing special about this place.  Been here twice since I'm staying at the Cosmopolitan, makes for convince.  Nothing spectacular about the food but I like how they made my chicken salad blacken when I asked.  Came out pretty good.  Second time I came here, I ordered the french dip sandwitch and it was just okay.  Nothing really special about it. 3
This was by far the highlight of my trip to Toronto, and no trip here is complete without a stop here.  Go mid-week to avoid the crowds.  The views are stunning!  It's one of the worlds tallest structures, of course you have to check this out!For those with Vertigo, stay away from the glass floor. It's actually a patch of reinforced glass that you can stand on and see below you.  I thought I was invincible that day and so I walked the small patch of glass. At first I just quickly ran across it like I was walking on fire or something, then I took a deep breath and walked back out on it to experience a fleeting sense of weightlessness, then I was simply in awe. 5
The food is very good and the spicy dishes do have some heat.  Tends to somewhat pricey, for the size of the portions. 3
I love love Midge at Prova salon. She does great color and cut. And I am very picky! She is very nice and easy to talk to. I am never disappointed with this salon and excellent stylist. 5
Went to The Duchess for karaoke tonight after not being there since the summer.  Great onion rings!  However, later on in the evening, I was absolutely shocked and disgusted by a rap song the karaoke host sang.....there weren't even words for this song on the monitor,,,the guy knew it by heart, singing along with another guy.   I am by no means a prude and I appreciate a good raunchy song, but this rap song went way beyond that.....it seemed to have "Fuck" in almost every sentence and he rapped about shoving his balls in someone's face, and what he was going to do to women which basically amounted to rape. The karaoke host and his side kick were jumping up on the furniture and pumping their fists in the air while they sang, like crazed lunatics, rapping all this filth.  To top that off, they both had dirty unkempt beards that made them look like Islamic terrorists.  Then later on, as we were leaving, one of the same guys was sitting with a girl outside, by the front door, smoking what clearly was not tobacco.  I have nothing against smoking weed but if you're going to smoke weed at your place of employment, don't be so obvious by doing it right in front of your employer's business where patrons come and go and can see and smell what you're smoking.  Not a classy move at all.  If the owner could see what was going on at his place of business tonight, I don't think he would be too happy.  I think from now on, I'll go elsewhere for karaoke. 2
Just a regular breakfast spot. Nothing special or out of this world. The service was excellent though. That's y I gave it 3 stars 3
I went there because of an email I got from my credit card company Capitol One about auto financing. I thought I might just check it out to see what they could offer me because I was in the market for a new car. Clear those cookies on the internet people! They  really do use them. . I met with a man named Dave Wetzel. I needed to know where I stood exactly regarding my credit so I authorized him to pull my credit. My credit wasn't horrible but it was in the middle 680. That was ALL I had asked him to do. We test drove a used vehicle that I would've qualified for on his lot. I told him I wanted to shop around and would get back to him. The man should've been named Weasel because he tried to get me approved for that vehicle through the bank the same day multiple times even though I didn't want it. I kept the text message of our conversation where I expressed my dissatisfaction with the way he conducted business. He said because I signed the credit authorization he didn't do anything illegal. Well maybe not, but he definitely isn't making sales with such unethical practices. I was able to get a brand new car at Toyota and I didn't have to sell my soul for a lower interest rate. These financing programs are predatory on people who are not educated about the way credit works. All and all, Mr. Wetzel is just a grievous symptom of a larger systematic problem. Making the poor poorer. 1
I asked for gel and they put acrylic on. Nails were not cleanly done, misshapen and uneven. 2
No sound allowed on prelims of UFC fights - before 8:00 pm. Owner's orders. Food is decent though. 3
Good food, nice patio, but terrible service. I waited 2 hours for 2 tacos. Unreasonable. I hope to never be back. 2
The pulled pork was good, the sweet and spicy sauce was good, the mac and cheese was insane! 4
Food is OK at this locale. Management is awful. Cleanliness just as bad. I have been here a few times, and it looks like a high school cafeteria. 2
If only I could write out the sound Homer makes for donuts.... absolutely everything I have had from this company has knocked my socks off!  Being gluten free now my choices are more limited but that's OK I am still a happy customer.  Most other choices out there just don't do it for me.  Having been everything from raw foodist to vegan for 12 years and now omnivore with gluten limitations I have tried every thing there is to try.  Way to go SFRT! 5
Poor service, and below average food.  The hostess was nice enough as she seated us, but the girl that waited on us did not smile once, and was very unpleasant. The chicken katsu was dry and overcooked.  The teriyaki chicken was cold, and jelly like, as if it was made an hour prior to us ordering it.  I think it's pretty difficult to screw up teriyaki chicken, but they somehow managed.  Very disappointing, especially given their high prices.  Sushi Tomo a few miles down the road on McKnight was considerably better, and a bit less expensive too.Unfortunately, I cannot comment on the sushi here, but I don't think I will be back to try it anytime soon. 2
Eating is a subjective experience. One person's orgasmic-gourmandic experience may be another's mediocre meal. Tastes vary greatly and it all boils down to that meal at that moment in that place.That being said, if you don't find Lulu to be absolutely amazing then there is something horribly wrong with you. We went on the friday after Thanksgiving and Charlotte must have been still under the effects of post-gobbler tryptophan malaise because when we arrived we were one of three tables, a scenario which I understand to be atypical. We were greeted warmly and seated by a window which framed a vignette of Central Ave at night. Wine was poured, conversation ensued and then the food was plunked down in front of us. My wife had the eggplant lasagna and I opted, in spite of the "you are what you eat" connotations, for the Chowdahead. My wife's dish was excellent, smoky and perfectly balanced taste and texturally. My Chowdahead, well let's just say the only superlative that could come close to describing it is "wicked awesome." For those of you not from New England, that means phenomenal. A fillet of salmon, which was perfectly cooked, lay atop a bed of the most wonderful chowder I've had south of the Mason-Dixon line. That evening was one of the first nights with a winter chill in the air this season and these two entrees fit the weather perfectly. Hot, rich, perfectly seasoned and filling. Our waitress was great, the service excellent. It was comfort food with class, served in a warm atmosphere coupled with good wines and great service. It was, absolutely, the best meal I've had in Charlotte in years. And I hear they do brunch as well. 5
When we first arrived here, I thought this place would be a 5 star experience. Their bacon board and apple pie moonshine is out of this world.After we had the bacon board, my husband and I took our server's suggestion and ordered their short ribs, which our server said were phenomenal. The short ribs come with fried coleslaw and we asked the server if we could sub asparagus and not get the fried coleslaw. So, the short ribs and asparagus come out. The short ribs were tough, small, and didn't have much flavor.Then, when our bill came we were charged the full amount of the short ribs and coleslaw, and an additional $4 for our asparagus, which clearly shows that it's $4 on it's own. So, why did we have to pay full price to sub them and then not get a side that was supposed to come with our meal? So, we basically paid full price to not receive a side, and paid an extra four dollars for asparagus that would have been $4 regardless if it was subbed or not. We also experienced some issues splitting our bill and my husband and I were charged $30 more than we were supposed to be, even after telling our server that some of the items on our receipt weren't ours before she swiped our card. We were still overcharged and had to cancel one tab, but still be recharged for the other.This place started out a wonderful experience but it seemed to get worse and worse as the night when on.I will definitely go back, but only for the bacon board and moonshine, not the entrees. 3
Went to Blue Hound a couple of nights ago for the first time with friends.  The hotel and restaurant had a cool and hip atmosphere.  We were seated promptly at our reservation time and the place was not crowded.  Our server was pleasant and knowledgeable and recommended several things on the menu including the special which was soft shell crab over an artichoke coulis with fiddlehead fern.  I ordered the special (and a shot of gazpacho) and the others at the table ordered a flatbread pizza and tater tots (yum!), the salmon, and the chicken.  When the salmon came out, it was such a tiny portion and my friend commented on it.  I had an option of ordering one or two crabs with my dinner and I opted for one after asking our server if it would be plenty of food.  I should have ordered two.  The food at Blue Hound is creative, ubber fresh, and delicious.  However, we all left still feeling hungry due to the small portion sizes.  We talked about ordering more food but the items are quite pricey and our bill was already over $100 without tip (only two of us had an alcoholic drink).  We eat out frequently at all of the new hip and trendy places that are opening all over Phoenix and feel that with all the other restaurants who are now offering creative farm to table food at  lower prices and larger (yet reasonably sized) portions, Blue Hound has some adjusting to do.  It would be a tough sell to get me to go back unless I knew our bellies would be full and our bill not so high. 3
I have to say, I really liked this place. It's a convenient location on the strip. It's not too bad on the price front. It's connected to the tram system. The room was a good a decent size; there were four of us in a 2 queen bed room. It didn't have an amazing view, but it was decent. The food court was standard; I appreciate that they had Subway as a choice rather than just things like McDonalds. There were other places to eat in the hotel, but I didn't get to try those out. There are a few bars as well, not a surprise there, but I did have my own personal favorite one, the Ignite Lounge. It was favorite because there were awesome bartenders that got to know me and always had awesome drinks. I would just say, "Make me something strong and fruity," my standard order, and they would come back with something new and yummy. And they got to know me and my friend and would look out for us.  Also, I have to say, I enjoyed their pool scene as well. It's not a pool party that one can get at places like Wet, EBC or Rehab. But it's not bad; it's chill and there's still a good mix of people there. 4
BED BUGSLiar liar liar !!!!!!!!I was checked out of the hotel when I called so how could I refuse entry.I can still tell you where spider webs are In the room that I guarantee you missed.What about the food and how bad my service was.  I walked out the first night and complained to zac at the front said well let me send you to a restaurant that you will get treated correctly...I thought I would give Zuzu a second chance. Mainly because i was hungry and did not want to drive.  So that day i spoke to a hostess and sat on the patio not bar like before where I got no service as staff walked past and hung out chatting with the girls  at the coctail service station about the night before.The service was decent but here it the review of the food:The chicken matchsticks were burnt over cooked and dry And looked like the oil had not been changed in weeks.  The beef stroganoff pasta was soft meaning over cooked and the sauce was watery and flavorless and technically the beef was the wrong type for a stroganoff. I can keep going on about bad things at the hotel but I think enough said!What a punk you are also as if you have all my info why did you or someone not call me back after I hung up the first time.  Then you see my review and lie and still don't call me back.Where is any customer service!!!You have my number on file and I left it on the assistant to the gm voice mail as no one was in the office to answer my call on a Thursday at 4pm.  What type of operation are you people running or should i say not running.If you had done your job correctly and called me and tried to correct and explain your side then maybe I would have changed my opinion of the hotel and altered my previous comments to reflect a more positive customer experience.  Instead you don't call and lie to try and defend my comments and make me stand by my previous statements of I WILL NEVER STAY AT OR RECOMMEND ANY PROPERTY RUN BY YOUR GROUP AND WILL INFORM ALL TRAVELERS OF MY EXPERIENCE THERE! 1
Maybe we caught them on a bad day when the stove and microwaves weren't working. Ice cold food. I must give 2 thumbs down unless I can borrow yours. Let me single out the gravy on the brick meatloaf as looking like a gloppy congealed massive wobbling blob. Disgusting. The server was very apologetic of the fiasco and we understood her embarrassment.I'm summoning Gordon Ramsey on their behalf!! They should seriously be ashamed of themselves for attempting to serve this cold mess. We walked out after the quick taste and we will never, ever, ever go back. 1
I was greeted by a very friendly and helpful staff. She was wide eyed and chirpy! I came in here looking for Clinique Super Lip Balm treatment cream however, they were sold out. She was kind enough to let me know that just around the corner is the Clinique store itself and I can probably find what I'm looking for out there. Thank goodness so I don't have to hike over to the Fashion Show Mall. Every step you save walking in Vegas is a big deal! 4
Better than some in the area, but still lacking in a few ways. Crab rangoons are always burnt and delivery takes way too long (only 1 driver). 3
Got my nails done on Friday and by Monday they were chipped. Pedicure lasted less than 2 weeks. The #4 pedicure is wonderful but not enough to keep me coming back. 2
Loved the food had the Plato tipico, gives you a little of everything. To drink I had an ensalada it's a must try yummy. Definitely recommend. Very busy had to wait a while to be waited on. Other then that it's was great. 4
In short, service was excellent. Chowder was good not great. I had the flounder and it was fresh and good. Portions were big, fries crisp and Cole slaw so so. I don't do hushpuppies but my wife said that they may be the best she ever had. So I tried one, ended up eating the 3 she left me. Dessert case looked amazing but who has room with portions like this. Wife had the tuna salad and enjoyed it. So, after all that food with 2 iced teas the bill was under 20 bucks. Can't beat that. 4
Went to lebowskis for Dyngus Day for some polish beer ,cabbage ,polish sausage and pierogies . Okay so this is what I got a piece of toast, tasteless cabbage , bratwurst and some factory processed pierogies. Awful it is very sad to say that the owner is a buffalo native related to this dish.On another note  The service was good 1
i was so excited about going for dinner here after reading these reviews.  I was so disappointed about service and food (edge of tuna was kind of green and it doesn't look fresh and smells fishy), I never going back there again. 1
I popped in here for lunch and the food was tasty and the service was very good. I ordered the Pacific Halibut "Hot Dog" and it was a different take on the concept. If you are expecting a traditional type of hot dog then this isn't for you but if you want to try something different, I don't think you'll be disappointed. 4
The payouts are pretty shitty, its like they are trying to pay off the remodle with tight slots. The food is over priced and its seems like 1/2 the people in there are just begging the other 1/2 for money. The comps are also really bad but are getting better. 2
Went here with my boyfriend for the popular Taco Tuesday, and we both were disappointed. The environment was nice and relaxing. However, the workers were very distracted & the food wasn't very appetizing. 2
Worst Ever! Do they even want customers?? They charged me $140 for "Premium Seats" im in the 20sumthing row and middle seat of 3?? The charges didnt even show until they sent me my final flight plans...once it was too late to change without, surprise, another fee! I didnt even pick that and would never pay extra to sit in the middle...theres a reason those are the LAST seats to fill up everytime. Ive been trying to call and get ahold of them to make the changes for over 8hrs now and all I get is a automated attendant who after 5-6menus tells me nobody is available to help and to call back later, then it hangs up on me. Ive never had this issue with any other airlines! 1
Randomly chose this in a pinch. The service was ok, the restaurant had a lot of workers, but the water took a while. The food was fast, tasted good. The bread was ice cold, I thought it was just one piece and then I tried another and all were ice cold. Would not try again. Experience was meh. 3
Interior looks like an old outdated coffee shop. The waitress/owner/cook/dishwasher said very little to my wife and I. She appeared to be angry that we were there.. (go figure) This was a Saturday night around 5:30PM. We were the only ones in the place. (Should have been clue #1) She took our order and proceeded to cook it up too (Hope she washed her hands first)Be warned.. wear your old clothes if you decide to go to this place. She was frying up something and the whole place including our clothes smelled of burnt grease. The food was hands down the worst Vietnamese food I've ever had. The meat was tasteless, the sauce to pour over your noodles and meat was just vinegar and a bit of sugar I think. The rice noodles were cold and all stuck together in big mass. The spring rolls were a mix of lettuce and cucumber deep fried in a wonton skins (BAD..)I can go on.. but I think you get the idea. She never asked how the food was or seemed to care. She dropped the bill off without saying a word. The ambiance.. Her and her husband, who was trucking in boxes from his car were yelling at each other in some Chinese language. There was a TV going with a loud Chinese video. We should have used our better judgment and left as soon as we sat down. Never, ever again.. will I step foot into there. I highly recommend that you don't waste your time or money. 1
Nice Italian restaurant in the South Side known for live bluesy jazz bands.  If you are going for dinner, I recommend showing up early, before the band starts.  There is an upper level and the main entrance level.  Upstairs is great for a large group, or an intimate dinner for two.  The downstairs area includes the bar and a more relaxed atmosphere.  Typical Italian food.  Nothing fancy or outrageous, but nothing memorable either.  The food is good and doesn't disappoint, but don't expect to find anything out of this world to Yelp about.Coming from San Francisco, it was upsetting to enter a restaurant that still permits smoking.  I usually avoid a facility that permits lighting up.  Smoking upsets the taste of your food, aggravates my sinuses and makes my clothes stink. 3
The worst pizza place. Take note that you can call in an order come to pick it up and they give your pizza away and you have to wait 10 mins for them to make another. Second time I ordered online said for me to pick it up at 7:05pm got here at 7:15 they gave my pizza away again even though I already paid online in advance. I rather go to Papa John's less stress and I get my pizza before the estimated  time. Oh and hot n ready pizzas are never ready there's a wait. 1
Nothing change after 2+ years visit!! The service still suck, food still bad!! I don't know why people still take line up at here!! I prefer pay more $2-3 to get good food and good service!! Agree with one of the guy said "only cheap people go here"!I think other restaurant at hwy 7 is the same owner, they do same worst food and service!  OMG !!! 1
Is there a zero star option available? This event is horrible and a waste of money showing graphic movies of crushing dinosaur skulls blood coming out of dinosaurs I recommend spending your money elsewhere. There is nothing exciting to do unless you pay extra 1
The margs were watery and low on the alcohol.  The server treated my mother ( yes my MOTHER) like she was from outer space and water went empty more times than a trip across the desert.  Never been to another macayos but not gonna try after that visit. 1
It's been awhile since we've been to Kensington and decided to check it out during March Break. My husband had been craving for authentic Mexican food and we decided to check out Emporium Latino. When you first walk in, you will notice so many things to buy. Fresh vegetables, cacti, etc. You place the order to the cashier and then once you've paid, you give it to the lady at the back. It was a long wait to get our food..about 20 minutes. But, it was good to browse around the store and look at all the items you can buy. We bought vegetarian burritos and some fried churros. Amazing food. We will come back again for sure! 3
Parking was a nightmare and I quickly made the decision that walking from the residential block behind the strip of commercial property would be easier than waiting for a spot to open up. I ordered the Cranberry Turkey sandwich and it was kind of sad and sparse looking. It was dripping (I think maybe from the tomato) and the bread was soggy when it arrived. I debated taking it back, but decided that I would just live with it because I was super hungry. On the upside, the cookie was good. I wouldn't order the sandwich again. 2
I was excited to go to the lululemon athletica at Scottsdale Quarter because I really enjoyed shopping at the previous store that closed in Scottsdale. Well something has changed... I walked into the store and while there were more sales clerks than customers, no one said a word to me and no one asked if I needed any help. They were all too busy talking with one another. And to add insult to to injury... one clerk had to walk around me (didn't ask if I needed help) and went to play with one of the customers dogs.... I had fully intended to buy a Christmas gift there, but left because the service was so poor and I did need help with the sizing.   I went over to the Nike store and had a totally different experience, very positive.  I'll stick with Lucy and Nike where they appreciate their customers. 1
HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!! They have the worst way of communication. I am stuck with my car and unsatisfied. I did my financing through a bank and even my bank complained about them. I had to call every day and go there to get my voice heard and I was just tossed between people. Then to hear that the people who were returnig my calls no longer work there. I was treated like nothing and after a month of trying to fix my problem it's finally starting but I have to keep calling and emailing them. I should not have to initiate it. They are horrible business people. I wouldn't recommend them to ANYONE!! 1
Dinner on Sunday night was a disaster.  The  butter plates on our table were dirty. (yuck) Both of the Moroccan lamb ravioli dishes arrived cold, twice!  The lid on the coffee pot fell off and the waitress poured coffee on the table and on my husband's jacket.  No apologies,A bus boy dropped a huge tray of dirty dishes next to our table.   I would describe our dining experience as surreal.Doubt we'll ever return certainly not for dinner.  IMO management needs to better train the entire kitchen and dining room staff,  (The price of one of the ravioli dishes was taken off our bill,) 1
This was the worst indian food I have ever had to date.The staff was very friendly, it was clean, but awful.We went here on a Sunday for my moms birthday, for the lunch buffet.The food wasn't that warm under the heating lamps. They had tandoori chicken, butter chicken, rice, pakoras and a selection of desserts. After checking out the buffet, I opted to have butter chicken off the menu, hoping that that at least would be hot and fresh. When it arrived, it was hot, but the cuts of meat were terrible. It didn't seem like it was the chicken breast that the menu promised it would be. I picked at it, and hardly ate it. Meanwhile, my family was waiting for them to refill the buffet. It seemed like they brought one item out every 15 minutes, even though the buffet was empty.The naan took the longest to restock, and it always seems flat and cold when it got there. I was smart, and ordered the naan from the menu, so when it came it was at least fresh.I ate here about a month ago, and I still feel sick when I think about the cold, flavourless food. It's a shame, because they seem like really nice people, but they food just isn't good.... 1
Had a wonderful dinner!  The polenta fries are crunchy and the inside creamy.Everything was wonderful and perfect.   My sister keeps talking about the "Old Fashion" drink.  Just can't wait to come back to this gem! 5
tried the asian dishes, the japanese noodle one has so much sodium! the thai style ones were bland tasting, the peanut sauce noodles was the best of the bunch. the chicken and steak had the texture of those frozen tv dinners (like swanson), but the price for what you get, given it's in prime real estate is ok. i'd prefer to spend my money on better food though. 2
I guess you can say that this place deserves higher since it is the only game in town but I cant really say its good thai food.  It is just like any other place you get thai food from but I guess if you are fixin for some pad thai, there is no other place to get it.  These are the same people that owned ricky lys next to Marc's in stow on 91. 2
Went to a Royaltea in China and lovveed it, so I was really excited when this location opened! It doesn't seem to taste the same, though. I've had the royal mousse tea so far (it was called "cheese tea" in China, the foam was thicker and tastier), it's decent. I still come back because I do like their tea but it's not outstanding. Skip the desserts (waffles & ice cream/crepe cake), there's definitely better elsewhere but they'll do in a pinch. Overall this place is great to visit and convenient for location, but not quite outstanding. Definitely want to try their durian mousse tea though as that looks really unique and I haven't had a chance yet. 4
For a huge corporate run chain this place has awful service. My 2nd and last visit here ended even worse than the first visit 3 months ago. Server spoke 2 words the entire visit, had to ask for refills which the the server filled with a completely different beverage, bread sticks burnt, soup was never refilled and the server never offered. The picture is of my empty soup bowl sitting on the table while 4 servers watched sports on TV and chit chatted amongst each other. I could have went to Fazoli's and had better service with better food and saved $30! 1
I don't know what all the hype is about this chain coming to Canada. I've hear much more positive differing references about their US locations. Each time I've gone here, which has been 2-3 visits that anything I'm looking for they don't have anything close & what they are selling is a disappointment. People share with me their US locations are considerably better.  I caught a manager & expressed my disappointment & conflicting references from fellow customers regarding the variety, prices, selection & quality of what they're selling in the US and her feedback was simply their Canadian locations are not like their US locations, when people have held the bar up to this hoping for the comparable shopping experience here. Their expansion into Canada has been a disappointment for Canadian shoppers and the proof is in their revenue forecasts reality and feedback. Don't think I'm going back unless I shop at one of their US locations at some point. 1
Very tasty food for a good price...Israeli/Middle-Eastern menu...something worth trying; hummus with hot mushrooms and rainbow trout. 5
Breakfast was just awesome.  Pancakes were just right and the French toast were delicious and not soggy like other restaurants.  Bacon was crispy and not greasy. Price was on point for the food. Will definitely come back when visiting Vegas and recommend all to come. 5
What happened to you Sylvia's?!?! Have been going to Sylvia's for over ten years and have always been a fan. My recent experience was horrible. Service was terrible, was difficult to even get water! Several other tables were in arguments with the manager which made for a less than pleasant experience. Thought the food would still be good but nope! Food was dry and possibly microwaved. I won't ever go back, it's a shame. 1
Although a few mistakes with our order and all of our food not coming out at tve same time, we were pretty satisfied with this place. The manager treated us to a round of drinks and also remade a meal tha was not to our satisfication.I had the tuscan chicken sandwich which was extremely tasty. I  will be back again based on the customer service. The manager was competent and aware of her customer's  needs. 4
I was planning on giving this company a 4-star review (I'd like the soil a little richer), until getting off the phone with their manager a few minutes ago.About two weeks ago, I called Pioneer Sand to get a quote regarding 6 cu yds of sandy loam and how much the delivery would be.  On that phone call, I told them my location.  I was quoted $55 for delivery.  I received the sandy loam on the 23rd, and noticed I'd been charged $75.  The delivery driver basically said there was nothing he could do, given that he wasn't a manager.  That's understandable.I just got off the phone with a manager (I didn't get his name).  I explained that I'd been quoted $55 but was charged $75.  "Yeah, that's because you're out in XYZ."  "Well, I told the person when I got the quote that I live in XYZ.""Yeah, sorry about that." So essentially, despite the fact that a customer was told something, that customer should be prepared to pay something different.  I know many people will say, "Hey, it's just $20," but you know what?  It's my $20, and personally I was raised to do what I say I will, even if it turns out I was mistaken about something or something else comes up.  You say it's going to be $55 - especially when I disclosed my location from the beginning! - it should be $55.In regards to the quality of the soil - sandy loam, 1/3 each topsoil, mulch, and compost - it was ok.  I'd like it a little darker, but I can just amend it with a few bags of manure and my own compost.  The 6 yds will work as a good starter for my raised garden beds. 2
We use to love Red Lobster, but our last visit was disappointing.   The service was very good and the staff attempted to make us happy, but the food was sub-par and overpriced.  Things were cold and not the quality we use to get there.  We had a large group and spent over $200 for a family birthday and were told they do not give birthday treats anymore.  Gees, a cup of ice cream with a candle would break you?  After many years, won't be back. 2
This place is totally new and very clean.  Only reason I gave it a 3 stars is that it is really far from the strip casinos which is where we like to hangout.  If you don't go to the strip, then this place is will be a 5 stars for sure. 3
Whoa move over Joe's Crab Shack, Shuck's has been discovered. The first time I came here I wasn't sure about how the food would taste, but I am glad that I tried it anyway. I tried the lobster bites and the crab dip both delicious. The second time I came here I saw a couple that ordered this big shell of seafood which was the clam bake. So my bf and I ordered it since it seemed like it would be enough food to eat. Of course it was...it has clams, crab, corn, potatoes, and sausage! MmMmM just the sound of it makes my mouth water.  Totally worth the place to go to eat some seafood and watch some games. Great location, clean, and friendly staff! 4
I walked in and almost walked right back out after seeing the prices . Each macaron was $2.50 and the other small pastries and cakes were $5-$7. I'm all for paying for quality but these prices were pretty intimidating for a poor college student. I ended up purchasing two macarons, salted caramel (the most popular I was told) and a passionfruit chocolate. The salted caramel delicious but the passionfruit chocolate was just okay. They are of decent size and the amount of filling is just perfect.So if you can afford it, go for it. 4
I used to recommend Calvary to others but it has recently gone downhill. Bed bugs are an issue and are not being taken care of. For Christmas dinner,  clients were provided sandwiches and there weren't enough to go around. Some of the caring staff used their own funds to purchase pizza. I believe there has been a change of leadership and that's part of the issue and many staff are leaving. Terribly sad as this used to be a wonderful place for individuals to start their recovery. 2
Went there today for a gluten-free lunch. Had the signature pasta with quinoa pasta and chicken it was awesome!!  I highly recommend it. 5
I went for cheese burger and fries on a Tuesday evening. I was seated and had my order taken pretty quickly. My food arrived pretty quickly too. Cheese burger was good. It was juicy and tasty. For some reason the fries were not hot so I guess they must have been sitting before I ordered waiting be paired with the burger. I also had a glass of coke. I am not really a fan of tap soda and this one too was kind of flat. I also asked for mayo after my order arrived and that was the slowest part of the service- I  was almost done eating when they brought it. All in all, it's an OK place for pub fare but nothing stellar. The bill came to about $22 with tax. 3
I miss you since we moved an hour away, but we still find an excuse to come your way when we can for my husbands haircut. Nicest place and lady ever and not to bad with the scissors and clippers!  (^_-) 5
We arrived in Vegas super early and Westin let us do an early check in, around 9am. My brother, nephew and his wife called their hotels to do the same and they had to wait til late afternoon to check in.  So i asked westin if it would be a problem if they waited and rested in my room and again no problem.  They are so accommodating, they even asked if i wanted extra room Keyes for them and told me that parking if free for them as well.  The rooms were clean and the beds were super comfortable.  Soft towels and a beautiful view of the High Roller from the Linq. When they saw my room everyone wanted to move to my hotel also because of the location.  Walk across the street to Ballys and you can go on the monorail to any part of the strip, no need to uber or lyft.  Also while everywhere was super crowded the Westin was quiet and peaceful.  Ask my friends and family ended up at the Westin towards the end of the night to gamble as well a it wasn't over crowd and rowdy.  They also give you $5 slot play or $10 for the tables when you sign up for their play card. No complaints here.  Special thanks to Mylin at the front for being so accommodating! 5
If you are planning to take an intercity bus this is the main bus terminal in Montreal. From what I heard, this bus terminal was revampted a few years a ago. You will find there a coffee place, a small book store and ATM machines.  It can easily be reached via the subway, city buses, by taxis and by car. There is even a bus connecting with the airport. The bus ride will take you between 40 and 60 minutes from the airport. By taxi it's more or less 20-25 minutes.There are different ways to buy your bus tickets. Either the traditional wait in lign at the counter or by using the self service interactive terminal or on the bus station website. Worth to mentioned, their website is really bad! Try the website of the bus companies stopping there! (Limocar, Orleans etc..). They are much better! Just to give you an example, it not possible to find the address of the bus terminal on their site!! That's quite ridiculous. Overall it's a good transit station. It's nothing fancy but it does the job! A small detail there is free wifi in the bus terminal and in most buses connecting to this station. 4
Neither expensive nor cheap. The quality is above average though rolls r a bit salty for me, while service is quite slow. Nothing impressive after the first time. Still go there as it's nearby and offers brown rice option (extra $1 per roll). Go there for lunch is more economical. 3
I'm conflicted with this place.  I was fortunate to have sampled the pork belly and flour less chocolate brownie on a separate occasion and they were phenomenal!  So I wanted to try out their other items, went for lunch and most tables were taken but we were able to find a seat. Ordered the mac and cheese and fried green beans and number 1 burger with the regular fries.Both the beans and fries were over salted and almost made it difficult to eat.  The Mac and cheese was ok, just had higher expectations for this dish.  Even the presentation was lacking, no garnish or garlic toast. The portion and price was right though. The burger for me is what saved my rating from a 2 star.  Super flavourful, it could've been more juicy though as some part of it was over cooked but still a good burger.  One more thing about this burger, it comes with a fried egg, the yolk was cooked through and through which I don't like.  Should've been a little bit softer so you could get some runny yolk, sure makes it a very messy meal but IMO yummier!Service was alright, the head server or bartender she could've been a little bit more personable. 3
I needed to have my watch bracelet adjusted. Friendly and quick service, no scratches or anything on my new watch. Reasonable charge of $10 which is pretty standard for this type of service. 2 jewelers were on duty and they seemed to know what they were doing. Would certainly come back. 5
I've eaten their food many times but as take out. Last night was the first time eating in house and after my experience there, I would never eat their food again. Not to mention the service was absolutely awful and we waited over an hour for our food. One of the guys with us found a confetti star in his pasta and when it was brought to the waitresses attention she said "we won't charge you for it...and enjoy!" Really? And the washrooms were absolutely disgusting and there were some sort of little black bugs walking around on the floor. Never going here again! 2
This place is only good if you know which dress you want and if you're ready to make a purchase. The service wasn't bad, but wasn't great either.  I wouldn't go here if I'm in the beginning phases of looking for a dress.  They sell bridal gowns, bm dresses, party dresses, accessories and etc.  The owner, Joanna uses this sales tactic where she tells you she can alter your dress for a really low price but the "special" is only valid for the day (we asked if we can come back and get the same deal and she said no) and to hold this deal you will need to put a deposit of $50. She kept saying that the next time we come in we won't get the same deal and she will charge more.  I didn't really like the fact that i was pressured to make a decision on the spot when i wasn't ready to do so and the approach they took regarding the special alteration prices seemed wrong. 2
Close to home, convenient and consistently good. Baristas really know their stuff at this locale. Boulder city is not the friendliest. You need to a local fir them to recognize you. 5
I came here with my family just last week we ordered the 10.99 larger cheese special this is by far the best pizza I had in las vegas the pasta we also order was fresh the service was phenomenal it was a nice sit down place for my family and I to enjoy dinner and football !!! 4
I was extremely disappointed! I had an appointment but got there and waiting forever for someone to even come up to my car in the pull up line. After waiting over 10 minutes I got out of my car and walked inside the bay where NO ONE even acknowledged me or said how can I help you. I had to walk directly into someone's face and ask for assistance and mention that I had an appointment only to be asked "Do you see someone specific". I knew at that point no one cared. I was asked to wait in my car. Waited another 5 minutes or so (now 20 minutes past my appointment time---not to mention I need to get back to work because I was dropping off the car). Finally someone comes up to me and asks how can they help--I let them know about my oil change appointment and they are unaware of how to code my service program in their system since it was an oil change that was taken care of by my membership in the ToyoCare program. 2.5 hours later I get a call that my car is ready. Upon pickup they are in the process of closing down so I didn't take a once over of my car. When I arrived home I noticed that my back window windshield wiper blade had rubber hanging from it. So someone pulled it and left it hanging. They didn't even bother to replace it and just left it hanging. UNACCEPTABLE....because I know the car was inspected. I would have had no problem paying for a new wiper blade replacement but wasn't given that option. I won't be returning! 1
Very friendly staff, Heather was awesome and the owner, Dave, came out and visited. We were driving through Phoenix on our way back to Tucson from Sedona and the Grand Canyon and was looking for a place to stop on the north side to let the work traffic thin and found Caps on Yelp. The boneless mild wings were delicious. We had several salads and they were huge! Several ordered steaks and were pleased. Mom loved the grilled veggies and bonus was ladies night with $3.50 margaritas, Mai Tais and martinis! Glad we found it! Thanks Dave! 4
I lived in NM for almost 5 yrs and really fell in love with green chile! The 1st time I went, I ordered the stuffed sopapilla with green chile pork verde. It was incredible!! The pork is fork tender, perfectly seasoned, and the green chile has a great flavor and heat as well. Have been back many times and have had no complaints. I have had the tacos, sliders, burritos, and simply ordered the pork verde with green chile. All is amazing. Never had the red chile- I'm strictly a green man! If you like authentic New Mexican cuisine, this is the place for you!! If you want Tex Mex or Americanized Mexican- go find somewhere else to eat as this is not the place for that. 5
Awesome chocolate and ice cream. What more could you ask for. Brownie bites in sundaes are real homage Brownies not just gross chunks of goo!! 4
Tapas styled Thai resto. Not the cheapest Thai place but of the "trendy" ones (Khao San Road, Pai) that I've tried, while all good, Sabai Sabai was my favourite with the tastiest menu. (And in the end, I basically spent the same as the other restaurants and just as full, if not more). Also good friendly service that keeps things moving. And considering how busy the place is, was able to accommodate our large group very well (with speedy service too). 4
First off- Congrats Chef Piero. My co-worker and I shared two sandwiches the cuban and american(the american version of an italian) both delicious. 5
This our favourite South Indian restaurant... Anywhere....including many that we've been to in India!We moved away from Toronto out west and every time we come back, this year is one of our must do destinations. The food is consistently delicious and comes out quickly. It's nice that there is a variety of spice levels to choose from and that one can customize the dosa's, never mind the sheer variety to start with. Although a tad on the higher price side (compared to other South Indian restaurants), the food quality justifies the difference. 4
My daughter has been coming here for more than a month now. She improved a lot on her singing in just a few sessions and is now starting to get rid of her shyness. Susan is such a great vocal teacher and mentor. Now my son is also enrolling with her. My daughter became so interested in music and now she's also trying to learn how to play the ukulele. I highly recommend this music school. 5
Server was super rude on Christmas. Iwas born and raised in Vegas so I grew up eating at this location and the one in North Town. But after today I will never come back, I am so upset at the quality of food and service today. Goodbye Longhorn 1
Henry the food here Tastes good amazing full of flavor awesome repeatedly coming back. This Cosmopolitan is the spot. Food for the whole package. 4
I've always had a great experience at Coldstone. They are always friendly and have no problem when I ask for extra toppings. They have the best tasting ice cream in town. 4
The food is aweful!!!!!!!!!!! Seriously...it's terrible! GO here for fun drinks or dessert. Don't waste your time or money on the food. I can't even say the food average which is pretty sad when you have a group of 6 and the average drink per person is 1 and the bill is over $300. Such a disappointment!!!! 1
The most consistent place I've ever been to as far as normal traditional american fare. I love sitting at bar wi my wife. Great bartender. Lunch specials and soups are always good. Fresh homemade bread is a must there. Owner is there and smiling a lot. My father took me when I was a kid. Never fails. Pizza very good as well. 4
Sad to say we will not be eating here as often due to the fact they stopped buying sour cream wtf?! Food has always been great and sour cream may not be that much of a deal breaker to some people but I don't enjoy breakfast with out it :( 3
I had the sampler platter, my wings were fall off the bone tender, but were a little more than warm. But had a good flavor. The BBQ was good but was barely 3 bites and I only had two ribs. They were good though. The cornbread was great and the mac n cheese was pretty good.Wife got the brisket sandwich, decent flavor but was tough. Then the dessert, we got the coffee lovers ice cream cup. The ice cream was good but not $8 good. All in all food was probably about average for a BBQ joint, but pricey for portions. 3
Got the VIP packages and that was now way worth the additional 100 plus for this experience. If your lucky once inside you can find a staff member with a red hat who is supposed to be your concierge to get to the head of the line. Well that only works on entry and one interactive exhibit. You stand in line for everything else. The VIP tent is tiny with $7 drinks and your VIP T shirt. NOT even close to being worth it. You do however save the $10 parking fee, whoohoo , it's a dust bowl dirt lot. Overall the group running it mentioned several things were not right, like the screen printed poster not being available (part of VIP), the 3D not working on something's , and the RFID wrist band, what's with that? It didn't do anything.  Overall the $25 ticket might be okay, but not the VIP. 1
I love this place! The music is great and the employees are awesome. They have a nice selection of beer to choose from and the food is great. The Harvey's seasoning on their fries is outstanding. They have both indoor and outdoor seating. The outdoor seating is cooled by misters and is rather nice even on the hottest of nights. During the winter they have some gas flames that heat up the outdoors. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for great American food. 4
I should have gone to the Japanese place across the road. I had to grab a quick to go lunch here and nothing was good except the wontons. My egg rolls were soggy and the General Tso's was unrecognizable. I threw it our and got LJS 5 minutes down the road. Also a few months back I had the short ribs and they tasted like plastic. 2
Customer service was great. It had that local, know everyone's name feeling. I felt like I was at a burger shop by the beach and not on my break for lunch in hot as hell AZ. As for food, I had a pastrami burger which was perfect! Greasy and full of flavor! Then I tried the chili cheese fries. Which were a surprise, they are good, but keep in mind the chili is sweet. I enjoyed it. To top it off I had a lemonade. Yum yum. 3
Believe the hype, these guys are great. I joined in August, and what can I say more than I went from never having worked out regularly other than high school volleyball to working out 5 days a week and getting fitter than I've ever been. I've never been able to motivate myself to follow a regular workout regime  in the past, but this has a truly built-in motivation factor with competition and camaraderie that built me from struggling to make 3 days a week because I was so immobilized by the intensity to 5 days a week every week! Very impressed, I'm a lifer. I literally woke up one morning and decided I'm going to give it a try. One month later, I tried adding another 3 months to see if I would last. Now it's 8 months later and, although I get made fun of for things like not shutting my car door, I'm really feeling a part of the box. 5
I've been a member of mountainside fitness for some time now and honestly this location makes me embarrassed to say that this is my gym of choice. I just started going to this location due to my new job being over this way and let me tell ya...this location is so dirty and unorganized. Toilet paper all over the bathroom floors...everything on the gym floor is slimy and sticky and literally nothing is put away. So cluttered. Not to mention I got on four treadmills before finding one that would work properly. I'm so disappointed. Almost worth me sitting in traffic trying to get to the arrowhead location... at least the front desk people are really nice. 2
??????????????????????????? ??????(???)???? ???????????????????????????????OK???????????????????????????????????? ????? 2
Once my weekly end-of-the-week haunt, I have since abandoned the Churhmouse. When I first started eating here three years ago, the staff were incredibly attentive, personable, and professional. The food was plentiful and tasty. How times have changed."So, are you done yet?" is not what waiting staff should be asking a group of nine that is steadily drinking and has a record of tipping well. All of the best staff have left and been replaced with people who cannot recognize my group after weeks of serving us. This is on top of a major decrease in portion sizes.The food is still tasty and their burger specials are excellent. However, the service is now really sub-par. I would like to dine in the Village more, but the attitude in the staff needs to change. 2
This was a great show. We took our 14 year old son for his birthday and our 5 year old can't wait to go back for her birthday. We all agreed we wanted to go again. Great people great show. Fun, funny and very talented! 5
I went to this place and had the carne asada burrito people seem to really like and I have to say the place and the burrito wasn't bad. It was close to home, cheap, and a good place to get a quick fix. I liked it well enough and the food was a good portion size for the price. I'd go back again. 3
This place was highly recommended by several friends. While it was good I dont think that it lived up to the hype. I ordered steak and chicken tacos. The steak had good flavor and they did pack as much meat as they could into the tiny tortillas. I need more time to sample and explore the salsa bar but the creamy green jalepeno salsa was good. The chicken tacos lacked flavor and were a little dry. Prices were a bit higher than I expected. I paid $8 flat for 3 small tacos and a coke in a bottle. The place was tiny and it was difficult to get to the salsa and back to my table. I was there during lunch on a Friday so that is to be expected. Service was average. The tables were clean and the place appeared well kept. Great story of how the place was started, good food but just did not live up the hype. 3
OK, I have been here before and loved the food, and my daughter adores this place as well. I was a little hesitant because there was a review posted that made me uneasy, I am Caucasian and my daughter is bi-racial. I have been in places where both she and i had been discriminated against and it is hurtful. I will say when i came in here today, i was immediately greeted by Jasmin (?) I hope I got her name right. She was so helpful and took our orders right away. I had a restaurant.com certificate and i wanted chicken and waffles (my daughter loves Roscoe's in Pasadena and I wanted her to have them here). Jasmin suggested we get the chicken and waffles and in order to utilize the value of the certificate she recommended the smothered chicken as a to-go order. The food was brought out fresh, hot and delicious. No attitude by anyone that I was aware of, if anything, they were uber attentive. She even got us our drinks to go. Nice touch. All the food (and there was a LOT) was so delicious. I will definitely be coming back more often. everyone has an "off" day and poor service and rudeness are inexcusable, but I am happy to say that M&M treated me and my daughter like family. I can't wait to try the chitterlings next time.. 5
Hirut is great.  Delicious food, friendly staff, a down-to-earth feel.  I couldn't ask for more.  It's my favourite Ethiopian place in town... I think partly because it doesn't feel like it is trying hard to be great; it just is.  I haven't been for any live events, but I love the idea that they do this. 5
Moved from NY four years ago and have eaten at this restaurant more than I can count....it is ALWAYS good!! The food is authentic and consistent. I always ask for the "special" salsa that you will not get unless you ask for it. It is very hot but probably the best salsa that I have tasted. My kids also really enjoy this place and I would consider it a nice family place to take them. Also, Sunday the kids eat for free!!! 5
No story is needed here.Service is bad.The chicken is dry out.No lunch sets Order 2 meals and 1 didn't come after at least 30mins.And waitress didn't follow up even we ask her to check.And we ask for bill and they didn't cancel the one which never arrived until we said how can u charge us.... 1
Finally, someplace that serves their full dinner menu late night.  The service was fantastic, the food was incredible.  First time there and certainly not my last. 5
The food at this place was good or may be we just got really hungry after the 75 minutes wait because when your hungry anything tastes good. Yes people we waited for 75 minutes and the person at the counter who looked like a manager didn't even care because he was having a few drinks at his own bar. There was no one else at the restaraunt so its not like the kitchen was busy. My advice save your time and go to Royal India. 1
Chips they serve are amazing! I usually do not like/eat chips - but these are a definite try! We went on an evening, before the dinner crowd. They were not busy, or waitress was attentive, friendly and helpful. They have an extensive beer list....which includes cider! They also offer beer combination "cocktails." I had a burger that was cooked the way I ordered it (medium) and was delicious. The crowd picked up by the time we were leaving. Nice atmosphere. Will come back. 4
This Hotel needs a serious clean sweep of its management. This should be a great place to stay, but as this is our 4th time, we are just prime examples of insanity, expecting different & better results from the same group.... Our first room was like, 78 degrees when we walked into it. We put the AC down to 65, went down to eat / play for 4 hrs....came back and temp said 76.....not cutting it....Maint said the AC needed rebooting (really?)...2 hours later it was still 76.....we got a lower floor....this time the room was ok, but took all evening to get down to 70.HEY.... in the summer, when the temps are over 90.....keep the rooms cool for the next arriving guests.....it might make their stay enjoyable... 3
Not too bad. The service is great and the food is good. The drink list is limited to say the least, but I would go back. 4
It was our first visit here and I think we all enjoyed it!I first had the waffle with fruit and whip and I have to say it was just a little too crisp and airy for my liking. I replaced it with the bacon ham and egg sandwhich and OMG!!!!!!!! YES YES YES! It was perfectly sweet and salty and filling! YUMMMMMMM I can't wait for my boyfriend and I to have another day off so we can enjoy breakfast at 2pm again! 4
I would give a negative 5 stars if I could. These guys are shysters!I drove away really happy after buying my car at showcase last month. I continued to be a happy camper driving around in my new car until about a week after purchasing it when my debit card was declined for a $1 coffee at circle k one morning on the way to work. I called my bank and found out that showcase honda had not only pulled the downpayment for my car but they also helped themselves to an additional large amount of money in a strange denomination that made no sense and essentially wiped out all of my funds. It took me 2 days of calls to the finance department to finally get my money put back into my account only to have another large amount of money in a strange denomination  pulled from my account two days later. They kept saying they had lost the check that I had written them for my down payment ,even though the check had already cleared several days before and the amount they were pulling from my account was not even close to the down payment amount at all! I had not even authorized them to debit my account with my debit card!! I had given them my debit card # to sign up for an automatic deduction of car payments thru another company they use, but the payment wasn'tdue for over 30 days and the amounts they were pulling were not payments they were random amounts that even the finance girl couldn't explain. The finance girls were really snotty with me at first telling me I was wrong until they got a clue and realized they were wrong and then said it would be reversed in 24 hrs. I patiently waited with ZERO funds in my account until the next day and nothing. It took several days to get my money put back into my account and with an explaination of "we lost your downpayment check" which had cleared my bank several days earlier and was a very different dollar amount! They declined to pay any over draft fees from my bank even after admitting they made a mistake in pulling the money. Then 2 days later they did it again for a different, unauthorized odd dollar amount that made no sense at all. I ended up having to close the debit card and order another one and my bank suggested I file fraud charges and then close the bank account. I called and left several messages to the "finance manager" nearly in tears over what was happening but I never got a return call. I also called the guy who wrote my deal and helped me do all the paper work and he never bothered to call back either. They also sent me plates and didn't bother to credit me the nearly $100 bucks from my old plates that I told them I wanted to keep so I had to spend a few hours at the DMV getting my plates switched over and a credit. They said they would give me credit for the 2+ years left on the service contract of the vehicle I traded in but they blew that off and charged me full price for a new service contract-I found that out when I got the service contract paperwork in the mail yesterday. My salesman called early last week to see how I was loving my new car and I told him what was going on and how upset I was and that the service manager was not returning my calls. The salesman said he would tell the manager and look into it and get back to me. That was a week and a half ago and still not a call back.  Wow, what a dissappointment. I guess they already got my money so why bother investigating my complaints about how SCREWED OVER I was in the process. Never again. I read the bad reviews here before going to showcase and thought it wouldn't happen to me or it couldnt be that bad. There is a reason most people on here give 1 star. BE WARNED OF THE SHOWCASE HONDA SHYSTERS!!! Its sad really. 1
My friend and I enjoyed their 100$ special which included 60 min infrared wrap, 50 min massage and sugar scrub. We forgot to bring extra clothes for infrared wrap, but they provided us with theirs which was very nice. By the end of the wrap session you will be soaked in sweat.We got to stay together through the wrap and massage and that made our experience even better. Music was very relaxing and just right.Whole body massage was very nice, the only complaint I have is the length of the sugar scrub, it lasted maybe 5 minutes.Staff was very professional and friendly as well. I would come back. 3
This place gave me the run around from the start. This place tries to sell you broken, rusted bikes for well more than they are worth just by spraying WD-40 all over them (Very bad for bearings!) Customer service was very bad and I had to leave. I'm giving it two stars because the concept of the place is cool and I truly hope others have a better experience there. 2
Local here. I took my hubby to see the Jabbawockeez for his bday weekend. Our seats at first was horrible (to me) but Teresa (an employee) came up to us and moved us to Front Row. The show is AWESOME from the Music, Moves and Crowd Interaction.  I highly recommend seeing the show. Keep up the good work.  I can't wait to see the Jabbawockeez Again. 5
FANTASTIC!!!!These guys know the basics about customer service infused with super-flavorful thai food. We've been coming here for a year (about 8 times). Friendly, fast, clean and fresh tasting thai food. I'd give it 10 stars if I could. Not in a fancy big box stand alone building but clean and worth the visit. You won't go wrong I promise. Try the Pad Thai, Deep Fried Tofu and 'F5" Spicy Thai Basil. Fresh and mouthwatering. Oh and the price ... very affordable. ENJOY this GEM!!!! 5
If there are is a zero star, I would give it. It's a freezing night, we were waiting table inside, a waiter came and told us we NEED TO WAIT OUTSIDE because inside is the dining area. WTF?! Do Not Come. Period. 1
The deli provided the worst service. We decided to go to another grocer. They seems uninterested in helping us this was the second time. 2
Pretty cool concept, 3 clubs in one night, no cover charges, no waiting in lines and party bus to next club.  Its great, even better at 50% yelp deal.  The "party" crew from the company were very fun and nice.  The have flashing lights and walk around the club when it is time to go to the next one.  Its cool and other people in the club who are not with the Club Crawl have no idea who/what they are doing.The lack of 5 stars is the "drink" on the bus in between clubs is terrible vodka in cranberry concentrate in a bottle they keep refilling every night after night.  Perfect for bachelor party that wants to hit the clubs and not waiting in line or pay too much. Oh, and they buy you 2 drinks before the whole thing starts. 4
It was my first time at Morals last night, we had been wait for 1 hr for the table. The food was average, would go back if I'm in that area again. 4
This review is for international flyers. Check-in here to fly back to London is really alarming. The check-in is lackluster, in fact, it felt like we were checking in at some third world country airport. There's nothing in the lobby area. If there is a restaurant here, then I've missed it the past three times we flew out of here! Once you get through security, it's very dour. There's a small bar, a fast food joint, and one off the worst Duty Free shopping areas and newsagent shopping in the world. There's slot machines to kill the time, but as someone else stated on here, leave it to the last legal time to check-in as you will not want to hang out here. Also, for Vegas to be one of the few places where you can just about smoke anywhere, there is no smoking area once through security. So take those last puffs before going through!!! 2
Stopped in for a late lunch on a Sunday afternoon.  Sat outside and enjoyed the BBQ pork platter with baked beans, coleslaw, and hush puppies on the side.  My husband got a burger and onion rings.  Food was tasty though portions weren't as generous as at similar BBQ places in the area.  It was enough for me (an average female) though some men or big eaters might wish there was more.  Our server was friendly but the food took quite a while to come out, considering that we were the only customers.  Not sure why the kitchen was so slow. Still, the food was a pretty good value so we will likely return 4
Black bear is one of my favorite places in the valley to eat.  It's diner, comfort food at it's finest.This go around we went for a late breakfast.  Had to wait about 15 minutes (Sunday around 1130AM), but it was no biggie.  We ordered from the lighter fare section of the menu and got a Small Volcano (around $7-8) and a basic egg, sausage patty, hashbrowns, and biscuit (about $6-7).  The small volcano came with 1 sausage (subbed for bacon, no problem), 1 bacon, 1 egg, and 3 pancakes (for $1 more I got the oat/nut pancakes).  I eat big, but still didn't finish the pancakes.  More than enough food.  Good, crispy bacon, simple scrambled egg, and some pretty tasty, hearty pancakes.  All was delicious, and we both hoped they'd come take our plates quickly so we'd stop picking at them.Service was good.  Coffee kept coming, food came quickly, waitress knew all the answers.  Black Bear never disappoints.  Total was about $24 with tip, a tea, a coffee, and the 2 meals. 5
Charming little place with amazing pastries! We stopped by an hour before closing and were warmly welcomed. I had the mille feuille, my favorite pastry of al time and how I base if a patisserie is up to snuff. It was perfect! My husband had some pastry with praline, apricot, and speculoos, which was just the perfect amount of sweetness and a masterful balance of creamy and crunchy as well as sweet and tart. We left with two caneles that I had the next day, and they were still deliciously chewy and crispy. Can't wait to return! 5
I have  searched several states for the right doctor to trust my life with.  I am blessed to have found Dr. Parson and his practice. All my anxieties and concerns were professionally and carefully answered with an extremely gifted and talented Doctor combined with a soft touch. 5
I got Jimmy johns all the time and for a while it was great; I hadn't a problem with them. But lately, they've gone downhill. Not only did they mess up my order completely twice in a row, but the delivery people wanna give you an attitude if you don't tip them well enough. It was an hour before they arrived at my door. "Freaky Fast" is a big lie. If you want a quality sub, go to Jersey Mikes. 1
The food is epic and i love their burgers and got sandwiches. The only thing that prevents me from a full 5 start reading is the delivery guy. It's some grumpy old dude with a chip on his shoulder. I don't say shit to em. Only time he had ever been pleasant is if you give him some high tip. 4
Nothing but top notch services from Lexus of LV. If you are looking for a new ride, look up Johnny Chang.  He will get you the best deal and put you in a car that fits you. You won't regret it. We've gotten two vehicles from him and will be back for more when the leases are up! 5
We went on a Saturday morning and it was 45 min wait, and I'm not quite sure why. I'm starting to think breakfast joints are the way to go in the restaurant biz cuz they're always packed. The food here was good but nothing to die for like Matt's. The omelets and French toast were good (but French toast came out cold), the hashbrowns were excellent, the tater tots were typical, and the homefries were average. I was a fan of the ice coffee with mint in it but I wouldn't recommend it to people who usually drink super sweet coffee beverages. I'm giving this place 2 stars instead of 3 because the wait was unpleasant and the servers were rude, and the hostess was a prima donna. 2
We popped in right before closing time while visiting Cleveland because we'd read good things. For a local, I could see this place being amazing. Tons of meat, fruit, veggies, cheeses, etc. on sale at great prices. As we arrived, the shops were all closing up for the day. I was kind of bummed. I would have loved to purchase some tasty treats, but I knew the meat probably wouldn't sit well unrefrigerated on the drive home to Chicago.If you're a local, don't miss out! 4
Beautiful atmosphere, however there was a wait to sit back there when we came here at 7ish on a weeknight. We tried the "dinner" crepes because they seemed to be the restaurants specialty. The crepes themselves were very tasty however the filling was subpar. 3
Not too bad. I am not at all the Old Town Scottsdale nightlife kind of gal anymore, so this wouldn't be my scene during those times. However, about 12 of my girlfriends and I went to The Mint for Happy Hour on a Friday and had a pleasant time. The food is really good! The drinks are good and the 1/2 price makes them very reasonable. The interior was pretty cool. Later at night you probably wouldn't be able to notice all the cool details. The co-ed bathroom is weird - just weird. I really didn't like that. The staff while very attractive and friendly, seemed a bit new. Our very sweet server had a lot of trouble with our big group. She didn't want to do separate checks at the beginning and told us doing one group bill would be easier for everyone. Then, when we tried to pay, it was a problem and someone else told us we should have done separate checks...we tried! I waited 30 minutes for my bill when there might have been 3 other patrons in the Mint other than our group. I would definitely come back for another happy hour and check out the outdoor bar, but would probably insist on separate checks. 3
Fast delivery and nice staff. Food was delicious. Pizzas were on the large side. Will order again. 5
Worst insurance experience of my life. I was with John Marxen for years and when this ass hat of a clown took over, I tried to continue my business with the new owner but was continaully harassed and bullied into getting a policy that didnt suit my needs.He doesnt know the first thing about how to treat people. 1
The food is tasty and the menu is extensive but the last two times that I have eaten here it has been served "COLD". The first time, I thought it might be a fluke because we were in the bar area. This last time there was no excuse. It was not busy and we were in the dining area. I go there when in the mood for comfort food and it certainly isn't comforting when it's served at room temperature. Won't be back for quite some time, if ever! Four cold dinners is far too many. 2
I love going there for the freshest fruits/vegetables and the good selection of salads plus ready made hot food.  The slight higher prices are worth it for me, a local resident who love the freshness and convenience. 5
I think the reason for the low ratings is because, like all LA Fitness clubs, the focus is on sales.The facilities are fantastic: amazing number of cardio machines, awesome free weights area, plenty of room in the aisles, excellent cycle class area!Where they fail (big time) is customer service: try to get someones attention at the counter-difficultreport a broken machine-will take weeks to get fixedAnd, omg, stay out of the way of the personal trainers!  They take over machines, stretching areas, racquetball courts to take care of their paying clients.  They leave machines covered in sweat and leave equipment laying around instead of putting it back.The top insult came recently when they suddenly cordoned off the stretching area and kicked everyone out because it was going to be reserved only for their clients.  What?? I guess that would be ok if they had another stretching area that didn't look like an after thought of throwing down a small mat in a corner.This gym could be excellent given the great space and amount of equipment.  But the poor customer service and sole focus on selling and maintaining personal training at the expensive of everyone else drags their rating down to a 2.5 or a 3. 3
After we ate we noticed that one of the crackers was chewed up by a rodent. Wouldn't recommend or go back to the place at all. 1
We usually like Barros so I took my family over a couple of weeks ago for an evening meal.  My daughter is sensitive to gluten, so we ordered a gluten free pizza, regular pizza and wings.Their regular pizza was good as always.  The gluten-free however, came out with the crust burned.  I tasted the edge of it and it tasted as burned as it looked.  I took it back and was told that's just the way it is with gluten-free.  Since I ordered meat on the pizza, they had to make sure it was cooked so the crust gets burned.  That's it - no offer to make it better, just go ahead and eat it.So I wasn't happy about that, but to make matters a little more annoying, I could hear the teenage server talking to someone in the back (the cook I'm guessing) and making some smart-alec remark about my complaint. That's cool I guess, but FYI - it's a pretty small store and I can hear you out by the cash register Einstein.The wings were OK, but very wet.  Oh, and they don't have any wet-wipes, so you just have to go through about 20 disintegrating napkins while eating your wet wings.So, 4 stars overall for the pizza, minus 2 stars for the crappy service and smart-alec high school servers.  I'll just stick to Sardellas, who apparently have already taken the class on how to make gluten-free pizza. 2
Such a tiny place.  No alcohol.  Talent was meh... At best.  Supposed to be nude but I saw 10 dancers and not one nipple.  Selling the VIP hard but wasn't buying it considering.  Don't waste your time or money.  $20 cover $20 dance which is normal for the area but high for the quality. 1
The work is beautiful but the customer service is poor.  She brought her her own kids to our family shoot and it was a disaster.  That was entirely forgiveable had she not consistently made me feel bad for various things--that I was inquiring of sneak peeks 10 days after our shoot after said promise of 3 days, that I didn't inititate giving her my Groupon voucher number--she accused me of defrauding her because she has had that experience before, that I wanted to do the scheduled photo shoot after she suggested scoping out the site and approved it (it had rained crazily early that day).  It is also interesting to note that the 10/17/04 5-star review by Sarah M IS the photographer herself. 2
Its hit and miss with the service went to the Chinook center location again tonight with some Friends. Brutal service. and barley any sauce in the pasta I had. Cleanliness Id have to say alright I suppose. 1
I went here with very high hopes, given the good reviews on here.  But I came away thinking that it is unlikely I will ever go back.Service - the cashier was not friendly and got confused over me telling her that I wanted a crispy taco.  She thought I was asking for all of the ingredients to be fried to a crispy texture.  Really?Food - I have been looking for a great shredded beef taco, and this is definitely not the place.  Cheap hard taco shells that are not cooked to order (think Taco Bell) - no wonder she had no idea of what a crispy taco is.  The meat essentially had no flavor at all.This was my first time going to this place, so, in fairness, maybe they have better tasting food on the menu.  But I came to a place called Los Taquitos, looking for a great tasting taco.  I left very disappointed, and without any desire to return.  I guess my quest for the perfect taco will just have to continue. 2
I chipped my front tooth on a Thursday and sadly, my dentist wasn't open the following Friday.  But Pearl was able to get me in at noon on Friday and for that I am grateful (and giving the 2nd star).  But I am not sure why everyone else writes reviews about how "cool" the place and that it has Netflix because when I go to the dentist, I would rather a place have a professional feel to it and not a night club feel to it.  And maybe this place is just for a younger sort.  Dunno.  But when I see someone come in and open dental tools (hopefully sterilized by an autoclave) who is not wearing scrubs, it makes me have a sense of uncleanliness.  Dr. Jenny was able to fill my chipped tooth but the surface of my tooth is rough and you can actually see where the filling was placed.  Please note that I have chipped this tooth before and i know what is right and what is not right in a filling in that spot.  Furthermore, as far as dentists go, Pearl is quite expensive.  I had to pay $270 upfront because they said that generally insurance does not pay for this type of filling because it is considered "cosmetic" and that they would submit anyway.  Well, i just got notice of a claim with my insurance, and above the $270 I previously paid, Pearl sent ANOTHER claim in for an $80 exam.  And they did not bother to submit the chipped tooth filling (as they said they would) because they assumed my insurance wouldn't pay.  That is for me to deal with my insurance about, not something they get to decide themselves.  I called and had to ask for them to submit (which they did).Any other dentist I have been to in my life files to insurance and then you owe the dentist the remaining balance.  But not here...no, here you pay up front and then have to get reimbursed AFTER.Again, if you want to watch Netflix with a person dressed as your neighbor working on your teeth with blaring music, this is your spot...if you like dentists and hygienists in scrubs without club music all around, you might want to go somewhere else. 2
Your app is horrible. Every time and I mean every time some stranger knocks on my door your app has issues. So I cant see if they have left my property. I will be leaving your company as soon as our contact is up. I do not have piece of mind with your system. My house was broken into 2 years ago and the motion did not set off the alarm. I up graded with several cameras. Cant look at them when I would like to. Always an issue. 1
This location recently opened on 521 just south of Ballantyne.Tried them for the first time tonight - ordered a large pizza with pepperoni, sausage and extra cheese.  Thought it was expensive ($30) - until I saw the size of this puppy!  8 New York sized slices in a large pie.  Very tasty and just a bit on the greasy side, just the way pizza should be.  Pizza needed just a little more sauce for my taste.  We had the "Classic Original" crust but according to the menu, you can also request Sicilian, deep dish at no additional cost.In addition to pizza, menu offerings include the usual soups, salads, pastas and sandwiches.  Can't wait to try the meatball sandwich.  Alcohol seemed to be available to dine in customers.There is also another location in Waxhaw.Be prepared to pay a bit more - in order to get a bit more in terms of both quality and quantity. 3
If you are looking for a dentist then this place is amazing. I am one of those people that hates going to the doctor/dentist so it's a miracle when you can get me to go. This place was recommended by a coworker and I am so thankful. From the moment I made my appointment to the time I left I felt so welcomed and comfortable. Every single one of their staff are personable and friendly to the point to where I forget I'm at the dentist! It's a family owned practice and I cannot speak more highly of them. Thank you Okun! 5
Maybe I'm just unlucky but I've been three times now and everytime I've gotten stale, hard buns. I think I'm done. 2
Very fresh sushi and sashimi and great Sake selection.  Great quality for the price. 4
I was here on Father's Day with my family for lunch, coffee and dessert. The service was slow and inconsistent - they ran out of lots of items. My mango salad with grilled chicken was small with very few pieces of mango and not very fresh spinach with a few craisins on it. The chicken incredibly dry. When I say dry - I mean DRY! It was overall very disappointing. The ice cream was yummy - my kids ate it up. I just don't think this place is worth all the hype. Wish Marcello's wasn't so busy. 2
Aside from Pages [r.i.p.], the only good bookstore in the city, The boutique selection is tailored to people who actually read, rather than line shelves.The guys who work there are amazing. They'll give you all the time in the world to help you find your next book. I said I loved The Believers and Steve Erickson and he pointed me to this brilliant Russian book about a mass serial killer. Haven't read it yet; I'm not a person who actually reads. 5
Went to see the new Star Wars on a weds night. Staff was nice, when they were there. Seats were big and comfy. Food is ok. Hot chocolate was really good. Nice upscale environment. I didn't know they had a parking lot, I would have parked there instead of on the street. We could have seen this movie for free had I known that no one cares if you have a ticket or not. They asked if we needed a tickets when we walked in, or had it we bought them on fandango. I said yes they are on my phone. They waved to go upstairs an no one ever asked to see our tickets. Ever. We sat in the lounge for about 15 min had some drinks. Then into the theater. They have a little button that lights up to call staff. They didn't come in to take orders till the trailers started and it was dark. Ok no biggie. After ordering they asked for my CC and then took it away with them. Out of the theater. I'm not big on that. Then they delivered drinks as the movie started. Not a great time to do that. The food arrived about 15 min later, during an exciting part of the movie. They forgot napkins. Every time they came in to wait on someone in the theater it was a distraction. Eventually that traffic slowed down and we were drawn into the movie. It looked great, sounded good in the theater. Not a lot of seats in each room. And the seats are paired. So it could be strange if you choose a seat next to someone you don't know. If you go alone or a group of friends. Finally they bring back my CC with the bill. During the end. So we miss some details. And this movie is all about the details. Also during the end this teenager in front of us, whips out his phone and starts texting. Then looking at picture of girls. Screen bright as daylight. I was gonna let him finish, but he just kept his phone out. So I pushed the back of his chair, and motioned towards the screen. He was clearly like "What? What did I do? You got a problem?"  He put the phone away. I did not pay over 50 bux for three people to come here and look at his phone. But whatever. I think the idea of the theater is good. But the execution needs finesse. Order before the trailers. Get food and drinks to people before the movie starts. Get out and don't come back during the movie. Over all it was a bad part of town over priced and loads of distractions. I will not be returning. No need. Galaxy has theaters in better parts of town with better service and rules for no distractions. That and candy. The candy selection was weeeeek. Also no cherry slushees. Boo. Lol. 2
Bought my bike online in February 2013. No problem with shipping timeframe. I was in awe when it was finally assembled and rode it whenever I got the chance. Since my first ride, there were clicking noises somewhere in the crank area. I thought that something was loose so I tightened whatever I thought it needed so I can get rid of the clicking. Nope, that didn't work. Tried to ride it out, but that didn't work. Every time I went for a ride, sounded like the cast of Stomp was around because the clicking was in such a pattern that I could probably come up a song while riding. After going to a bike shop, they claimed it was a bad bottom bracket. I replaced it and the clicking noises went away...sort of.  The noise was also coming from the rear wheel.  Disassembled and cleaned out the rear hub/freewheel/fix cog. Still making noises. Played around with the tightness of the chain, but the clicking didn't go away.  After further research, I decided to replace the freewheel cog. Eureka! No more clicking. Seriously, I've only had my bike for about 6 months and I already had to replace 2 parts. It's great that the company can make the bike affordable, but it sucks when you end up with crappy parts that fails to satisfy from day one.  Perhaps I'm just unlucky with that build. Who knows... 3
Came here as a group of 4 for Winterlicious. I have been here outside of the Winter/Summerlicious periods, so I will compare them in a little bit.Corner House is divided among the 2 floors of a house - upstairs is a larger dining area and the rooms below contain the bar, kitchen and 2 smaller dining rooms with a few tables in each. The lower floor is a lot more intimate if you are with a significant other or small group.There is free parking on the street after hours along Madison and Huron Street. A little warning, if you have to wait you'll be crowding the small little doorway and waiters will be madly dashing between rooms.Understand that during Winterlicious food may be prepared with a little less love but it's still worth the price point ($35/person). But if you do choose to come to Corner House outside of their peak periods, you will be treated really well and the food is top notch. I don't recommend the Sirloin steak - try the venison if you're a little more adventurous.Towards the end of our meal the waiters did start to get a little pushy and even took the saucer away from my coffee before I put the cup back down. They do have a lot of customers to serve due to the popularity of the restaurant. Anyways, nothing terrible to say, but not to much to compliment either.To add, if you miss Winterlicious they often have a habit of extending it well into February. 4
Overall I feel the aquarium did an exceptional job in many areas, and needs a little help in others. The exhibits were beautiful, with a great variety of sea life to see. The price is a little steep but I feel you will have a good time and be in awe of many of their larger tanks. A perfect spot to take the children for an afternoon and let them play and learn hands on. I do hope they have the staff for maintenance of their interactive displays as well as the numerous television screens - they provide an abundance of information and I hope they haven't overlooked the amount of wear and tear that will come to them. I am concerned for their busy summer seasons as I feel the crowds will hinder guests enjoyment, as well as the restaurant is a huge letdown. 4
agreeing with jolean s. about horrible service.  i ordered a special which the hostess told me about.  after making my selection and waiting for some time, i was told that the sushi chef was not going to honor the special pricing.  i was in the middle of texting a friend about the great specials this place had.  i walked out as well without trying the food and recanted my rec.  completely ridiculous. 1
I was so happy to found a sushi restaurant inside the hotel. I went there today and sit at sushi bar with my friend. The sushi chef is very nice at first. The food was so good. The service is great. Venny is our server. Here is what make me dissapointed. At the end of our meal when we are ready to leave, the shorter and light skin sushi chef ask me for tip. He said because he already gave me 2 free food but I didn't ask for it! I couldn't believe it!!! This is a J.W. Marriott Hotel and the employee asking me as a customer for a tip??!!! what a shame!! Isn't this hotel train their associates?My friends told me too before about this situation, but I just not belive what they said. Now that I experience myself, I just wonder if he asked to all the customer at the bar for the tip.I would like to give this restaurant a 5 stars but I cannot because the chef ruin the whole thing. Maybe next time I just sit at dining area and enjoy my dinner without somebody soliciting. 2
In terms of my sushi fix in AZ it has come to this. While I'm a sushi fanatic (particularly sashimi) it's an inexpensive way to get a bit of that satisfaction in the desert. I typically go for the bowls (more bang for your buck). My favorite by far has been the 3 alarm roll with spicy salmon. They also have great seaweed and cucumber salads to compliment your roll. Overall the quality is "meh" but what do you expect for inexpensive sushi? It does the job! 3
Counter service. Nice open atmosphere. Looks and feels like a chipotle for pizza. The pizza wasn't anything spectacular, but if you're looking for something quick to eat, this is the place. They did no do a good job dispersing the toppings. We had one slice that basically had just cheese. We asked someone for a towel so we could wipe down the table. He informed us that he would be right back to take care of that. He must have forgotten because when he returned shortly after, he started collecting plates and asking people how everything was going. We had to ask the manager to assist us. Then as we were eating our pizza, we watched the same person that we asked to help us, wipe down a table for two teenage girls. Apparently, to get service you must be a young attractive female. 2
This is an hour of my life that I will never get back!  I have been to many Vegas shows and I have to say...I cannot figure out why this one is STILL running!  No...I know!  Everyone wants to see Holly's boobs!  Well...you have to wait almost the whole show for that and if you can make it that long thru this train wreck of a show, you are a better person than me.  Don't get me wrong...there are a few good parts...The main guy in the show has an AMAZING voice!  Some of the pole work was VERY impressive.  But the show itself is absolutely ridiculous!  I thought there would be a point to show, but apparently there isn't.  The milk bath grossed me out.  The routines were ridiculous, I have one friend that leaned over during the show and said, "I don't get it...did that car just burn off her clothes?", yes, it's that ridiculous!  What does a car have to do with Little Bo Peep anyway?!   I didn't go into this with high expectations, and my expectations were not met AT ALL.  Apparently word has spread that the show sucks, because the theatre wasn't even 1/2 full.  I say skip this and see another Cirque, and I'm not a huge fan of those either (I feel like if you've seen one, you've seen most of them!), but I'd much rather have gone to LOVE or Viva Elvis. 2
This is my favorite place! The salsa is great!  They are quick  and friendly and I've never had a problem!  My family and I have gone here for years.  The tamles and chimichangas are great.  The tacos are good but expensive.  The margaritas are great and cheap! 5
Very cute place. The sandwiches were fresh and tasty. We tried the rossamanna, most Americans won't think of it as dessert, as the sugar amount is same as breakfast cereal. I got coleslaw as a side and it was, too, fresh and not too sweet. 4
I said I like it hot, but don't kill me. I literally thought they forgot the spice even though I saw the guy put something on from a hot sauce bottle. 3
Terrible. The girls here cannot even colour match you without using that little gadget. A real makeup artist can tell you by just looking at you. To conclude no one here seems like they are certified in makeup and has no clue what they are doing or even talking about. The makeup they have on is not appealing either. Looks like a 5 year old did it. 1
Tried Anew for the first time with high hopes for an exciting and exclusive night out. Their affordable prefixed menu stands out from the crowd. The restaurant itself is beautiful and the wait staff is knowledgable and kind. Where it fell flat for my party were the items on the menu and the food that came out. We had noted an allergy in the original reservation and after a phone call and promise of the allergy being taken seriously, it presented as the main fish on the menu. This limited our ability to partake in the 5 course tasting which is why we originally went. So we opted for 3. The food focused on small portions with unique gastronomy and plating. The taste and overall finish of the food could have been improved upon as my pork dish seemed under cooked and was leaking blood, it had the texture of raw bacon. The worst part for me was, I wasn't certain if this is how fancy restaurants cook meat and I was uncomfortable saying anything. The serving sizes are small but I suppose that is to be expected with the price of a multi-course dinner being so fair. So the reason I gave a three rating isn't because we hated it nor because we really liked it. It simply was an experience that we likely wouldn't repeat. We would rather spend our money somewhere that was more comfortable with larger portions and food that focused on taste and less on fancy cooking techniques (there was a lot of foam) and left us feeling fulfilled. 3
Ordered a bunch of dishes. The portions were large and the service was good, but I didn't love the food. Everything was very salty and the spices weren't blended well - it was like biting into a raw, salted cardamom pod. 2
Went to this restaurent with the family while we were in town to see Phantom of the Opera. The service was quite good. However, the dishes tasted nothing like French. I ordered the Chichen. My wife the lamb. My dish was way too salty. My wife complained that her lamb was very bland, over-cooked (she asked for medium rare), and tough. My kid's Croque Monsieur came with a huge pile of fries, which was also way over-salted. It seems the chef got his or her salt for free and would not hesitate to use it liberally. Overall, it was a big disappointment after reading the good reviews. 1
I ordered the Blackened Chicken Po Boy sandwich.  While the chicken was delicious. There was not much chicken in the sandwich.  I wish I took a pic. Basically, I got a small piece of chicken breast cut in half and place on each half of the French bread:( 4
Could have been so much more.  I love going to new restaurants when they just open because that's usually when they are at their best.  They pull out all the stops and with that knowledge, you hope you go in for a memorable time.Unfortunately, it was just decent.  When we asked our waiter about the menu, she barely knew the intricacies about it.  She couldn't even tell me whether the tritip or the sirloin was better since she didn't know what these cuts were!  Maybe we were just unlucky here but that obviously put us off right away as she did not seem confident about the menu.  After we ordered, we waited 1 hour before any food showed up.  It didn't seem too busy either which suggests that it's not a really a smooth sailing ship here.  While only opened a few weeks ago, that's still rather unacceptable in my opinion.When the food came, it was only decent too.  My wife ordered the bacon wrapped trout and it was burnt.  They tried to cover it up by putting the burnt side down but when she took a look under, it was all black.  In retrospect, we should have said something and returned it but at that point, we were so hungry so we just ate it.  Maybe that's why it took an hour for the food to show up; it's because they forgot they were cooking and therefore burnt it all. As for the dessert, it was a mixed-bag too.  The Whiskey bread pudding was super gooey and with just the right amount of sweetness.  It's definitely the star of our meal.  Unfortunately, I had the flourless chocolate tart and it was extremely sweet.  I wouldn't recommend this one.All in all, a meddling experience.  A couple of high points with the nice ambience and whiskey bread pudding, but slow and uneducated staff, burnt fish and a rather boring menu means I will not go back.  It was nice of them to comp the wine as an acknowledgement of their mistakes, but why go to a place that makes so many mistakes in the first place?  Your time and money deserves better. 2
I have been bringing my dogs, old and current, to Villa La Paws -Glendale since they were in the mall at Bell Rd and 28th Drive.  It was a place I thought of as "safe" for my dogs.  I always had good service at the old location and mostly good service at this current location. I have noticed your fees going up and the quality of service going down over the past few months. Today's service, I received yes responses to my requests for bath, brush, toenail/dewclaw clipping, glands, etc. all that is the normal service that I pay for. The groomers have been good in the past to trim the nails back and I make sure I tip according to the service provided. NOT this time.The bathing seems ok but I couldn't tell if their glands were done. The girl at the desk couldn't tell me anything of the service that was done. I got home to find their toenails and dewclaws don't look like they were trimmed at and if they were it was only to take off the tip of the nail.  The fees jumped over the amount I was charged 2 months ago for both dogs so I would have thought the service should have been impeccable but what I go was less.I'm disappointed in current management and the services provided. 2
My husband and I ate here last night and I was disappointed and felt taken advantage of.  The experience as a whole was lovely, from the limo to the decor to the service.  But nothing - nothing - I ate blew me away, and I certainly did not leave feeling like the nearly $700 bill for the two of us was close to worthwhile.I will also add that my experience was very tainted by the fact that the moment we sat down, before we were given a wine list or cocktail menu, we were offered a glass of champagne.  Obviously we should not have accepted without requesting the menu first, but I was shocked to find that they automatically served us $45/glass Veuve without ever telling us that was what we were drinking or hinting at the price.   Nor was my husband informed that the tiny vegetable starter he ordered had a $50 surcharge when they asked him if he wanted to add bone marrow to it. I realize that for some people who dine at JR, money is no object.  And although we went there expecting to spend a lot, I did not feel that it was well spent.(I will add that when we questioned the bone marrow surcharge, it was graciously removed from the bill.  We did not say anything about the Veuve but I  suppose I was still in too much shock.) 2
Please do not eat here. They are the rudest people I have ever met. I just wanted to make a simple reservation and before I knew it I was getting screamed at for no reason. I would stay away if I were you. Consider yourselves warned. 1
Pizza is good, but pricey.High quality ingredients and very fresh! 4
I bought a Groupon and thought I'd try this place out. I was excited to treat myself to a scalp massage and I was hoping for something voluminous or wavy (a notch up from what I normally do at home). The staff was friendly and the salon was beautifully decorated. My biggest complaint was the scalp massage. My roots were being pushed and pulled to the point i felt pain. Every time I thought about saying something she'd soften up. In hindsight I should've just asked her to stop and move on to the blowout. I asked for wavy and not "boing" curls and I ended up leaving with "boing" curls. My scalp was tender for the rest of the day and the style was just meh. 2
Where's the owner?I came in for some dinner on Tuesday. It happened to be their Buck-a-Shuck promotion. But I'm not much for oysters. I sat at the Bar and had a menu placed in front of me relatively promptly by one of the two guys working behind the bar, who appeared to be the only employees working.Some friends of the bartenders who were also at the bar gave me some recommendations on their favorite pizzas. I picked one that sounded interesting and sat back an enjoyed my  soda water. The two guys behind the bar were working hard turning out drinks and Oysters (why the Oyster station is at the bar and not in a sanitary controlled environment in the kitchen was not evident, but they looked to be using the Ice station for the Oysters) but there was precious little activity elsewhere.I kept my faith up, nonetheless.After 20-25 minutes, one of the "friends" who had been drinking at the bar, came back inside from a smoke break, and one of the others said he was going to start making my Pizza. I looked back at the pizza oven and he was ripping off roughly 3 feet of tickets. At that point I gave up and left.I can't fault the two bartenders who were trying to keep turning out drinks and Oysters, but what kind of owner leaves his or her restaurant with no GM and only two staff, especially on a promotional night like Buck-a-Shuck? Don't know if it's been the same owner through the previous two iterations of the place, but if this is how they run their business, it's no wonder it keeps shutting down. It's a shame, I used to like Bensonhurst, but I doubt I'll bother giving this place another shot despite its convenience to me.Pros:Menu and a Glass of water were provided to me quicklyBartender appeared to know the menuGot me a Soda water very quickly when I asked for it.Cons:-No owner or manager on site-Couldn't try food as my order wasn't made.-Unsure if Bartenders' friends drinking at the bar were employees or not. If they were, they were drinking rather than working.-Very understaffed if only two people working on Buck-a-Shuck night.-Oyster Station at the Bar seems unsanitary.-Unsure if Bartender rang in order.-No evident pride in the business. 1
It was my fist time coming here. I ordered the Shrimp Cocktail it was really Good. I also ordered the lunch special a Chicken Chimi,rice and Beans it was OK. My son ordered the Carnitas Burrito,Fries and Beans it was OK. The Salsa and Chips were pretty good. Overall experience was Ok 2
The very best Southwestern Restaurant and New York Pizza joint got married and had an amazing miracle baby named My Slice of the Pie.  This little gem in  Arcadia never disappoints, and owner Randy is always in to make sure of it.  Try my favorite- the Supremo pizza, it has southwest sauce, Pollo Asado, chopped garlic, chorizo sausage, green chilies, roasted corn, red onion, Asadero, mozzarella, and Cotija cheeses topped with chopped cilantro, it's AMAZING!  Though beware, you'll be addicted after your first visit.  Keep up the good work guys!!! 5
This place was very unimpressive. When it was the Mez it was much better. The quality of the food and service has gone down, the bathrooms were a mess and the theater wasn't even ready for us to enter until after the movie was supposed to start. Don't waste your money. 1
Just finished dinner here. Would have given this restaurant 4 stars if not for the terrible service from our waiter Roberto. He seemed to be completely preoccupied with the couple at the table next to us. After our entrees were cleared and we declined dessert, we waited over 15 minutes for our check before we waved down a passing busboy and asked him to send Roberto to our table. Rather than coming himself, he sent the busboy with the check even though Roberto visited the table right next to us about 5 times after our plates were cleared. We were not rude to him in any way, shape or form so I can't imagine why he chose to behave that way. He came by to say sorry as we were signing the check. Too bad because the food and atmosphere were nice and it would have been a pleasant experience if he had made the slightest effort. 3
Happy hour is jam packed, service at the bar is only fair,  fare is a bit pricey.  The sushi rolls, though, melt in your mouth. 3
They don't carry spicy mustard. Excuse is that it goes bad before they can sell it. Really? Only subway I've ever been to that doesn't carry all the same stuff. I mean how much does a case of spicy mustard really cost anyways? Sad! 2
Wishing there were more locations -- but in Henderson @ Green Valley Parkway, you'll find wonderful food, juices, and ambiance with many vegan and gluten free options that do not sacrifice on taste. I send all my clients there! 5
I love this place. Great coffee, great atmosphere. Anytime I'm near there I make time to get a coffee and sneak in a meat pie 5
Came here on a weekday looking for some decent BBQ take out for lunch. At 15 past noon I was one of only three patrons in the restaurant. One of these days I am going to learn that's a bad sign. Cashier was slow and couldn't make change. I cannot believe that's just how they do it in the South and the place is trying to be authentic. The South is known for refined social grace and hospitality. Here I found neither. Got the pulled pork sandwich with potatoes to go. Pork was super dry and there was no sauce included. I would have expected them to put a container of sauce in with a to-go order. Bun fell apart in my hands.Mashed potatoes tasted like one of the ingredients had gone bad, as if rancid butter had been used. Gravy was thin and greasy. Yuck. If this place got a health code violation I would not be surprised. Other reviews are either panning or gushing so the place may be hit or miss. There are enough complaints though about not so fresh food that I think it's best avoided. 1
I've been several times and have not been disappointed yet. The food is typical tex mex but really good! I typically get one of the crazy big burritos and my wife gets one of the chicken dishes (Aroz Something or other I'd butcher spelling). 5
Walked in, got super excited as the Newcastle vs Everton game was on the television. Downhill after that. Not a single customer in the place, but every table was dirty, trash on the floor, seats in disarray. Took 25 minutes to get our food. Still haven't cleaned. Ugh. Next.... 2
This by far the worst park I've ever been to. Dirty with very bad and extremely expensive food (even for an amusement park). Slow service, long lines and poor excuses from management.  The bathrooms and changing rooms are filthy!  I complained to management and they didnt seem to care.  The park was empty and there were still 2 hour waits for some rides due to the slow workers.  I will never come back and suggest you spend you $500 somewhere else! 1
Just save yourself some time and go somewhere else when planning on buying a vehicle. Totally disappointed on how they conduct business. 1
If I was rating on food alone, this would absolutely be 5 stars. We split the tofu tod for an appetizer. Panko coated and fried tofu with a crazy good sweet/spice dipping sauce. The tofu was well seasoned (its easy for fried things to go bland and this didn't) and had great texture. I had chicken pad thai. For $13 it was a generous portion. It came out piping hot and with a perfect level of spice (I requested on the mild side of medium, which isn't easy to nail).I also tried my husband's massaman curry with chicken, sweet potato, and peanut. It was phenomenal, really rich from coconut milk with great flavor and heat. The service here wasn't bad, but they're definitely still learning. Our waitress mentioned that her brother opened the restaurant with his wife, and I'm happy to support a family business while they sort out the kinks. I think this is a great addition to the neighborhood and will routinely be slammed. Glad they offer take out! 4
I stopped into Sunday cycles after a bad experience somewhere else. I met with Joe, He helped me with the parts I needed and put me in contact with some people I did not know to ride with. I strongly recommend this shop!Thanks for your help Joe! I will buy a bike from you soon! 5
About 3 out of every 5 times I find that I have been overcharged for something. Check your receipts carefully! But don't be surprised if the manager fights with you about correcting the price errors. I've even had a manager go take the signs off the shelf so I couldn't prove the price was incorrect. Now I take a picture of the tag or go with the manager when they're doing the "price check" to make sure they don't cheat me out of the shelf price! 2
I've been attending classes and workshops at Bliss Flow for about a year and I absolutely love it.  The studio is clean, spacious and peaceful.  The teachers are warm and helpful.  This is a great place for yogis of all levels to continue their practice.I highly recommend watching their website/facebook for workshops and specials. 5
Great food. Awful, terrible service. Our meal was delicious. Unfortunately we couldn't enjoy it because the waitress was so rude. Ask for a water refill and expect dirty looks. When our food arrived, my bacon was on my boyfriend's plate of pancakes, dripping in syrup. It was hard enough to flag down the waitress, but when I asked if it was my bacon on his plate, she said "yeah" and walked away. Find a better restaurant that values your business. 2
This company can't be for real. I have rarely dealt with such poor servicer or product before in my worst dealings. From the staff to the baggage check in system 1/2 a star. I'll grin and giggle when I hear they went belly up. I know you get what you pay for, but they conduct themselves like it cost a nickel . in the future I'll be avoiding this company at all cost. Just having  their planes at any airport is not a good look. Good luck, you'll need it if you fly spirit. 1
~Before you read my review, just keep in mind that I'm a Hypochondriac~ A celebration, of course is what compelled me to come here to celebrate, to celebrate my cousin getting another stripe on his belt in Kung Fu.  I had been here once before ( though it was an early morning movie, so it might've been cleaner then), and the experience was okay. It was a short movie, so I didn't spend much time in the "theater", nor did I step foot into the bathrooms. But, alas, my messed up perception would soon change. Though, before I go into details, I must confess that I've been to elite theaters, like iPic and beyond, so I might be just a bit of a cinema snob. When we got there, to the ticket booth outside, it looked like a fine place, like the last time that I had been there. We got our tickets and rushed in, since it happened to be a chilly night.   The concession stand was alright, it just had the basics, (and after my second experience, I wouldn't buy anything that could possibly be contaminated) but the good thing was that we only needed popcorn and drinks. Unfortunately, splitting a large popcorn is tough since they only have little soda cups, so it was not as convenient  as getting trays like they have at Harkins.  So far, it was okay. When we got into our screen room, I noticed that it was a bit old (and someone etched a gang sign in a nearby flat wood area by the balcony) but still, all good. The sound and picture quality was alright for the kind of theater this is, but obviously it could of been better.  The problem truly arose when I went to the bathroom. As I was walking, wondering where the bathroom was, I found one by our theater in the back. BIG MISTAKE! I, for a quick second, thought that maybe there was a bathroom in the front, but I just decided to go to the one that I saw.  As I walked in, I froze. Ick! All I saw was outdated equipment like the sinks, and the toilet! Don't even get me started on the stalls! No seat covers, crude graffiti ALL OVER the stall doors, uneven paint (from spray painting over the graffiti) old, disgusting toilets, and now, when I read these reviews, apparently sometimes they have feces smeared all over the walls!? Ugh. THESE PEOPLE ARE F***ING ANIMALS!!! THAT'S EXTREMELY UNSANITARY, EVEN SOMEONE WHO WASN'T A GERMAPHOBE WOULD SAY THAT!!!!! Oh, where was I? Well, anyways, after the movie, I was told that there were bathrooms in the front of the theater.  I WISH SOMEBODY WOULD'VE TOLD ME THAT, BUT THERE WEREN'T ANY STAFF AROUND!!! I didn't feel like exploring this demonic hellhole anymore so I quickly left.                               ~This has been a ChibiNarwhal Yelp rant~ 2
This is my favorite place to get seafood in the valley. Everything I've tried is a hit. Great po boy with big portions of shrimp/oysters. Clam strips, oysters, clam chowder all delish! Even my kids chx fingers were tasty. Staff is always friendly, it's nice & clean. 5
We had very helpful staff both at the desk and in the garage. My only complaint was with the car. We were told at the desk we would get a Chevy and what was waiting was a Dodge Charger. I didn't like the car inside or outside. Service 10, vehicle 2. 4
Kim and I took a drive to see her 98 years young grandmother from Colorado to Scottsdale Arizona on Valentine's weekend. We stopped at Infiniti of Scottsdale, we were greeted by sales representative Stephen Fitch. Stephen is a very personable sales representative, who delivers a no hassel, no haggle, non-pushy enjoyable experience. We upgraded from an '07 H3 to a '08 H3 Alpha Hummer. Thank you Stephen for all your professionalism! Kim & Jeff 4
BEWAREI dropped off my truck in perfect condition, but when I picked it up later that day the "Check Engine" light was on. I didn't accuse anyone of doing harm to my vehicle, but when I brought it up the owner got really defensive. After pressing him for more info he threw me out of the shop, even though I never raised my voice or used profanity. Now that I'm doing more research online it appears that this has happened to multiple people. Even if the light was not the result of the shop's work, the owner seemed to know something he wasn't willing to share and couldn't get me out of the store soon enough. There was no sympathy or understanding, just accusations that I was lying and trying to extort money from him. For the record, the check engine light has never turned on since the truck was brand new until now. As a side note, before starting up my vehicle to drive it away, they advised me that if I post a five star review I would be given a gift and entered into a drawing for a trip to Disneyland. This now explains how they got any good reviews to begin with. 1
They have great donuts but sadly customer service i is lacking. Almost never give me napkins when i order a donut at the drive thru cold coffee at 530 in the morning at the drive thru on many occasions. But they always try to sell you a drink. If i want a drink i will order one 2
Icecream was good but the service today was horrible! Ashton had the personality of a mortician. It was such a depressing energy, I decided to enjoy my DIDN'T LOVE IT outside. 3
Best barbecue in pittsburgh! Ribs are great and moist, choice of regular and the leaner St. Louis style. You can't go wrong with either. We love the chicken here, first time I've tasted vinegar soaked roast chicken and apparently how it's made in some places in upstate new york.Occasionally there might be a bit of a miss with us occasionally getting chicken or ribs more charred but the taste is always there so no big deal. Cornbread is the same thing, sometimes good other times just okay. All are still good when reheating at home. They give out dinner rolls which is just okay... But hey we're here for the meat not the free bread.Their meat is so tasty and flavorful we rarely even use the sauce (there's a spicy option). There are like 3 tables outside but not a good place to eat with constructions going on across. This is mainly a takeout place, not even a bathroom for customers. Still, we will travel just to get takeout their amazing ribs and chicken. 5
Major disappointment.  The service was excrutiatingly slow in spite of the fact that the place was virtually empty.  The food was glop...the "pan roasts" were poorly cooked pieces of shrimp is a sauce that looked and tasted like it was Campbell's cream of tomato soup.  I will never return, and wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.It's worth noting that right next door in the casino is Austin's which I think is one of the most underrated steakhouses in town.  Sadly, the oyster bar is nothibng close in quality or service. 1
Way too expensive! I felt embarrassed for them to charge that much for normal food and portion sizes. I went for the first time and with my two cousins from Germany. I'm really sad that my cousin had to pay extra to have buns on his bison burger because it was originally on a lettuce bun. I went on Burger Week to try their "Detour burger" and had to pay for the fries because they lowered the price by 3$ for the event...which is not a discount if they take away the fries in my opinion. I pretty much payed the same price lol burger was okay but the sack was terrible. Fries were good. Service was slow. In total it cost 60$ plus tip for 2 burgers and 3 drinks. 2
Went here for lunch last week with a work friend.  Barely had to wait, but that's absolutely not the case at dinner time.  The last time we had a friend that wanted to try it, there was a 3 hour wait time  ...that means some idiots agreed to wait 2hr and 45min!!!!!??  Though this place has undeniably good sandwiches, nothing is worth the ridiculous wait.So now they're opening up a couple more restaurants, which makes sense, but also brings forth a cheesy franchise type ambiance.  Tough dilemma.  If I was the owner, I would have opened up more of the almost-same restaurants with slightly different names so they could each offer the same staple meals with a bit of uniqueness.Note to self:  If I ever open a restaurant, give it a name that follows some kind of theme in case it blows up and I have to make more. 3
Great restaurant!  Love the Sunday set menu, and $5 wine.  Certainly one of the better restaurants in the Scottsdale/Phoenix area. Food was great, great atmosphere, Elliot is the man! Been back twice.. with consistent service & food. 4
I was first introduced to Gab's by my Mom.  She had been coming here for various auto repairs and oil changes.  Thank goodness for her recommendation.  I live in the West Valley and am more than willing to make the drive to Gab's so I can have my car fixed by Gab.  Everyone at Gab's Auto Repair is friendly, trustworthy and professional.  Karen and Gab are two of the nicest people. I never feel like they are trying to sell me anything my car does not need. I like their honesty and integrity.  I would recommend to anyone to bring your car here. And it doesn't hurt that Gab reminds me of my step Father-in-law.  :) 5
Good food. Fast, attentive and pleasant service. They check in with you, make sure your coffee or drink is refilled. I have been here a few times. They are always crowded  .. however the crowds never affect the quality and attentiveness of service. 4 stars - Because I wish they had more choices for someone that eats no meat. 4
I went here again, and had very similar items.  I love the fried shrimp so I ordered it again.  It's crunchy and so yummy...completely unhealthy for you, but I'm not really looking to eat healthy when I come here.  I also tried the beef dry pot since I like dry pots, and we all thought the beef one was better than the lamb (it's made the same way but we just like beef more).  The dry pot has bean sprouts at the bottom which I think makes a nice contrast to the spicy beef (it helps to lessen the spiciness and add a crunch).  As for the tofu dish, I ended up liking it as well, but it wasn't what I thought I had ordered.  It's completely my fault though since I don't speak mandarin or read Chinese.  I was thinking by the English description "fried tofu with pepper sauce" that it would be cubes of crunchy fried tofu with a dipping sauce on the side, not a stir-fry with vegetables.My only warning about this place is that if you are like me, and don't speak or read Chinese, you will find it more difficult to speak with the waitress and read the menu.  I'm ok with trying new things though so it's not a big deal to me.  Also you might feel a little uncomfortable among a full restaurant of Chinese speakers.  This time around, the waitress didn't say a single word to us, hehe, she didn't even try.  I don't care as long as the food comes and is yummy. 4
Save yourself wasted money and transmission problems.  Never buy a Ford.  Even if there's a lawsuit saying your car is messed up Hillbish will give it back denying a single issue.  Drove it right over to Huntersville Ford and they fixed two things.  Ford has been sued for faulty transmission several times since 2012.  Just walk away from any Ford. 1
I was a long time customer of MyPublisher before Shutterfly bought them and absorbed them, so I was more than willing to give Shutterfly a try. But I did have a number of questions about certain MyPublisher features that I was hoping Shutterfly would adopt. I have now tried and failed THREE times to get answers to my questions:Attempt #1: Questions submitted through Shutterfly customer service webpage. No response at all.Attempt #2: Live online chat with a pleasant person who had no idea what the answers were and no inclination to ask someone else.Attempt #3: Another submittal through the customer service webpage. It got automatically redirected to MyPublisher, whose response was "We're not in business any more. Please contact Shutterfly."Three strikes and you're out. I will not be using Shutterfly for my photo books. Atrocious customer service. 1
not a great experience at all since it changed from paradise bakery. the cashier was very rude and seemed miserable to be working. ordered a salad and soup and the salad was 50% wilted and no flavor whatsoever, and the soup was very very bland. definitely not impressed and spent way too much for bad food ): 1
The I love Bacon burger is one of the best bugers I've ever had and not only do I love burgers, but I am picky. I liked this place so much I kept thinking about it every time I ate a burger in Vegas. I actually ended up going back a second time before I left. 4
A bit of an upset. 20 min after i placed my order, went to pick my pizza and wings. The pizza looked and tasted like it had been sitting out for an hour. The wings were still hot but unfortunately not as tasteful as they looked. Thought I'd try something new in the area but now I'll stick to what i know. 2
I'm not sure there's a solution to it, but the cones they have up to direct the line make it extremely tough to get in line when coming from the road. Two cars got caught up in the line when trying to just go past it in the short time I was there. The food is just perfection, of course. In-N-Out is always delicious! 4
Went to this place 1st time on Fathers Day 2015, Walked in offered immediate seating outside under mister, or 1/2 hour wait, choose to sit out side, NOT hot w/ mister and shade, order chicken wing and waffle, when in Rome do what makes sense, got fried green tomato as app, both were excellent, other food ordered was banana nut pancakes and adult mac and cheese. First time ever to this place and have to say food was all excellent, big portion and quality food.2 NEGATIVE-- Service was horrible, slow, slow, slow, 20 mins from sitting down until even took drink order, and great portion size but very expensive, so value for what you pay for, but if you would like a small cheap meal this is not the place, giant portion 3
I don't get what all the hype is about Earl of Sandwich. I've eaten here a few times and the sandwich is small (I need to order at least two) and the service is always slow. Looks like not everybody else here agrees with me but that is how I feel. 2
After waiting twenty six excruciating minutes for pedestrians to finish crossing from the Starbucks to the other side, we turned into the treasure island main entrance only to be redirected to the "self-parking" area prior to checking-in. After the excruciating process of finding a parking space we stepped from our Prius into the excruciating, and miserable, heat. Unloading our modest amount or luggage we unknowingly began our journey to the TI lobby. We rush into the air conditioned block of elevators adjacent to the parking garage and hit the glowing brick that says 'casino/hotel'. The ding announces our arrival. We exit and look down an unfamiliar and unmarked hallway. I turn to my partner, "is this the way?" His response, "I believe it is the only way." We take a step towards our inevitable doom towards the clatter and commotion of the intoxicated arcade. We come across a set of escalators downward to the gates of hell it seems, but no the sign disagrees stating, 'hotel/casino' once again. I turn and hesitate, we continue on. Once at the base we are surrounded by merchandise and flyer flickers pleading for our attention, "NO!" We manage to mumble, "we just want to set down our things and take refuge before facing death." They refuse our pleas. We walk for minutes that seem like hours, "which way?!" Do we really have to walk through this mini-mall to get to out hotel lobby?! It was right there?! Or so we thought. Finally after confused wandering, we found ourselves at the back of the line for the TI check-in. How we managed to find it, I still cannot recall. Honestly, what is the point of hiding the check-in? As I carry my luggage to the elevators towards our room I wonder, "do they really think I will stick in a few dollars as I make my way to the front desk? With what free hand? And if the reason for this labyrinth is to punish me for the sin that is self-parking, success. True success TI. Excruciating failure, but your brilliant success."*We did not have to pay the resort fee, thank god, because we booked with hotwire. Also don't use the two for one drink coupons! It's a lie! 25$ a drink! But the room was great for 55$ a night... 4
ZERO stars. As I was in a back room in my home vacuuming I had a knock at my door which I did not hear. My fault there. I had my phone on me and received a voice mail to call a number that was different than the number on my phone. I call and give my name and say apparently I had someone at my door sorry I didn't get to them or hear it. I get told that once they leave the area that's it. No coming back. So I say ok I'll only be home until noon the next few days. I get told by the lovely lady on the other end that that's just not possible for them so I can call another time when I'll be available to recieve my order.  So whoever spent good money on flowers for me just wasted their money. Very poor and disgusting customer service. I will make sure I pass this on to everyone I know. 1
This may be bad for Von's, but I love coming into this store because IT IS SO QUIET!! Not many people come to this store...the usual noise is absent here...one can shop in peace and actually hear what they are thinking.... 4
DeEtte's work is amazing! I was looking to add bright colors to my hair and I definitely wasn't disappointed. I brought pictures for inspiration and she far exceeded what I had imagined. DeEtte took her time to make sure I got what I wanted and was a real artist with my hair.  She was welcoming and very knowledgeable. I not only got a great color, cut, and style but I left having a better understanding of how to take care of my new look. She is my go-to from this point forward. 5
I'm glad I gave this place a shot, I ordered the Santa Barbara and I was not disappointed.  I was surprised to see that you have to pay for fries separately but no biggie. There was not much variety there and I will admit that the employees don't know the menu as well as I expected. (I usually like to as them their recommendation or their most popular item) The Santa Barbara was delicious, it comes with bacon, avocado on sourdough bread. (Highly recommend this if you're a simple ingredient type of person) Their location is also great, it's across the street from Zoyo's (frozen yogurt) and if you have a picky eater you have chipotle, Mad Greens, NYPD, Wingstop, and Foce guys in the same plaza. 4
This place has an absolutely horrible policy with high chairs and boosters... They  are kid unfriendly...the food is ok and prices are ok. The service is also slow... I will not come here again!!! 2
Amy H. was great. She was very accommodating and willing to give input while keeping your preferences at the forefront of the appointment. I received a cut and partial highlights and found the prices extremely reasonable. I would definitely be a regular if I didn't live on the East Coast! 5
Look it's simple if you are going to be expensive and obnoxious you must deliver "Period!" We ordered the onion soup which was cold and had barely any cheese so we sent it back; I mean it was brutally cold. Finally after a good 15 min wait the soup arrived and tasted bitter with notes of citrus rind, nutmeg and I don't for the life of me know why it tasted like it had lavender. Talk of taking something great and butchering it just to be different. Next we ordered Wagyu with a side of mushrooms fingerling potatoes and mashed potatoes which I'm not going to even bother to remember what fancy name they choose for mash. I love Wagyu rare but they brought it medium the fingerling potatoes were dry, the mash was good but I mean who can screw that one up and the mushrooms, well at that price they could have choosen Something better than shiitake. We were asked if we wanted dessert but we figured that we had enough crap for the evening. $350 bucks plus gratuity later I say FU Ramsey start looking after your own restaurants before fixing other people's. 2
Holy Oak is down the street from a sewing place where I've been taking lessons and it's the closest place to get coffee, so I've been a few times.  Very hipster, the kind of hipster where the owners don't think an overhead sign is necessary, instead there is a little small one on a sandwich board out front.  The servers are pleasant in a cautious sort of way, as though they know I'm not a regular and don't want to get too close.  No drip coffee, but the latte was decent and they have tasty ginger molasses cookies. 2
Had the Drake burger, which was on promo for their 10 year anniversary. I thought that the burger was pretty good; I really liked the cheese and the bacon was very smokey and flavorful. I really like the bun - it was slightly chewy and toasted with butter. Also came with a pickle. What really stood out were the fries that came with the combo. I believe that the fries were twice fried with sea salt. I am definitely a fries girl and these were one of the best! I probably wouldn't pay full price for the burger ($19), but perhaps I would might just to have the fries. 4
If you are interested in a basic haircut stop by this shop.  The barbers are unskilled and unable to provide anything other than a cookie cutter haircut. 1
The food is good, but the service is tooooo slow!!! Not recommend if you are not free for a 2 hour dinner! 3
Great selection of large burritos. It's a little more chain feel than El (or is it Los) Campasinos across the street, but it still has good food. 3
Purpose: for work, have stayed here frequently (50+ nights)Pros:- Rooms: I like that they have different styles of rooms and I sometimes score with the corner rooms (which feel bigger). - Rental Car Service: is located right downstairs. Pickup/drop off cannot get any easier. (Note: they close early on Saturdays and are closed on Sundays)- Gym: it's the YMCA, so it's a legitimate gym. - Concierge Lounge: always open for bar snacks and drinks. Open on weekends. Love the free full-sized water bottles.- Location: less than a 10 minute walk from the Bank of America stadium. Makes it easy/fun for Panther game days! Also, it's connected to various buildings, so you can get pretty far w/o walking outside.- Early Check In: has been granted each time I've come in earlier than check-in time.- Security: requires key cards in their elevator.Average:- Check In: generally takes longer than it should. Multiple times, when checking in during the evenings, there's no one at the front desk and I'll have to wait a bit for someone to come out.- Bellboy: always generally have to wait for someone; not as attentive as I've experienced at other hotels.- Concierge Lounge: the food offered is generally nothing to look forward to (chicken wings, mini corn dogs, etc.). However, the set up is nice and the view is pretty great.Cons:- Showers: I prefer showers with bathtubs and most of their rooms don't have that. Makes it difficult to warm up the water w/o getting sprayed from the shower!- Gym: they close early on Saturdays and are closed on Sundays.- WiFi: not free for non-Rewards members- Restaurant: it's not amazing and in my various stays, I've only found 1 item that I like: Tuna Crisp.- Key Cards: I always have trouble with these deactivating during my stay (even though I do a good job of keeping them away from credit cards/ phones).Unexplored:- ParkingOverall: I come here for work and really just need a bed and shower, so the rest is not too bothersome for me (but I've listed them as they may be important for others). The pros/cons balance out some of the pros/cons I've noted at the Marriott City Center hotel, so it's hard to say one is better than the other. 4
Staff was nice, but $9.00 for a shot of Jameson's. That's some bullshit. The bar tender told me that it was the best bar on st Clair w. I disagree. About 5 minutes after she made that proclamation, the owner came in and made her cry. 3
The service is very bad. And recently they changed their chef. The food quality and quantity went way down. And with these situation they actually drove up their price!!! Hugh disappointment. 2
I love Mad Mex!  I know I'll have a guaranteed good time.  The food is tasty, they offer a good beer selection, the service is friendly and attentive and they play cool music.  My one complaint is the meals are too big!  But they let adults order off the kids menu.  Not many places allow that, but Mad Mex always meets my request.  Mad Mex puts their customers first!  Oh, and they let you sample the beer! 5
Great lunch menu. Food here is always good but the service can be kind of hit or miss. They had one waitress named Jamie that was probably responsible for drawing in half of their business. 4
16 flavors & So many toppings to choose from and they have pomegranate seeds! Indoor and outdoor seating options. My new favorite yogurt shop. 5
I am also pretty surprised by the negative reviews.  Came here for my birthday on a Saturday night, arrived around 7:30 with a group of 9, waited in the bar upstairs about 1/2 hour for two lanes.  Had a GREAT time, and the service was friendly too.  I LOVED getting drink service while I bowl.  YES, it is more expensive than your typical bowling alley, due to the fact that it is 1) downtown 2) a lot nicer than your typical alley (did I mention the drink service while you bowl?!).Anyway, it was a great way to start off the night, we had a couple of games of bowling and then took off to another bar (and didn't have to rent a car or take the subway for 1/2 hour to get to the alley - major plus). 4
I love this place. I recommend it all the time. However, I always....and I mean ALWAYS have to explain to people that this is "not the place with the little flag that gets you more tacos" This restaurant has a special place in my heart. 5
Horrible service. First, I wanted it to go and it was presented to me for dine in. Second, the sandwich was wrong, even after I asked if it was a BLT with Avocado. Good thing I checked before I left. And there was no acknowledgement of the inconvenience and wait time. That goes a long way. Will likely find another Einstein to go to. 1
Great food with the right amount of serving and cheap drinks! 4
I know that indian and pakistani food is hot, but why can't restaurants learn to tone it down a bit.  I can tolerate some heat, but if a medium is too hot for me to eat, that is bad.  If you like hot food you probably will like the food.  Quality and flavor were otherwise good.  The portions were generous.  My wife got chicken tikka marsala, extra mild, she could not eat it but it was fine for me - good flavor.  Samosas were good, nice cardamom and cumin flavor.No ambiance. now this normally does not bother me, in fact my idea of a good ethnic restaurant is great food and no ambiance.  However, minimal or no air conditioning would have made eating there unpleasant.  Try take out. 2
I love public transit and I hate the TTC. The TTC is the worst public transit system I have experienced anywhere in the world. In the past year I have used transit in Montreal, New York, Los Angeles, Paris, London, Frankfurt, Rome, Athens, Mexico City... I'm probably forgetting a few but you get the point. I won't get into how filthy and unreliable the entire system is for the sake of ranting about my biggest pet peeve. Streetcars. They clog the city and should have been buried many years ago. (Not to mention the havoc their slippery tracks wreak on cyclists) If the city can't afford to burry them, at least give them dedicated lanes like on Spadina. The $3 fare is too expensive, tokens should be sold at many more outlets throughout the city and the Metropass is a joke. It's only worthwhile if you're taking the TTC twice a day, 5 days a week. If you're skipping even one day it's cheaper to use tokens all month. The whole point of a monthly pass should be to save people money and entice them to use transit more often. I would rather walk 30min in the middle of winter (and often do) than give the TTC three of my hard earned dollars. 1
Wow! What a relaxing place to get away from reality. Colette is so personable and friendly. She cares a lot about customer service and making sure you are pleased with all aspects of your time there. The Spa pedicure is TOP NOTCH! Hands down, the best pedicure in town.....the hot towels wrapped around your feet take you to a relaxing state of mind. 5
Not sure what the hype is.  Probably the worse meal I've had.  Burger was soggy and there was too much sauce.  When the patty slips and slides out of the bun while you try to eat it, there's something wrong.  Fries were stale and oily.  My husband's Avocado club wasn't any better.  Burger itself was bland, the bacon cold, and avocado was not fresh at all.  Definitely not worth the $22 I paid. 1
We arrived to mgm grand on November 24 2016 my wife and I, first thing we notice is that they start charging money for parking even the hotel guests, if you chose to use the valet service the hotel will charge you $18 per day if you use the self parking the hotel will charge you $10 a day, I personally think it is very very not good for hotel to charge his guests money for parking.We step in to get our key to the room, Ryan was a very nice guy behind the counter check everything and told us that the room we order on line is not available so he will upgrade us to a bigger room the only difference is that we will have a queen bed instead of king , we sad OK took the keys and went up to the room, once we stem in we notice that the room was not clean at all and the bad Cover was on the bad, half on the bad and half on the floor. Besides that we didn't like the very SMALL queen bad. we go down to the desk to Ryan again and told him about the room wasn't ready for new guests and that we like to get a king bed just like we order at the beginning, Ryan went to his manager and come back to us says that the manager didn't confirm him to give us a king bed unless we pay additional price of $20 a night!!!!!!!! We order from the beginning a king bed and they can't supply it so we need to pay additional  $20..We ask to speak with the manager his name is Dominique, SUPER RUDE AND VERY NOT PROFESSIONAL FOR A MANAGER!!after going back and forth with him about us getting the room we order with no additional price he finally agree to give us a king size room BUT, WE WENT IN TO THE ROOM STEPPING IN TO THE ROOM AND GUESS WHAT!?!?!?! THERE IS A COUPLE HAVING SEX ON THE BAD ASKING US "WHAT'S GOING ON"DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THING ANY WHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD???we went down to Dominique asking him to cancel our deal with Them and give us our money back, he said he can't do it since we don't give him a chance to fix the issue, DOMINIQUE YOU ARE VERY NOT PROFESSIONAL MANAGER AND ALL THIS WASN'T SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN FROM FIRST PLACE IF YOU WERE JUST GIVING US THE ROOM ORDER!!YOU GAVE ME A KEY TO A ROOM WHERE 2 PPL HAVING SEX ON THE BAD AT 1AM!!!GUYS DON'T GET ANY CLOSE TO THIS HOTEL EVEN IF IT'S FOR FREE! 1
My fiancee went to this salon because of the proximity to our condo and the reviews on Yelp. She came home complaining of what a horrible exp;erieince it was for her. Her nailperson started out by cutting off her nails (she was to get a fill) at all different angles and then ripping them off her nailbeds one by one. My fiancee was literally yelling "ow!) and the nailperson just laughed and said,"your funny." She proceeded to rip them off and leave the fragments all over the table until my fiancee told her to stop because her fingers hurt. She then stuck them in solution and proceeded to continue with what was described as dirty equipment with her dirty nails. After my fiancee complained the nailperson was very rough in treating her nails and at one point left the table to look at another nailperson showing the results of her pregnancy test, clearly not knowing what the results were. If it weren't for her nails being in a state where she couldn't get up and leave she clearly would have.To end it all, intstead of the $18 listed, the nailperson charged her $30. We are from San Diego and never did she come home complaining from a nail appointment like she did this time. Don't waste your money! 1
All units are 2 one bedroom suites. You enter your door to a foyer which then shows a door on the left and the right. Each one opens to an identical one bedroom suite. One unit has a shower only, the other has a bathtub.All,are condo style- equipped with dishes, pots and pans, etc.The building we were in had a view of the South Pointe Casino next door. At night it light up very brightly, so room darkening curtains were there. The hallways were carpeted and the walls were very thick. You never heard people in the halls which was a plus!We did not use the amenties onsite so we don't know what was available.This is a great place to book when large parties come to town.It is located quite a ways from the strip. There are free shuttles to the local sgopping areas. 4
The food is delicous, but a little pretentious for my taste. The crowd is a bit foodie-alternative which also was a little snooty for us to just chill out and relax. The service was a bit slowNone of us had the BBQ, but we smelled like it all day after leaving (it smells great in the restaurant) so I assume that it is quite good.The ingredients are all fresh and locally sourced for the most part which feels good to purchase and good for the local economy.All-in-all, not really my cup of tea, but a great asset for Ahwatukee for those who are looking for a local, fresh culinary adventure. 3
Never takes card after 10pm. Slow and often not the most friendly. The store its self is nice but the service is just so slow 1
I was really excited to see that they had opened up here, but the excitement was quickly tempered by the staff, and the cupcake itself. It is really small, and all three times I've been there, you feel like you're walking into a private conversation between either the staffer and their cell phone, or the staffer with a friend or fellow staffer. They just pause when you walk in, look at you, and quickly rush you through your order so that they can continue on with their private matters. At least that's how I felt. As for the cupcakes themselves, they're definitely not awful, but there are better around. Another reviewer noted that they experienced a dry, grainy texture with the cake, which I also experienced, all three times. The good thing is that there is a good selection of flavours.Bear in mind that, these cupcakes are still better than the super dry ones at Loblaws. But if I'm paying this premium, I'd expect nicer staff, and a yummier cupcake.Overall, I'm disappointed. I gave it three tries, and will stop now. 2
Love this place! It was my first time at Buck & Rider and I was blown away by this restaurant and everyone who works here. The ambiance was great because it offered a more intimate setting with just the right amount of music to make it fun and upbeat. Management was extremely friendly and stopped by on several occasions to make sure we were enjoying our dining experience. Our server Gabriella was very knowledgeable as well, and couldn't have been nicer. We loved the drinks (I had the Your Money or Your Life and my girlfriend had the One Night in Babylon) which we both agreed were some of the better specialty cocktails that we have had in a long time. We started off with the crab and macadamia roll along with the crunchy shrimp roll which were both incredible but the best surprise of the night came when the steamed PEI mussels hit the table. YOU NEED TO ORDER THESE. They are honestly so good that I am worried my description of them will not do them justice so please just trust me and order them. For the main course I had the 8oz grass fed filet which was perfectly tender as well as the grilled salmon which was cooked to perfection. To top it off we had the lemon meringue pie and just like the mussels I am insisting that you order this when you go. Will definitely be back very soon, thank you for the great food and service! 5
Stay far away from this place. This practice is only concerned about money.READ THE BAD REVIEWS...They are SPOT ON! They cant seem to keep the good Dr's and their replacements seem to have the attitude and demeanor like you are somehow inconveniencing them in some way. Do yourself and and your loved ones a favor and look elsewhere!!! 1
My friends and I were so excited to try this restaurant. When we heard bottomless wine and Italian food, we couldn't get there fast enough! We went this past Monday at 5:30 - not exactly what I would call a busy time. We had bread, salad, and food within 30 minutes, so we were feeling very rushed. I wasn't even halfway through my entree when the server was already coming by asking if we wanted cappuccino. The food was sub-par, nothing to write home about (the salad was DRENCHED in dressing and inedible). They gave us two carafes of wine - one white, one red. There were 5 of us, and we were never offered any more. From seating to signing the bill was exactly 1 hour. We asked our server Gerson for another carafe as we still had quite some time to kill before our show. His response was, "I can absolutely give you more wine; however I need this table so you will need to drink this in the lounge." I have NEVER in my life been asked to get up from a table, ESPECIALLY after only one hour. We were absolutely appalled, and this will probably keep me from going there in the future. 2
I requested an insurance quote from the Adams Agency using their on-line system.  Their agent contacted me promptly for more information and e-mailed my various quotes.  Unfortunately, after sharing my e-mail address with them, within 48 hours I was receiving junk mail for auto warranties, home owner warranties, life insurance, and other e-mails related to the industry.  For that reason alone I would never use this company. 2
Terrible service, long wait times, rude staff. Botched a simple suture. Had to return because the wound became infected after lack of proper instructions on care, and stitches didn't hold. Waited 3 hours to be told they couldn't do anything. Avoid at all costs. 1
I have been going here for over 4 years. I love it! Every one is friendly and they know what they are doing. Kim is a real professional. I would not change for the world. 5
Amazing show! Was our first show in Las Vegas and it did not disappoint. We had seats in the 2nd row and the view was great. You could tell that they weren't using any wires. The acts were so talented. There were many parts were the audience got very nervous for the entertainers due to the act they were performing. There was good comedy, good music and very talented entertainers. Loved every minute of it! 5
Huh not good. Nice and clean place but need lots of improvement on food. Shrimps tempura was a 1 star! 2
The food here is great!  Our server, however, could have used a refresher course on manners.  We decided to eat here on our last day of staying at Palazzo.  At check in, we received a 20% off coupon, so why not??  We noticed the Happy Hour was about to begin...double score!!  We were told that happy hour is either on the sweltering hot deck overlooking the strip or at the bar.  We opted for the empty bar to partake of the 2 for 1 drinks.  The menu offered one selection of whiskey, vodka, gin, etc.  My BF wanted whiskey on the rocks, she informed us they had no whiskey!!!???  WHAT??  OK...no problem, he's flexible and had the gin instead.  I'm sure VEGAS runs out of alcohol all the time...!!We ordered Kobi beef sandwich and fish and chips (off regular lunch menu, not happy Hour selection).  We LOVED it and ate every last bit.  Just as we were enjoying that feeling of finishing a delicious meal and sipping on that last little bit of drink, the waitress's Tourettes Syndrome rears its ugly head..."OMG, I've never seen 2 people finish and order of fries before.  You guys ate everything on your plate.  I've never seen that in my 6 months of working here!!:"  By now, the bar area is a bit fuller and people are starting to look over at us!  We are not overweight or overly sensitive people so, we laughed it off and joked back, but I was like WTH is wrong with this lady???I guess maybe there was a stray dog tied up outback that was supposed to get our scraps because I have never seen someone get so excited and shocked over an empty plate beforeIf you want to eat in the restaurant, I suggest wearing your thickest skin, eating only half your meal, or doing take out... 3
This is excellent sushi. The fish is fresh and the selection superb. I usually order the small chef's choice sushi plate. I always enjoy the array of sushi and rolls I'm given, and it is a bargain at $15. Be sure to try the bonito... Wow. For sushi lovers and haters alike, the miso black cod is a star. Nice sake variety too. 4
I had a wisdom tooth pulled by Dr. Buch last week.  It was as pleasant an experience as having your tooth pulled could possibly be.  Dr. Buch explained everything to me beforehand, and also kept me informed during the procedure, which I really liked.  HIs assistant Jessica was so friendly and really helped put me at ease.  All of the office staff were great.  Making the initial appointment was easy and when I needed to make a follow-up appointment, they got me in right away.Many years ago, my then teenage daughters had Dr. Mansfield pull their wisdom teeth and he was great, too.  So, I highly recommend Southwest Oral Surgery! 5
been back TWICE since i had the fried chicken sandwich and believe it or not both times i came back a manager/supervisor came over and told me they "ran out of buttermilk chicken" once i can understand twice your just incompetent.service was absolutely horribleyou lost a customer 1
This is the coolest thing to do in Vegas under $20.00!If you love Sports, memorabilia and want to have a couple hours indulging that, go to this exhibit. The Marcus Allen Collection is complete from CIF High School to Hall of fame...Incredible...Rings, awards, jerseys..the works.The memorabilia is without question the best collection around, from Ali/Frazier tickets, babe Ruth game worn, Heisman trophy.....the list is incredible.The staff are the biggest fans here, they are massively knowledgeable without being aloof, get involved in the interactive exhibits and generally make the thing come to life.  DO NOT just walk by the contracts/letters in the initial walkway, these things are gold...Howie Longs letter from Al Davis and Warren Moons agents back and forth regarding potential lockout....Pure Gold!Anyway, loved it, recommend it..Go. 5
Love me some fresh frozen custard, especially from Nielsen's! The hot pastrami grinder sandwiches are awesome too!! It's a bit pricey but the employees are nice, the restaurant is clean and they have quick service. Definitely worth trying if you haven't yet! 5
The overall feel of the reviews here are pretty on point. The reason to go is for the beer selection, the best time to go is for happy hour, it seems a bit too pricey for my taste otherwise. The food is overall pretty average, the appetisers seem better to me than any of the entrees that I have tried. My best suggestion is to ignore any of the things that it is trying to be, it is not a particularly great restaurant but it is an awesome bar for the beer lover, and the appetisers are definitely adequate for an accompaniment to the beer. 4
The food is good but a lil' pricey, however the restaurant is open until 2am; so that's very convenient.  The service can be better but I'm used to Chinese restaurants, they all kinda have an attitude. You must try their deep fried tofu ~ it's delicious. 3
Decent store, clean. Decent service, nothing exceptional. (Better everday prices at fancy Fry's on Shea). Usually come here when they have a sale for something specific, like $0.99 eggs. Their regular priced items are usually more expensive than the larger grocery chains. Sometimes, when beer is on sale, they have decent prices. 3
I've lived in DC and Chicago, two great food towns.  There is no Thai place in either town that compares to this one. Tofu pad Thai makes being vegetarian worth it and picking your spicy level (1-10, 6 for me) is awesome. Authentic food for suThe lunch special is cheaper than Panda and a million times better. The service is not perky but that's part of the charm. Very small seating area and not much to look at, but get past that because you will love it! This will always be on my Vegas to do list when I return. 5
My kid loves Lisa and the place! The only thing is for parents the waiting area is a little too crowded ... 4
At the outset, excellent service - very frequent and attentive, but not disingenuous or perfunctory.As a group of 6, we ordered various dishes to sample:- one whole chicken: excellent; tender and moist- one whole Uncle Ray's Seoul Brother Fried Chicken: tender and moist with some spice and kick- Truck Stop sandwich: decent hot chicken sandwich entree; open face pulled chicken sandwich with gravy and peas; the gravy is really heavy on the black pepper; the bread is thicker than Texas Toast (but not toasted) and the chicken was tender; though I like peas, they didn't do anything for me for this dish- Lightning Chicken plate: super spicy battered chicken on thick bread; for spicy food fans, this takes it up a notch and can clear your sinuses; tons of batter, but otherwise the chicken is again nice and tender and moist- Butter Lettuce Salad: excellent salad; great complimentary flavours with the rich dressing and good serving size - Poutine (Triple Cooked Fries): average; cheese curds and gravy were sparse and could have used more- Spit Fired Sweet Potato: excellent side of 4 small servings; very soft and gently sweet; - Mikey's Southern Coleslaw: nice side, good portion size; not too creamy and subtle flavoursTriple chocolate brownie: chocolate brownie with chocolate sauce and chocolate ice cream that's excellent for the chocolate lover; the brownie was nice and fresh and the ice cream was great; loved everything except for the sprinkled saltThe mains and sides came in skillets and I liked how they provided small tongs to everyone for easy sharing.All in all, decent food and excellent service - great first impression. 3
One of my favorite places in Pittsburgh! The noodles come out quickly and are so so delicious. Their portions are huge, but the noodles warm up nicely in the microwave if you end up taking leftovers home. 4
What gives?  I have seen some negative review of club sport lately, but they all get taken down.  I have been a member since 2005.  Great things about Club Sport:There is an amazing salon and a solid day spa on site.  They serve food and beer.  The family vibe is nice if you are not looking for a meat market.  Lots of courts. Lots of classes.  Not so great things about Club Sport:Outdated machines.  Low level of cleanliness.  If you notice, most of the people raving about how clean it is went to a Yelp event.  I guess they put on their A game for that day.  If you look around the machines, it is shocking how poor the cleaning is.  In addition, this is the only club I have belonged to that doesn't provide spay bottles with disinfectant.  Customer service varies from exceptional to exceptionally poor, depending on who is there.  When I signed up, they promised me free guest passes whenever I wanted them.   I only asked for them once a year, for an out of state guest.  Management told me that I would have to pay $15 a day for my out of state guest even though I have been a member for years at the highest membership dues (tennis club membership). 2
My boyfriend and I travelled to Las Vegas for the first time and we had a wonderful time! Joanne and Mark, helped me surprise my boyfriend with a birthday couples message! From the start they were friendly and professional. My phone call was returned within the hour and after a brief description I booked our appointment. We stayed in contact via text, to keep my boyfriend from knowing anything. On time, clean, wonderful setup with relaxing music. Personable, knowledgeable with their magical hands. We decided this will be a tradition for us in Vegas! Why waist your money in a spa when Joanne and Mark can come to you for a reasonably price? I've lived in OH, VA, FL, TX and now TN. and this message was the best yet!! 5
My quest for a good, authentic Mexican restaurant in Lake Norman continues.  I would place this one a bit above the others I have tried (I excuse the excellent Verde from this list, and would call it Mexican-inspired fine dining).  The flavors have more depth, more nuance, than typical suburban Mexican restaurants.  The menu is extensive, perhaps too much so.  But the steak in my Burrito Verde was overcooked, dry, and tough.  The margarita did taste like it was from a mix.  The service was good.  This location has proven itself challenging, and, sadly, I would not bet on El Toro's success. 3
The real stand out was the appetizer "mixed plate variety of appetizers"...WOW. just outstanding side sauces,  truly.  the beef and chicken stay on this dish was succulent and flavorful; the steamed shumai dipped in the hot/sweet sauce was YUM...Sweet attentive wait staff, my lemongrass chicken entre was juicy and flavorful, not so spicy hot it couldn't be eaten, just spicy but enough to make your sinus open up a hair.  my companions beef and macadamia nuts was very good.  Our dessert was fried ice cream I can only give an average rating. 4
We spent the night here after spending 3 nights in a different hotel further down the strip, and my girlfriend's first comment was "Downgradeeeeeeeee....".  Which it is, even perhaps from your local motel.The Luxor has done something tricky.  They've managed to disguise their 2-star hotel by spotting it with 4-star features, like "internet" and "buffet" and "shows".  They also have "concierges" and "room service".We were actually greeted first not by hotel staff, but by one of the discount-ticket booths that try get you into purchasing all sorts of whatnots.  This was bad sign #1.  We then proceeded to the huge check-in line, which managed to stream out to the door.  This was bad sign #2.  It literally seemed like it would be more beneficial to listen to the discount-ticket seller than waiting in that monstrosity.After eventually getting our room keys and trekking to the proper elevator, we had the pleasure of watching the room service staff at work.  Somebody had left their unfinished meal outside, and the staff was "cleaning" it.  This meant moving it from the corridor to a secluded corner where the remnants of who-knows-how-many meals also lay.  The best part was that the leftovers remained there untouched until we checked out the next day!  Mmmm... delicious.  This was bad signs #3 and 4.Walking around this hotel is a chore in the pyramid.  Each corner only serves certain floors, so if you're unlucky enough to be in the 50% (yes, 5-0) that are on the opposite side of the building from your specific elevator, you're going to be walking a LOT.  After trekkiing to our room, opening the door to our room, we were greeted with a beautiful view of the airport's runways, carpet from the mid-90s, a CRT television (wow!), and an air conditioner that made my old college dorm seem palacial.The bed was like a cupcake - not something you want to sleep on.  It was just a huge mattress topper, but with little support to speak of.  The bathroom was pretty spartan, so it did actually feel like we were living similarly to the ancient Egyptians.  I guess they can get their 1 star from this.  They offer internet, which was wired from a 25-foot cable set inside your dresser.  Somehow, they have decided to install a router in every room, but neglected to get wireless, or more importantly a digital thermostat.  Your air conditioner is the On-High-Med-Low/Hot-Cool kind, so if you find yourself alone, late at night, waking up to change your room temperature, fear not.  For you are already at the Luxor.Needless to say, we didn't feel particularly encouraged to spend time at the casino or the restaurants, so we walked the 1/2 mile or so to citycenter and spent the rest of the day there.Even for the low prices, you're getting ripped by their ~20$ resort fee.  The only reason I'd stay at the Luxor is to beef up my mLife account, and then hop over to some of their pricier resorts to get my comps. 1
Heather is awesome! Disneyland here she comes! Egg Works has one of the best breakfast in Las Vegas. California Crepe is delicious. A huge plate of goodness! 5
As a buffet, this restaurant is great!The price is low and the food is good for the price, but to order, I recommend to go further and get food of better quality. I ordered online and waited for 45 minutes past the delivery time before actually calling back. Their delivery guy didn't even show up until another 20 minutes. By that time, I was hangry (hungry + angry) and I told myself that if the food was at least good, I would be okay with it. The problem is that most of the chicken was bones, their chow mein was the same as the buffet one which would have been great if I paid 5$ for it, but I paid much more!! So to dine in, this restaurant is perfect for the area, but DO NOT order from them!! The food is all-you-can eat 5$ buffet quality and the service is more than meh. 2
My first visit was for restaurant week. If they can treat people this well during a $30 meal week then they have to be amazing all other times of the year as well.  We loved the atmosphere as well. Our server was so sweet and attentive.  The food was absolutely delicious and so great. My suggestion is the Pork Tenderloin dish! My goodness. I will be going back.....often! 4
I ordered on Foodora for delivery.  It arrived quickly and warm.  This said, the reviews on Yelp were quite misleading, and why I am compelled to post.  Portions were generous, but definitely lacking in flavour. Chicken was much better than beef. To me a Donair has a distinct flavour, but this was not even reminiscent of that taste.  The "special" was literally fatty beef over potatoes. Potatoes were way overdone and bland.  I will not be ordering from here again. 2
If your looking for some legit street tacos Taco y Taco is spot to be. Although when we arrived we weren't sure where to line up because there are different stations. They should put some signs up for first timers. I ended up getting 3 tacos the Al pastor and 2 lengua tacos. The Al pastor taco was okay not my favorite. However, they have the best Mexican style corn. I highly recommend trying it if you want some legit Mexican corn. 4
Got the spicy bhuna gosht (lamb) and it was delicious. Good amount of heat and lots of different flavors. The staff was incredibly friendly and offered to let us try the naan bread on the house after we ordered rice. I will never order rice there again because the naan is just too good and it's absolutely huge! I will definitely be back. 4
This is an update to my previous review. I'm changing my rating from a 1 to a 3. I'm doing this because after I wrote the first review, they reached out to me and tried to rectify the situation and the relationship. I appreciate that they made the effort. I can't comment on their work as I decided to go with another company. First review:I called this company once each day for two days to get an estimate on a small job. They did not feel it was necessary to call me back either time, as promised. If you don't want my job, that's fine, just tell me and stop wasting my time. If you don't care, I don't want you working on MY home. 3
I was served cold corn beef hash ,no 1 in my group was overly impressed . 1 visit was enough . 1
When they day 9pm, they mean 9pm. Pizza was a 2 stars - nothing special. Wings were too salty. Beer was the only part that made it worthwhile - dark IPA. 3
I love Sara and all the gals at Motive. The atmosphere is welcoming and laid-back (not something you can say about all salons this good!) and no one picks up the scissors -- even for just a trim -- without a conversation about what you want. I recently went from shoulder-length to a long pixie and I've never been happier. 5
The place was very busy. QUICK  AND GOOD SERVICE. BUT I prefer In &out and smash burger they have better burgers. 3
After reading all of the great reviews, I was going to try this nail salon out but they do not do SNS nails. Keeping up with change is important. That's the only reason I gave them 2 stars. 2
I waited for about 20 minutes just to drop off the prescription. Finally, a lackadaisical employee saunters up to the counter to take it. We made the terrible decision to wait for it, and that was our fault. However, when the prescription was finally ready, I again, waited at the cash register for about ten minutes without any recognition that I was there from either the pharmacist, or the cashier who kept bustling around behind the counter. I almost thought I had an invisibility cloak on or something. The arrogant pharmacist continued working as if no one was there. Finally, the clerk yelled haphazardly into the air, "I NEED SOME HELP HERE! I'M WORKING BOTH STATIONS". Then, when she came over, she rudely asked me "Can I help you with something?". Umm, yes, I need to pick up my prescription. In the mean time, she slammed the signature clipboard down in front of me and then, started muttering under her breath how she shouldn't have come in today and kept making exasperating sighs about how terrible everything is. I kept my mouth shut because I just wanted to get out of there, but really? It was totally awful and that is why, from now on, I will never go there again. 1
This restaurant serves decent BBQ foods, however items other than BBQ is barely satisfactory, and the depressing dining environment is a huge turn down. 4
Best Chinese food in driving range of UIUC! Believe the reviews about the crispy tofu; it's really that good. I've been here maybe 10 times and have never been disappointed. The optimal way to eat here is with a group of 4 or more people so you can share many different dishes! I haven't had any bad dishes, but some that were particularly good are: Crispy tofu (of course), Basil fried chicken, Taiwanese fried chicken, and salt and pepper fish.If you go on a Friday or Saturday night, expect a very long waiting time if you go any time after 6pm. It might be difficult to find a table, especially if there are 4+ people in your party. If you plan to go during that time, make a reservation! 5
Let me preface by saying the service here is excellent, the staff is very attentive at all times during the meal and their guacamole service before the meal was very tasty. One person in our party enjoyed their steak entree, and it was very good but the chicken fajitas were bland, and the chile verde could have been better, they lacked flavor and heat terribly. The red salsa which they bring out had flavor and some heat to it, the green salsa did not. We expected awesome Mexican food here based on reviews and awards but that wasn't the case with our visit. Gone are the days of the old El Cholo Mexican Cafe on Las Vegas Blvd, and the killer food they used to serve consistently, it seems that nowadays Mexican food in Vegas is watered down, lacks the heat flavor and substance of the old ghosts of this town. I don't want a fusion of some pretentious looking spread when I go for Mexican food, I want flavor, heat, and authentic recipe's and Vegas just lacks that in the culinary genre. 2
Had a mid-week lunch here recently with a client at his request. I'm going to break it down into 2 areas because I had 2 different experiences: service and food quality.Service: A++Not only was I seated immediately as I waited for my guest, but upon learning that I was having a business lunch the hostess sat me in a quieter corner away from the bustling main room. I have never had a wait staff say "thank you" and "you're welcome" more than this. They even joked with me as I ended up waiting 30 minutes for my delayed guest. (I used this time to read other Yelp reviews for my meal selection.) I can only hope that service is like this at all times. For my money it doesn't get any better here.Food: CUnfortunately the food wasn't as good as the service. I got the chicken parmesan after reading that the salads were less than overwhelming. I guess it would be OK if you like your chicken parm buried in veggies and cheese. Me? I like my chicken parmesan to be mostly, you know, chicken. It wasn't bad, mind you, but I can make a better dish at home and I am certainly not an Italian restaurant. Can't say I recommend the meal I had here this day. (on the other hand, I did once have the lasagna here and I remember it being tasty).Quite frankly, for me the Olive Garden is a better Italian experience, even with all of its chain restaurant failings. I can forgive bad service if the food is great (the tip is an interesting invention) but not the other way around. My search for a go-to Italian restaurant will continue, though I can't say I won't be back if I get another invitation. 3
Ehh... the food here isn't that great! I ordered the spaghetty western and the captain seafood linguini.  The sauce was ehh okay, nothing great.  The seafood wasn't hot enough so therefore tasted fishy and lack of flavor.  The garlic bread which came with the order was soggy and drenched in butter/margarine. Over $20 bucks per order is hefty for an order of pasta which wasn't that Good. I doubt I'll be going back anytime soon. 3
This place is ok! We go because it's literally 3 mins away. I prefer amc west gate. This place tends to be on the dirty side and customer service not that great! For example, my husband and I went to see Star Wars. The movie entrances were labeled wrong, and when we asked to find out the correct theatre the girl was frustrated we were even asking. Grow up. But I get it there's basically teenagers running the place. Big marks on screen.. Maybe they need to be cleaned? Not sure. Like I said not my favorite place but it's ok once and awhile. Parking lot sucks too. 3
This is my third time at the Luxor.  The public areas, pools, and staff are fine but the rooms are very dated and poorly maintained.  The elevators are sketchy and while the prices are $25-40 lower than others on the strip, there is no Wi-Fi and restaurants are sub par. 2
We were visiting Toronto from California; the weather outside was bitter cold (-20c) but the staff at Barberian's brought our dinner party warmth.   From every aspect the service was fantastic. From coat checking right through to the owner (Aaron Barberian), our experience was absolutely the best. We had a rather large party and we were seated in the 'wine cellar".  What a fantastic area of this historic steak house. The wine cellar is two-story high and has about 20,000 bottles! Our server (Ange) had obviously been in his trade for many years because he was flawless. Ange answered all of our questions with dignity and respect but brought in a nice sense of humor as well. He made some wonderful recommendations. During the meal he anticipated our needs before we did. Ange blended in nicely with all the members of the party and it was a pleasure to spend the evening with him.All the food and wine was delicious. Everyone commented on how excellent their food was. The dry-aged beef was of absolute top quality. The desserts were very, very yummy.  It was a meal to remember. 5
My colleagues took me here for dinner last night.  I did not expect their  burgers to be so good.  The prices are a little high, but there are a variety of gourmet burgers to choose from.  The fries with chili are good too.  I am not a big fan of beef, but I would not mind going back when I am back in Vegas for work.  By the way, the service was excellent as well.  I gave them a 4 star because the price was a little high for a hamburger, but they are worth a try. 4
Great customer service great prices he even went above and beyond to help me will definitely use their services in the future  Richard Southern Hills espresso 5
im a huuuuuuge steak snob and have been to most of the nice steakhouses in every city and i looooooved the steak at SW. my bf and i ordered the bone in rib eye and it was seasoned and cooked perfectly and i craved it for the whole wknd while i was in vegas. it comes with 3 dipping sauces but i preferred the steak by itself. their sides, not so impressive. really good appetizers and salads (i had the kobe beef carpaccio and wedge salad with blue cheese and the biggest piece of bacon ive seen in my life). atmosphere was perfect and i would go back again and order another starter instead of a side. 4
I have been to Tao multiple times in the past and have usually had a good experience, but this time, it was different and the customer experience was horrible. I made reservations at the Tao Lounge on March 31, 2017. The place is great and so was the food but our host, Kri***, did not seem to be enjoying her work. I understand that that one can get overwhelmed with everything that is going around at Tao, but doing the job right and making customers feel special is one of the things that keep the place running. One request - Please have your hosts smile and make customers feel  special. No customer wants to come to your place and see a unwelcoming face.Tao management - Reach out if you need more details and the check number 2
This is my first time ever giving anyone a review, but I felt I had to share... anyone thats planning on opening up a membership  here please beware. I signed on 2 months ago, the "manager" told us they were remodeling and adding other activities, like racket ball  (which is what my son was interested it), he said I could change the membership name to my husband's  if i found myself not going often. Well today I went to switch the membership name to my husband's and come to find out, 1. Im not able to, 2. they are not remodeling/adding anything,  and 3. he was not the manager, infact he was just fired for providing  customers with false information.  I was told to call the Corporate office and let them know the situation to see if they could help me with the name change,  well corporate told me they could help. ... but i would have to pay $99.00. I asked her why i would be charged for making a change to my account if when i signed up i was told i could, they fired the guy for lying but still want to charge me . Again.....please make sure you get the correct information and you review everything before signing anything,  it's clear they cannot be trusted, and instead of helping they still want to go after your money. 1
Let me start with ... I love small companies. I always want to like them, this place included. Easy to find, cute interior, and the girl who helped me was pleasant enough. That all got two stars. I was in the mood for something small and sweet so i was excited to give it a try. But I was soooo disappointed!!! I ordered a Champagne cupcake for myself, the cupcake was missing half an inch of the cake and was so dry. The frosting was soooo sugary and didn't taste like champagne at all. Brought the Salted Caramel back to a friend and he was unimpressed as well, dry and nothing special. $6 dollars for two bland dry cupcakes that didn't even fill the bakery cup. 2
This is a great little place. In all fairness, we've tried a lot of the Thai food and not much of the Hakka per se, however each time the service has been fast and friendly, the food has been delicious and affordable. YUMMY Thai curry coconut dishes and great portions = good value. 4
I discovered this place as soon as it opened. It's clean, new, and the owner Brandon is always on site. They washed literally every crevice of my car. The staff is super friendly, hospitable and efficient. I will definitely be back and would highly recommend their services. 5
Eh, drinks where overpriced and weren't that good. Service was fast for it being the lunch rush. The chicken wrap was good but needed more sauce and less lettuce. All around it was okay but not worth the price. 3
This place is a joke.  There is a better beer selection at the worst lcbo in the city.  If you really appreciate beer and have tried everythig don't waste your time here.  They get a one cause the fridge works and there is beer in it. 1
My friend and I swung in her last night around 10:30 after a show at the Smith Center. Both of us had missed dinner and were starving. The place was pretty dark and empty looking but once inside we found three or four other tables of late night eaters. As a whole this place is kind of a greasy spoon and a bit sticky but that really didn't bother us. I ordered the waffle breakfast with eggs and sausage and the portion was huge. My friend got the same thing only with pancakes instead. We both really liked what we had and seriously loved the butter they used. The service was fine nothing good or bad to say about that and the price was right at $24 for both of our meals and two coffees. Certainly be someplace when a late night breakfast craving hits. 3
I haven't been here since I was a kid but something tells me I would still enjoy it. It is filled with tonnes of awesome displays and enough interactive elements to keep you engaged while you're there. My favourite was the broadcast booth where you can record your voice over famous goals in hockey history. If you are even remotely interested in hockey and in Toronto then this is well worth it. 4
Awesome burger.  This is the first time ever eating at a johnny rockets.  This location is smaller than the ones I've seen on the strip.  Took away one star for the size of the restaurant and the cigerette smoke odor coming from the casino.   Great burger at a decent price. 4
I have been here twice. Once for breakfast about a week ago and today for dinner. For breakfast I had the Chicken Fried Steak with Sausage Gravy and Biscuits. This was good. The chicken fried steak was crisp but not overcooked, the sausage gravy had a good amount of sausage and was very flavorful. The biscuits were also good. My companion had three blueberry pancakes. These were very large and she raved about how good they were. For our dinner selections we had the barbecue 1/2 chicken and the meatloaf sandwich. The chicken was very tender and the sauce, while not homemade, was tangy and pretty good. The meatloaf got a good review from my Mom. she loved the gravy. We had very good service on both trips. This is not a fine dining establishment, but for a tasty, well prepared homestyle meal at a good price this is a really good option. 4
Your typical hotel restaurant. The service was slow, way overpriced, mediocre side items. For the price of the food and the reputation of the hotel, I would expect there to be freshly prepared foods, nothing previously frozen and more creativity from those running the kitchen. Not worth trying when there are so many other great options within a short walk. 2
Great music choices, however the club itself is set up horribly. For a dance music club the dance floor is way to small. I always feel like I am getting pushed everywhere I go in that club. Also, I know the security has to be 'hard' and 'tough' but they are just complete douchebags for no reason sometimes. Like fucking relax your job is not that important. I do like the outside part of the club though, I wish they would have expanded it. 2
Lots of vegetarian options. Good food at good prices and great daily specials on food and drinks. 4
Good food. Been there several times. Great staff, very understanding when I threw up. (It was my birthday at the time and I probably drank too much). Wide selection of alcohol and multiple TVs for whatever sport event is on. And several pool tables and dart boards. Great place for friends getting together. 3
Of the many Mexican restaurants around to choose from, this is definitely the best. I've never had a meal from La Unica that I didn't enjoy. Lately I've been on a taco kick - I love their shredded beef tacos & their carne asada tacos - authentic with cilantro & onion on soft corn tortillas. They also have some of the best horchata. 5
Loved the atmosphere of the quaint little shop and amazing froyo. Make sure you bring cash because they use landline for cards. 5
Excellent food and drinks and fantastic service. Must try the make your own guac. This restaurant was difficult to get into and I tried for months, but it was certainly worth the wait. I highly recommend this restaurant. 5
Grabbed lunch here was quickly seated the waitress was very nice and helpful to my coworker and I who are first timers to charlotte. I highly recommend the guacamole they have side dishes for two bucks if you don't want to spend nine on the big bowl. Their chicken taco with cilantro was awesome, wasn't big into their side dish red rice it slaw but the taco and guacamole more then made up for it. Reasonably pieced too for seven bucks. Will be returning here when I am on my next business trip 4
2 of my girlfriends recommended this place so all 3 of us went.... I made sure to have an appetite when I got here..... sushi was mediocre.... what made it TERRIBLE was the service..... we were there for 2 and a half hours because our orders took about 30 min to come out whether it was appetizers or sushi.... our server's excuse was because the bar was full....? So you're telling me your main dining area (which was actually also pretty full ) should SUFFER just because the bar was full????? **someone replied to this comment saying to come on a Monday when it's not busy... umm so I have to come a different day to get even mediocre service? No thanks... 1
Drink specials are on point. BILLY is amazing. He came up and asked how are our experience was and came back 10 minutes later with shots for our party. One persons in our party was allergic to an ingredient in the shot so he came back with a different shot. Amazing customer service, will definitely be back 5
I hope the show is worth all the hassle of getting the tickets!  WHY would we have to come pick them up earlier in the day, fighting traffic and getting lost instead of just getting them when we come to the show?  Or better yet, why can't we just print our own like the rest of the world? 2
My fiance and I decided to check this place out via a referral from a friend. We waited about 20 to 30 minutes to be seated which was fine as they were busy at the time. After we sat down though our waitress was nice she was really slow at attending to our table. Once our food finally came to our table it looked as though it had been sitting for awhile. You know when you put fresh beans on the plate they have a moistness to them.. These looked like dried old beans along with this on my fiance's plate he also received a taco where literally the shell wasn't cooked, it's as though they took it out of the package onto the plate no heating at all, the waitress didn't believe him so he had her physically touch the shell which was raw and she agreed and seemed taken back by it. The main course of his dish was cold on the inside which brought him to believe it was frozen then just reheated. As for my plate im vegetarian and found something suitable enough for me the volcanes, I asked the waitress to leave the cheese off to the side as I'm more vegan than vegetarian. After waiting for about an hour to get our food a different waitress finally brought our plates and there on my meal the cheese was on top. Since we'd been waiting so long I was like screw it I'll just eat it. Though I found out the guacamole and the pico have jalapenos in it which im allergic to unfortunately so I sent the plate back and since they aren't really a vegan friendly restaurant I settled for the Spanish rice which tasted like it came from a box. For all the hype this restaurant puts out it was extremely over priced for what you get and the service is horrible. I wouldnt recommend this place. The only reason I gave two stars was because the ambiance of the physical restaurant itself was nice. 2
The sundae bar is a big hit with my kids, particularly the blue "whipped cream" (I shudder to think what's actually in that). The food's pretty much the same stuff you can get at Friday's, Applebee's, etc. I like their salad with the almonds and blue cheese-- they sometimes really dowse it in dressing but it's good. 3
Great service friendly staff, priced well. Cleanliness is huge for me. See Kelly  or Twee 5
Stay here over 20 nights a year. Always great. Service and facilities are always superb. Rooms are super comfortable. Located next to Westgate this is the perfect place for a short getaway. Westgate has super restaurants and entertainment. Pool area and spa folks are terrific. Check in, get comfy and have fun. 4
This has been one of my favorite pizzerias for a while.  It's as close to u can get to jersey pizza.  There are a few other places that are good too, but luckys rocks! 5
I was hesitant to go into here after reading a review of another location...however, now that I have been in 2x for 2 different laptops, I can say I was pleased with their service. They were nice and honest.  The first issue I had turned out to be a corruption on my hard drive - they told me an estimate of what it would cost and I decided to purchase a new one...so no charge there.  My new laptop received an error so that I could not log on...so took it there for help.  Jeremy gave it a look and took about 15 minutes to determine the problem (created a new profile, deleted the old one), fixed it for me with no charge....hopefully I won't need them anytime soon, but appreciated the fix very much!! 4
Really impressed with everyone at Nova Interiors! Prompt, courteous and professional. My bland fireplace wall is now an amazing feature wall at a reasonable price. They were neat, clean and fast and I'm thrilled with the outcome. I plan on having them do my whole house flooring replacement and crown molding, too. I highly recommend this company! 5
Loved this place! Excellent sushi. Fantastic, friendly service. Don't miss the Yoshi Roll or the Cucumber Wrap. And the fresh homemade wasabi is amazing. Best sushi I've had in Vegas in years. 5
Being a UofT engineer, this is my usual watering hole. Sure, its not the classiest of pubs, but that's all part of its charm. From my experience the service ranges from mediocre to terrible. The servers can be moody and I've once waited an hour for a cold plate of wings and fries. It's a hit or miss deal.The house beer is surprisingly drinkable for $10 a pitcher and the wings are some of the best I've had. They're a respectable size and somehow manage to stay crispy despite the generous coating of sauce. The sauce selection is decent, but I never stray from the Hammer wings (not on the menu, but oh so delicious). 4
Desserts and bread are always great at Nova Era. Customer service is terrible. Desserts always a great variety and always fresh. Couple recommendations; custard cakes, bean cakes are all amazing! Customer service.... After waiting in line for 15mins with only two people in front of me I was told to go to the other counter to order my sandwich.... After ignoring me for another 10mins the extremely rude woman making sandwiches doesn't even greet me and in a very unfriendly manner tells me to basically go sit down and now wait to be asked what I want.20mins pass and I am still here sitting and waiting to have someone approach me to take an order. I will never be coming back here to eat and HIGHLY recommend only coming for the bakery stuff only here! Terrible fucking service. 1
ONLY went here since we were crunched for time and had to find something close and quick. NEVER again. LOUD, too much hustle and bustle walking around. Not bad food, just your typical chain style fare.Again, as I said,,,,never again. 2
We stumbled upon Fajita Grill while just walking around. We seen people sitting outside and figured we'd give it a try. I liked the outdoor seating and thought the food was very good but a bit overpriced. The chips and salsa were tasty. Someone had mentioned in a review that the chips seems store bought, I really can't say for sure, but either way they were good and and fair quality. I do believe the salsa was definitely homemade and enjoyed it a lot. I feel the authenticity of the food is just about on par. I had eaten there with my boyfriend and a friend who found the burritos to be the best they ever had. I had the enchilada, which I enjoyed very much. It's close to one of the tastiest I've had (but I've lived in Arizona and traveled to Mexico which is where I've truly had the best) The portion size was awesome. I was stuffed for rest of the night! The service was decent. Not super friendly, but certainly not bad by any means. I would certainly go back and just be bit a bit more prepared for the price next time. Pro: Nice location, good food and portion sizeCons: A bit overpriced and semi-friendly service 3
So sad!! Used to be the best mall inThe area. Gone downhill. It's still clean but limited stores and it has a sad feel. Not sure his much longer it will be operating with so few customers!! 3
HORRIBLE dining experience tonigt!! Service was terrible, slow and unfriendly. Customers who came in after us by at least 30 min were served food before we were ( both of us ordered pizza ).  Dirty tables not bussed until customers came in and needed to be seated. Heard a customer be told there were no more clean plates... Finally after an hour and a half our bruschetta came out, but the crust was burnt terribly and they tried to cover it up with extra tomatoes. When asked if our pizza was coming soon, was told it had not been started yet!!! Told the server to cancel it and she brought us a check for our drinks!!! Paid cash for our drinks, which should have been comped in my opinion, the server told me they had no change!!  She then had to get me change from her purse. Watched 2 other tables walk out after us! Will NEVER go back!! 1
Stepped in here on a visit to see my brother; the fro-yo is good; 47 cents an ounce is higher than what I'm used to. His mango bubble tea was a bit disappointing or rather the bubbles were; they were still hard and not as "bubbly" as I would have liked.  Liked the atmosphere and can definitely see why people are opening it up all over. :) 3
Since it opened, this place has become a West Toronto local favourite. And what's not to love? HUGE slices with fresh ingredients at reasonable prices. While I defintely have had better pizza before, for something quick, fairly inexpensive and reasonably tasty, there isn't much within walking distance that beats it. Just stay away at noon during the week, or the highschool crowd will eat you alive. If you can't make it in, they have delivery available too. 4
I was here tonight for a first date. My date and I split 3 appetizers: the Pickerel Tostada, Smoked Chili Tiger Prawns, and Sweet Potato Fries. The Pickerel Tostada was rich with flavour and ingredients and was my favourite of the bunch but the Smoked Chili Tiger Prawns were a close second. The actual prawns themselves were excellently seasoned and tasted amazing with the spiced honey and tomato cilantro vinaigrette sauce but the lentil quenelle that came with it left something to be desired for me. Perhaps if you get a really good dollop of the spiced honey sauce on the quenelle the flavours improve but eating the lentil quenelle alone left a bland almost cardboard like taste. I think the key is to get some of everything on the fork and then maybe the flavours and consistencies blend nicely together. The plate would have satisfied me much more had it been all prawns and sauce no lentil. The Sweet Potato fries were ante'd up a notch with a dip I'd never had with sweet potato fries before. Unfortunately it's not described on the menu and I didn't think to ask the waiter but it tasted almost like a ranch and blue cheese combination with what looked like green onion mixed it. It was delicious and a welcome change from the traditional chipotle mayo sauce we're all used to. Not sure if management pushes the staff to get people in an out ASAP but our waiter brought us our bills while our plates were only half eaten (we had been there maybe 30 minutes) and came back ten minutes later and grabbed our plates (which still had food on them) in a manner that lead me to believe our time was up. He did ask before he walked away with the plates but when the waiter's hand is possessively holding your plate and then they ask you if you're done you say "Yes master! Sorry master for being so slow". This as I said was with food still on the plates AND half consumed beverages. I left that restaurant having not finished my cider; a feat that I assure you has never occurred before. It was nowhere near closing time and it was a Monday night. Though hustled out the evening was enjoyable and we went on to a pub nearby for more drinks. Had we not been rushed, the restaurant would of got at least one maybe two more rounds out of us. I'd go back but I won't be hurried out like that again. 3
I've been here a few times for the awesome reclining, cushy seats.  There is a ton of room in each seat and ample leg room even when fully reclined.  All of the seats are assigned which allows you to get there late if you want.  Besides the great seats, every Tuesday night all movies are only $5.  In addition, you can refill your soda for free if you are willing to exit your comfortable seat.  The only food delivery I've seen is pizza from the local pizza place next door.  I have yet to try this option but who doesn't want pizza during your movie!!  Definitely check this place out.  The only time I ever had an issue was the theater adjacent to the mini golf and bowling since it is not sound-proofed enough. 4
Nicest salon in the northeast Ohio area. Beautiful place. Awesome stylists. Everyone is extremely friendly as well as trendy!! 5
Awesome customer service. Highly recommended place to buy appliance parts. Went in for an AC motor today and Eddie hooked me up with a new motor and even wired it to the plug in so install was a snap. If u need any parts ask for Eddie he went out of his way to help and get me set up. 5
I'm a huge fan of Pho.  I had it every weekend growing up.  I grew up just outside "Eden Center" in Northern Virginia, which is the Vietnamese hub of the East Coast.  Oh, and I'm half-Vietnamese.  I think that gives me a lot of credit for this.My wife and I gave this place two tries.  We really wanted to try to like it, I swear.  I always want "my peeps" to do well.  The decoration is nice.  Service is passable.  But all the other food sans the pho is barely passable.  It clearly isn't authentic Vietnamese, but I also don't think they are trying to do "authentic."  They are making relatlvey bland Vietnamese food palatable to most, and I think they generally succeed, but this is NOT the place I would go if you wanted to show your friend "Vietnamese food."Their Pho is average.  If you're craving pho and this is the only place in town I would go here.  Otherwise I cannot recommend this place.The rest of their dishes, be it their Vermicelli or their Rice dishes, are less than adequate.Again, I want this place to succeed, but personally will not be coming back here.  Saigon noodle is by far your better bet, though unfortunately they are a victim of their own success and are getting quite busy! 2
Great food and the apps are amazing. Good beer selection as well. Jamie our waitress was super fast and nice. When we arrived we didn't see the hostess stand, so walked in and sat down. Robert, a waiter was a complete jerk and told us we needed to go and wait in line for a table. There was no line. We walked back up to hostess, she sat us immediately. Robert needs some help on how to treat customers. 4
Way overrated, kid at the counter wanted to charge gratuity for an order of 6 or more...really you want to charge gratuity for an order of 6? So instead we ordered individual, you're still gonna have to make the 6 anyway.  Also this establishment is a line up, order and pick up your own food, get your head out of your asses. 1
Update: I'm just writing from what I saw and experienced and I didn't have any bias. I have done eyelashes in other places in the past. However, I am giving you back credit on lashes didn't fall off within a week like others commented here. So I'm good with that and I want to be fair to you. I understand that you may not be happy with my comment so I will not say anything further. 2
I love Buckle but the staff at fashion show are SO pushy! The first time I thought they were just having a slow day or maybe training... But it's literally every time. We get it, you need commission. But asking me 4 time in 6 minutes if I need something is absurd. Yes, I know how soft your jeans are, you don't need to keep bringing me pairs to touch. I ended up leaving because I was being hounded and couldn't even look at something without being asked if I want to try it on. Give customers space to shop! 2
This place decided to cancel taco Tuesday on Tuesday! That's like having your kids run downstairs on Christmas to find no presents under the tree because Christmas was canceled! This sucks 1
Worth the trip! The service was great and the menu is very thoughtful. More of an experience than a meal. I have a sneaky suspicion this place can be hit or miss though. Half the items ordered I would order again. The other half just missed the mark or were more sensation than tastation. A few pieces of meat were too fatty to eat and the other half were making us moan. Don't let the parking lot/location scare you. This is Vegas. Many talented chefs come here and open hole in the wall gems to get their names out there. 4
This is a money pit. If your young, dumb, and have money to piss away this is the place for you. This is piano karaoke of the worst kind. Save your cash and go to a pub with a good band. Better food. Better service. Can't believe I wasted two hours of my life there! 1
I would drink of their blood orange mojitos every day if I could.  This is a favorite happy hour spot.  The tapas are good and the drinks are delicious.  Very good array of tapas and this location has a fun, hip atmosphere.The drinks are moderately priced and the service is usually pretty fast. 4
While it's been nearly a year since I had a fabulous dinner at Michael Mina, I still think about the amazing meal I had.It was my first trip to Las Vegas and my boyfriend wanted to impress. By taking me here, he definitely did as well as enjoyed the food himself.We were recommended to try the Chef's menu and also followed it with the wine pairings. We both enjoyed the Ahi tuna tartar, LOVED the lobster pot pie, which got the pie to innards content right (I like a little breadness with each bite), and both of us were in awe of the Kobe with sear foie on top. I don't know if they still do that, but both of us just melted a little inside with each bit. It's in our top 2 of steaks...and trust me, we eat a lot of steak. I don't even remember the dessert, that's how mind blowing the steak was. I'm sure it was tasty and delightful because my dinner at Michael Mina was nothing but excellent.Service was impeccable, and they dealt well with my constant requests for their delicious bread. The wine pairings were done well, but I was happy I was staying in the Bellagio after dinner because that was a significant amount of alcohol in one sitting. The atmosphere was elegant without pretension or "over-styling." Probably the most comfortable restaurant I went to in Vegas. Most people were well dressed (i.e. slacks and dresses) but no need for anything over the top. I wore a little black dress and my boyfriend wore a nice sports coat with dark slacks. While we were probably the youngest ones there, the servers didn't treat us like we didn't belong there, which sometimes happens in upscale restaurants. Big plus for that.I'd love to go back, but this time, I'd probably order something different just so I could try other things...but I'd get the Kobe again. For sure.It's worth the pennies to go, and try the chef's menu! 5
Fast and friendly service with decent greek food. Visit it once every couple of weeks. 3
Terrible costumer service. Paid for my prescription on Wednesday and they said it will be delivered next day. Thursday comes, no one came. They called Friday saying apparently someone called me before delivery Thursday and I didn't pick up, which is not true, I have no missed calls from anybody. And not to mention when they called I picked up right away. So Friday they said someone will come in after 1 and I instructed them that they can leave the package at the front door, he said ok, so Friday 6 pm still nothing. I've tried calling, but of course they were already closed and I couldn't get thru to anybody. Now it's Saturday and I have to wait till Monday to resolve the issue and to see if I'll even get it on Monday. They were quick to take my money, but didn't deliver on their end. Customers beware! 1
As a Chicago food aficionado, I walked in and was overwhelmed by the menu.  As we waited (there were 3 of us) for 20 minutes, the food coming out to the others (6) in the restaurant looked huge, greasy, and amazing.  I would have given 4 stars, if it were not for the price and the wait....  $15 for a sandwich, fries, and drink.  Ouch.I appreciate the fact that the lemonade was from real lemons, and the giardinera was homemade, and the italian beef was well stuffed, but $15 seemed like a bit much, especially when considering the seating and tables have not seen a dime in upgrades or maintenance in a decade or more.  I know it takes time and money to make good food from good ingredients, but a few bucks and a few minutes less would have been nice. 3
Horrible service. Didn't acknowledge us standing there for five minutes and far too overpriced. Do not go here. 1
Great Customer Serves! awesome collection of skate wear!! great sales to. Store is very spaces and clean!! No downside at all. and the location best of all 5
Angela was really helpful and set up my auto insurance quickly and easily. I was able to print my temporary insurance card and get my vehicle registered right away. Thank you for helping me get set up and making the transition to North Carolina that much easier! 4
I have had great sandwiches and soup at Rare in the past so was excited to see they're offering a new line of grilled cheese sandwiches. I've had some tasty "gourmet" grilled cheese this past year and had high expectations for Rare. Well, my sandwich was tiny, flat and looked like it had been run over by a truck. Two thin slices of bread and a thin line of cheddar cheese. They didn't even bother to cut it in half. It looked worse than someone's throw-together school lunch. Big waste of money. I should have gone elsewhere in the food court! 2
Wow.. What an amazing deal for happy hour! You get great deals on Martini's and Burgers at a fine dining Steakhouse!! If you haven't tried it.. You must!!! 4
Great little restaurant lots staff, very attentive,super clean and most important the variety of dishes that we all had were delicious ,first time there and will become my new favourite  for sure.you won't be disappointed. 4
If The Improv chain didn't bring in such amazing comedians, this place would be totally screwed. I always have fun watching the comedians, but I can't help but leave with such a bitter taste in my mouth from how much of a rip off this place is.First you buy the tickets, but if you buy online you have an outrageous service charge. The real kicker is having to buy a minimum of 2 items during the show, beers are $5 or $6 and the cheapest things on the menu, I believe. Cocktails are $11-$13. I think glasses of wine are around $8. There is a pretty good selection of food options. The improv does have a lot of great comedians who pass through! Even the opening acts are generally great! Line up early if you want a great seat right in the front! The point is, a night at the Improv will be fun, but if you aren't prepared for it, it can end up being a pretty unexpectedly and unreasonably expensive affair. 3
The staff are friendly but The food quality is just not good anymore. I've been going there for a few years ever since it opened up. Started pretty good but went downhill ever since 1
druggies and drunks make the atmosphere.the food's reasonably priced, cooked to order, and the beer is cold.what do you expect when you pay $3.50 for a burger, fries and pop? 5
Arrived Monday,  quick check in and then we got up to our standard room.  After settling in I went to turn the TV on and it wouldn't come on,  I diagnosed the problem to an unplugged cord.  As I went to plug it in I spotted two syringes laying behind the center,  the wife called the front desk to inform them and they moved us to a suite room.  Suite room was much nicer and we had no issues with the room except during the heat of the day the a/c couldn't keep up.  Will say several times the door lock acted up but once I informed the front desk they repaired it.  Internet,  I could never get the network to go,  so why charge a fee for something that doesn't work?  Irritating! We were without our kids on this trip and I don't think I'd bring them here as I think they'd get bored as there isn't much here to keep their attention. 2
I was really disappointed. I've only been here once and the pizza was soggy which is awful by any standards, let alone for "New York" pizza. The two stars is for the waitress who was really nice and all the decorations inside. 2
Being a full-time grad student, I frequent coffee houses frequently. This Starbucks was pleasant enough overall, but the lady taking my order had the personality of a lima bean. This location should put heir friendly staff as the first point of contact and leave the grumpy smurfs behind the counter, where they can make some coffee magic and not have to interact with humans. Also, the place was relatively empty, yet not one of the three ladies behind the counter thought to take a broom to the place. Not very clean and no effort to correct that. Our breakfast and coffees were delicious, though. No complaints there! 3
Never been to a store like this before but everyone who worked there was very helpful and friendly. Crystal, who helped us, was very knowledgable and professional. She is easy to talk to and knew exactly what we needed. I would not hesitate to go back or to recommend this establishment to someone. Wonderful people work here!!! Love it!! 5
Used to come here quite often - back in the day lolI'm torn.....the renos are a great improvement and the atmosphere is fun yet relaxed.The steak sandwich though has been destroyed!Shoestring fries with enough salt to kill leeches. Steak sandwich was a fair size/thickness. The chef can cook a med-rare steak, but killed it and any juices left with seasoning salt sprinkled after!The garlic toast was so dry around the edges, I actually didn't eat it. You could tell it was stale. Caesar salad was old - lettuce soggy and dense. Flavour decent though. Helped with the salt factor if nothing else. Had a "purple gas" pint (Big Rock) - was fabulous!Waitress was also fabulous!Might give this another chance. Maybe. Not for dinner though, I don't think. 3
We came here for a full dinner but left after our drinks so this review does not grade the steak but the lackluster service. From the moment you walk in, you are (or should be) tempted to leave. The "hostess" doesn't smile or greet you, but hastily takes you to a table. Then the waitress comes with the same attitude and lack of knowledge of the food, wine or beer. She couldn't answer even what beers they had or what was different about them. After saying we were ready to place our order she disappeared. After a long duration she returned, at which time we decided we had enough. I may give Longhorn another try, but not at this location. 2
The staff was super attentive. Food was yummy...more tex-mex like. The view was awesome! You could see the whole valley. I went for lunch with my family and it was pretty quiet compared to the weekend (according to my Mom), but it was a Wednesday afternoon and we were looking for something good! It really seems like it would be a fun nighttime bar/food spot....I'll definitely visit when I'm in town again! BTW the margaritas looked awesome....alas I didn't try one. 4
Our favorite local place.  Food is always excellent, great beer selection and great service.  Hal himself is usually there. My dad called it the best burger ever. My personal favorite is the mushroom brie bisque. To die for. 5
Consistently good car washes, waxes, etc. Unfortunately their customer service doesn't match.  Consistently crabby :( 3
I was in the area and was looking for a quick bite. Staff was extremely friendly. Got the original Philly cheesesteak and a philthy sized original poutine. Philly cheesesteak was tasty, but the philthy sauce was a bit sweet for my liking. The poutine was amazing!! Portions are big and can be shared. 4
Very nice physical space when I walked in. The employees did their job, but didn't impress me beyond that. The food was very average and could have been much better. 3
I've never written a bad review before, but last night's dinner at Charlotte Cafe was spectacularly bad, and deserves a bad review. Service was truly horrible. The waitress was surly (PMS-ing?) and spent about 20 minutes kibitzing with a big table while our food congealed on the service line. That was when she hadn't disappeared altogether. The food itself was bland and visually unappealing -- colorless, and as I said, the pale beige gravy had congealed and had a skin on it by the time it got to us. My blackeyed peas were a dry lump and under-done, my sister-in-law's cabbage was cold as a frog, my chopped steak was gristly.It took an hour and a half from the time we were seated until the time we left, and we were the next to last table to leave. They were practically sweeping under our feet as we walked out. Overall, blecchh! Oh, and to add to the misery, the live music was loud and intrusive. 1
Used to love the inventive --if quirky and sometimes off the mArk ---combos of this Asian Fusion place. But now it is about As standard as they come with lamb shank and salmon entrees ... What happened ? After the renovation the place lost its center ! Plus staff is slow and not very  professional ... Another one bites the dust ! Not likely to return especially when the competition for novel and fun food is on the rise in the burgh!! 2
It is deeply disappointing that The Stand has stopped serving their beautiful tacos and street corn. These are their two best offerings and never disappoint. I have been a long time customer of original Arcadia location and it is especially bad for those of us that have supported you guys from the start. I am hoping you change your minds. For me, it means you lost your edge. You have taken away the best of your menu. I love you guys. Please. 2
AWESOME place! Found it through this site and got the recommended dishes of Pan Tai, fried rice and then yellow curry!!! Yum! Dishes are spicy so review helped me keep it at 2 which was perfect. Our second visit tried Beef PHO which was fabulous! Best I have had! Rounded off with doughnuts for dessert! Great service and great food! A place to not miss!!!! 5
I enjoy their burger every once in a blue moon.  I love the shakes, and the animal fries are super good!  I'd much rather order animals fries with a hamburger patty on the side. 3
Paige and Pam are no longer there. Paige is now at Flare, love her hair cuts she's very professional! 2
The show was OK, the seats sucked. Get ready to rub elbows with your neighbor. Reminds me of the seats on airplanes, best way to describe it. 3
I had drinks with a few friends here on a Saturday night. I cannot comment on the food as I didn't order, however, my friends seemed to be pleased with their choices. The restaurant is quite pricey (over my price range). The atmosphere is nice, a bit loud for myself, but not complaining. Is it customary for pricey restaurants to have rude, pretentious staff? We were sitting at the bar and some of the bartenders were intolerable. It took an incredible amount of time to get an order in and once we did we were treated as if it was a waste of his time. Oh, and clearly it was since he never brought us our drinks. We had to ask another bartender for them. The staff is quite young and clearly interested in only serving young attractive women. I am not picking on the men as it wasn't only the male bartenders the female bartenders were extremely aloof and ignored us as well. I guess next time I need to give them my fancy credit card or wear my push up bra to get decent service.Not worth my time or money. 3
My son ordered a hot wrap ... it came to the table lukewarm.Coffee tasted like it had grounds in it. 2
If you went to Iroquois Ridge high school then you should expect to see other former graduates there. Usually the people that you didn't realize you didn't miss until you saw them again here and were forced into an awkward, unwanted conversation. On weekends it is usually rammed well past the point of being enjoyable. Oh and there will probably be a fight.Other than that it's pretty harmless. The food is better than you'd expect and the prices for food and drink are fair. 3
The new appetizer menu was delicious. Three of us ordered steaks, all of which were cold. Two of them were well done so I'm not sure how that happened. On a good note, they were nice enough to comp two of the steaks. The service was friendly and overall the experience was a good one. 3
I'm a frequent Rubios customer at this location. I always get great customer service from a young lady names, Amanda. She knows what I order and gets my order right every time. Great job, Amanda!! 5
This is a less expensive alternative to Eez. It is priced much more afford-ably for the more frequent sushi indulger's. I still love Eez but it is a bit expensive. This place is located in the plaza with Hickory Tavern. It has a cozy indoor seating area with a small sushi bar and an outdoor patio. We chose to dine outside but neglected to lather up with bug spray... yikes! We went for dinner but I think "we" were dinner.... still scratching!!! Anyway, the menu is quite extensive. I had trouble figuring out what to choose with all the options in front of me. I decided on the Edamame followed by the Chicken in Garlic Sauce. I know, it's not sushi. I saw this and pulled the trigger. It was ok, I haven't had this dish since I was in NY. I think I'll stick to the place in NY. One thing is certain, I do believe a lumber jack would have trouble finishing his plate here.... Holy Cow! I think it was $8.50 for this platter of food. So if "hot and a lot" is your thing... this place is for you. I didn't hate the experience I just didn't care of the dish. I will go back again to try a sushi roll, at least once. All in all...Paul Bundy sized portions, great prices and good service.  Oh yeah, they also have daily drink specials and serve a variety of fruity Martini's and Wine. Monday is $2 domestics and $3 imports night. 3
Tammy and Debbie are AMAZING! I had a bad experience with laser hair removal a few years ago at a med spa.  It was very painful to the point where I had given up.... that is until I heard such great things about luminescence!   Debbie was very comforting and the laser they use is awesome.   Compared to my previous experience it was a breeze.  The pricing is affordable,  great ambiance and professional staff.  I can't wait to start utilizing some of the other services they offer. 5
My husband and I went in last night (Friday) to give this place a try. We got there early enough to avoid a wait but it was already full. We were glad that we did not have to wait for a table. The atmosphere was great and they had live music, which we weren't expecting. I ordered the Cajun Shrimp Alfredo and my husband got the stuffed Poblano, which our server recommended. We also got the asparagus as an appetizer. Both of us were very happy with our dishes, the food took a little long but our server brought us bread and we had our appetizer to munch on. The reason for the 3 stars instead of 4 is that we had to wait over 15 minutes for our drinks, which we ordered when our server greeted us. Our appetizer made it out before our drinks and by the time we got the drinks, we both were already frustrated with having to wait so long. I ordered a glass of the Pinot Noir and my husband got some type of margarita from the specialty drinks menu. We both normally get 2 drinks when we go out but we were only able to enjoy a few sips of our drink before our dinner made it out. The waitress was for very apologetic and explained that the bartender was backed up. However, as a table of two with pretty easy drinks, we both thought it was a long time to wait. It worried us both that our food was going to take even longer but the food came out in a timely matter (with the appetizer before the drinks!) Overall, we both decided we would still go back again because we did enjoy the atmosphere and the food was delicious, just most likely would not be getting drinks. 3
Not really much of a drinker or to get drunk but this place Definitely got my attention with all the tropical drinks and service can't really complain I just wish there was more room to walk or to drink. It gets always packed after 7 or 8pm. 3
To premise my review I've been to Beri many times and with many different people. My friends and I are shocked by the low reviews this establishment receives. In my opinion here are the highlights of this place:Delicious (not overly sweet) Frozen YogurtMany Toppings to chooseFriendly Staff$1 small to satisfy the craving (cash only for the small)Punch cardsFriendly StaffPoppingsThe first topping that caught my eye that set this place apart from the rest are the "poppings". These are similar to tapioca / bubble tea balls / boba except they are flavored (mango, passion fruit, etc) juice surrounded with a thin coating. These things POP in your mouth. They are great, everyone should try them out. They offer many different flavors of frozen yogurt (~roughly 5-6: green tea, pomegranate, plain, strawberry, taro, and some others)Final note, everyone but one person that I've brought here enjoys this place. 5
A little pricey but worth it! The thumbprints and crescent moon cookies are so good! The iced nut roll is great for around the holidays. A must buy for new customers: Heavenly Chocolate Torte (you can get it iced with choc of vanilla buttercreme). It's sooooooooo good! 5
Both my psychiatrist and my GP (who have known me for years) suggested I see a neurologist about my seizures, and my GP recommended Dr. Reese. Reese was rude, condescending, and hadn't looked at any of my information beforehand. He constantly interrupted me and then made me repeat myself because I "wasn't clear the first time". He dismissed the idea that I had seizures and refused to explain his reasoning or what else it could possibly be. When I started asking about different types of seizures, and pointing out that seizures like simple partial ones aren't accompanied by convulsions, he told me "yes, well, you aren't the neurologist, are you?". He ignored my dad's presence entirely and wouldn't answer his questions. And after every time he inerrupted me, he would sigh and say, "Is there anything else you need me to listen to?" as if he didn't actually care what I had to say, and was only there because I was paying him to listen to me babble.I was scared, in pain, and wanted someone to listen to me and make me feel like there were answers somewhere. Reese not only failed to fulfill those basic requirements of a doctor, but managed to make my father and I feel completely ignored, hopeless, and angry.I wouldn't trust this doctor with my paycheck, let alone my life. Run away. This man is a doctor in title alone, and is basically only here to swindle you out of your money. 1
My hopes were extremely high for good southern food as the reviews seemed to rave everywhere I looked. However, if you are a real southerner who is used to home cooked meals by your grandmother/mother then you will not be impressed. The chicken is not as nearly impressive as it looks. It is NOT crispy, rather the skin is falling off with an almost too soft light texture. So you never really get that awesome and satisfying crunch when you think of great fried chicken. The concept was ideal but they didn't pull it off. The best dish was the Short Rib $32 14 oz. bone in short rib, charred corn, green beans sweet garlic bordelaise, cauliflower mashed potatoes. Expect a small portion of this with over-powering flavors of lingering oils! House Fries were yummy and yummy!Mac n Cheese, well texture and flavor nice but a little sweet for my palate.You won't be satisfied until you have the experience and can testify to your own dining experience here. 3
My experience at this restaurant marks the first time Yelp has lead me astray. I was so jazzed for what I thought would be an excellent evening, and was very disappointed. The tables in this place are crammed so close together, and the music is so loud I could barely have a conversation with my dinner companion. The charcuterie board was lacklustre, as was the pasta.The bill was $150 for two...at that price, there are so many other, better options to choose from that I won't be back. 2
Decent doughnuts, coffee is strong as hell! I drank one and a half cups and was up all of the following night! :-) 3
Love this place!! Everything tastes amazing and fresh. I would recommend the mangoberry salad it's yummy 5
I did a rennovation loan with Jeremy and his team in December 2014. I was buying my home late in the season over the holidays, and he went above and beyond to get everything sorted out and closed before the new year. He worked with me getting the renovation done so the lender was content and since I was out of state at the time, got the contractors work settled and the realtors on every side were stoked with how easy the transaction went. It's great when your loan service choice is the best choice that you make all year. 5
Great pizza and great service! Loved the tasty red sauce, crispy crust and friendly atmosphere. 5
I've found this food to be pretty good as far as Thai food goes. The wait staff is very friendly and the food comes out very quickly. The decor and location are both very nice with standard outdoor cafe seating during the nicer months and plenty of indoor seating. I've been there twice now and it's my standby restaurant if I want some good Thai food in the Laval area of Montreal. 4
This practice is amazing. The front office staff is excellent as are the vet techs. I have seen 3 vets at the practice, all of whom are outstanding. I have referred several of my friends to the practice and they are equally satisfied.  They give you as much time as you need during an appointment and clearly outline costs and give you options. A follow up call comes the day after an appointment, regardless of what you were seen for. Truly a caring and well run practice. 5
The staff at Barrow and particularly Dr. Luis Manuel Tumialan was abysmal.  After not getting a call back to me for a couple of days we set an appointment.  I describe my healthcare as Tricare which she says she accepts.  The appointment was a couple of months out but was willing to wait in spite of my back pain.  At 3:30 the day before my schedules appointment Sherry calls to tell me that they do not accept my insurance.  To make this worse, to enroll in Barrow you have to fill out their on line questionnaire that takes about 45 minutes of pain staking minutia... which includes WHO YOUR INSURANCE CARRIER IS!!   what a nightmare!So now I am back to square one.. with the same back pain.  Just avoid these guys. 1
This place was clean and really cheap.  But it definitely doesn't look like they have changed any of the fixtures/carpet/etc since their heyday when Elvis visited! Lots of cigarette burns, smelly hallways, and worn out carpets. Good to stay at if you are just sleeping in the room (clean sheets!) but go somewhere else if you expect anything more than that. 2
I was really hoping to find the next great mexican restaurant... but i didn't !!! the food is ok, not bad but not great, the problem is that it's way overpriced for what it isapetizer + entree will bring you to 35$-40$ per person!! i don't mind spending when the food is great but when it's just average, then LIMON we have a problem!even the Margaritas are average but at 12$ a glass... can get way better for half the price.the restaurant itself is very nice, i would recommend going with a group because it's quite noisy. but the seats... oh my God, so uncomfortable, no cushion and so big you are too far from the table when you wanna eat!!!service was nice, a bit slow, but ok for a Sat nighti really love mexican food and i can say i was disapointed with Limon, maybe the expectations were too high! too bad, i will not be coming back and will not recommend it 2
*Please understand the low score of this review is based purely on the server* FOOD, BEER, AND RESTAURANT WERE AWESOME!Four of us were seated at about 9:15pm on Saturday Dec 26 (Restaurant closed at midnight that night).  Our server (Rach K.) has a horrible poker face.  It was quite apparent that her need to go home was more important than our want to have some food and a couple beers.We ordered cheese curds, one pound of mussels, wings, and four beers.  The food was awesome.  About half way through the food, she dropped off checks without offering more beer.  She seemed annoyed that I ordered another beer, and it quickly became apparent that we were her last table of the night.  If she hadn't made the whole experience uncomfortable by asking what we wanted every two minutes, we would have stayed longer.  Finally after a four more beers, we watched her cheer and pump her arms as she took our checks back to the kitchen. 2
Food was a little bit more expensive then I would have liked, I personally like the goat roti I ordered but my friend said his roti was alright , and his mom said the same thing. the service was friendly and fast . 3
Went there on a Friday night. They were busy. The hostess was great. She was extremely friendly. Too bad she wasn't my waitress . I ordered the BBQ grilled chicken and the vegetables and baked potato for my side. I was told they were out of baked potatoes but if I wanted to wait 20 minutes, they would have them. I was getting an appetizer anyway. I said that I could wait. When my meal came, I got mashed potatoes instead. No explanation as to why I got mashed instead of baked. I waited for the waitress to come back and ask if everything was ok and she never did. I could have found somebody and said something but it wasn't worth the trouble. My whole meal was mediocre. The chicken was not that great. The vegetables were terrible. I ate very little of both. Honestly, the mashed potatoes were good but I asked for  a baked potato. I also would like an option of regular butter instead of cinnamon for the rolls. The rolls were good and my margarita was delicious. Not sure if I'd bother to return here again. All in all it was a mediocre experience. 3
Lee Lee's is a fine store with a lot of variety. I mostly purchase produce and meat! Clean and well organized. My go-to in the East Valley. 5
I was under the impression that Pure was kind of on the older side and wasn't super thrilled about coming here...BUT I went here with a group of 8 girls as part of a bachelorette weekend and we all LOVED it! We got in at about 12:30 or 1. We were on the guest list and only had to wait a few minutes to get in. The dance floor was crowded, but that's how it always is in Vegas clubs if you don't get there as soon as they open. The drinks were delicious and pretty average priced (it's still a bit expensive though). The deck area was AMAZING and the view of the strip was perfect. The music was perfect. They played hip-hop/rap downstairs and the deck area had more of an EDM vibe. The crowd was pretty good too (no one came in contact with any creeps). I'll definitely be back. 5
Disappointing. Subpar food, small portions, stale decor. The only redeeming factor is its average menu price. 2
Even though I had a reservation here, I fully expected to have to wait a while for my table.  Parking lot packed-check. Lots of folks on the entrance patio-check. Large group exiting while i'm entering-check. Yep it's going to be a long wait. But it wasn't! We were seated immediately and our server, Rio, came over and promptly introduced himself.Let me tell you this: Rio's attention to our table was first class.  He was very amiable and was patient and engaging with my too talkative and over sharing father.  Rio made us feel like we were his only customers.  He did his best to make sure that we were satisfied. Ask to be seated in Rio's section if you want great service.We ordered 1/2 dozen blue points on the half shell.  Seven of those succulent oysters arrived at our table with ketchupy cocktail sauce, horseradish and mignonette as toppings.  The mignonette was tasty and who doesn't love raw horseradish! Yummy!My Dad and I both had naked scallops with broccolini, and lemon caper sauce on the side for our main.  I specifically asked Rio for steamed veg, no butter.  The plates arrived with four scallops not three (because of their size, I guess) and a shiny portion of broccolini. I asked Rio again for just steamed veg and he happily complied with a smile and a new portion arrived within minutes - still shiny.  Rio brought another serving as well in case I wasn't satisfied. Rio really is a customer service pro!Scallops were delicious and perfectly cooked although the lemon caper sauce was undistinguished. Three servings of identical broccolini convinced me that they must spray oil on the veg in the kitchen. I just don't get that.I'd give Pappadeaux food 3.5 stars but Rio's service elevates my rating to four. 4
The food here is good but as for customer service I have nothing good to say. My husband and I would come here often just to grab some Chinese food since it was only 5 mins away from where we live.  Last time I had called in to place an order I asked if I can place an order of beef broccoli and an order of tofu in brown garlic sauce. She said something that I couldn't understand and hung up . So once I got there an old lady approach me and said " hi can I help you". I told her that I called in not to long ago but wasn't sure if she had my order down correctly. So she brought me the slip and well the beef broccoli was correct but as for my tofu  she had wrote down something so I told her and pointing it out on the menu that I wanted tofu but instead of the oyster sauce if I can have in with brown garlic sauce. We came back to pick up our food and there was a guy server this time and we've been served by him before and he was super nice.  We told him that we placed a pick up order for beef broccoli and tofu in brown sauce. Once he opened up my box of food he had a confused look on his face and asked me if I asked for tofu and I responded" yes I did" he looked at me and said I don't see any tofu in here so he called out the lady and said that I had asked for tofu but there's no tofu in here.. Well this is where all the madness happens the lady came storming out  pointing her finger in my face while there was a customer sitting at the table waiting for his pick up order, yelling at me and honestly I couldn't understand what she was saying. So we sat down and waited for our food and the same nasty old lady was at the front desk and said that it was my fault and stuff about her working there for over 10 years .. HA!! Really!!??? Is this how you treat the customers ...   I was soo mad and hurt by the way I was treated that I kind of tear up a bit . I honestly will NEVER EVER come back here again after that incident. I just feel bad for the business because their food is wonderful and well I thought their service was good until I met that nasty lady .. 1
I went here for a friend's birthday on Saturday.  This was my second time there, and I have to say that everything is pretty mediocre.  The service is inattentive and casual, but the waiters are very nice.  Some of the food is really good--I really like the coq au vin, the country pate, and the cheese plate.  But the various flavors in the famous burger (which I've had twice) get sort of melded together into a fatty, greasy mess.  If you go there, ask to sit outdoors because it's very pretty and there is a trippy, tacky show every half an hour. 3
I've been searching for some decent Pho in the south part of Calgary.  Out of all the places I've tried, this one is the best by far (although, still not my favourite).  When I get a hankering for rare beef pho with a side of spring rolls, this is where I'll be going...at least until I find that elusive favourite.  Still, will worth it and the staff is very friendly. 4
After finishing the noodle, add a bowl of rice into the soup to make congee :) 4
THIS IS TO BRI G. Can we take a minute to realize that an employee wrote back to a guest? If you would have told us this in person, this would have been a different story. Anyways Bri, you have to understand that dinner isn't a job appointment l, I'm sorry I wasn't on time. As for making other guest feel.comfortable why is that my concern?  I don't go to a restaurant thinking my arrival is a such a burden.  The minute we got there you were giving us attitude and treating us like a bunch of kids who came in to be rude, loud and have a purpose of being annoying. And before I forget, why were arguing with me about how many cups.of water were at the table? They were 4 people and 8 glasses of water. There's no excuse for taking someone's food too early, I've never seen that happen. There's a difference between asking the guest "Any dessert for tonight?" And "any are we ready for free (whether they are or not) birthday dessert? And to top it off you came back with a bill saying you added 20 percent to the gratuity because of the trouble we put you thru... 2
Love the strawberry waffle and coffee.  The AZ potatoes were good too.  We will definitely be coming back. 4
"Gourmet burger" is an oxymoron.  Put truffles on in, put caviar on it, it still is a hamburger,  Maybe there was a day when putting A.1. Peppercorm spread or chipotle aioli on a hamburger was enough to get attention, but today you can get an Angus Mushroom and Swiss burger at McDonald's.Don't get  me wrong, I love a good hamburger as much as the next red-blooded American,   But on my first and last trip to a Red Robin, I found the "gourmet burger" pitch off-putting.  I made the mistake of ordering the Bleu Ribbon.  I mean, I love bleu cheese (they even spelled it right!) on a burger.  This, however, was overwhelmed with the steak sauce and chipotle aioli (no, the two do not go well together, in case you wondered).  In hindsight I wish I had ordered something that would have let me know whether they can properly prepare a hamburger.I enjoyed Bad Daddy's Burger Bar much better, and think their menu is much more creative.Red Robin is an attractive place, and our server was good. 2
I brought my friend here to celebrate her divorce and it was so much fun!!! When we first walked in and sat down I had a guy come up to me and just start giving me a lap dance. He didn't ask and when he was done wanted to be paid. For this reason alone I did not give 5 stars. Besides that the experience was great! I will say that JT is the best. I had a few dances from him. He was my fav by far! All of the guys were great while dancing on stage. It's just a lot of fun all around. I definitely recommend it! 4
This is one of my favorite places to have a cheat meal!  Nobody likes the prices or the long waits, but I have always said chipolte is the Starbucks of food.  Their guac is top notch and I could eat just that!  Their service is always fast (as possible)  and friendly. 4
My friends and I came here because of a recommondation.  Looking from the outside, the looks attractive because of the outdoor seating.  Upon entering, we were greeted immediatley.  We were asked if we wanted to sit outside or inside and we chose to dine inside the restaurant because it was too hot.  My problem eating inside is that the music is too loud.  It's very difficult to converse when the volume is turned up to the max.  My friend's father asked our waitress to lower the volume so we can talk, but we didn't notice the difference.  Oh well.  On with the food.We were provided with chips and salsa and I was dissappointed.  The salsa was bland and too runy.  I believe Chevy's salsa taste better than this.  The food is standard tex mex restaurant menu and prices.  I ordered the chicken fajitas and they were very good and tasty.  I was so full that I was unable to finish it.  My wife ordered the the shrimp quesidilla and it was okay.  My friends enjoyed their food, but nothing to knock us of our feet.  As I wrote earlier, other than the chips and sales everything else was ok. Nothing to call home about, but also not worth complaining about either. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive and the ambitance is very lively.Overall...if you want tex mex, nachos and maragaritas...The Salty Senorita is the place for you. 3
A couple days ago my sister's phone died.  We were out and about and headed straight for a TMoble store that she knew of.  Since I have TMobile too, I took advantage of the stop and addressed an issue with my phone that had been annoying me for months (but it wasn't keeping me from using it so I kept putting off the trip).  A technician named Vince looked at my phone and within about two minutes had the problem fixed.  In the next couple minutes we addressed another question I had and ended up learning some very valuable things about my phone.  He was great and I was very happy.  My sister and her husband were also very satisfied with the service in the store.  It's too bad they ended up highly frustrated by the so-called customer service that they were forced to deal with TMobile's over seas telephone technicians.  The result was them nearly dropping TMobile all together.  The moral of this story is if you can get anything done at the store, do it at the store. 4
Excellent customer service and they always look to get us the best coverage and price possible.  Anthony, Ivan, and Eric are awesome! 5
Looking for some good Italian and this place is a home run!  Loved the sweet potato cannelloni. Kale salad was delicious. 5
Known for the "best patio and worst service." Since, establishment has opened, they continue to honor the tag line above You are welcomed by eye rolling hostesses, that clearly need basic training for the lack of people skills. Waited over an hour for a reservation at 7pm, so don't bother making one. The food was alright but nothing was memorable. LB 1
Great ambiance !!decor at lucky foo's is quite original to any neighborhood restaurant/bar you'd see off strip. We ordered the charred edamame and Brussels sprouts .. WOW!! That's all I can say.  The sushi came out quick and fresh and the staff was very courteous. To top it all off we had the Funkler for dessert .... ***warning*** if you have anything to do after you eat you probably want to postpone it till the next day because you will want to sleep Overall everything was great! 5
The service is not bad but you need to make sure to repeat requests such as, can I have milk for my coffee, or they forget the first few times. The food is......... Ok. It's trying to be trendy and it's decor sort of does but the food does not. The ham off the bone is either delicious or seems almost raw. It's totally hit or miss. The eggs are ok. The pancakes steer clear of they are dryer then the desert we live in. It's not cheap so I can't play that up and I'm always shocked by how crowded it is. For the better option I'd head to Herb Box next door. 2
I would give less stars if possible.  The tech's first visit quickly got to the problem.  A part was replaced but the problem persisted.  The next visit was 12/29/14 and this time a different part was needed.  I was told to expect a week for delivery.  It's now 1/21/15.  Their early reasons for the delay were the holidays.  Now they just say it's on back order.  I would not recommend this company if you are interested in resolving an appliance problem. 1
We got extra charges on our bill without notifying us in advance. A no go for sure. Quality is just so so. 1
Food was good as usual, I liked that they have alcohol available at this location. Service was a bit too attentive, but wasn't really a nuisance 4
Not a fan of this location, since they do not honour promotions that all other Quiznos honours.I recommend the location at Adelaide and Yonge. 1
Bought this tour for myself, brother and dad and let me say that I was not disappointed! Our tour guide Donald was an awesome host, very informative & gave many suggestions for other restaurants in town. All of the restaurants we were high quality food and we never had to wait on a table. The restaurants staff were very gracious. I would also advise to purchase the drink package. That itself was a great experience, too she'll beverage were to die for. I do plan on telling all my friends about this tour and will also be attending the other tours offered. Donald - great job, hope that you will be the tour guide on the next tours. 5
Awesome is the best way to describe North Park Lounge. My son came home on leave and surprised his girlfriend and her family during dinner. The staff worked with us to pull off the surprise. They were very accommodating. After we were done with dinner and asked for our bill (there were 7 of us) our waitress said a few of the girls got together and took care of our whole bill!  Words can't express how grateful we are to the staff to make my son's homecoming special. The staff was wonderful and food was fantastic!  I highly recommend North Park Lounge. 5
Carve is a steakhouse-restuarant for those who want a more formal ambience without the pretentious uptight atmosphere found in some "dressy" restaurants. I'll start with the attire since it might be an issue to some people. In general there appeared to be customers from the casino or more smartly dressed people with jeans and a nice shirt so it's not very strict like some other establishments that require "dressy attire". Tidy overall though.There is a very subdued low lighting, just enough to see the table and others around you. You never feel like you're in the dark though, just right for ambience. It was also pretty quiet so you could easily talk with others without resorting to vocal cord abuse. The service was very good as others have mentioned. A nice bread basket arrived with a variety of sweet and white bread as well as a very tasty crisp bread, looked like tacos but it might have been parm crisps. We started off with fried calamari as an appetizer: big portion but I was somewhat disappointed with the crust, tasted the same as the mozzarella sticks on TGI Fridays. Not bad tasting, just expected more.We also ordered a Caprese salad which truly stood out.. The fresh mozzarella was so soft, moist and creamy and combined with the vinaigrette it created this mild antithesis of textures of flavors.For the main dish we ordered the famous prime rib that Carve is known for. It is available in 3 sizes: 12, 16 and 20 oz. Frankly we did not notice much size difference between the 12 and 16 oz. The prime rib itself though was a revelation. Very soft and juicy, with sweet fat portions, cooked to perfection. I am not a prime rib fanatic but I do enjoy well cooked prime rib and I have to say this was the best I had so far.As far as the price goes, it came to roughly $35 per person (we did not order wine), which I think is very reasonable for the food quality and service. I will definitely visit again to try the other interesting dishes they have and I suggest you do too! 5
I recently bought a corsage here for my senior prom. It was not at all what I asked for even though the girl I had talked to said there would be no problem replicating the photo I showed her. They redid it and it was still nothing like I wanted, but I did not have time so i paid and left. The corsage was a random white flower spray painted the wrong color blue (instead of an actual blue flower) and it was so sloppily put together it fell apart within a few hours and did not even last until prom started. The rest of the store is good, but do not order any flowers or you might be disappointed. I paid around $30 for trash I could have put together better myself. Another customer was also dissatisfied with her corsage as well, but I did not see how they fixed hers. 3
Wasnt planing to get AYCE, but if you like unlimited uni sushi and soft shell crab here is the place you need to be. 4
Was here for a party last weekend and had a blast. They play great Jazz music on Sundays and the tapas are really amazing. Would highly recommend. 5
Delicious food but lackluster performance. Chef was friendly and engaging tho. Must try! 4
I went this morning an got the bad service from the Spanish girl with the flower leggings on. She put my order in last after people came after me. She didn't smile. The sandwich wasn't good want be going back. 1
It was my first time here, i had a good experience but i thought the food i had was ok.  Maybe i dont have a very sophisticated palette, but i thought the fondue was ok.  The cheese didn't have a very appetizing taste to it.  I ordered the short ribs which were awesome!! They fell right off the bone and had great taste.  they pair it with a mashed potato that had a weird spearmint taste that overwhelmed the dish.  I had a drink called the moscow mule, very refreshing and it doesn't feel like you are having alcohol.  My fiance ordered the chopped salad, supposedly one of the best salads she has had.  I had a bite and agreed it was very good.  The ambiance it nice, a little dark, but was cool how it felt like you were in a house.  I will go back, but hopefully have a good all around meal. 3
Mamma's Pizza!!Many pizza places have disappointed me lately, but not Mamma's Pizza. Its just a small pizza place, barely any room to sit in, but I love the pizzas. The crust is thin and crispy which I love.Staff is friendly, food is great, I'll definitely be back more than once! 4
Upscale Syrian food. Traditional decor with lanterns, cushions. Food is excellent- wonderful flavors. Don't get too full on the mezze- the main meal portions are quite large and filling! Lamb dishes are the highlight. Lovely traditional Syrian tea with cardamom and honeyed sweets to finish off the night. Friendly and efficient service. A bit pricey though. Overall a great night! 4
The last time I checked Arabic's don't microwave chicken........sure its packed look at the quality of the people that live in whitby hicks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 1
I've had so many massages at so many places, it's been hard to find a massage therapist that really stands out in my mind, that is until I had my first massage with John. Professional, knowledgeable, and a true master at his craft, John manages to fix what ails me without making me cringe in pain. I am a hairstylist, and my neck, shoulders and hands suffer, in fact, I was close to seeing an orthopedic surgeon for my hands, but since my most recent massage with John, I have literally NO aching. He is absolutely a MUST, you will walk out feeling like a new person!!!!! Do it. Hurry. Off you go. Get yourself to Space and let John get you back in line! 5
First timer and felt rushed.  They were out of this out of that.  The girl really offered no help. Tincture I purchased has produced no effects as claimed. 2
Group of 7 for a Sunday brunch.Step 1.  order 7 caesars.  received 5.  was felt to be responsible for said error.Step 2.  ordered a mimosa.  order was refused on the grounds of it being "to classic".  was in turn up sold to a 14 dollar drink.Step 3.  ordered an assortment of egg dishes for the table - all were incorrectly or incredibly over-cooked.  again, was felt to be responsible for the missteps.  this doesn't even compare to the preparation of the pork belly which were essentially jerky.  or worse.Step 4.  the tomatoes were great.  Step 5. THE CAESAR'S WERE 11 DOLLARS!Step 6.  as such, it was 100 dollars per couple for what was an entirely unsatisfactory brunch experience.Step 7.  we will never go there again. ever. 1
We had a large party for a friend's birthday.  The shark tank was awesome and very entertaining.   We got there about 5 minutes after they were seated.  We had to wait about 10 minutes before our came back to ask for drink orders.  Then we watched as she went and made 3 rounds to her other tables before we got our drinks.  I had asked specifically if they had Dr . Pepper she said they did.  It was mr.pibb.  I do not like mr.pibb.  There was a picture of the blue cheese burger showing lots of blue cheese.  I ordered that and asked for onion rings instead of fries.   I was told that i might as well order them as an extra side because i would be charged the extra $2 anyway.  So i did.  My burger actually looked better than the picture.  It was delicious.   However my friend ordered chicken fried steak and got a pile of breading and some steak inside of it.  Her mother ordered a baked potato with sour cream, bacon, and onion, and instead got butter and sour cream.  And the kids all got their plates absolutely last so they whined until their food came.  Our server only asked those drinking beer if they wanted refills, the rest of us resigned to being thirsty while she filled salt and pepper shakers at other tables.  She obviously didn't care too much since her gratuity was added automatically. 2
Great local, family owned sandwich shop. Food is good, and prices are very reasonable. Also, they have a great vegetarian sub, which is uncommon for sandwich shops. Definitely a 4th Ward must try. 5
Two stars for the duck pond. That's it. Margs taste like sugar water, food overpriced and actually tasteless. I feel bad because I used to love this place and I know people that work there.  But the food sucked last two times and the service was so so. Got a super bad vibe from my server because we just ordered apps(that sucked) one was so bad we returned it. Anyways, two  dry tamales and three margs (house!!!!)were 34.00. Still tipped $8. Sorry I didn't spend $75- but I won't spend even $30 again there. Bad food, rude service. Nice duck pond. That's all ya got. 2
I mean, it's Steak 'n Shake, you don't expect much. But never order any of their seasoned fries, you will NOT get them. The last 3 times I've asked for salt and vinegar fries (including about 20 minutes ago) I just got regular fries. Might not be a big deal if that wasn't the whole reason I went there. 1
the staff seemed pleasant enough, until after a lengthy exchange in which I, as a first time visitor, asked about 3 or 4 of the options, and finally made my choice, was then told that the one I wanted they were out of :(  given the staff was at the station preparing another mac and cheese as we spoke, and it wasn't busy, I was very disappointed they didn't tell me up front what they were out of.and more importantly, after waiting a few minutes while the food was in the oven, I walked the short 4minute walk home to eat a small $7 mac and cheese that was unevenly cooked. some bites were hot, others were lukewarm. if this is all you are selling, it would make sense to make sure the food is thoroughly hot?!i like the concept and want to return, but not sure it is worth the money. 2
I've been to this place three times. The first two times were for lunch. The food was mediocre, at best.  Their breakfast menu looked so good, though, that I decided to give it a try. Let's just say that this place really needs a management overhaul. The whole experience was shockingly bad. First, we were greeted by a young man who kept wondering off, coming back by, saying, "hold on," wondering off again, and then finally seating us in a restaurant that wasn't even particularly crowded. A little unusual, but no big deal so far. A waitress came in a reasonable amount of time and took our drink orders. My ice tea was horrid. It definitely did not taste freshly brewed and had an artificial lemon flavor to it. She took our orders, and brought the children's (burnt) food quickly. Then about 15 minutes later, came back and said they were out of what I had ordered. I found something else to order, and someone eventually brought it along with our other adult meal. Our food was cold when we got it, and of course the kids were done eating by then.  We then didn't see our waitress for about 45 minutes, long after we had finished eating our cold food and were trying to entertain our children who were understandably getting restless at that point.  We were finally able to flag her down and get our bill. I never once saw any sign of management anywhere. I can't say that I would recommend the place, unless they get new management and some major staff training, which is a shame because it's a nice  looking place and has a potentially good menu. 1
I'm no sure if we got a bad box or not...but these are the most disgusting pastries I have ever had. Four of us shared a mixed box and sampled each one. Everyone of us gagged. One person spit the lemon from the lemon meringue across the room. This will haunt me for years! 1
Really?  The only Pinot Grigio available is Santa Margarita @ $12/glass!  I'm not a beer drinker and since this is a sports bar, I expected a quaffable white wine at a reasonable price. PLUS the waitress didn't tell us about the limited selection and high price.  To me this is an easy fix if they want to attract more women. 2
I understand the prices are low and there is a "pay for what you get" mentality. It is in a conventent location, and cheap...However, next time I am going somewhere that actually serves good food and offers a friendly service. I had to ask for chopsticks after my food came. You will absolutely not find authentic cuisine here or anything close to it. I will not be returning and recommend you go somewhere else, too. 2
I gave these place a second chance since they do have alot of mexican products that walmart n frys dnt have but i regret going back i went back bought my groceries the whole time i was thei i was regretting being there every time i went to grab something their were flys on it even on the stuff inside the refrigerators an one isle as i was going trough it smell so horrible i almost puked defiantly never going back an customer service is so horrible i waited for like 15 minutes for someone so help me at the seafood place horrible place. 1
Mushroom salad and sweetbreads were my favourite. Along with the deserts! Mushroom salad had a nice tangy dijon mustard buttery dressing on it and sweetbreads are just my favourite thing so it's hard to go wrong. Their pouding chomeur? is really good and reminds me of the cake at bar isabel - so yummy!I would rate this place a 3.5 3
The stylist cut it exactly the way I wanted it without me having to give her too many instructions. She was quick and precise. They normally cater to men and boys. I am a female but I wear my hair short because I wear a wig and it gets hot with the extra hair on my head.I did not feel uncomfortable although there were other guys in the shop. Fast friendly service. Went to the other place across the street, I am much more satisfied with Sports Clip! 5
Love love love this place!  Great new items, odd finds you cant get anywhere else! And he best awesome sushi bar with the best prices and fantastic sushi chefs! Everyone is so nice and helpful! 5
The worst gym; poor service, unprofessional staff, and overall a place to avoid- Been a extreme fitness membership for 7 years, and Goodlife member for almost 3 years- never thought I would be treated so poorly. 1
Went here with a group of friends and the food was terrible.  The carne asada was burnt and the seasoning on it was quite unpleasant making it almost inedible.  The beans and rice were bland.  My friend ordered a  burrito that was supposed to come with avocado, when she brought this up with the waitress she retorted with "well we didn't charge you for it,so there's nothing I can do".  She couldn't understand that it was SUPPOSED to have it as per their description, and all my friend wanted was a discount for the chicken she added to it.  Only upside is that the margaritas were decent and did their job.Service sucks, food ranged from inedible to meh, and they were pricey to boot...won't be going back. 1
This would have been a nice experience had our order not been made incorrect, our meals actually arrive at the same time, and had the food been made that day.  Supposedly this place has been around for a decade, however it struggled with only four seated tables.I ordered two empanadas in leu of an entree and my boyfriend had ordered the curried chicken.  After multiple, "the chef is working on your food right now," excuses I was presented with a single beef empanada, and he, the curried chicken.  As a vegetarian this presented a problem, and I was still missing an empanada.  Roughly 10 minutes later I received my correct empanadas.  They seemed a little dry to me, but at this point I was too hungry to care.  It wasn't until we had finished eating that the waitress came to our table with bottles of sauces and say, "Oh I guess you didn't need any sauce!" The curried chicken was floating in about 1/4 cup of broth which he used to rehydrate the dry rice that still held the form of the measuring cup it was scooped with.  Chef Mike (microwave) obviously reheated the rice and beans.  The rice was crunchy, and the beans were dry and split.  The salad took up half the plate, and was simply pico de gallo on a bed of iceberg lettuce.  He would have been happy with this for lunch, served on a paper plate, from a food truck for $7.  It did not pass as a $13 entree item.     Items ordered: Patacones, Bean & Spinach Empanadas, Curried Chicken, Jamaican Iced Tea, Caipirinha 1
Not very impressed. I went in to get a set of Bio-Sculpture nails with French finish and 3 days after application my nails started to chip. I went in for a touch-up and they were gracious enough to do it, but after another 3-4 days it happened again and an entire strip of the white tip peeled right off my thumb. Bio Gel - when done properly - should last WEEKS! I could tell immediately during the application process that she wasn't layering the gel properly. I had asked fro French finish and that was only applied last when it should have been applied beneath a layer of Bio in order to secure it in place. The decor is wonderful and it LOOKS like a professional high-end salon (their prices also reflect that!) and the staff is very friendly, but the quality of the work is lacking. Maybe Bio Gel just isn't their speciality. Maybe it might be shellac and eye lashes. Either way, I was not impressed, unfortunately. I've only ever done Bio Sculpture Gel for the last 5 years and I KNOW when it's done well and when it's not and how long it's supposed to last.I will likely not be going back here for Bio gel. 2
The food tasted great and the price was awesome.  Their lunch specials are only $5 and come with enough food for two.  Dinner specials are only $8 and come with even more.  Highly recommend! 5
I originally wanted to go to the cafe across the street but it was full house there so we came here for a late lunch. It's my second time here and it was not a nice experience. We didn't even sit down and eat. We walked in at 2:00pm not knowing they close at 2:30pm. The guy who greeted us (oh and I don't think he was dressed properly if he was working there) said to me they will close at 2:30pm in poker face and flat tone and asked if that's okay. Somehow I heard he said 3:30pm so I thought we have enough time so I said okay no problem then he led us to a booth then walked away. Then my husband turned to me said he heard him said 2:30pm but he wasn't sure. So I went up and asked the guy again... and once again he used his poker face said 2:30pm. I felt so pissed with his tone and manner and said its okay we are not going to eat here and walked out. I worked in restaurant before and i totally understand it would be kinda pissed to have customers walk in before closing but this is a service industry. If you want to close at 2:30pm sharp then just stop taking patrons at 2:00pm. I think that's totally their decision. My first time here wasn't impressive too. The food was just okay so with this experience I will not go there again. 1
Love their coffee and food! Very friendly staff.  I just wish they had more seating:-( 4
man, the bread is hard as hell. everything else is okay. check out hue thai for some good banh 2
Super friendly staff - owner is around, will stop for a chat. Have been here several times and the place is always busy. The 10$ dinner specials are well worth it! Great pierogies!  Food is good - the side salad and entry salads are really good. Bar prices are very reasonable. They also apparently have different cheesecakes delivered with some pretty unique flavors (apple walnut, creamscicle) I have not had them yet but the waitress has said they are good. Nice casual hang out spot. 4
My husband bought 4 mini variety cupcakes and a huge lemon cupcake. they were not worth the price he paid for them. Mini cupcakes were dry, only thing delicious was the lemon. Maybe i didn't like the cupcakes because I'm a fan of chiffon. Would not go back again. Smith's has better cupcakes for half the price. 2
I'm just going to throw it all out there and say this is probably the best meal I have ever had, bar none.We ended up here thanks to a $50 food and beverage comp I had.  If it hadn't been for that, I would have never even thought to eat at this place.  This was everything you would expect from a high-end restaurant: beautiful decor, ambiance, superior service.  I was extremely impressed that when the dining room doors were closed, you absolutely cannot hear any of the noise from the casino floor.  Quite the feat considering when were were there the table dancers were performing less than 50 steps away from the entrance to the restaurant.We started with the escargot.  It was incredibly fantastic.  I'd had escargot before and it was always my experience that they were a little bit chewy, so that is what I expected.  That was completely not the case here.  They were warm. soft, tender, buttery, and just enough garlic to get a really good flavor but it didn't punch you in the mouth or send you running for the mouthwash.For our entrees my boyfriend had the sauteed green-peppercorn filet of beef and I had the pan seared duck breast and duck sausage.  On my first bite I just melted.  Gave out and audible "mmmmmm" complete with an eyeroll....and again with the second bite....and again with the third....then I cut into the sausage and I nearly fell out of the booth.  Every bite was pure heaven.  I think my boyfriend was pretty sure he was going to have to take my upstairs for a smoke afterward!  I have never had duck so perfectly cooked.  Tender, juicy, and so full of flavor.My boyfriend was enjoying the same out of his steak.  He sacrilegiously ordered the steak "medium", which in my opinion instantly kills the flavor of the meat.  However it was so wonderfully seasoned that there was zero compromise in the flavor and so perfectly cooked that I'm pretty sure it could have been cut with a spork!For dessert we decided on the pistachio souffle with white chocolate sauce.  Completely fluffy, moist, sweet goodness in a bowl.  It stood beautifully and there was a wonderful crisp crunch to the outside, and oh-so-soft, warm, and melted inside.  The last bite where the white chocolate sauce had fused with and melted into the remains of the souffle was complete perfection.Normally I would scoff at dropping this much coin on a single meal, but this place is now going to be built into the Vegas budget.  I'm a year away from going again and already I'm craving this food.  We've already decided on the rack of lamb and Dover sole for the next round! 5
My family & I have been patients for Dr. Levins for 20+ years.  HE IS ABSOLUTELY THE BEST DR. EVER.  He's always patient (especially appreciated with my elderly parents), and answers all your questions.  He is open to discussing all options for your health care, and supports you in your decision.  And get this...he has never once made me feel rushed or acted as though he didn't have time for me.  I doubt many can say that about their doctor.  He has recently moved to a new office, so I can't speak on the staff, although I feel the comments below regarding his previous location are exaggerated.  His medical assistants were terrific.  You simply can't find a better or more caring physician than Dr. Levins. 5
I initially wanted to give this a 4 star; however, Yelps categorization of "Yay, I am a fan" isn't exactly appropriate. Quite frankly, I don't trust George Brazil. For clarification, The customer service and office personnel are GREAT! They really do try to work with the customer and they really do try to make things right... however, it is their service personnel that I don't trust. Two of the four that have came to my home have tried to sell me a new a/c unit and made rude remarks like, "Well I hope it lasts you another 4-5 years." This is odd because the unit air handler is under 15 years old and the heat pump is under 10 (there are houses from the 1970s with still working air conditioners on them and they are trying to tell me that a less than 15 year old (total) unit is already on the brink). I realize it can all be related to how well the system was maintained; however, I'm not buying it. That being said, they were not overly pushy... just rude about it. Secondly, we never had any A/C problems at all until we decided to get on their maintenance plan. Then all of the sudden things started going out. Is this proof positive they did something wrong? ...no. In fact, I am willing to give them the benefit of the doubt and chock it up to coincidence. My biggest problem with George Brazil is the service personnel don't seem to know what they are talking about when it comes to company policy. Case in point, I was told in the winter that my refrigerant was a bit low (not horrible but a bit low) and that I would probably need to have someone top it off when spring/summer hit (as temperatures affect the volume). I asked the guy how much they charged for that? He informed me that if I spent another couple of hundred and get their service plan that it would be taken of. I mentioned that would be fine as I was also concerned that the drain pipe may be plugged and need blown out. He said that would also be included. Thinking this was a win-win, I paid the additional amount and put my mind at ease until spring/summer. When spring/summer rolled around I was called by George Brazil to schedule the service (as per the contract). Lo and behold, the new service guy arrived and stated the refrigerant and blowing out of the drain pipe would be an additional charge. I informed him that this is not what the previous guy said and proceeded to pull out the paperwork. He then argued with me about what the paper said. Since he was a bit rude about it, I called the main line of George Brazil (who reiterated what service guy stated but agreed to perform the tasks if I would agree to give up one of my service calls). This was fine (as that is what I thought we were doing anyhow). The management and phone service personnel were great about it and they were truly trying to make it right. Which is fine; however, the first service guy apparently suckered me into a contract on a lie (whether intentional or not), and when confronting the second guy he was rude about it. He even made suggestive remarks about what a nice home, television, and car we have. What's wrong with complimenting that? Well... it was done in a sarcastic manner with the insinuation that we could afford to pay him for blowing out the drain pipe and topping off the refrigerant (and it concluded with a remark of, "I sure wish I had those things."). Maybe we could afford it, maybe we couldn't... but when we bought into a contract on the basis that services were included... we expected what we paid for. He was just plain out RUDE about it!They are now calling me to schedule another "maintenance" (probably with more hidden costs). I told them I wanted to cancel the service call but they still keep calling anyway. At this point, I don't even care if we are reimbursed for the unused service call.  I just don't trust whoever they are going to send out (and I don't want other things going wrong within 2-3 weeks after the visit). I'd rather them keep the money and not touch it again. The company itself is great and customer focused but the service personnel need more training (and to understand their own service agreements, regardless of which service person was telling the truth). Plain and simple... I don't trust them anymore. 3
The food was okay, but not up to price. Most disappointing element is open element to the casino. Bar is behind glass doors and restaurant open. More of airport restaurant atmosphere than high end steakhouse. 2
I like Primanti Bros, this location wasn't all I hoped and dreamed. Plus one star for being a Pittsburgh experience, minus a star for serving a mediocre version of it. 3
***** BUYER BEWARE!! ***** They will take your money get you a used copier and if there is any problem with the copier forget any kind of service.  The copier I purchased needed some repair and Ron would not answer phone calls from my phone.  They do not honor any kind of 30 day guarantee. 1
This is a tough one to review...we used the drive thru service which was incredibly slow (one car ahead of us). I was doubtful from the beginning that a drive thru could run efficiently for a Subway. When we pulled up to the window we had a coupon, the employer helping us, Courtney, took it but another employee, Kathy, snapped that we couldn't use it. Courtney explained that the coupon had their specific location on it and ended up phoning a manager to ask. The manager approved the use of our coupon. While waiting for our order to be made we saw Kathy sneeze, into her shirt, but with gloves on she held the front of her shirt. Now we all know that spit, viruses, and bacteria still pass thru shirts. Was it better than sneezing into the air? Sure. Should she have still at the minimum changed her gloves? Yes; but did she? Of course not. She then also adjusted her hair behind her ears with the same gloves and continued right along making sandwiches. The order Courtney made for us was correct and she was very pleasant to deal with however I would not return to this location because of Kathy and what we witnessed and her general attitude. 2
As soon as you walk in your smacked in the face with this wonderful aroma of sweet yumminess. We were walking around so I decided to get the cupcake shake to make it easy to enjoy .. Smores cupcake and vanilla ice cream ... I don't know .. But it just didn't seem right. I took a few gulps and couldn't stomach anymore. It was so thick and grainy. I tossed it. I came back a few hours later with my mom who ended up getting the salted caramel cupcake. Meh, it wasn't that great. The frosting wasn't overly sweet but the cake was dry. The price isn't bad for such a "colossal" cupcake at 3.25 ... But that's about it. I definitely won't be back .. It wasn't something I will crave. 2
I have used these folks for church events over the past 6 months and they have been exceptionally professional and accomodating.   We have mainly had a need to order tables (round) and chairs.   They deliver and pick-up when they say they are going to. They issue invoices/receipts. We keep them as a referral in our directory for weddings as well. Our overall experience with them has been great.  In the future I will use them for personal events. 5
Best value soo much food for the price. They do a large single topping for 10 bucks i had a two topper larger for 12!!! Soo good. They have the best chicken wings in town, not over cooked like the pubs. This location is the best! 5
This place is not open on sundays. We drove there before their posted hours, on Yelp it showed they were open until midnight on Sundays n were closed at around o:30pm. 1
I eat out from this place often as I work within the area. I've only had the half chicken lunch special which comes with two sides and have never been disappointed.Chicken is super tender, rice is delicious and moist and the potatoes are just right. It's simple, clean, delicious Portuguese chicken. Nothing fancy, but everything flavorful. Would definitely recommend this to anyone. 4
I am an aging martial artist and the years of abuse have finally caught up with me.  My back and hips have been causing me some painful problems.  I have visited several chiropractors in the valley seeking help.  Dr. Burnett is the only one who has been able to give me long lasting relief.  Her approach is refreshing and effective.  She spends time looking at my whole body and addresses the issues she finds.  And I really like the massage therapy after the chiro session!  She has an excellent and caring staff and I highly recommend Four Peaks Chiropractic. 5
This pizza is the best ever. I am from Boston and love my pizza and this place does not disappoint. Not only for pizza, the salads are huge and fresh and fabulous!!!. The pasta dishes are also great, with lots of garlic and fresh basil. Don't forget to try the lasagna.... the best. 5
Kailin was the best waitress! Very attentive and quick for a party of 6! Would highly recommend the kalbi beef with strawberry yogurt Soju. 5
Not recommended. Our dog was cut with big choppy marks. Hair was long and short all over. Face was trimmed on right side and not on left side. He looked like a sheep when done. Was 45 minutes late and charged way too much. I had to re-trim the dog again as he looked ridiculous. 1
My wife and I had our date night at the Esplanade for the first time since it's renovation.  I was surprised at the changes made to the place.  Gone was the old ticket booth, and the lobby/concession stand area was turned into a bar lounge type atmosphere.  Looked like a cool spot to hang out and wait for your movie if you were early, or even to it and chat, if on a date, after the movie.You can purchase your tickets at the automated machines, or buy/pick them up inside at Guest Services.  The employees were very cordial as we passed them on our way to our seats inside the theater.  We decided on the Cinema Suites, since it was 21&over.  We were impressed with the layout, and the very comfortable seats that recline.  Our server was very nice and informative.  I was surprised when she was entering our order into her pad, the other servers were bring our drinks and appetizers.  WOW!  That's faster and more impressive than a restaurant.  I had the sirloin tips and mashed potato's, and my wife had the fried shrimp with fries.  I can't comment on any mixed drinks, (another reviewer complained of watered down drinks) mainly because we had wine. All in all, it was ok.  Kinda like food at an Applebee's, or Chili's.  Nothing to go crazy about, mediocre, and over priced, but it WAS a MOVIE THEATER.  I mean, It's not a Michelin Star restaurant.  I don't care that it is in the Biltmore area.The thing that annoyed us the most were the 2 pompous couple's we sat between.  They constantly complained about something.  Mostly their refills.  The waitress explains to you, should you need something, PUSH the call button.  They never did.  They expected someone to come by.  The point of the call button is to minimize the wait staff running around disturbing patrons who are watching the movie.  This is the main reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5. They were really annoying. It's like this.......You are at a THEATER that serves food and drinks.  Not at a Fancy restaurant that shows a movie.  You're paying for the comfort and experience of being able to relax, enjoy a drink or dinner, all while watching a movie.Bottom line, Food was ok, a little over priced, so watch what or how much, you order.  If you like to drink, have a beer, wine, or straight drink, if you are so worried of getting it watered down.  The employees from beginning to end were excellent.  And the over all experience was very enjoyable and fun.  We would definitely do it again real soon. 4
One day, my husband got stranded because our jeep stalled after putting gas in near a QT. he called me and I called several different towing services and found this one. Their towing cost was the lowest I found and not too far from where my husband was. It was a hot day. Thank you 4
Nothing special.  That's about it.  I had a craving for some nachos - average.  My husband had the enchladas - again, average.  I tried a pina colada - super average.  The service - not so great.  We went for lunch.  It wasn't crowded.  In fact, I didn't see many people.  And yet it was hard to get the waitress to the table. 3
We live across the street from Mabel's and are frequent shoppers there. It is a fantastic neighborhood spot and a great place to drop in on a Saturday or Sunday morning when you're walking the dog.Our favourites include: croissants, almond croissants, sourdough bread, any of the cookies, the carrot cake, the empanadas (Veg or Meat), and the roast beef arugala & horseradish sandwich on a pretzel bun. Every item is made with care and the best ingredients. Also they brew a mean cup of coffee.They are not getting 5/5 stars from me because the prices are a touch high (although I respect the business and the quality of ingredients they are paying for), and MOSTly because my husband adores the almond croissants - The Grid (RIP) even did a write up on them - and they never have them anymore. Inventory management issue I suppose.Anyways if you haven't been, GO. Awesome spot to grab a dessert if you're having a dinner party too - pies, cakes, squares etc. are perfection. 4
I have rarely given a bad review like this. I didn't have any food so I can't rate on that. This is 100% a service and friendliness review. Came in on a random week night , in town for a work conference... sat at the bar. 2 other people walked out and one other person commented to me about bad service. Pretty bartenders but seem to good to be friendly to patrons.  Also, and this seems to be a major issue for a few people here, a guy in a suit outside the Mirage is handing out 2 for 1 fork know coupons for this place. Turns out that is "only for 2 types of beer and "well" means "well vodka soda" only. That's it. And they don't seem to understand why that is not cool with a lot of people. Update: my 1 well vodka and soda (because that was the only "well" option apparently, was $17. 1
The food is great, but if you have any kind of allergies please do your research. I took my girlfriend there and made them aware of her allergies. The waitress reassured us that is was okay to eat. 5 mins later she had an allergic reaction to her meal. They need better training. 2
The best samosas I've had in my life! Try the beef kofta as well very good with the Somalian rice. 3
I used to take my kids here because it was clean.The guy who was working in kitchen left the kitchen wearing gloves then stood by the register flirting with two girls in loud voice. Touched the register ... sti?l wearing  gloves . Then he went back to kitchen to work wearing same gloves. Which nade me never want to go back there again. 1
We have been making our rounds for pizza, and have had some real wins....this however was not one of them.  We went for dinner, and although the reviews were mixed, - we decided to try it.  I think like the majority of the reviews, we should of went for $1 slices.  After eating - I wish I had only paid $1 a slice instead of the amount we did for the Large pizza we had. We ordered the Carmines special on 1/2 and on the other half the meat lovers (not on the menu but advised from a Yelper)  The Meat lovers side was better.  Still lacking the flavor and what the other guys have.  OK Ill say it.....I wish we had just grabbed a Costco Pizza - it would of satisfied me more than this.Staff was friendly - although....when you see a $7.50 (YES 7.50!!!) Glass of wine with a sip out of it and still on the table, full at dinners end, ask if everything was ok with the wine.  Ordered a Cabernet, did not realize it was $7.50 until the check and could not drink it.  It was pretty bad...and not worth the price. Overall - I would of rated this place probably higher had I had $1 slices...the expectation would of exceeded the value.  I feel guilty and upset we spent what we did for 2 glasses of horrible wine and a large pizza......not worth it and frustrating. 2
Rolled tacos = divine experience. So much bang for the buck too. Ashamed to be completely stuffed for $5 and their salsa is excellent. 5
HOLY SH*T, OMG!!!  AMAZING!  Super Awesome!  Can't stop thinking about it!  Such an EPIC, crazy, fun show!  A must see!  The crew are just super nice, the service outstanding and the show (s) are Extraordinary!  I was at work today, in an executive meeting, all I can think of was how amazing this place is.  Love it, a must see and really, I'm not over exaggerating. 5
We are servers as well. We had our work shirts on for the establishment we worked for. The second we walked in the server on the bar side rolled her eye just because she was getting sat. Mind you this was 11:15 and they close at 2. She came up to us. We ordered beers. I had my passport but she denied me and involved her manager to kick us out. She judged us right when we walked into the door. We always tip over 25%. She was really rude and snotty... She didn't even say her name. First thing she said was, drinks? She's probably jumping up and down that she doesn't have another table right now. We understand. We're in th same industry, but if you're that unhappy.. Change it. Please. 1
Overall, I had a good experience. Make an appointment, because they get busy.. very quickly. Remember that the students are still in training, so yes, your appointment will take longer. When you go in for your services, more so for a haircut, be specific with what you want. Work with the stylist to inform them what you want your hair to look like. Help them. If you know that your hair behaves a certain way (e.g., your curly hair gets much shorter when length is taken off, you have an odd colic etc). The more information you provide, the better service you will receive.... and you are helping them in their training! Also, it may be helpful to bring a picture of what you are looking for. The stylists have look-books that are used with their instructors. Having your own picture I'm sure will be immensely helpful. For $15, you get a shampoo/condition, hand/arm massage, mini (very mini) facial, cut and style. Can't beat it! Students appeared to be attentive to the clients. Yes, on occasion, you will overhear them chatting with each other and showing each other things. This happens in any work place, not just because it is a school or they are budding professionals. 4
This is my local P.P. It's big,clean and the staff do a good job of cleaning the washrooms. I rarely have anything negative to say about the staff or the cleanliness of P.P. but the food has gotten worse over the years.Why does the sauce taste so sweet?Why does it taste like crappy no name ketchup the next day?What the heck is the ground beef made from because it sure doesn't taste like beef?Why are my pizzas always burnt on the bottom?Why are the pizza slices so stale?Why do the wings have so much fat?What's wrong with the dough, it's too damn chewy?I can keep going but if you've eaten there you would have experienced a few of the above by now. P.P. needs to get back to basics and address complaints by their customers. 2
I have gotten my vechicles serviced here on many ocassions.  Excellent staff and great service!!! 5
I can't put negative stars? I should be able to. What an effing joke. Why is this place open? Went here with my wife. I have bronchitis and my wife is showing symptoms of it. She went in and was treated like dirt. No one was in there and after she was sent into a room, the nurses sat around and gossiped outside her door for 20 minutes. My wife got up to leave when they decided to stop her and then lied to my wife about being busy when even the receptionist admitted they were extremely slow. Then refused to give her meds and treat her after the argument with the nurses. I will refuse the payment with insurance when the bill comes and hope this place shuts its doors. I warn every one when I say "stay away from this Mickey Mouse operation before something bad happens to someone like malpractice". You guys are unprofessional and should be ashamed. After all my reviews on yelp, this is my first one, congrats assholes! I'll bring back her records from a real dr office to show you what morons work here. People, trust yelp reviews and move on to a different urgent care. There is a reason this office has bad reviews 1
The reason I'm giving Charleston's 3 stars is because it's so damn expensive. I do feel like there should be a sign at the door that says "THIS PLACE IS UBER-CLASSY, DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE PETSMART NEXT DOOR." We brought our two young kids, which immediately felt inappropriate because the place has a very dim, romantic vibe. The food was very good, above-average fare. They DID have kids menues (despite the fact that it didn't feel family-friendly) but they were the MOST expensive kids meals I have ever seen. If we were on a tight budget, I think we would have walked out as soon as we looked at the prices, like $15+ for the average entree. Again, the food WAS very tasty, but I would recommend this place for a first date or a special occasion because of the ambiance, atmosphere, and cost. 3
This is without a doubt the most incompetent, slow, and disengaged pharmacy I've ever dealt with. Go anywhere else but here to avoid hours of delay and immeasurable frustration. 1
Nope. nope. nope. Ok, let's be real, a lot of the properties in Oakland and Squirell Hill are POOP! I moved to this apt because I was coming from NYC so I didn't drive, it was convenient to work and not lying I was seduced by the space. A dining room and a living room? Whaat?! Yeah, that's where the greats end.    First off: general prop manager was hostile in the beginning, really if I wasn't desperate I wouldn't have bothered.    Living in this place was like living the plagues: -first there were mice, then there was a bat who came in through the hole for the cable when I was away on vacation, the plentiful and fast moving centipedes, the neighbour who sounds like a wild turkey and her hyper kids who wake up at the a$$ crack of dawn on the weekends, the ants when the garbage doesn't get picked up, fruit flies that appear in Summer, even if you have NO FRUIT in your house, a toilet that regularly backs up and makes weird noises at night. They do respond to service requests but nothing's ever fixed. I looked like an Eskimo in Winter and was never warm. The 2 winters I was in Pgh, I ended up in the ER for respiratory distress.        Now, after moving out and leaving the apt SPOTLESS, trust me, I was the best thing to happen to this place; they stilll didn't refund my full deposit. I had no other beef with this company, I paid my rent and they didn't bother me. 2
Just went to this buffet and I tagged on the 'all you can drink mimosa for $8'.  Our server was really good and kept me topped up with drinks all morning - I was never without a mimosa!  Now onto the food bit - I would have given it a 2.5 but my husband felt it should be higher, so we settled on 3 - this does not include service.Food in my opinion was ok but the majority of it looked dried and withered, as if it had been out for hours.  However, my husband said the cooked to order section ie: eggs/omelet was really good.The oriental/asian/sushi section looked like it should have a health warning attached to it - it looked like it was left overs from the day before.Pizza section ditto.  Most of the food was luke warm.Now to the recommendations:  pumpkin ravioli, salad bar, some of the meat/carvery section and the dessert section - in particular the PB and jelly ice cream.  Huge strawberries dipped in choc looked nice.Was quite disappointed on the whole.The decor/music/ambiance was lovely in comparison to some other buffets in Vegas. 3
Met a friend for breakfast here. Service was good. It is an Eat n Park / Denny's type of place so if you enjoy those kinds of places you will love Drew's.. I ordered the farmers omelette and my friend had the Corned Beef Hash and eggs. The big plate full of CBH was made from scratch and not canned. Delicious per my friend. My omelette was ok... Because it was the farmers and had some potatoes in it I did not receive any hash browns just a couple of slices of small toast. A great place would have included some fresh fruit to fill the platter but not Drew's just a small burrito sized omelette in the middle of a big platter.. 3
Owner was so disrespectful, unprofessional and rude. She made me feel unwelcome and didn't care for my satisfaction. It all started by giving me the wrong order and not making the tacos to my satisfaction. Instead of making things right she gave me attitude and made ugly faces. On top of all that I waiting for a whole hour for food. I do not recommend this place!!!!!!! 1
The dentist here is very rude.  He talks down to you when you ask questions and makes you feel like you should already know the answers.  I'm not the dentist, he is!     Also, I had a small cavity filled and was still having severe pain a week later.  I went back in to have him look at it.  He told me to come back in two weeks if it still hurt.  When I asked him if I should take tylenol or advil or something to relieve the pain his response was "I'm not going to tell you to pop pills!"  Ok, but you are the cause of this throbbing pain and you have no suggestions for relief??  I really think he hit a nerve and didn't want to admit it because it's now two weeks later and the pain is getting worse.  I would NEVER go back here.  Not only is the dentist rude but the dental hygienists aren't all that friendly either - probably because they have to put up with him all day.UPDATE:  Went and got a second opinion on the cavity he filled.  He did hit a nerve pocket.  I went back to Rosewater to tell him.  He then tries to cover up and say that he told me that he initially told me it was a deep cavity (LIE - he told me it was a small cavity) and that I might have to have a root canal (LIE #2 - he never mentioned anything about a root canal, someone would remember those words)!  Also he told me that he told me an over the counter medicine to take for the pain (LIE #3). 1
As another review said, this place really deserves more of a 3.5 than a 3, but that's the only option. On a late night, I decided to take the deal on the ad: 10.99 for 1 large 1 topping pizza and 1 small deep dish pizza for free. I went with pepperoniIt was a fantastic deal really. In 20 minutes, I went out to pick up the pizza and brought it home to try for the first time. The pizza actually tastes pretty fine, but my one gripe is how greasy it is. I guess that's how they achieve the crunchy crust and it does have great texture, but the greasiness can get overwhelming after a few bites. Actually, the oil is itself a flavor of the pizza it seems. The way I figured around it was to put a piece of paper towel on the bottom and let the paper towel soak it up. You have an opportunity to be friendly to the environment by reusing by squeezing out  said oil from the paper towels and pan frying other items in your refrigerator. I suggest eggs. For my small pizza, I got anchovies on them. Now I've never tried that before, so here's where I don't know whether it's a matter of custom or Jet's, but I got about one anchovy each slice. I don't know if that's how it's suppose to be, or Jet's might have been a little skimpy on it. All I can say is that I felt like I was just eating cheese pizza and at one point, it turns into an anchovy pizza and vanishes soon after. Despite these things, finished the entire pizza over the course of a few days. Would I go back? I suppose if I have that particular craving for the crust. This is definitely not a place to avoid. It's worth a try. :) 3
Saw this place on the Food Network. It is just off central in Phoenix, it is a small quaint  old facility that has a charm of its own. We had the waffle and chicken, service was fast as was the delivery of the food. We were pleasantly surprised at how good  the chicken isThey have no parking lot or waiting room, you wait outside for a place to sit. For us it was just a few minutes. We enjoyed the experience, for us this it is what  casual dining was like before the arrival of the Chains.Good experience 4
really good food. my favorite is the lamb curry.  Perfect and tender, with a wonderful sauce.  I also really like the pad thai here.  I have come here with my family many times and they all love it!! 4
Emergency air had a special of $29.95 to check out the A/C.  I will say the guy was prompt, professional, and friendly. That is where the compliments end. After the inspection, it was determined that that the Evaporator Coil and Condenser Coil both needed cleaning (acid wash).The estimate -$254...not for both, but each! You would think for over $500, it would include labor. Right? Nope, that's another $110 (1 hour).  So to clean both coils on one unit, it's $618!! Then he pushed the yearly maintenance agreement for 5 years, for $1000. $618 to clean a unit is an absolute fleecing. I don't like their pricing practices and for that reason will never consider them doing any work. It's very clear to me what they are trying to do and I think it's  morally wrong. Take a look at Gregg B's comment on Benjamin's post about the reason they are "expensive". It's because they are" big" with "large overhead". Ha, Ha, really? That's the explanation?  The mom and pop shops vehicle purchase price must cost less because they can only buy one or two at a time. Their parts (coils, thermostats, etc) must cost less because they can order them in smaller quantities.  Let's talk about overhead. Each tech has a certain overhead and revenue potential. Add more techs, yes the overhead rises, but so does the revenue!!!! So, if that ratio is out of whack then something else is wrong. There's many advantages to being large.  Saying that's it's acceptable to charge much much more it appears, for the same parts and etc. because you're a large company makes no sense. Whew, thanks for that insight. Mom and Pop shops with much lower purchase power from now on!! 1
I have been to places all around the world and i will have to say that my expectations are very high.  I decided to go to the Palms and stay and all i got to say is i will never go back the resort was beautiful but the kitchen needs to reconsider finding help or something?  It was ridiculous and i am not going to waste my time talking about it.  Is there a chef there? 1
Food was okay. I had the branzino, two small fillets, I mean super thin and small for 30 bucks. Ridiculous for this price, and it was under seasoned. Caprese salad was 14 bucks and the buffalo mozzarella tasted like cheap mozzarella balls. The good stuff is way tastier! Didnt offer sangria year round which makes me angry... dessert was amazing. Crossaint stuffed with noiciolla gelato, nutella and whip. Over priced for ok food. 3
Went for all you can eat Prime Rib on Monday nights. Should have read the reviews online first. The Prime Rib was mediocre at best and the six green beans that came with it were cold and undercooked. We sat at the bar and our service was good, but the food was far less than desirable. I would have gladly paid $15 less for a burger and fries someplace else. 2
I love this place, great service and amazingly delicious Chinese food. The sweet n sour chicken is my favorite. I've never had it better and I've eaten at a lot of Chinese restaurants. I also love the vegetable fried rice, lemon chicken, and wonton soup. I've seen reviews that are unfavorable and to each his own but, really? I don't know what the hell they're talking about. This place rocks and does so consistently. 5
Sadly this 2 star review is in comparison to Texas de brazil. The atmosphere is quite empty and bland. Their meats are dry and unseasoned. Their salad bar is mediocre. The service is really nothing to speak of. For the same price, you can experience the ridizio in a better atmosphere, with better food and service at Texas de Brazil. 2
BUYER BEWARE yes all of the bad you hear about car dealerships runs rampant in this place Peoria Kia... First I signed a deal on a 2012 optima, trading in a 2011  they told me not to make the payment. Then they call me back a month later saying I have to make my old loan current in order to have the funding go through... So 2 payments later in the same week I get a call June 1 stating I must come down and resign the deal all the while reassuring me that the new deal would be 45 days out well guess what , and I know u will be shocked. I get a statement payment due June 16. I call the DS and am told a typographical error is the cause and regretfully there is nothing that can be done. And so now I'm on the hook for the payment 15 not 45 days after signing........... Love the car but this seems to me to be criminal...... DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY HERE THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT ANYTHING BUT THEIR OWN POCKETS. IF I LIED LIKE THIS I'M SURE SOME TYPE OF CHARGES COULD BE FILED 1
The food was very good and everything was done just as requested.My issue with the experience was when the waiter's attendant asked if he could clear our plates and we asked for a box. He openly mocked us for wanting to take the remainder of our meal home. Even if there are only a couple or so bites left on each of our plates, when you are spending $300 on a meal asking for a box shouldn't be accompanied by mockery from the wait staff. In addition, we hardly touched our sides because we filled up on the other great courses. We also had the sides boxed for us which included the lobster mac and cheese. When we got home we saw our two sides had been combined together into one small carry out box and food was definitely missing from our sides! We hadn't touched half of the lobster mac and cheese side dish but somehow only came home with a spoonful in our box and not a single piece of the lobster made it home! We would not go back based on this experience. I expect much more from a fine dining restaurant. 2
I've been to this pub mostly for beer and had a burger or two as well.Have not tried their wings yet, however the amount of grammatical mistakes and ambiguous sentence fragments littering the place stupefied me and made me unable to explore this place better.What the hell is "flavor"? That's not a comprehensible word to me who speaks Canadian English and John A Macdonald would have boycotted this bar because of it.Another example: are the wings half-a-dollar on Wings night or are they just half-priced? The signage said 1/2-$ and me and my friends argued about the differing meaning of this ambiguous phrasing.I might go again, but am much likelier to do so if they clean up the grammatical and ambiguous statements in their signage. 2
First time I visited, my friend and I had a wonderful experience; drinks were great, food was warm and service was good.However, when I decided to bring my boyfriend, it went sour. We didn't have a server, employees kept using the phrase: "oh, no one has seen you yet". It was busy, so that was understandable. Nevertheless we werent served water and the pitcher of sangria was a mixture of wine, orange juice, and simple syrup. Not sure where the Cointreau, Bacardi or whatever alcohols they used were, but it was flat out gross. More than half of the menu was unavailable, so we settled. Yet, it took about 45 minutes for the cheese platter. This arrived with our meal despite asking for it as an entree. The overall experience sucked despite the dope view. 2
Had 2 fillings a couple days ago. From walking in the door, on Saturday morning, I was out in 45 minutes. The whole staff is super friendly and helpful. I've been going here for around 2 years now. My portion of the timings was $120, insurance covered the rest. Dr Resnick is super helpful and knowledgeable. He takes his time to make sure everything is right for you. If you have any problems you can call him directly afterwards and he will take care of it. Really nice guy. 5
I decided to give Paradise Carpet Cleaning (i.e., George) a call after reading all the excellent Yelp reviews, and I must concur: George is great. He returned my call within a couple of hours, showed up right on time, and did a great job on the carpets. It wasn't the easiest job because I live in a fourth-floor unit, but he figured out a way to get the hoses and whatnot all the way up here. The cost was quite reasonable, and he was very nice. 5
Reminded me of a typical denny's type diner nothing special. Left there wishing we didnt waste our money on low quality food. Staff was friendly, but the food is so bad it only deserves 1 star. Can't comprehend how it has 4 stars to begin with. 1
This company is horrible. I ordered some plastic business cards and it took them almost 2 weeks to even put them into production. Then when I finally received the order the colors on the card were so much darker than the actually proof they sent me to approve. Is this company is very cheap in price and very, very cheap in quality. There customer service is on the bottom of the barrel. They did not try at all to rectify the problem. They wanted more money to fix the problem that exist with there poor quality printing. PLEASE BE AWARE STAY AWAY ITS NOT WORTH IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 1
Unfortunately after the company installed my system and had guaranteed one year follow up for any repairs needed, when I needed them for a repair they did not come as promised, and did not return any calls, texts, or emails for explanation or service.  I cannot recommend this company for that reason. 1
Please do not live here!My experience has been terrible. 1) MOVE IN: my move in was postponed 7 HOURS without notice. I showed up at the scheduled time with all of my furniture ready to go and was told that my carpets had not been cleaned yet despite the fact that the apartment had been vacant for over a week. I went back to my parents' house (20 miles away), waited the 7 hours, and then returned. The carpet was STILL not dry/done. I told them to just let me move in because I wasn't going to drive back and forth again. In addition to the carpet being wet, the front window was cracked and the dishwasher had standing water in it - all on move in day. The apartment was not at all move in ready. 2) SERVICE REQUESTS: are not handled with urgency. My refrigerator was broken for 5 days before it was fixed. Needless to say, all of my food had to be thrown out, and the office staff took zero responsibility for the issue and on top of it were rude to me about it getting fixed. Apparently it is annoying to them to have someone calling them every day because their refrigerator hasn't been repaired. 3) This is one of the only apartment complexes I have ever heard of that DOES NOT PROVIDE A COVERED PARKING spot for each of it's apartments. All covered parking must be paid for. If you don't want to pay for covered parking, then your option is to pray that you can find uncovered parking close to the apartments. If not, you are forced to walk a long distance through a parking lot that is mostly un-lit. As a woman, this is very unsettling because I don't get off of work until late at night and almost always have to walk through the dark parking lot alone to get to my aprtment. On most occastions, this means having cat calls shouted at me from men lurking in dark corners and from their balconies. 4) DRUG PARAPHERNALIA is littered everywhere in the common areas of the complex. Do not ever expect to walk down the stairs without finding a used needle or partially smoked joint laying on the ground. The walk ways reek of Mary-Jane seeping from cracked apartment windown during all hours of the day. 5)There are constantly cop cars/ambulances/paramedics visiting this location in the night time. I'm guessing that most of the time this is due to domestic violence because couples will fight and throw each other around audibly for about an hour, and then that will be followed by sirens and police. This is just my guess though. I haven't personally seen any police reports. 6) Though changes are being made by the new management to improve the quality of the apartment complex and of the units, I think that the bright orange and blue combination of colors that the exterior has been painted looks tacky. The change in name from Lakefront at West Bay to The Ninez/Nines was probably intended to make the place seem more modern or hip, but I think it just sounds ghetto. I have been able to catch glimpses of the newly renovated units when I walk by them, and they look much nicer than my unit looks on the inside. This would be a plus to anyone that is going to be a new renter at this complex, however, I can only speak to my own personal experience - which has been sub-par to say the least. 1
I really wish it was better.  We had the greasiest BBQ we've ever eaten, especially the brisket, which was in an inch of grease.  The sausage was better.  The ribs have some potential but were badly overcooked.  Even the loaded potato with brisket was swimming in grease.  The service was very friendly--I do hope the food can get better. 2
$6 for edamame...you know the stuff that a Sushi place  serves up for free while you wait. For the quality (or lack of) that you get here the prices are definitely out of whack. Plenty of T.Vs, even in the bathroom, makes it a good place to watch the game! The big miss here though was the service,  Literally like 20 minutes before anyone came, and when she finally did, acted kind of surly (I think she was trying to be witty, but just came off rude) Staff was all kinds of chummy around the bar, which is nice...but not if I'm still waiting for my beer. Beer list is solid and extensive to be fair...but definitely not what I'd call imaginative. Flanny's in Tempe?...now THATS a place for beer lovers! 2
This place looks wonderful.  The staff were great but the hotel is not focused on sleeping.   They seem to focus their effort around film crews and the after hours party.   The sound of the road could not be silenced by white noise from my iPhone even at the loudest.   And from the fifth floor we could hear and feel the music until 7am. 1
This is my second year going to West Valley Vision, and I've been very happy with the level of service and professionalism I've received. I love the machine they use in place of dilating your eyes -- not just because it's easy at the time, but the doctor pulled up my scans from last year to show me a side-by-side comparison. Really great! I'm still getting used to wearing contacts and Dr. Martin has been so helpful in offering different options. The only small downside is price, but I think you get what you pay for, which I why I'll continue to go here. 4
I've been here a few times and I just don't like it which is fine, everyone has different taste buds. But I do have to say each time I've been in I've had so much gristle in my taco or burrito (yuck) and the tables were disgusting and needed to be wiped down and there was trash everywhere.   5 tables open but we didn't want to sit at any. Finally picked the least gross one and wiped it down ourselves and threw away the trash.   The floor had bits of food everywhere, it was just generally untidy and unwelcoming. 2
The food was generally good but there was hair in two of our dishes and some of the servers were abrupt and borderline rude. However, our server Anne was polite and quickly addressed our concerns about the hair in our food. 2
Went on a weekend morning more than a year ago. It says something that I still remember the details of my visit. They were just unorganized. Possibly overwhelmed. Lady who I think was the owner was just barking orders. Maybe we should have waited for a table outside for a more peaceful dining experience... 2
Always a good combination of food, fund and flare.  Just be sure to get there early (before 6:30 PM unless you have a reservation).  The dishes are always scrumptious, from tuna on rice, to sushi combinations to simple edamame.  And for Sake lovers, the menu is F - I - N - E.  But be prepared to shell out some dollars.So have a cocktails (or 2) before heading to this treasure trove of Asian splendor.  Order an appetizer to share (I like the edamame, tuna...well, I really haven't had anything bad), then move into something more substantial.  Consider splitting dinner or even a few appetizers.  (You're in Vegas...save your money for the tables or the streets!)  But when you finally have to eat...skip the buffet's.  I mean, let's face it, you don't know when the last kid sneezed on it, right?  Go to Tao's an experience some zen....ah'uummmmmm..... 4
I ordered the chile verde and it was fantastic.  The outdoor pond is home to ducks, Turtles and fish. I will be back. 4
Food is pretty bad. I make better tacos at home. ZERO flavor, cheap flour tortillas and standard grocery store ingredients. I tried twice to give this place a try and I just can't do it. The owner is really nice and a great sales person but I just wish he would of put the same effort of upselling his product into his food. The last time I ate there I had to throw it away, it was that disgusting. 1
If you like personal touch and friendly service then come and check this dentist out! This office will exceed your expectations! Dr Nguyen is professional, nice and the staff is so great. If you are looking for a dentist that does not make you feel like you are one of the many clients or more like a business then come here and see what I am talking about. 5
EDIT: Went back in on 10/4 and my gel manicure was chipped in a few days. It's now two weeks later and every finger is chipped and peeling and my pedicure is in pretty rough shape too. Same me, same salon, but my last mani/pedi with them lasted 3+ weeks with no chips and this one was destroyed within a week.4.5 stars and they give a 'cash discount'I love my gel manicure and spa pedicure! Lee and her daughter were very nice, Lee and I had a wonderful chat, and they were so accommodating - bringing me color options to pick from so they could start my pedicure right away. I did a color changing gel for my fingers and a dark glitter for my toes. 60 for the service, and definitely worth it. I got a punch card and will be back for certain! The only reason I took off a star had to do with cuticle removal. She was extremely diligent with it on my toes, but she did cut me 3x. It stung but the antiseptic/vasoconstrictor solution they have took care of it with no problems. It doesn't bother me so much, but felt I couldn't rightfully give a full 5 stars because I know it bothers others tremendously. 3
Went with my wife and sat at the bar with the vodkas in ice (she was intrigued). We both enjoyed the atmosphere, the servers were courteous n prompt. Food came out quickly.    I ordered the Cobb Burger and Sweet Potato Tots and a White Russian. I would agree with some other posts that there weren't a lot of "original" pre-thought out burgers to choose from, there were a lot of options to build your own, however, I prefer to taste what strange creations other people think is a great burger. That said, the Cobb was very good. Best I've ever had? No, but still worth it to me. The Sweet Tots were a strange idea to me, but incredibly good. I do wish they served some sort of aioli sauce or something with them but that's not a huge deal. The White Russian was large and very good.    Overall, it was slightly spendy but there was a LOT of food, too much, really. My wife and I could have probably split the meal n still have been satisfied. Plus, since we were so full, we had to miss out on the Cap'n Crunch Shake, n that makes me sad.    I would go back again, build my own burger with my wife and leave room for the shake. 4
The closest you'll come to actual Boston Pizza on the West Coast. I would have given it more stars however the quality is variable. Sometimes you get a perfect Pizza sometimes you get not so great pizza. 3
I'd like to take this opportunity to thanks Chelsea From The Front Desk for her being nice and helpful great job!!! But the only problem we can't request for microwave "fire hazard issue" other than that everything went well 4
HORRIBLE FOOD AND HORRIBLE SERVICE -- But hey their female employees are all walking about with body parts sticking and pushing out and thinking they are ALL that!  Will NEVER go back to this establishment ! 1
This is my favorite lunch or break spot on far west side. Very good coffee, good deli items and you can have grocery items too. Very clean and nice staff. 5
Most employees are friendly here, except for the lady who works most mornings into early afternoon.  She is very unfriendly, talks short to people and really acts like she does not like her job. I had to refer her to the supervisor because she really had a bad attitude with me when I went today and I had done nothing to provoke her. I will take my business elsewhere. WOW 2
My workplace is nearby and every time i got a chance that i can go out on my break, i dont missed a chance to check this place out. This place offers good products (vegan-vegetarian-supplements-toiletries-scented oils-pet food) on reasonable prices. The staffs have sufficient knowledge on what theyre selling to their consumers without doing the whole 9 yards of mind blowing terminologies. It helped me to "stay healthy" throughout this years, and im not planning to stop anytime soon!:) 4
Beware!  My son just came from this dentist office with an appointment for full mouth xrays, a dental exam, and a cleaning, all covered by insurance.  After all the xrays and exam and one hour later, he was told he needed a deep scale cleaning for an extra $171!!!!  He has never missed a 6mos. cleaning in his life and when he declined the extra deep cleaning, they refused to give him a regular teeth cleaning!!!!!  They sent him away!!!!  Is it not a patients choice whether they would like to spend more money on their teeth?  What the heck is going on here????? I think this practice is trying to line their pockets with cash.  They were plain mad that their scheming did not work!  Please go elsewhere! 1
The overall experience was disappointing. The ambiance is very nice and the service was at par. We ordered the butter chicken and tandoori chicken. The butter chicken was acceptable but the tandoori chicken was terrible. It was evident that the chicken was not cooked after we placed the ordered and was very stale. We complained to the server. We chose the restaurant based on the reviews and the experience didn't live up the overall 4.5 stars the restaurant is rated. 2
What else can I say about Mountain Park Chiro except for "PHENOMENAL".  From day 1 service has been exceptional. I feel cared for and cared about. Great Customer Service.  Keep up the good work. 5
Just another poorly run Chandler restaurant.  How come service is not important here?  Can't tell who your waitress is, manager walks around but doesn't accomplish anything.  Have to fight for a seat, even though your name is on a list, they let people walk in a just grab a seat from under you while waiting. 2
I came here for the first time hoping to pick up a few pieces of cake for a birthday. As I was afraid they'd run out of pastries, I stopped by around 2pm. A woman working at the drinks counter looked at me as I entered but didn't bother greeting me before returning to her work. I went up the flight of stairs to their pastries section and was quite disappointed at the nearly empty display cases. The woman working back here came out to help me and when I asked about the possibility of more selections coming out that day, she told me to come back after 5pm. After running a few errands, I returned to find two flavours of tarts, an eclair, and two different chocolate cakes available. I decided to grab a couple of tarts and a chocolate cake. I didn't get a chance to try the fruit tart but the lemon meringue tart, which I liked, was tangy with the right amount of sweetness to balance it out. The chocolate mousse cake was not quite what I was expecting though. It was super dense and rich so after having about 1/3 of the piece, I had to put it back in the fridge for later.I would like to come back again to try more cakes but seeing how they seem to have trouble keeping their desserts in stock, I might end up having to look elsewhere for treats. 3
Great place to sit down and have a good cup of coffee. Came here on a Friday evening for coffee and dessert and I was very impressed! Leina ordered the lemon bar and I had the strawberry cream cheese croissant. Both desserts were excellent! We also shared a latte, which was pretty darn good as well.I am looking forward to my next visit to Stone Oven! 4
Nothing outstanding here. Portions are a good size. Lots of variety to choice from. Staff doesn't seem to leave behind the counter. There's a small salsa bar but nothing to fuss about. I've had the fish tacos which were a little bland. Same for the chicken burritos, not much flavor. Not sure why I expected this place to be good, bigger menu than del taco but not much on taste. If you're hungry and need a quick bite I guess it'll do. 2
I come to this library so often for school. It is such a patron friendly place to go, its so clean and it has free wi-fi. The children's section of their library has a little play area for those parents with younger kids and the staff is so insanely helpful when you need to find a book in a hurry. 5
I highly recommend Bike Authority.I ride a Trek 7500 hybrid on the Bike&Hike and the Towpath.   I ride some 1500 miles/year.  SInce Brecksville Velosport closed a year or so ago, I take it to  Bike Authority for service.    I had them perform their $60 tuneup package.   I was pleased with their attention to detail and their quick turnaround.   I took the bike in early on a Saturday and it was ready in a few hours.Today I took in my bulging tire for service.  The shop was fairly busy but they took care of me right away.   The tech explained the tire needed to be replaced and gave me a couple tire choices - he had the tire replaced and I was on my way in 15 minutes tops.    There was no labor charge. 5
So I was so excited to come in with my wedding party. She was unresponsive and didn't seem to even want the business. She doesn't do mobile, which is a little odd considering she stood to make hundreds of dollars. Luckily I found someone else who was a lot nicer, more professional and also did a good job. 2
Wonderful service in both English and French and a very long list of options. Got a Californian inspired egg omelette with salsa, sour cream, sliced avacado, peppers and onions with a side of sliced and spiced potatoes and some fruit wedges. As a drink I got a banana chocolate expresso yogurt drink that woke me up good. All together about 21$ before tip. 5
I'm a fan of this place. It's cheap and a good place to go to when you have a late night hankering since it's open 24 hours. I like the California burrito and their chicken tacos; they're not as greasy as some of the other places I've tried. Their cheap beef tacos aren't bad and I do like their french fries. It's good a good place with good food and I come back here whenever the mood strikes. 3
I've been to Passione about 3 or 4 times.  The first time we were here I had the fettuccine alfredo and it was amazing.  We went back a few months later and it was really bland.  The last time we went was because we had a coupon from Groupon (or one of those group buying sites) and decided to give it one more chance even though we said we wouldn't go back.  I had the pizza and my girlfriend has something with shrimp in it.  We were both disappointed again and probably won't be going back.  The staff are excellent and the decor is really nice it's just that the food is kinda bland and with so many italian options in this area i think i'll spend my money elsewhere. 3
Love!! Great ambiance, and such fun options. I had a three ounce duck confit burger. Super respect a restaurant that serves a normal portion as opposed to these massive portions that feed the obesity epidemic. Perfect portion for dinner and super delicious! Husband had the wagyu kobe beef burger that was also amazing. Sweet potato fries were perfect and came with three yummy dipping sauces! I had the white sangria, which was really refreshing. Pet friendly patio too, which is always a plus. In short, would highly recommend for lunch or a casual dinner! 5
The service was fast AND awesome. The gentleman who replaced the battery helped me understand and learn how to better care for my battery. I couldn't ask for anything more! I'm very pleased - I'd recommend them highly!   Thank you!! 5
Went to cash a Wells Fargo check yesterday, The teller called to verify check and spoke with the person that signed the check, then wanted to check other things in his system, after 20 min. Of waiting at window he told he that could not cash the check. I forgot forgot his name, Latino dude black suit working In The middle. His boss even said it was ok. Sad thing about it is that I went to my bank BANK OF AMERICA and they cashed the Wells Fargo check in less than a minute! Stay away from this fraudulent place! Probably too busy opening fake accounts! 1
Being used to having great pho both homemade and in cities like San Diego, and OC I have high expectations when I visit pho restaurants. Jenni Pho was Okay. Good service, interesting biography type thing about Jenni perfecting her pho broth for 20years or so on the menu. The pho was not bad, it was not the best I've had but I can say I have had worse especially down the street at that other place...If you are in the Las Vegas area but not near spring mt. I would suggest Jenni Pho its not the best but it is good enough for the convenience. 3
Has always been my favorite place to go every time we go to vegas.  The green bean dish, jumbo garlic prawns, and especially the roast duck is my biggest favorite.  The roast duck was always moist and glazing.  However, this trip, it was a disappointment, roast duck was dry and super salty and the green beans too chewy - hence the 3 stars. However, I will still come back to this place when I visit again. 3
I don't like giving poor reviews, but the quality of food for what they charge just isn't worth it.  I understand it's Vegas, but......We were looking for a late breakfast/early lunch on a Saturday before catching our flight home.  Our normal spot, Hash House A Go Go, was absolutely packed and we didn't want to wait so we figure we'd try Chayo.  The ambience was nice and host staff friendly.  We were seated and ordered drinks.  I ordered a margarita, friend ordered a mojito.  My margarita was good, but her mojito was...well....yellow.  I've never seen a yellow mojito before.  She sent it back and when they brought her another one it looked (and tasted) like an actual mojito! I don't know what that first one was.  That was about the only positive part - decent (although expensive) drinks.  The food was less than mediocre.  My friend ordered a simple caesar salad with dressing on the side.  They brought her mayonaise.  Yes, mayonaise.  She asked for oil and vinegar instead, she was told they don't have oil and vinegar and brought her some citrus type stuff that again, was pretty much just mayo with lemon juice squeezed into it.  I've worked in enough kitchens and made enough dressings from scratch to know that most of the creamy dressings are mayo based, but it's NOT ALL MAYO!!!!!  Who wants to put mayo on their salads?  The salad itself - ugh.  The greens were very limp, not crisp.  Chicken was dry.  I ordered the tacos.  Very underwhelming.  They lacked flavor.  Sorry, not a fan. 2
I'm finding all kinds of iconic burger places to review on yelp. This is an iconic burger dive that brings back fond memories from my youth. The burgers used to be good and homemade. Fresh cut fries and freshly made onion rings, just killer. They've changed a lot since then, frozen patties and frozen fries/rings don't taste as good. Buns fall apart to easily. The burgers are still massive and the portions are fairly decent, better than paying $9.00 at mCdonalds for their crappy premium burgers. Fun decor, staff are fine. Solid 3 stars but if they would have kept the original recipes an easy 5 stars. 3
Terrific experience!  I called IIya for a repair on my dryer.  First thing he said when I opened the door was "Shoes on or off?"  I was in love.  He explained in detail the problem, had the part on his truck, and fixed the issue in about 20 minutes.  Plus parts and labor guaranteed for a full year; not everyone offers that.  As a realtor and property manager, I'll be using Ilya for my appliance repair issues from now on.  Thanks, Ilya! 5
We went here on a Saturday night since it was the only Korean BBQ place within 5 miles that had less than an hour wait. The menu is large, with three pricing tiers depending on what kind of meats you would like. They also have a wide variety of items not included with the all-you-can-eat, but we were there for meat. The food's good. Our meat was fresh and flavorful (with the exception of the pork belly being a little bland), and the sides were traditional, so no complaints there. Lee's Korean BBQ only gets three stars for me because of the service. I went there on a date and was surprised to see that the server wouldn't let us cook our own meat. Instead of taking our time, talking and cooking, we had a woman leaning over us for most of the meal. Our server barely spoke to us, and didn't even give us the option of what we'd like to eat first. They don't switch out the grills here, but they do clean them. Everything seemed clean, but there was a cockroach on the bathroom sink, which always concerns me. 3
The best nail salon ever! Friendly staff always very helpful!!  You should give them a try!! 5
First time my husband and I have eaten here and service was great! Our server was very attentive and friendly and our food came out quick. It had good flavor with the meat being tender, but wasn't necessarily the best out there. Also, if you're not a fan of vinegar based sauces, that seems to be all they have. 3
I really like the Smash Burger as a whole, but this location struggled with a couple of things.Pros: The food came out quickly and it was good. This is a good location if you live in North East Gilbert.Cons: They got our order wrong (missing condiments and sides). The drink station was a mess and not stocked. The trash was overflowing even though the restaurant wss not particularly busy. They don't participate in the loyalty program that other locations do. 3
These are guys are pure charlatans! My friend David recommended that I try out Ted Wiens. What a mistake that was! They pushed a no-name brand Fuzion Touring on me, saying that they were the best new tire on the market. Aftermarket tires seemed like a bad idea but I ended up buying 4 and with installation it came to $650.00. In less than two years two tires had completely warped, shaking the vehicle profusely. Since I live in Los Angeles it took me a while to bring the tires in, yet when I rolled them in, provided my receipt, the service desk completely vacated. A manager told me flat out that they would not return the clearly defective tires. "We'd lose money if we returned every defective tire..." However, I pointed out that the manufacturer clearly states there is a five year warranty. They flat out wouldn't stand behind the products that they sell and said they would do me a favor and recycle the tires. I highly recommend you avoid these hucksters at all costs. I'm out $650 and need a new set of tires in less than two years. 1
I like that it's cheap. I like that the food names are kind of cute in a hardcore rock way. I don't generally love the food, but what do you want--it's fun, and it's cheap. A good place to meet up with people and not spend a ton on the tab. Only downside is that now the place is packed--all the time. Westside is still coming around, and right now they've pretty much cornered the market. As the area continues growing, I think the crowds will even out. 3
Worst comedy club I've ever been to and I've been to many. Horrible customer service to boot. 1
UPDATED 12/15/12The owner contacted me directly via Yelp and offered his apologies and a chance to make amends. He indicated that he's been taking the appropriate corrective action. I believe that this company is worth a look for your security needs and I would inquire with them for any future needs that I may have.ORIGINAL POST:Do not call Titan Alarm or otherwise ask them for a quote and give them your information. They will bombard you with phone spam. I've been having the same experience with them that I've found other folks have had.There is a guy named Robert from Titan Alarm. I asked for a quote online, and this guy called me for MONTHS even though I told him repeatedly I had already gone with another company. Harmless, but annoying. 3
We recently had an amazing catering experience for our 75 person party with Mykonos Grill. This was the first time we hosted such a large event and Peter clearly showed that his primary concern was the success of our party. He was extremely helpful, offering lots of tips on how to best serve and arrange the food with so many people, and never made us feel rushed anytime we stopped by or called with a question. The food was delivered on time and was a huge hit with our guests, everything was delicious! We've dined in the restaurant before as well and both the service and food were excellent. We couldn't recommend this restaurant enough. 5
Ambitious with poor execution. The menu there is limited but I didn't mind that. My hopes were that since they only did a couple of dishes, they would do them well. If only.  And maybe they could be better if they weren't using the exact same products as their parent restaurant Eat n Park.  I ordered the specialty pizza of the day (butternut squash) and was completely underwhelmed. The  dough was the same that EnP uses for their rolls, the sauce was the same that is used for EnP's spaghetti sauce and the cheese was as bland as you could get. Had there been a little bit more thought into the ingredients like higher quality cheese (feta, maybe) and sauce that didn't come from a can it could've worked.  Unfortunately, they thought they could give you great ambiance and new presentation and you wouldn't notice that you just had diner food. The most offensive part was the $10 that I paid for a pizza that was less impressive (and substantially smaller)  than a $5 take out pizza that I could've gotten around the corner. 2
Just came here with some friends and couldn't leave without writing a review. Ordered the Assorted Plate (pork skirt, pork butt, pork jowl, pork belly with and without skin) and the quality of the meat is fresh - which can explain the $59.99 price tag for the plate. The servers are very attentive even though it got a little busy. The decor is very quaint and has an elementary school theme and I'm glad we tried it out. We will definitely be coming back! 5
We had no troubles with our SUV rental with Sixt.  We were upgraded for no additional charge.  We took pictures of several scratches on the car prior to leaving the rental area.  A rep signed as a witness of the areas and off we went.  The return was seamless.  All in all a good experience, and a great rate.  We would consider Sixt the next time we rent a vehicle. 3
Dick & Arnie's is definitely 5 star. Between dad and kids I know all the staff do a really good job.The prices are competitive and the hair cuts plus care given to customers are WAY beyond what any of the chains have done for our family members.It's worth the wait if they're booked because each staff member does a good job. There's no gamble like going to the chain places. 5
If you can appreciate modern sleek art and architecture, you'll understand Crystals and the coolness of it.  I did.  Impressive use of space, texture, art, and sculptures.  Feel the ice sculptures, it's effin cool.Shops are ultra high end.  If you can't afford it, why rate it 1 star?  Did you experience the service or product?  I went to Paul Smith and the staff was fun and I got a few strip socks for 30% off.  Awesome.Tom Ford.  Ummm....how magnificent.  The staff was down to earth, lot of BS bantering and ended up with a new pair of shades to replace the Prada I sat on.  It's just another experience and even though 1/2 of the shops were not opened yet, the open airiness was cool. 4
Great place to take your second half for a date, birthday or anniversary! Good thing, you do not have to wait in line to get to the restaurant. Separate elevator takes diners to the top floor!Views are gorgeous, ambiance is quite nice! Service is ordinary! Food was alright,  slightly overpriced but we know why, we are at one the most visited places in Canada.All in all, very pleasant experience! My wife was very happy and this is a key! 4
I hired Buhler's for a local move within Calgary that included storing my belongings for a few weeks between pick-up and delivery dates. This required loading and unloading into storage as well as my initial pickup and then the final delivery. The crew was mainly the same between pickup and delivery and did a good job. They were careful to wrap my furniture and managed to negotiate a pretty cramped stairwell without incident. They were pleasant and worked hard although a few boxes clearly marked "This side up" were delivered upside-down, a few boxes weren't delivered to the rooms indicated on them, and sometimes a stack of boxes included larger, heavier ones stacked on top of smaller, lighter ones but nothing was broken when I unpacked. I loved that they brought two trucks so they could load/unload the house and the garage from the alley separately. Brilliant! It was unfortunate that they were a day late in delivering my belongings, but it all worked out okay in the end.As is common in moves where things are loaded and unloaded multiple times a couple of items were a bit worse for wear once they arrived, however what's important in mentioning that is that Buhler's made it right, and I very much appreciated that they followed through.Although I think there was some room for improvement, I found them easy to deal with, competitively priced, with good customer service. Give Ron and his team a try on your next move. 4
Kept needing to pull out my driver license; then I could not find it and customer service did not want to call the safe area to look for it.  Home Depot will not take a return without a state Id or driver license, even with a receipt.  Customer service is rude and does not care if you go to Lowe's or if they lose your business. 2
Red chilli is very good beef tacos are awsome!!! 4
Brazz was really disappointing. I was excited for the salad bar thinking it would be similar to Chima and Texas de Brazil. Instead it was worse than Ruby Tuesday. One of the dishes was a half piece of salami with a piece of cheese that looked like a Kraft single that was an inch by an inch. The service was slow and they never brought the chimichurri sauce or bread to our table. The decor is really out dated and just feels like a cheap chain restaurant. 2
The chinese lady answering the phone is rude. Even in person she is rude. My husband and I had the same experience. I had a hard time understanding her broken english and she seems annoyed by that. So i told her your english is not easy  to understand , her reply?  "i know my english sucks". (Not in a nice tone btw and went to the kitchen talking in her language) I wanted to talk to the manager but accdg to the waiter she is the manager.. Made me laugh. 2
Idk when You tell me its $45 for 5 tacos and 2 drinks you better be that good which I really didnt think so. So I would say its a no go 1
This place has some awesome food. Get some sake bombs and that makes everything taste so much better. You also can't beat the service. 5
What more could you ask for when stumbling around drunk at 2am in South Side?? Awesome gyros, awesome fries, and even more awesome home made tapioca pudding. Cash only, but they have an atm inside. 4
This is hands down my husband and my favorite place in the world.  It is the perfect place to relax with a drink listening to the phenomonal pianists (Whitney Phoenix is our absolute favorite).  As mentioned in other reviews, it is also great for people watching since it is located right in between the Bellagio lobby and casino.  The drinks are delicious- the bartenders know how to make them right and the complimentary snack tray is always great.  We always have great service here and will continue to come back again and again. 5
This is a really nice looking place,  I really enjoyed the ambiance.  It is not too loud and not too dark or bright.  There is a lot of attention to detail.So much potential; but their kitchen preparation needs an overhaul.  We had multiple things that were not good.  I found my arugula salad to be inedible because it was sopping in oil and there was no vinegar/acid to cut it.  The arancini were awful (bland fried blobs of rice/risotto without enough sauce, cheese or basil).  Entree was mediocre at best.  I hate to be so critical, but their food was not good.  I left here feeling real hungry. Might be a great place to drink, but I would absolutely skip a meal here. 2
Service was terrible. The food was mediocre quality. Maybe it's a place you just come for coffee or ice cream. Ordered a egg sandwich, egg was cooked well not over cooked but the bread was soggy. They got the order wrong too originally bring 2/3 things ordered wrong. Anyway I recommend the Starbucks across the street. 1
Simon Restaurant has a great setting overlooking the slick Palm's Place pool. I felt like I was in South Beach and forgot that we were in Las Vegas altogether. The decor also lends itself nicely to daytime dining since there are lots of windows letting in the sunlight, but it transforms into a great evening dining spot after dark. We went there for appetizers and ordered the truffle Mac & cheese, the fries, the shrimp cocktail and the tuna tartare. We all loved everything we ordered. The presentation was lovely and the service was quick and friendly. I will certainly be going back here soon to try more of the dishes on the menu. A great experience! 4
Great little place in downtown Matthews.  The selection of Belgium and domestic beer is great. A bit on the pricey side , you can get some of the same stuff  at the wine store at about 20% less. Great place to relax although if you're coming after work you may not get a place to sit due to the size of this place. 4
Usually have a great time having dinner here. Steaks were cooked wrong. Food was just not right. Used to be a go to spot for us, not anymore. 2
Awesome place!The cocktails are out of this world (not to mention an extensive list). Atmosphere is great with jazz band playing and comfy couches. The back room would be awesome for a private party. Can't wait to go back! 5
Have been here numerous times. Pretty sure this will be my last time here. Quality has gone way down. Prices have gone up. Not worth it!! 2
The manager is an unhelpful snob and to give you an idea about the cleanliness of this place, the same piece of gum was sitting in the cup holder of a treadmill for the duration of my 10 month membership. Yeah. Clearly they do not clean this place the way they ought to. The personal trainers hide equipment in closets and when you ask for what is supposed to be communal equipment (i.e. foam rollers, etc.), they throw you an attitude like you're really putting them out asking them to step away from texting at their desk to walk 12 steps and grab it for you from their closet. Parking is atrocious at Bakery Square. Super crowded, too many members, not enough equipment. The sales people are sitting there, usually in groups, staring at the very front of the gym as soon as you walk in which always made me pretty uncomfortable. The cancellation process wasn't too difficult though, so I guess I can give them some props for that. 2
The price is right however the ingredients could use a major upgrade. The Italian sausage looked horrible. They should have prosciutto or arugula to add. I don't think I will go back. 2
Pizza was pretty good once we got the right one. Price was right for the product given the tourist environment. The waitress was a hot mess.Ordered 3 beers and one coke. Got 2 beers and 1 coke. Asked about the other beer and got "yes, it's on it's way" as if the 3rd beer comes from a special place not near the other 2 beers. Ordered half pepperoni half sausage. Got half pepperoni half mushroom from a food runner. Said that was the wrong pizza. About 5 minutes later the waitress brought us the same wrong pizza. After another 20 or so minutes got the correct pizza. Never once asked if we wanted more drinks (there for over an hour), only saw the waitress to bring the pie and and check. The table behind us was ready to walk out after getting the wrong pizza 3 times, the manager came to their table and they stayed. Not sure if anything was offered to them. Manager never came to our table. I guess they are used to the wrong orders and that doesn't constitute a table visit.In general tourists locations in Vegas have crap service so this didn't surprise me. 2
They really need a zero star option.They charged me 1300 for broken parts only to find out that they were not broken. They just painted over the existing parts to make them look newer. The rust under the fresh coat of paint was a dead giveaway. They fixed my a/c only to have it go out a week later with the same problem. They also cross threaded my oil plug and that just takes a special kind of idiot to do. Nothing like a fresh oil leak after an oil change.They lie and make you think youre getting a great deal for all that is wrong. But youre just getting ripped off since its all going in their pocket in the first place. Scum of the earth. This is why mechanics get a bad rap. You stay classy not so purrfect auto.Never again. I would rather let me car break down and have to walk barefoot uphill both ways in snow to get around than to go to that place again for service. 1
Gone there twice both times no oven roasted chicken and they would rather send me to another kfc than have it on hand 2
Good food.  Freshly made in a very timely manner.  Friendly service.  What more could you ask for?  Stoughton loses many restaurants but thisOne remains strong due to good food and service. 4
I made a mental note to check Caramba's out during a visit to the Stir Fry Palace next door.  The place was packed, and I figured it must good.I took my daughter there to dine on a couple of enchilada plates.I think based on the great reviews here and the crowd that maybe my expectations were too high.  I thought the enchiladas were okay.  They weren't terrible.  They were just okay.  The beans and rice were fine.  I'll definitely give this place another try.  I believe in wisdom of the crowds, and Caramba's seems to be always crowded.  Those people must know something.  Maybe I got them on an off day, or maybe I was just off! 3
Great margaritas and the chips and salsa are really nice and hit the spot. The rest is eater beware, a lot better choices on property for casual (Fifty/Fifty) or any other Mexican place on strip or off. They have a formula and it doesn't work. Everyone loves Mexican food but this is ill-conceived and has no kick from any of the dishes. 2
Good food. Good service. Loud people. It was Sunday Night football in the bar area. The restaurant was not that busy and our waitress mostly stayed at the table next to us talking with another customer. 3
I have been seen by Dr. Behera for a few years now. I have had one successful IVF cycle and one that wasn't. I have had multiple IUIs and procedures done. I think that Dr. Behera is a very kind and personable person and extremely knowledgeable. I should also say that my second transfer, the one that was not successful, I did it traveling from out of state so it was pretty stressful. It was a difficult transfer this last time and there were a lot of little things that added up to me finally getting in touch with Dr. Behera after many tries. I was told many times during the cycle that she was too busy. I finally wrote a letter to her and she quickly responded by calling me and letting me know she would prefer to speak with me about all the issues I was having. Update: I have just recently spoke with Dr. Behera and know there was a lot of miscommunication. But be sure if you are receiving monitoring out of their clinic that you really communicate to know what is expected of you. I had no idea that I was supposed to continually call and check both clinics to make sure my results were sent and I guess I caused their staff at Bloom to "stay late hours multiple times" because I didn't do so. Which she informed me is not their job. Also, make sure that you know what you'll be paying for. If I would have known that when I talk with the doctor I get a bill, I may have chosen more carefully when I wanted to speak with her. I'm not trying to attack, just want to make sure if anyone else finds themselves in the situation I was in, you don't have the experience I had. I appreciate what their clinic did for me and I have a beautiful daughter which I'm grateful for, but out of state monitoring seems to be too difficult for both sides. 3
I'm Persian myself, Their food is always cold... and i'm sure they preheat that before giving to customer! I dont recommend this restaurant! 1
Had the "All you can eat" fish fry. Servise good, food just average. Too noisy. 3
This is one special event, it's not a hair cut so don't come here for a quick snip, it's an experience and and education.It's not cheap so don't be afraid to handsomely tip on top of a not cheap cut. 5
I'm giving three stars because I love Chick-fil-A, in general, and until the last few months, this location has been perfectly fine. However, I haven't been going to this one lately because of how bad it was the last few times I went. I got chicken nuggets that tasted horrible. How can you ruin chicken nuggets? I got a salad that was significantly smaller than usual and contained wilted lettuce. I don't even think it was the same type of lettuce usually used in that salad. Worst of all, the service wasn't good in the drive-thru, and good service is usually a cornerstone of any Chick-fil-a. The last time I went through the drive-thru was on a weekend. It appeared that only teenagers were working and there were many of them. The restaurant wasn't crowded, but it took forever to get through the drive-thru. I've seen them get two long lines of cars through in no time, but not this time. While I was waiting in the line of cars, I suddenly heard yelling. Apparently two young employees were arguing by the open door between the ordering speaker and the window. I got to listen to that go unchecked for awhile in the slow moving line. When we finally got to the window, there were probably 10 teenagers standing around chatting about their love lives and various other things, but nobody was standing at the window to take my money or give me my order. There was one young lady who was trying to get everyone to work, but she was being ignored. Finally, the one person doing any work got our order together and took my money and gave me my food. After all that, they forgot my honey mustard sauce! My suggestion would be to have a responsible adult member of management work on the weekends, because the kiddos aren't managing themselves. 3
Food/drinks: 4/5Service: 5/5Atmosphere 5/5Came as a group of 6 @7pm on the Monday of long weekend , didn't make reservations, had to wait at the bar for 15 minutes for a big table. Most of the tables there were for 2-4 people. The place wasn't too busy, maybe 75% of the tables filled. Food: 8 piece fried chicken: sounds average but each piece was huge! The drumsticks were enormous. I expected it to be a little dry, but it wasn't at all. Crispy goodness on the outside, and moist and juicy tenderness on the inside. Highly recommended!Taipei tater slaw - small appetizer, enough to share for six of us.OG bao (5-spice pork) - the bun was good, wasn't dry. The meat itself was average. Flavor wasn't too strong. Perfect balance with the bao. Next time, I'm going to try the chicken schnitzel bao (das bao).Deep fried goldmember (fried squid): cocktail sauce that came with it was good. The squid wasn't too oily and perfect. I don't like anything too battered.Kung pao cauliflower: pretty average but good. Although it was more saucy than I imagined. It said stir fry, but I feel like it was more drenched in sauce. Red rooster fried rice: loved the flavor, portion is probably good for one person if not sharing. Mo money fried rice: surprisingly good, definitely not as flavorful as the red rooster but I expected it to be bland, which it wasn't at all.Drinks: If you are going with a group of 4-6, must try the punch bowl! It's their version of sangria, served in an "authentic" Chinese pot. It's fruity, I didn't get much of an alcohol taste to it. The presentation itself is impressive and just a fun way to drink with  friends.Service:I think the owner served us the punch bowl. He was very nice and approachable. The bartender was helpful with drinks recommendation. AtmosphereDefinitely a fun casual restaurant. They have wooden stools and tables, yet sleek gray walls. Nice contrast. What was interesting to me was the signage to the washrooms are in Chinese. I didn't check out the guys washroom, but unless there's a urinal in there, I wonder how people knew which washroom to go to. I only knew because I can read Chinese. In case anyone needs to know, the girls washroom is at the end.Definitely will come back for drinks and fried chicken! 4
Offering an authentic Brazilian experience, Le Milsa is something everyone should have the privilege to enjoy. With several different types of meat (turkey wrapped with bacon, chicken, filet mignon, lamb, striploin, sausage, amongst others) brought to your table on pitch forks and sawed off for you at the table, Le Milsa is perfect for parties. For $30, it's all you can eat meat, rice, sauteed mushrooms, salad, bread and sweet potatoes. Dessert is also included. The standout for me was the turkey wrapped with bacon (anything bacon is good in my books). On the other hand, the lamb was very tough and "lamby". Make sure you refrain from going too early as you will only be served the ends of the meat, which tend to be the driest and toughest. Even if you ask for another piece, they will twist the meat and still shave off another end-piece (makes sense as a business model).The service was good but I'm not a fan of the required coat check. 3
PLEASE don't go to K2 Bistro! I've been to many AYCE sushi restaurants in Montreal, and K2 was my worst experience! Not only the food was bad, but the way I was treated by the restaurant was unethical and it is the reason why I decide to open a Yelp account and write my first review. Please continue reading my review to understand how ridiculous and unacceptable the situation was.My husband and I went to try K2 sushi for supper. We were seated at a tiny table for 2 in the corner of the restaurant. We've placed our order and when most of the food arrived, the table started to lack of space. I kindly asked the waitress if it was possible to use the table beside us that was empty so we can have more spaces. You won't believe what answer I received. The waitress told us that if I want a table for 4, I will have to pay for 3 people! ... Sorry? Did I hear wrong?! There were two 4-ppl-tables taken by two couples, and the waitress said they were paying for 3 and if we don't believe we can go ask them! My husband was going to stand up and ask the other tables, but I didn't want to make things big and ruin our date night, so I stopped him. 1) if they really charged them for 3 ppl, this restaurant is illegal. 2) if they did not charge them for 3, this restaurant is lying. No matter what, this is so wrong! I kind of regret to not let them charge us for 3 people so i can file an official complaint to the Office de la protection du consommateur! All this to say, don't go to K2 sushi because of their unethical way of doing business! If you really want sushi buffet, there are plenty of choices around that area: Sushi Crescent, Toro Sushi, Odaki, etc. Just stay away from K2! 1
Breakfast buffet is so-so. Nothing really tasty, they only have Mexican menudo for soup which was bland. I tried the pastries, they were dry. I thought they tasted old. The only things I enjoyed was the corned beef on which I poured gravy for better taste and the orange juice. Not a lot of selection. Service was good, staff was nice and friendly. Place is clean. Would not come back though. 2
-5 stars literally saw the 'chef' lick her fingers over and over again while I waited for my orange juice. Then she started setting up people's dishes .... With her bare hands...Disgusting place... Extremely unsanitary!!!! After waiting 10mins to receive my orange juice while almost puking watching the levels of sanitation plummet more and more I was then presented with half a cup of juice. When I asked to upgrade to a full cup I was then told that's the only amount I can buy? Okay guess they don't want to make money. Tip- save yourself the nausea go somewhere  else 1
We lived at Ten Wine for just about a year and it was the best experience we have ever had when renting at an apartment community. The lofts are large and have great floor plans and are completely modern which adds to their amazing location in downtown Scottsdale. The community is well maintained and offers all of the amenities that anyone could want. The best part of living there is the great team! Andrea does a great job of making sure the residences have what they need to feel at home while keeping the community well maintained and welcoming. The maintenance team is also great and respond to work orders immediately. We only moved out because we had to relocate for business, otherwise I think we would have lived there forever. It's a great place to live and definitely a community everyone should check out. 5
Yummy local diner Local and home spun Kathy the waitress was wonderful!Eggs and bacon yummy. Conversation was terrific 5
Overrated. The place is very small maybe 4-5 tables. The service was not that good, not personable. The parking is horrendous.  To top it off the food wasnt that great. The sweet home alabama was not what I expected. Not much flavor in the different pasta dishes. Sad! 2
Used handy for the first time today and am happy with our tidy home. Elizabeth was so lovely, I felt 100% comfortable having her in our house. And a bonus my dog loved her, and my roommates cat did too. We will definitely use Handy again. 4
I like it for breakfast. Servers are sometimes a little bossy. In a good way - if they don't like what you're asking for they let you know what's good. 3
Sorry but the worst place in Chinatown for Chinese buns. They are the cheapest as far as I am aware, with the second being Mashion but the quality is not there. For normal buns Hong Kong Island is by far the best, for the rice balls with filling Mashion is better quality for a little more.The "mochi" or rice balls have a pitiful amount of filling and the store overall just feels the most worn down and unkempt. 2
I can't see how anyone gives this place any stars other than for the friendly staff.  I have to say the food here was one of the worst we have eaten.  The grease was so much my stomach was sick for a couple of days.  I personally will not be eating here again. 1
A typical Applebee's.  We were seated right away and our waiter was friendly and very attentive (maybe a little too much so).  We waited a bit for our food but it was a Friday night so we didn't really think anything of it.  I had the Shrimp and Broccoli pasta and it was good but the shrimp were a bit undercooked.  Overall, it's what you would expect to get from this chain. 3
I didn't feel like this place lived up to the expectations. I was more excited to come here but was let down. It took them too long to serve us our apps and mains. Our apps took about half an hour while our mains took about an hour to come. People came in, ate and left before we even got our food. The food itself was okay. I ordered the fried chicken and waffles - the chicken was way too fatty and the waffles just tasted, odd. Let's just say I've had better southern food. 2
First of all, I am a local so we have eaten at several of the buffets. The Wynn buffet is not all that great. First of all, our group of 4, three of us got sick! The only item the three of us had that our 4th member did not have were the crab legs. This is very upsetting because the reason we went to the buffet was for the crab! Yes, the crab is broken for you, but they are SMALL and made us sick. To be honest, the best buffet we have experienced is the Rio. It's always good! They also give half off if you have a locals id!! :-) 2
We go to this pizza place almost every week for girls night out. I have tried almost everything on the menu and never been disappointed.  The Cesar Salad is delicious. The fried zucchini appetizer or the garlic knots are fantastic. The service is friendly and attentive.The manager Cameron always speaks to us and makes sure that our food came out good. Not many managers make it a habit to know their frequent customers.  On occasion he has even brought out our food to us just to say hello.If you love pizza or Italian you will not be disappointed. 5
Northerners trying to cook southern food. For the price I expected it to be more than it was. I would go again but probably try something different or maybe just cocktails. 3
I've been a patient of Dr. Wyse for several years. I have always booked my appointments first thing in the morning to avoid waiting in the 'little white room' too long. After the third time of waiting over an hour after arriving at 7:30 in the morning and nothing more than a "i'm very booked" as an apology, I've decided it's best to move on and find a new family doctor. There are some rare services or individuals that are worth the extra wait. This, unfortunately, is not one of them. I find it very arrogant when anyone feels their time is more important than yours. 1
Nice fresh veggies and tofu, curry was fair, kinda watered down. I had corn cakes as an appetizer and they were just fair. 3
The only time i visited the place was a bad experience. The exterior wash wasn't perfect but the worse part came when i went for vacuuming the interior. The blowers just didn't have enough pressure. I had to run it multiple times over the surface. When i took it up with them , they said it was "normal". Only in the end i realized that the hose they were using had a cut or two which might have been causing the low pressure hence proving their claim of "normal" invalid. 2
I thought I was going to try this place out after the hype (which I still don't get why is still happening), but a turn of events ended up in me going yesterday.I got in a relatively "shorter" line at around 3:20 pm and got our cake at 4:35 pm. When we finally got inside the store, we realized why it takes so long to get a cake. 1) The employees work at a glacial pace- and it doesn't help that they're friends so you see them talking and working at the same time, which slows everything down. I saw one of the employees placing liners into the trays at such a slow speed, it's unbelievable (but believable cause SERVICE IS SO SLOW).2) There are three ovens that can bake 12 cakes at a time, but they were only using two ovens for some ridiculous reason.3) The system and management here is horrible. If you know that there is consistently a long line up, pre-bake cakes! Pre-prep all the batter! These are things that can be done beforehand and will make your business so much more efficient. It shouldn't take this many months to realize that your way of working is bad for your business and a horrible treatment to your customers.And then we get into the hygienic issues:1) All of the employees deal with cooking materials with their hands, and thus should wash them frequently and before they begin work. I did see most of them do that, but one female employee came from outside- touched the door handles and everything- and proceeded to work without washing her hands.2) They mix the raw cake batter with their bare hands?! I find that pretty gross. I looked over to see the employee with her arm up to her elbow in the batter just mixing and mixing. At least wear gloves, PLEASE.They should really provide some sort of customer service- maybe give a snack or some water to the customers that line up for hours. I think that would be nice. I also wish they would come out every now and then to tell us when the next batches of cake are out, so we at least have an idea of how much longer we need to wait in line. In the summer or in the rain, I don't know how these lines will turn out- they should provide some sort of shade or shelter for them to stay under. Overall, the $10 6-inch cake tasted good- but nothing you can't find anywhere else. You can get the same taste at chinese bakeries. It's like you put the word Japanese in front of cheesecake, and it becomes this whole magical must-try thing. I am also disappointed that they think what they serve are "madeleines"; those are just cakes in cupcake-like wrappers.Won't be back- cake, service, and long line-up aren't worth it at all. 2
Good food and fun atmosphere.  Staff was friendly and quick.  The guacamole was made to order and the street tacos were the perfect amount.  Would have liked more beer options.  Sat in the back booth overlooking the casino, made for a great place to people watch.  I would go back again. 4
Many years ago, the owner of Haveli in Ottawa recommended I check out the Taj Mahal here in Calgary, as one of his relatives owns it. Sadly, for some reason I ignored his advice until last year, and I now regret the delay in eating this delicious East Indian fare! (Don't be fooled by the somewhat rundown exterior, which I believe was part of my mistake)I've tried both the full sit down dinner and take out a few times each, and have been very happy with all dishes. A few have been closer to average than most of their vegetarian choices are, but some have been outstanding! Last night the alloo gohbi was pretty darn near perfection: dry, not greasy, cauliflower and potato both tender but not mushy, spicy, and a different blend of spices from the other dishes we paired it with (don't you hate it when some places use the same curry mix in every item? That's not a problem at Taj Mahal). Saag paneer was SO buttery-tasting but did not appear greasy in any way; it may be my favourite version ever. Have not tried the vegetarian buffet on Wednesdays yet, but will definitely do so in the future so I can sample a wider variety of options at one sitting. Service is prompt and friendly when ordering off the menu. Unfortunately, they are not accessible - you need to use the stairs to get down to the restaurant. 4
Pros: Environment, Staff, Gelatos, Salads, Soups...Cons: Not having a location in Buffalo, NY :)Is it a good restaurant for kids? YesIs it good choice for big groups? NoIs the parking lot enough to accommodate the customers? No parking lotAfter a long drive to Toronto, ON. We saw this small place and beautiful very near of our hotel. It was around 7:10pm when we arrived and the place was empty. Maybe because it is Sunday night. But is an injustice, places like this deserves to be always crowded.The service was very friendly and nice and the salads and soups did not take so much time to arrive.  Almost all the sits you can admire the park, because the restaurant windows are very huge.  My wife asked for a lentils soup and Cesar salad, I just asked for the Cesar salad.Overall, the salad was fantastic and my wife loved the lentils soup too. After, I went for my main event of the night: the gelatos. Oh the gelatos! They are the best in North America that I had until now. The Ferrero Roche is the top one.  This is the kind of place that worth to leave a diet. Nice people and food. Congratulations to G for Gelato and Espresso Bar. You made my night happy today! 5
Place was crowded at first.  Near a high school I hear, so must get a lot of school lunch crowd.  We ordered a little after 1pm and service was fast.  Parking is very limited.  No Alcohol or restrooms.  Place was a little warm (was 107 outside). No free refills on drinks and no restrooms.  Brother ordered a "Chubby Dog" which was not that chubby, but tasted good.  Fries were good.  I ordered Italian beef.  Seemed a little overpriced at $5.50.  Was more like a $3.50 - $4.00 sandwich.  But, it did taste good.  All things considered, I rate it a little above average for your fast food places.  Menu did seem to have good burger prices, but I went there for the Italian beef so didn't try one of their burgers.  One of the customers there told me to try Portillo/s, off Shea near 90th street.  She said it was the best Chicago in the valley.  Will give it a try some time soon.Overall... If you are in the neighborhood, you might enjoy.  Just bring only cash and hit a restroom before you get here. 3
Being that I'm not a fan of tasting menus or small tiny portions, I have to admit that Sage was very good.  We were seated in the lounge area and there were ASIANS up front so there's no racial profiling going on ( duh? to the previous reviewer).  In terms of service, We were attended to by the bar attendants and a manager.  Bar server offered his services and wasn't sure why we were seated in the lounge  but told us he'll make every attempt to give us great service.  We had a blast with him!  He recommended 3 dishes to us and if we didn't like it, he'd buy them.  We didn't return anything.  The escargot appetizer was divine especially the ravioli.  4 hour soft poached egg was more of a dip than a true appetizer and for someone who doesn't like creamy egg yolks, I slurped it all up.Loved the bacon rolls.  Amuse Bus was whatever.  The Hearts of palm salad was refreshing and the roasted pork shoulder was very savory.  The pasta portion was amazing.2 of us shared everything and we left satisfied in terms of our palate.  Were we still hungry.  Yes and No.  I wasn't.  My friend was.Would we go back.  Yes.  They also asked for our comments and how our dining experience could have been better.  We told them hopefully, they'll incorporate some more "filling" dishes into the menu and get rid of putting foam on almost everything.Overall, we had a great experience! 4
First time here.  We are BIG Coke fans so we were excited.  Got the Pot Roast sandwich. Meat was cut very thick so it was tough and dry.  We ordered a side of gravy and it helped a lot.  Fries were very good and NE Clam Chowder was delicious and meaty.  Service (Sydney) was GREAT!  We would probably go back but the bathrooms are somewhere out the back of the restaurant... literally out the back door.  My wife headed that way and was uncomfortable with the people hanging around back there.  The other dinners we saw delivered to other customers looked good! 3
I went for an ear piercing and the customer service was exceptional. Very helpful and knowledgeable staff. After walking in several other places I couldn't help but notice the friendly atmosphere and how clean the place was.  The piercer used sterile equipment and she was quick and it was over before I knew it! Great job and thank you! 5
Great food and at great price.  I especially like the Tortas Milanesa de Res and the Horchata.  They also have a little bakery inside the store. 5
Too many good things in one store.  My favorites, dark Chocolate covered toffee rolled  in pistashio nuts, Ice Cream Bliss Bars,  Shepards Bread, Spinach Salad, peanut butter pretzels, unsweetened ice tea and 2 buck Chuck.  Also, their frozen vegtables are great and the meat is good and reasonably priced.  I expected to pay more.  All in all my favorite place to shop 5
We were excited to hire MaidPro based on the positive reviews and ratings online. However, we were very disappointed in our experience. We did not receive a call prior to arrival the day of our service.  The worker did arrive within the time window specified (1:30pm), which we appreciated.  Upon her arrival, we discussed a short list of items to have her complete (2 full bathrooms and one 1/2 bath, vacuum the upstairs hallway and stairs, vacuum our living room, sweep and mop the kitchen/entryway and dust 4 shutters).  Based on her work, we ere completely dissatisfied with the quality of work.  Within 15 minutes of her arrival, she began working on one of the bathrooms and we left to run some errands.  We returned home about 4:00 pm (2 1/2 hours after her arrival) and she indicated that she was just getting ready to start the downstairs (1/2 bath, living room vacuum, sweep/mop and 4 shutters).  When we returned, we were surprised at how little was accomplished while we were away.  For the next hour, we observed that she was constantly texting or talking on her phone.  She completed the downstairs in approximately 1 hour and left at 5:00 pm (3 and 1/2 hours total).  Without any comment or question from us, she made a comment that her boss had been texting her all afternoon.  Upon her departure, we inspected the work and were completely dissatisfied by the quality of most of her work.  She did do a good job in the bathrooms; however, the remainder of the work had to be re-done after she left.  The shutters were not wiped down well at all, the stairs and hallways had to be re-vacuumed, etc.  We actually had to go back through and re clean 2/3 of what she did. We had agreed on 4 hours of work, and really only had her for 3.5 hours.  As we mentioned, we were pleased with the job she did on the bathrooms, however, we would have been able to do a better job overall and in a shorter amount of time if we had done it ourselves.  In addition, her vehicle left a 2" x 4" oil leak on the driveway.  Upon her departure last night, we contacted your office to let you know of our experience and ended up leaving a message.  At this point, we have not received a call back.  Very disappointing experience, especially considering that the house was empty and we were looking for some additional assistance while we moved.. Would not recommend to anyone looking for a housecleaning service.Update 7/10/2015We raised the rating to two stars because the owner reached out to us and was very concerned with making things right. She assured us that she was addressing our concerns, and was very receptive to our feedback. Failed to mention in previous post but every interaction with front office was very courteous and professional. If the actual cleaning matched the customer service in the office and by the owner, it would have been 5 stars. 2
Rude service. Came in through the front doors wanting to ask about the quote for a registered massage therapy session when all THREE front desk women failed to greet me. No eye contact or any acknowledgement of me. Even when I asked about the RMT prices in a pleasant manner, the one woman who did bother to answer answered back quite rudely in a condescending manner. As if I couldn't pay. Ugh. No thanks, I'll be taking my hard earned cash somewhere else!!! 1
We just completed our pool remodel with Dave Furman at Rondo Pools. I got estimates from 5 major pool builders in the valley before deciding on Rondo. We love our new pool! This was an average dollar project at $15k but we never felt our small job was less important than a big high dollar one. More importantly the process was the easiest remodel project (new kitchen,  floors,  & doors in a year) I've done to date on our home. I'm sure this is thanks to Dave and keeping the project on track. This is our seasonal home and I was concerned about monitoring this project from Chicago but it turned out quite easy to accomplish with Dave in constant contact with me and updates. I'd recommend Rondo pools to my friends. 5
Just had the Kentucky Fried Fish. Wow. I've never ever had better. I am well traveled- 44 states and 14 countries. Again- never ever better. The fry was light but full coating. The fish was obviously fresh as it was glistening on the inside. The sauce flavorful and not spicy. The slaw was sweet and perfect balance. Portion is large. Price good. I'll be back. I'll bring friends. 5
Chick-fil-a food is always good.  The service is what is at issue - it appears that the staff "caters" to the drive-thru and keeps the customers that come into the store taking a "backseat". 2
My expectations were very low. I was surprised to find the place had been renovated and was above what I had imagined in terms of aesthetics. Way cheaper than the Palms yet only across the street. Shuttle to/from the Strip was fast and easy.My only complaint is a kinda silly one. They obviously put a couple of buck$ into the upgrades. So why not go the extra oh... $50 to have decent stereo speakers by the pool. Seriously weird. They have a single old grey horn that blows out horrible sounding music. I don't mean the music programming - that wasn't bad. But the yucky high pitched vibrations coming from the ugly horn was just kinda sucky. Would rather they not even play music.Other than that, nice place if you aren't looking for a 5* experience.Would go back in a heartbeat. Would take ear-cupping headphones to the pool next time! 3
I was in the store and was new to Peoria area, lady told me to come here. I'm very picky about my nail but Khoi was great! I was very impressed over all with this place. Will be back! 4
Bought an open box tv that didn't work. Spoke with Grady, a manager, horrible customer service and was a pain to deal with. Will stick with Amazon from now on. 1
I went here for the first time for a Rocking Raspberry with Whey and was utterly dissatisfied. Service was good but the smoothie was bitter and not up to par with what I usually get at other locations. 2
Huge, noisy, long wait at the front door. I ordered the lobster fettuccine for $35/ plate. The lobster was terribly spongy and overcooked, the fettuccine was cooked to mush with no garlicky flavour. I had to ask for a spoon for my pasta which came after my dinner was cold. There was no bread on the table and when I asked for some, the server brought a piece of garlic toast (straight from the eighties) just for me and not my dinner companion.The staff being so young and poorly trained were a bad reflection of the restaurant depicted on their website which showcases beautiful cuisine. My experience was closer to being at a crowded overpriced Olive Garden...in my opinion.The atmosphere would make an okay patio/ bar scene if you don't mind overlooking a parking lot. They corked my wine which I do appreciate.I think they're best advised to make some changes quickly because once the buzz surrounding their novelty leaves.... 2
Just awesome traditional and unique sushi!  Impeccable service, great Saki and menu items.  Can't wait to go back! 4
service was very slow at 1:30pm and the restaurant was mostly empty.   The food was just average according to my two Chinese friends 3
First visit yesterday 6/7/2017. Found out they were closed.  A sign on door post temporary closed retrain staff something like that. So disappointed was looking forward to the unlimited toppings on pizza. 3
Fat lady working the drive through left her mic on and heard her tell her old man boss, "you need to tell your people how to talk to people". I'll come back when you replace your idiot, racist, low wage, front line with robots. 1
Took my jaguar to Bill at Kensington for new key and programming. My car was running in perfect condition until the key broke. Obviously with a Jag, the key must be programmed to the car or it won't drive ...so they had to order keys from a dealership. I was happy when Trisha told me they wouldn't charge me for programming if I ordered the keys through them. Due to the positive reviews I read here, I had the car towed while we awaited the new keys. The car was there 3 days. To make a long story short, we get the car back. Fuses blown for radio etc.. and needs a jump start. Dead alternator. Hmmm I spoke to Bill and he wants to charge 100+ for a diagnostic that I explained I didn't need. He then quotes me 730 something dollars to replace the alternator.. Really? 400 in labor... Really? My mind was officially blown! I went to ARCO AUTO CENTER on south Decatur on a referral from a friend. Ron specializes in foreign vehicles.. Alternator and labor= 320.00 out the door! 2
We had a wonderful experience this evening. Our drive thru window attendant Abby was very friendly and professional. 4
Why does this place have to be so bloody expensive? If London can have free admission to their museums then why can't we? By the time I've gotten to the third floor I want to find a place to lie down and sleep anyway.  AGO is a million times more interesting. 2
Went as two couples, the burger and the steak were good and the lamb was not. We asked for desert and were told they were out. Kinda dingy and way overpriced, for that kind of money I would go elsewhere. 2
Just found this small resturant. I really enjoyed it! Great food and Coffee, and not to busy, I would highly recomend if you want to try something new for breakfast or Lunch. I eat out for lunch almost every day, and it is really nice to find something different that is a one off. 5
Gaeng Kiaw Wan (in a coconut), Green Curry with bamboo shoots, kaffir lime leaves, basil leaves, green peppers and coconut milk. Served in a coconut! 4
I ate here yesterday for the first time in a while...and I remember why I don't eat at this location. My waitress was Kayla, I think. She never introduced herself. She brought us our appetizer and let us wait for about 25 minutes before taking our order because she thought we had more people coming? Absolutely ridiculous. She didn't even ask, she just assumed we were waiting because there was an extra menu on the table. 25 minutes later we finally order...she drops my ketchup and didn't get my order correct. The people behind us had to speak to the manager because their food wasn't cooked all the way. And the people in front of us were complaining because she got their order wrong as well. Complete waste of money. 1
Love it there. The pork shrimp coriander dumplings are exceptional. The wasabi salad is perfection . The service is ok, but the food is a winner. Simple and delicious. 4
Sorry but one of the worst KFC's I've ever been to.  I don't know what they do but the chicken is overcooked and still greasy.  After waiting for the chicken to be ready is still seemed as if it had been sitting in a bin for quite a while. 1
Don't fear the looks of the place, like they say you can't judge a book by its cover. They have the Best Pho in Phoenix, their broth is flavorful not watered down like so many others I've tried. Bun Bo Hue is really good as well.  Spring Rolls are always fresh not dried out, delicious  peanut dipping sauce! Only place you can find French Macarons on the West side of town. Overall a must try if new to the area, or a place to cherish and frequent often if you're a local. 4
This is one of the best place for Italian food in pittsburgh. Try their house chianti with the Absolut Penne with Shrimp. 5
Just terrible!  Dealers are all right, but pit bosses are like high school rejects on a domination regime.  This place is just not worth being at! 1
Great place to try out all the brews made by Phoenix and Sonora.  I recommend the flight  and just ask your bartender or waitress for suggestions. They are very knowledgeable about beer. Pick George's brain for beer information - he's a walking encyclopedia of beer. (For younger patrons, an encyclopedia is like Google, but on paper).  The tasting room is just that - clean and welcoming.  We had the Phoestivus last night, which is a slightly sweet ale with cinnamon.  Very Christmasy. 4
Recently visited Sundrops for the first time.  Enjoyed their "Diamonds..." pedicure and a gel manicure. The shop is small but they make great use of the space.  Allie was my technician and she was marvelous.  I am not into "quick" mani/pedis so this was a great spot to relax, talk a bit with Allie and just close my eyes to truly veg out.  My feet and legs felt and looked great.  My gel manicure is one of the best I have had and it was evident that Allie really knew her gel stuff.Again if you are a rush, walk in, cheap price type...this is NOT your nail shop.  I came in knowing I was going to be there a while and pay probably more than I should so I was not disappointed.  I have every intention to return and bring a friend. 4
My daughter and I love their burgers.Very friendly staffTheir fries are  really great.Had a banana milkshake last night..my only complaint is..it needed more bananas in it..I don't think they use real bananas,only something in a container that looks like a moll container.It was good but for the price,it should have real fruit in it. 5
Went there Sunday for the all you can eat Grand Lunch Buffet. The service was excellent, and the food was so good! I used the yelp deal 10 for 20. Best Indian food in the valley!!! 5
I'm use to the older terminals for the airport and yesterday I had my first flight out from the B gates which was actually much more nicer and newer than the C gates (always flown in and out of them). They've for some cool little beer cafe/bars that are completely open and in the middle of the large, open circular hubs of gates. Also lots of little food options and Hudson news stands everywhere. Definitely a refreshing look and feel compared to terminal C at least! If you have time to kill, I recommend swinging over for a few more food options or just simply to get a drink and hang out. 4
Glad I wasn't looking forward to eating here, or else I would have been really disappointed. The decor, ambiance, and service was of course amazing (as in all the restaurants in the Bellagio), but the food (mainly the steak) was not on par. I had the ribeye wagyu steak and it was the worst I have ever had. It was strange, some of my pieces would be really dry and then other pieces would be overwhelmingly marbleized and fatty. I couldn't get a happy medium piece. The soy based sauce that came with it helped it a lot.Other than that, the stone crab appetizer I had was very good and fresh. I didn't like the seared foie gras (I prefer the smooth spreadable kind, this was the lumpy really livery looking kind). I had a taste of the butternut squash soup which was excellent. The mushroom side was perfect, but the truffle mashed potatoes was lacking in truffle. For dessert I had the poached pear and the coconut souffle. The poached pear dessert seemed a little bland to me. The souffle was really good and it was nice to have a coconut variation of it. I don't think I will find my way here again (sticking with CUT next time).www.anitaeat.com 3
Very disappointed in the quality of their food, totally undercooked. So dangerous as I am pregnant and have to be carful with bacteria! Not even a grill mark in this burger!!! I ordered a bun less avocado club and the party was still bloody inside. Had to post the picture, hopefully they see it and take better control of their quality in food. 1
This place has amazing food, amazing service, and a real great vibe. I highly recommend going here, you will be blown away and are in for a real treat. 5
I split a burrito bowl with the S.O.  We get the brown rice, black beans, double chicken, fajita veggies, several salsas, and guac.  It was more than enough for both of us, and for fast food, it doesn't get much more healthy than that.  This specific location would benefit from more umbrellas outside: there are plenty of tables and ONE umbrella. It's not brain surgery, folks. 3
Worst service that I've had in Charlotte to date! I am a native Charlottean and we pride ourselves on good food and southern hospitality. I have been a patron for almost 2 years and I used to love this place. As the faces of the staff continue to change from vibrant, energetic, and fun to blank faced, talkative bar boys and girls, to "smoothie NON-makers" who struggle to remember the recipe ingredients, to "deer in headlights" managers, I've watched the quality in regard to customer service go down the tube. I waited for close to 7 minutes and eventually had to ask to be helped after being overlooked by not 1, 2, or 3 workers but a whopping 4 servers. How they happened to miss 1 of 2 customers standing in the front of a practically empty restaurant behooves me! I watched 2 servers laugh and joke at the bar for 5 minutes, so this was apparently more important than taking a freaking juice order (how difficult is that?). After waiting and being overlooked for a couple that walked in much later than me, I left without completing my order. Luna's is overpriced and seriously lacking in the quality of servers and respect for customers. They should take an energy shot and change the name to Luna's dead kitchen. I will obviously not be returning.... 1
Open later than most banks which is a major perk for me. Super convenient location especially when heading to and from California (NE corner of blue diamond & decatur; exit blue diamond from the I-15) Excellent customer service... consistently. Staff is exceptionally friendly. The manager Christian is a pleasure to deal with also. He is professional and very helpful. I'll be coming back to this branch for all future transactions. The branches nearby aren't quite as impressive. 5
Ick, the yoga factory, er Kula, doesn't do it for me.  Sure they have a great looking schedule brimming with all kinds of yoga, and of course a stellar intro deal that I was contemplating before trying, before I actually tried the place (via Passport). I went to a Saturday "Hot" Flow, which was more of an 'uncomfortably warm' flow.  It was also uncomfortably packed.  It is really hard to "open up" when you're slapping back and forth with the people next to you.   The class was somewhat challenging physically, which I appreciated, but instruction was pretty vague.  I didn't get any of the mental zen, which is my reason for going to yoga.  All I could think was, "oh I need to move back or she's going to kick me...uh sorry, I didn't mean to hit you...when the hell can I get out of here?" Back in the tiny change room I was more focused than during class, as I consciously tucked in my elbows to avoid jabbing nearby eyes as I swapped my shirt.  I left feeling like I had just been trapped in an elevator for an hour. 2
The clothes were a bit out dated. I had hoped for styles that were more modern. But could be just a preference in clothing styles.   Although,  the jewelry was retro to modern and pretty cool. Bought a couple bracelets. 3
Meh. You'd think that there wouldn't be much to be said about greasy Mexican food, but that doesn't seem to be true in La Hacienda's case. Not on my part though; they've got a pretty decent reputation online, particularly where weekend brunch is concerned. The Internet is full of lots of reviews, lots of check-ins, and lots of positive feedback.I'd say most of that good stuff online about them is dead wrong. La Hacienda is a decent little place at first walk-in: cozy, dimly lit, the kinda place you'd expect to find on this stretch of Queen West. With a mostly-covered back patio full of comfortable seating and nicely placed greenery, it seems like the perfect place to hide on a Sunday afternoon.But one thing is for sure, it isn't the perfect place to eat. The menu is mostly unimaginative with few signs of thought or effort. Boring chicken and beef burritos and greasy chorizo hash is what you'll be eating. Mostly everything comes with a side of their store bought corn chips and homemade salsa, but again, that salsa isn't made with any degree of love or passion for food; just a bunch of cubed tomatoes with little seasoning. La Hacienda sure doesn't have the fresh-chopped tomatoes and cilantro and killer guacamole you'd expect of a Mexican joint. This place doesn't have one dam authentic thing about it. Perfect for a hot, Sunday afternoon, they also serve in-house made Sangrias by the glass or pitcher. Unfortunately, they're far from perfect too. Cheap red wine, mixed with pre-frozen orange juice, and few bits of floating fruit, it's again, a big miss from the freshness most people associate with Sangrias. Call me crazy, but for 6 bucks a glass, I want some fresh-squeezed orange juice and fresh slices of orange and limes cut specifically for that purpose. I want the red wine they choose to have flavour that compliments citrus, not just whatever is laying around and recently opened.On this particular day, La Hacienda was brutally understaffed with one server and one cook; hardly enough to accommodate the back-patio alone, nevermind the front of the place. While still friendly, the server was obviously struggling to keep everyone happy; never returning to check on how people liked their food, which I assume they didn't. She was so busy in fact, that I didnt even have the heart to tell her how crappy everything was for fear that one misguided detail like that would throw her off her game completely.Seriously, this place is should be on your avoid list. There is absolutely nothing special, or Mexican for that matter, about it at all. It's just greasy, over-priced, 'Mexican' themed food served in a hipster shop on Queen West. If you're looking for authenticity, you've got a ton of other way-better options in this city. 1
It may be the fact that I have been here so many times that this place really doesn't have any mystique left. The ice cream is alright; the "restaurant" (cafeteria) that hopefully still isn't here was where I decided to have standards when it came to my burgers; and the terrace just isn't my place. The Union has all of those things but drinking pints of beer, listening to a random band and taking home the containers might be your thing. 2
Simply delicious !! Ordered the cheeseburger with the extra onion topping for $1.49 enjoyed every single bite...nomnomnom. I think you definitely develop a craving once you come here at least once. This was my second time and planning a third and forever after lol Fries were extra around $3.69 burger was around $5 something. Fries were enough for 2 people to share. Do try the cheese fries at least once! I didn't go for anything too big as this was just perfect for me and I believe it's one of their cheapest burgers (if your on a budget you can still enjoy). All of them well worth it as your getting a freshly made burger to order. I even like their large selection of diverse pop cans, and the casual urban hightop seating. Know some biblical questions to enter the secret menu. You'll get it right eventually lol 5
Best massage I've ever had! It's so different than an American massage but also so much better than American Massages! I felt like a whole new person after the massage. They do so much stuff to you in 1 hour it's amazing! I felt like every bit of tension in my body was gone afterwards. I felt like a huge noodle. I'm also a therapist so my hands and forearms where really bad and I felt like the lady gave me a whole new pair of hands. If you haven't tried a Thai massage yet you need to ASAP! 5
I came here with relatives visiting from out of town. They stayed in paris and we decided to eat here. There are two dimsum places that I know of outside the strip that are good and inexpensive. Well i was disappointed there weren't a lot of dimsum selections. Place is small and cramped, server was ok. We ended up ordering noodles. It was bland. The chicken taste just okay must be a frozen chicken from Vons. 1
Service and food was amazing!! Our server named Gerber was so sweet and treated our table of four like royalty! Would definitely come back for the smiles all around as well as the smiles in our burritos! Once again Gerber was amazing hope to have him again as a server! 5
I have cycled a lot of places over the years including Lifetime, 24 hour, Mtnside, Studio 360, Madison Improvement, Core Balance to name a few. Below is my review of Forza. Pros:Bikes are nice, and likely really preferred by cyclist who road ride. The owner is a kind lovely womanStudio is clean and well keptCons:They leave florescent office lighting on the entire class (not traditional to cycle classes)The music was not loud like traditional cycle studios, nor was it current musicThe energy of the teacher was rather low, not very motivationalFinal thoughts: The bikes are not typical spin studio bikes, so if you are used to normal spin studio bikes these might take some getting used to. If you are a road ride enthusiast this is the studio for you, if you prefer the inside traditional cycling "spinning" type class, this is not for you. 3
I applaud fresh52 on making this Farmer's Market happen in Henderson. There are so many logistical issues with having fresh produce sold in Las Vegas in the summer, and I'm sure that it has not been easy, as they have stated. I went last week and bought some delicious blueberries. I also discovered the Elixir cafe's sumptuous organic, vegan desserts, since they had a booth there even though their restaurant is just across the parking lot.  The strawberries were all gone by the time I was there (1 pm) but I look forward to buying them next week. I also look forward to more fun local vendors and produce being added. Perhaps they could add other desert treats like local honeys, dates, figs, apricots, etc. The quality of the other produce didn't look amazing but I chock that up to it being late in the day on such a hot afternoon. I will keep going back and purchasing from this farmer's market to help it stay in business and encourage its development. 4
Needed my nails done, Traci took my appointment, I got my nails, a pedi and eyebrows, all came out great! Hey traci!!! 5
I love this store.  I haven't done any price comparison shopping so I can't really comment on the other posters' experiences, but that's because what's great about Kol Kid is they have unique things I can't find anywhere else. If you need basics it's probably not the best place, but if you want to treat yourself or someone you love you can't go wrong.  When my sister found out she was having twins that seemed like the perfect occasion to splurge on very adorable $20 onesies.  Usually I'm all about the Carter's outlet $12 six pack of onesies (which you won't find at Kol Kid).  The staff is friendly, helpful and knowledgeable, and in spite of the high-end nature of their stuff they are incredibly mellow about strollers and toddlers running around.  I also love that they always have new stuff coming in, so even though I browse every week or two (I live very close to the store) there's always something new to look at. If you tend to be a frugal person or a bargain hunter, it's definitely not the place for you.  If you want to splurge once in a while (or you're lucky enough to be rich!) it's a wonderful place. 5
I've been twice and was glad that the food was good both times. The prices are decent for the entertainment district and the quality of the food. The zucchini fritti was good but a bit too oily. Arancini came in 3s and it was nice for sharing. Not a must try though.The prosciutto pizza was good. The crust was very thin so if you like thin crust, you may enjoy this.Overall, pleasantly surprised and would prefer to come here over some of the other "nice" restaurants in the area. 4
Horrible customer service.  I cannot count the number of times I was interrupted and belittled while speaking to the receptionist regarding my frustrations; not once was I allowed to speak a complete sentence without being "Ma'am"ed and talked down to.  She made me feel invalidated as a paying customer and, frankly, an adult.  Last time I was talked to that way was probably by my kindergarten teacher.  This woman has clearly never learned how to de-escalate a situation and has no business dealing with customer care.  Even as I tried to tell her I am trying to verbalize my frustrations with her company, she promptly interrupts me with a "ma'am!" and proceeds to tell me "you already did." Ma'am's = 25Complete sentences spoken = 0The only thing I would like to thank her for would be getting ahold of American Home Shield quicker than I could and canceling their service with me.  So thank you, Crotchety rude woman, for again throwing customer care 101 to the wind and not making any effort to make your customers happy. 1
So, we arrived at 1:45pm, for Brunch on a Saturday. We were told that we had to wait for 45 minutes. We waited at the bar, and waited and waited. Finally, at 2:55pm, the servers seated us at our table. We quickly ordered our meal, and waited again. At 3:15pm, and after waiting for 1 hour and 30 minutes, the server comes back and says that the kitchen made a "mistake" with our order, and that it would take a bit longer. Finally, our meal arrived at 3:45pm and over two hours since we arrived. The service is crap and the food is mediocre at best. Avoid at all costs! 1
Don't waste your time!  My husband and I couldn't even look, let alone talk to one another about the furniture we were seeing without being interrupted over and over again by aggressive sales people.  One decided to follow us around the store even after my husband politely told her that we really just wanted to look around ourselves and would grab her attention when we had questions.  She still wouldn't back off.  Aggressive sales lady I hope you are reading this.  Your loss. We were shopping for 2 UNfurnished homes!  Could have been a jackpot of commission for you.  Instead you probably spent your day chasing customers around and annoying them too. Learn to listen to your customers! 1
Very disappointing.   Extremely expensive.  Got the managers special.  From the time I paid til my truck was ready to 41 minutes.  The outside still had mud a on running boards and wheel frames.  The I side still had crumbs on console and floor.  Was running so far behind because of how long it took I didn't even complain.  But I will never go back.  Outside would have gotten just as clean going thru a $7 gas station car wash and I will have to clean the inside myself when I get home.  Do t waste your money here! 1
Overall its an "okay" restaurant. Very small interior, nice decor, and interesting "hipster" scene. Good food, kinda pricy for the amount you get. This restaurant wouldn't be a competitor in terms of good potion. They're popular because of the environment they provide. The quality of the food is fresh and delicious. I'd recommend trying it if you're in the area. 3
I got a great hair cut at Tony & Guy, but overal the service was terrible. 2
Not what you would expect from a strip mall restaurant!We had five different dishes and all were wonderful.The Ma-Por Tofu was to die for.  They claimed that the tofu was actually house made.  Incredible.Kung Pao had great flavor unlike some of the out of a can Kung Pao sauce that many places use.  House made!It was extremely clean and the staff was very, very attentive.  I will return on my next trip to Vegas. 5
The 1st time I ate here, i was extremely pleased. Tonight, I ordered extra cheese with  meatballs pizza. I am EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED. It just didn't taste good.  Maybe it was the meatballs? I think it's better if you you dine in but not for delivery. 2
They came to my job and took about 2 hours doing my executive detail inside and outside and I got the wax and headlight restoration and I must say my car hasn't looked this good EVER. I bought the car from a private seller almost 2 months ago but the car looks even better than when I bought it off him. Interior is looking great all around, exterior is looking sexy as hell with the waxing and the night and day difference between my headlights. My headlights even shine brighter now which is great. Oh and my wheels also look better than ever. Would definitely recommend and will be going back. The owner is a very cool and friendly guy. 5
I called and placed an order by phone so that I will save time, pick up the food and be on my way home. When I got there, the person whom I talked with on the phone asked me again what my orders were and just put it in the system as I was repeating it to her. Long story short, they made me wait for 30 minutes because it was so busy that day. What's the point of calling ahead if you still have to wait that long? Aside from that, the quality of food served was subpar. The fruits were not that fresh. The bananas on the pancake were already turning blackish and the strawberries were already wilted. The spinach omelette I ordered was not an omelette, it's just a fried scrambled egg with blanched spinach on it. An omelette is suppose to be a scrambled egg with all the other ingredients mixed with it, before frying it. Will never be back again. Horrible food and service. I would give a negative number of star if only it's allowed. 1
The nacho chips, guacamole and cheese dip were our favourite. Pulled pork, fish and bulgogi tacos were all just ok. The space is nice and fits with the King West atmosphere. Seating is "community" style (shared tables). You place your order and grab a seat when it becomes available. 3
Went to dinner last night with my wife prior to seeing a movie at the Harkins nearby. The restaurant wasn't too busy and it took a minute for host to arrive and seat us. Our server came over promptly and was attentive throughout the meal. Drinks were refilled timely and she was patient with us when we couldn't make up our mind on what to order. To start we shared an order of hot oven roasted wings. Best part of the meal. Good flavor, tender and nice to enjoy something that hasn't been deep fried. Moving onto the pizza....... Big swing and miss. I can see the appeal of happy hour, but the prices for their pizzas are quite high. We ordered a 10 inch Kosmic Karma. Red sauce, mozzarella, sun dried tomatoes, spinach, feta, and Roma tomatoes. This would have been a little better as a white pizza, but to accompany a heavy coating of pesto on top, they put nasty red sauce. This red sauce is lacking flavor and the little that it does have leaves a bad aftertaste. The crust looked like it would be tasty but it too was quite bland. For a place serving specialty pizzas I was expecting it to be bursting with great flavor. A pizza from Hungry Howie's would have been better even though they are by no means the best kind of pizza. Go to Grimaldi's for that. As far as portion sizes a 10-inch pie was more than enough for my wife and I to share. Overall I had high expectations after reviews on yelp and recommendations from coworkers. I will not be going back for another shot at dinner but may take a shot at happy hour one of these days. 2
Normally a good place with a variety of food and fun atmosphere but on 4/25/17 when six of us went in for lunch at 1:30 everything went wrong.  With almost nobody there service was slow, took 15 minutes to get drinks, food a half an hour and then two orders were over cooked and three were wrong.  They did comp us one meal that was inedible and gave us two desserts then we had to wait for spoons.  Pretty much as bad as it could get. 2
I have worked in the area for years and tried a number of lunch items. Everything always tastes very homemade and high quality! Soups are always delicious - Carrot ginger is a favourite, and they always come with a piece of bread for dipping.Cobb salad is excellent, they are pre prepared but come with a creamy and tangy blue cheese dressing on the side.Quiche with greens - my favourite lunch which I get fairly often from Le Gourmand. They always have 2 or 3 types (ham and cheddar, goat cheese and roasted veg, smoked salmon and dill are all common options). With greens it comes to 6.99 which is well worth it, the pastry is flaky and buttery and the portion size is very fair.They also always have hot lunch specials (lasagna, curries, meatloaf etc.) and a range of sandwiches that can be put in a panini press.Finally you can't go without grabbing a cookie, particularly the chocolate chip w/walnut are the best cookies in the city without a doubt. I think they're around $2ea but I would pay 3 no problem. They are crispy outside and gooey inside just like you would attempt to make at home but fail! Give it a go if you're in the area, they also have a nice little patio area on Spadina. 4
Nice atmosphere, friendly and helpful staff. For me, the burger was a bit greasy, but otherwise was great. The place is understaffed, which makes me feel like I'm being a nuisance when asking for something. Not the fault of the servers obviously, but something should be done to help them out and let them be personable instead of constantly rushed. To add to my server's workload, she was doing dishes since they don't have a dishwasher in the back. Also, the menus are all paper and not the most pristine looking. Would come back for the great service and fresh food, but I hope the owner hires more help and looks at some of the fine details. That will make this place less pretty good, and more amazing. 4
it doesn't get better than green valley ranch sports-book.  1 dollar beer, 1 dollar hot dogs, turf grill only top of the line food and priced very good, plus free well drinks when you gamble (must get coupon when you place wager).  get there early and you get your own TV. booth., the waitresses are very thorough, they walk down every isle and ask everybody if the want a drink. unlike ceasers.  the whole right side is for football and the left is for horse racing,  but you can pretty much sit anywhere. 5
Rivals my experiences at Napa valley restaurants.  Very unique menu. Interesting appetizers, excellent well prepared fish dishes.  The wine list was excellent and prices were moderate. The restored Lucas house provided an intimate experience with excellent service by Ty. 5
I have gone here a few times with semi-good experiences. The desserts are pretty good for the price. I've tried mango black glutinous rice dessert, mango pudding, green tea and red bean shaved ice an taiwanese black glutinous rice mix. The drinks are WAY too sweet and nothing special. I have only tried wings on their hot food menu and would not recommend anyone get them. I got the crispy chicken wings which were basically 3 wings cut into half and battered to make it look like 6 full wings. $6.99 for 3 wings is STEEP AND A RIP OFF. They did not taste that great either. I also do not like the fact that they add a mandatory 10% tip. Every other place I go to does not do this unless it is a big group. The first few times I went, I did not realize they did this and paid tip on top of the total! 3
This place is the spot for burritos not just in Scarborough but toronto. Price is amazing and ingredients are always fresh, I recommend this place to anyone 5
My food was really greasy and cheap looking. Don't see too much difference from Showmars, but maybe I should've expected that 2
The quality of the service you receive is bad and so expensive. I had to wait for a long time since they just had one stylist working there. I went there 2 times. Both times i was just so unhappy with my haircut. Not going there anymore. 2
Marcia and Mike are awesome! And my "Murphy" loves them too. I've been using their services ever since Murphy adopted me over 4 years ago. They take care of Murphy, and I, so well. They text me photo and video updates while I'm away, and also ensure my home and property are safe and secure. Whether 1 or 10 days away, Pawminders Plus takes care of Murphy and I! 5
Worst pharmacy in Vegas. I've been to many Walgreens and this pharmacy is by far the worst one. If you can avoid this, do. Nothing but long lines and bad customer service. Forget about calling them. That's even worst. Calls always get transferred and when you do get someone your call is placed on hold. After a long wait your call is forwarded to another department so when they reconnect you to pharmacy then you are at the back of the line again. Be warned. 1
Another average HK style cafe. Nothing special about the food really. Servings are decent but like everyone has mentioned, service is SLOW especially when its busy. 2
The guy in purple shirt  asking the black bus boy to go out back and fight what a turn off from this place 3rd time i ate here from out town this loud mouth pushing what  seems  to be a manager  never again will i eat there cause of him and i staying across the  street for 2 months  for work shame  on him the girls were just shaking  there head cause of his behavior  lots of kids with  family present 1
This hotel is really really pretty! I have been to Paris and the paintings on the main floor are pretty unreal! I have definitely stayed in nice hotels but it really does have an airy feel which I have found is hard to find at a lot of hotels in Vegas. 3
Overall, a disappointing experience but I'm giving it the current rating hoping some points will improve with the benefit of the doubt considering they just recently opened.The beer list on the website is much more extensive than what we were offered when we sat down as we were not given a list of bottles and trying to ask our server was a rather difficult task as he was either missing for extended periods of time or could not communicate very well in English.Wait times were long for getting drinks, food, bill, etc. Again, this could be in part because our waiter was new, did not understand our order, and at the end, he simply went missing never to be seen again (and we had to approach a different server to get our last drink and bill).We ordered two beers from the tap list and 1/2 liter of red wine. Our server had serious difficulty with our order for the wine even though we pointed out directly in the menu which wine we were ordering. The wine was corked and even the prospect of thinking about trying to point it out was unpleasant. If the server didn't understand that we were ordering the Bordeaux what hope was there for him to follow us when we explained that the wine was obviously corked and needed to be returned (something that had nothing to do with the storing or how long had it been opened).Beers were good, so no complains there. I just wish I had been offered the bottle menu as well as the tap menu (don't even try to tell me that I should have asked for the bottle menu ... the few precious times we saw our server had to be used ordering food and ordering our first round of drinks).The food was average but the menu needs to be more descriptive in terms of what is meant by certain items (considering the short list and plenty of space to do this, I'm surprised). Two savoury sandwiches (twists on French traditional fare) are offered with waffles instead of a bun. Given the savoury components it would be important to point out that the waffles will be covered in crystallized sugar and extremely sweet (either in the menu or by the servers). Burger and Belgian poutine were okay.I'm not sure if I will go back, particularly with so many other places available. Perhaps wait a bit until they find their groove and have better trained servers.I will update this review if we get the chance to visit it again. 3
What a brilliant place!!! Food great, service even better and the atmosphere , well you just have to go there yourself and experience the place. Awesome everyone!!! I'll be back tomorrow night!!! 5
Local pizza five minutes off the Strip. Great prices, great food. Garlic knots and homemade ranch ftw. 4
Went to Roux for New Years Eve, where they had a four course prix-fixe menu for the dinner service.  For the mains, my wife had a potato cannelloni and I had beef tenderloin with crab fritter.  Both were excellent.  Despite the place being completely full, the kitchen seemed completely in control, and the wait staff were very attentive.We have visited his neighbourhood eatery many times, and particularly enjoy their "happy hour" menu where they have drinks and dishes available for $5. 4
I agree with the other reviews.  This is a terrible Verizon store, but all the other Verizon stores that I've been to were even worse!!  If you live in Mentor this is still the best Verizon Store.  The thing I would like to stress the most is to get whatever quote in writing!!  I also was quoted a much lower price, and was really mad when I saw the billing.  I did manage to get the billing lowered, but it was extremely frustrating!!  I had a salesperson that went on and on about how much she knows, and told me to call her whenever I needed help.  When I needed help she never answered my calls.  Next time I go into the store for my upgrade believe me I will be more prepared for all of this nonsense!!! 1
As a former sushi chef & business owner, I would say that Zushi Bistro is well on it's way to earning the respect and favor of the people of Mesa.  Being only 9 months old Zushi Bistro has already acquired a fantastic staff filled with individuals of great talent & potential.  Like any new endeavor there are a few things that can naturally use improvement.  And I believe the people at Zushi Bistro can make that happen.  The sushi is good.  The atmosphere is special.  And the staff cares.Zushi Bistro in it's infancy has already achieved some wonderful and unique things.  Such as;  a spacious & relaxed patio area, a bar that inspires charm & beauty, and a sushi bar fit for the most avid sushi fan.If you expect absolute perfection out of a brand new establishment, this may not be the place for you.  Zushi Bistro in all it's potential is young and pulsating with possibilities.  This is truly a place for the creative and open thinker.  Where there's still room for the Good People of Mesa to make Zushi Bistro THEIR place to hang out and have a good time.I know when I go to Zushi Bistro I can leave all pretension at the door and still enjoy an evening of quality dining. - Matt DeLeonSinger/Entrepreneur480-621-7737 4
The patio is awesome but the bartender blatantly ignored me twice to walk passed me to help guys that walked up to the bar after me. She spent more time flirting with them than even acknowledging me, nothing, just kept walking passed me until there was only me.  This happened to me two of the three times I went there with different bartenders. Overall place is nice, nothing special, but the patio is one of the nicer ones in lakewood. 3
Amazing friendly service!!! I came with pants needing them hemmed & tapered and needed them fixed fast.. they fixed them in an 1.5hr!! Been here a few times.. always extremely nice! 5
Love going here! My last two visits were decent. The server honestly, was rude, I do not remember her name; but seriously, every other time I have been here EVERYONE is so nice. Also, the potatoes seem to be slightly undercooked, again this is a more recent thing happening here, I am guessing there is a newer cook. The biscuits and gravy, Cajun omelet and the coffee are to die for!! Definitely somewhere you should try at least once, anyone I have every taken here has become a huge fan and always comes back 5
Love this place the food is always great and the workers are so friendly all of the time i highly recommend you just try it ... Oh and the carne asada fries are LIFE 4
It was terrible.I had : (1) 2 hotdog combo with Sauerkraut , Lg Crinkle Cut French Fries and 1 Heineken beer          $17.24i picked up the hotdog and the bun totally disintegrated , incredibly small hotdog compared to the price, the fries were cold and over cooked.The beer was cold 1
I have been working with Chris for over 10 years.  He and his staff always are available to help with a question or to give me more info on something I am thinking of adding to my policy. I have referred many people over the years to Chris and they have all had positive experiences as well.  I recommend Chris and 360 insurance to everyone I can!  Give them a call. 5
went here with my husband. lots of cute animals but u can tell that they aren t cared for.. rly sad 1
An okay experience.It's a shell of the actual fast-food restaurants, but it fills the hole for a quick bite and drink while traversing the Rio. Service was adequate, although I attacked the restaurant when there were no customers. So maybe adequate is not good enough when I'm the only customer.The Whopper was bland. The ingredients were fresh enough, and I saw the server make my hamburger so I know it wasn't premade. But it just tasted bland.Overall, it's just meh. 2
I would recommend Jacqueline Hanna Photography 100 %. She was amazing! She made sure to go around to everyone at our function and ask if anyone wanted photos taken! She was so easy to work with! I would definitely use her again! Thank you so much for capturing our parents 50th Anniversary party!! CANNOT wait to see the pictures!! 5
2 stars! One star each for: products and ambiance. No stars for service, price and "Will I come back?"Unfortunately, no staff in sight. The shop is huge and jammed full of really interesting crafty stuff. If you can find what you want. It is also brightly lit and clean.Prices are generally more expensive than RRP. I had a huge list of stuff to buy, but no help. Also cheaper on Amazon and free shipping. Fiskars has 30% off now, so I stocked up those and only those.I won't be back. 2
Went to check out this place on a Saturday evening. Was blown away by the decor, thought it was an art gallery (and it used to be). Beautiful place, feels like you are somewhere in Paris or London. But that's where the good review ends. Our waiter came by, introduced himself and asked if we needed anything. So far so good. We ordered drinks and he went to get them. 20 mins later, he comes over (no drinks) and tell us that the bar is busy making drinks for a big table that just came in (um, I think we were first and the only drink that required making for our table was one cocktail - the rest were open a bottle and pour). So anyway, finally the drinks arrive and my glass of prosecco was a bit warm (I guess it was standing there for a while). The cocktail that my boyfriend ordered was tasty. Then we ordered the food and had to wait for that to arrive (except for the salad which arrived pretty fast and was good). The black ink pasta that we ordered was good, however the duck pizza was lacking in flavour big time! After we were done, we were sitting with empty plates for a while, even though there were lots of waiters in the restaurant who kept walking by us and not clearing the plates. Our waiter abandoned us because he was busy with the big table of guys. Finally a manager came by himself and cleared our table which was very nice of him. We wanted to get coffee but had to wait another 20 min! When our waiter showed up we asked for espresso and cappuccino.  When he came by with espresso he slipped and spilled it on my friend.  He felt very bad and tried to clean up the mess as quickly as he can and brought a new one right away. HOWEVER, they still charged my friend for it AND didn't offer to clean his jeans or even not charge him for a meal as the coffee was very hot and burned him a bit. WOW, I was blown away. We were so nice about him spilling the drink, but they didn't do anything about fixing the situation. For that reason will not be coming back! In summary, the place is beautiful, the food needs more work (keep in mind it's just another Italian restaurant so they should find a way to stand out), the service needs major make over! Prices are reasonable. 2
Terrible first impression before we even parked. Outside on the bushes beside the restaurant were cleaning rags laying out to dry. Once inside we noticed they were the same rags that were being used to clean the tables. The water tasted nasty and the sushi wasn't that great either. 1
04/11/2016 3:30ish. Copperfield Blvd, Concord, NC.   I love Longhorn Steakhouse.  Today made me think I'll find another location.  My mother is 87 yrs old.  Blind.  Wheelchair bound.  It's a treat when she goes to a restaurant, and I treated her to her favorite jalapeno poppers and wild west shrimp today.  The appetizers were delish, as usual.  And the waitress (Kiara, Kiana?) was attentive and polite.  I tipped her $5 for a $16 tab.  No complaints whatsoever about the appetizers or wait staff.  Tops!My mother and I are leaving.  Two women are chatting it up at the hostess station.  The restaurant isn't busy.  No one waiting.  The doors are not handicapped friendly, so I'm trying to hold the doors open (two), and push the wheelchair through without the door hitting my mother.  These women continue their chat as if we were not even there, muchless struggling with the doors.  I pushed my mother outside and returned to remind them that there will be a day when they, too, are old and in need of assistance, and that they should be ashamed of themselves.  I can't tell you what they were talking about that was more important than an elderly customer because they were speaking spanish, but I can tell you that my mother and I will find another place the next time we venture out from 'the home' for a treat.  Shame on Longhorn Steakhouse for employing such inconsiderate, uncaring, inattentive hostesses.  Last visit for us. .. and we've been going there since 2005. Shameful.P.S.  Please install automatic doors to accommodate handicapped people because your hostess(es) is/are too busy babbling with one another to help an 87 yr old, wheelchair bound lady and her daughter.  You folks will be old and incapacitated one day, too.  Shameful.I posted a 5 star review of this restaurant in 2013.  The quality of the food has not wavered, but the quality of the service staff has greatly declined.  Maybe they are just too young and dumb, or don't speak english well enough to understand that courtesy is part of the job! You don't let your customers struggle while you stand babbling with your buddy.  I am completely Disgusted. You won't see us again. 2
Found this hidden gem while visiting friends! Such a small and home feel! The food was amazing and Tommy was super friendly! Will definitely have to come back! 5
I hated this place at first. I thought the sandwiches were weird and soo messy and a bit expensive, but now I find I get a craving for one every week or two.It's a crazy big sandwich, covered in homemade tomato sauce, and its a mess, so be prepared. I have only ever had the chicken before with cheese and onions and its so nice.It's a little pricey, but you do get a good portion of meat and as I said, I get cravings now for one.One thing I've heard is that they're cash only, which is a bit of a pain, but in my experience, they take cards here. 4
I came in with a very basic question and the "salesman" was so incredibly rude to me. He completely refused to help me and I left with no improvements to my problem. Thankfully I'm still in the first 14 days of my contract so I can switch to a company with working service. 1
We held my daughter's 5th birthday party here. Pros: * Everything was taken care of! * Pricing for additions was VERY reasonable!* The staff was understanding and worked seemlessly with everyone. * The princess was definitely a professional party hostess, she guided the kids with great conversation and even wrote down the list of gifts each person got for my daughter!* We never had to worry about a single detail during the party!* Adults were given the opportunity to be either included or not, which from what I gathered they really enjoyed (I was with the kids the entire time).* We pretty much had the entire place to ourselves, which was really nice.* The cake and cupcakes were awesome!Cons:* I would have preferred to get everything in writing and sign a formal, itemized contract. 4
Friendly service, good chips & salsa. But the food was very disappointing. Cheese was terrible. Not sure what it was but never going to return to this place. 1
Would really like to review Fogon.  Unfortunately, we showed up at 7:45 on a Sunday night.  Seems like they close at 8, and will turn away people that show up before then.  I get it.  If you want to go home, that's fine. But set the closing time for when you want people to stop coming, not when you want to go home.Can't comment on the food, atmosphere, or drinks. We couldn't get served. 1
Food is really good here. Came here on a Friday, so limited seating, and sluggish service. We go fried chicken (order as soon as you sit down, it's 20 mins wait), papaya salad (yum!), Pork Belly Bao (juicy, saucy, with great pickled onions), and tried a bite of KPC (Kongpao chicken done with Korean gochujang). Again, the food is good here, definitely recommend, maybe on a less busy night. 3
I was going to order a muffin and then I saw that there were fruit flies in the bakery case. That made me want to gag a little.The coffee tastes OK, but the barista wasn't very polite.That's enough to give it one star. It does have a lot of seating, but maybe  because the place is filthy. 1
Following the completion of our pool and decking, it was onto the next phase: landscaping. We contacted several companies, and finally found One Call via Yelp. Scott, Kevin, Kurth, Christa and crew were wonderful. No high-pressure sales, professional, and easy to talk to. They had great recommendations on what worked best for our yard. The crew worked SO hard and are experts at their craft. Kids love their new beautiful backyard and pool. Thank you One Call! 5
Stay away from this place. This place is trash. The dentist doesn't know what she is doing at all. It seem like she is just graduated and has no experiences whatsoever. I had such a bad experience with this place from the beggining to the finish. I just had my root carnal a month ago. I was in so much pain during the whole process. It took 3 hours to finish the whole thing. I knew my teeth was that bad and it was just a root carnal. One day after the process, I was in so much pain that I had to take pain releive pill. I couldn't chew or even drink cold water. A few days later, my tooth had a small hole. So I had to go back to and get it fixed. I have never had this bad experience with a dentist like this before. I should've have stayed with my old dentist who has a lot more experiences. More than that the dentist is a bitch. She just wants your money. This place is hell. Stay away from it. 1
The first time I went to XS I loved it. It had a good vibe, good music. But like others have said they overpack this place. We got stuck outside for about 30 minutes while Tiesto was on because it was too full. Thank goodness I was with a bunch of girls, they let us in after only 30 mins. I saw people out there for over an hour!!Also the three times I have been here the people who go here are just so rude. Both times we got pushed around by groups of Italian guys and frat boys who couldn't hold their liquor. Super annoyed. For table service this place rocks, and if you can go on a night where they don't pack you in like sardines you'll have fun. Another time it's a no go for me. 3
If you're not familiar with Korean-Chinese cuisine, you're in the right place.When you first arrive, you are given a hot pot of tea and their menus. You can ask for water as well, but we like our tea so we usually don't. On one side of the table, you can find the restaurant's combo special sign, offering a huge variety of prix fixe for large parties. At Sunny Dragon, the portions are very big, so even the smallest Combo A would probably be enough for 4 (than their recommended 2-3 people).After you order, you are given a mixed plate of side dishes. In Korean-Chinese cuisine, there are 3 essential side dishes: pickled radish, kimchi, and raw onions with black bean paste. The white vinegar given on the side of the table can be poured over the pickled radish and onions to enhance their flavours. This is totally optional and is personal preference.Sunny Dragon also has a great lunch special menu for a very affordable price. If you're in the area for a great tasting lunch, you can definitely count this place in.As for our menu, we now have a set menu that we order since we've been here many times.We always get the kkan-pun-sae-u (sweet and spicy shrimps) and another main dish (usually noodles) to share. Kkan-pun-sae-u:At Sunny Dragon, the shrimp they use in this dish is huge! That is, they use the king sized shrimps and not the small ones. It is really worth your money. The tempura batter on the shrimps are so crisp and the sauce is drool-worthy. It is not that spicy on our palates, and more on the side of sweet and sour. We love this dish so much that we get it every time we go to Sunny Dragon. There are not only shrimp but a variety of vegetables and pineapple as well! The pineapple really gives the dish its sweet and sour flavour and I manage to find them all and put them in my belly. Fried Jjam-ppon:This was kind of an adventure foodie experience for us because we didn't know what it looked like, or how it would taste. Like, how is a spicy noodle soup dish fried?? But, it truly was a good idea to try this. The taste was almost exactly how the original jjam-ppong would taste, except with less soup! I was in love. You see, I love eating jjam-ppong, but I didn't particularly like the soup part of it. This was the perfect solution dish for me! The dish had a hearty portion of noodles in it, with Chinese bok-choy, seafood (squid and shrimp), and other vegetables.Family Jja-jang:This dish can be ordered for one person, two people, or up to a party of five. The story behind this dish goes a bit like this. Traditionally, the jja-jang-myun is freshly cooked noodles with the black bean sauce poured over it. It is then taken to the customer, who mixes the noodles and sauce together oneself. This dish, the family jja-jang, comes out already mixed by the chef, and also with the addition of seafood and other vegetables not usually seen in the traditional version. As there are other seafood and vegetables in the dish, the noodles and sauce are cooked together by the chef once more. The family part of the dish originates from the fact that this dish can be shared, bringing the family together over their meal. This is also why you can order this dish for up to five people. On our visit, we tried this popular dish and ordered the one portion of it. We asked the waiter who was taking our order beforehand how big the portions are, and he honestly told us that the one portion would be enough for us to share since we were ordering the sweet and spicy shrimp anyways. And he was definitely right! The dish was exactly enough for us to share, and priced below $10, just like the fried jjam-ppong was.All in all, this family restaurant is a hit go-to place especially during the weekend. You will find the place packed with Koreans and other Canadians alike. We highly recommend this restaurant! You could probably call ahead and make a reservation if you want. 4
So not impressed. If I wanted to spend this much on brunch, I would've gone somewhere better, but no, the people in the group wanted this place. I think we should've questioned her taste buds since she was slightly sick/congested. The place had different stations. There was American, Mexican, Italian, Asian, a Salad station, Seafood, Desserts, and MIddle Eastern, which included Indian food because apparently India is not Asia according to Planet Hollywood. The line was quite long, but it was around brunch/lunch so my party and I waited in line, which didn't seem that long of a wait. Or maybe it didn't seem that long since they had TVs playing a Nets game and people were all about Lin, but I digress. Once we paid, the total came to $31, we had to wait to be seated, which again didn't seem so long a wait. We marked out drink orders on a paper and went off in search of belly fulfilling food. I got the usual breakfast food: eggs benedict, bacon (a lot of it since I don't really eat bacon lol), as well as some fruit and harsh browns. Another plate contained stuff from the Middle Eastern station, like some chicken curry, basmati rice, their lamb stuffed tomato thing, and pita and hummus. Well have to say, I enjoyed the breakfast stuff, aside from the non-runny eggs benedict and was kinda disappointed in the Middle Eastern station. I found the food at that station a bit bland and asking "Where is the spice that makes this whatever it is suppose to be?!" Luckily there were drinks, although the OJ was a bit warm for my liking. And the mimosas were more like an Orangina than a mimosa. We asked for water, but that didn't come till later. I almost thought the poor server forgot. Anyways, I went back to the buffet to see what else I could eat. I didn't find much too appealing cause I was a bit full, but I soldiered on. I went back for a crepe which was at the dessert station. They didn't have any strawberries (big boo to that!!!) so I settled with cherries topped with chocolate sauce, whipped cream, and powdered sugar. I found it a bit blah; too chocolatey and the cherry filling was a bit off putting for me. I got another fruit of plate and found I was more satisfied with fruit than I was with anything else. I could've gotten it and a decent mimosa somewhere else or found better food at other buffets on and off the strip. Aside from the fruit, I liked the cotton candy :)I like buffets in Vegas, but not this one. 2
The facility looks very nice on the inside, but that is all this place has to offer.  There is high pressure for deluxe services and my my they charge an arm and a leg for them.  The very expensive full set that  paid for look more like little stubs on my nail bed.  The technician shaped my nail too narrow for my nail bed.  Remember the piece of tape you would put on your nails to make them seem longer as a little girl?  Well, that what they looked like.  I came two days later with shellac polish that already had lifted and expressed my dissatisfied experiences.  After trying to explain to the manager why a nail polish that I paid an additional $15 for should not lift after two days and nails that should not look like something out of a comic book, he finally gave in and I got a whole new set.  That meant removing the full-set and putting them back on from another technician.  The original technician that shaped the comic book nails wanted to ADD acrylic to the sides of my nail bed, "just add a lot of powder to the sides and reshape" she told the technician.  He thankfully said, "you can't do that'. I normally do not write reviews unless I am very pleased with services provided or I am completely dissatisfied.  This time I was completely dissatisfied, I will never ever go to this nail salon again. 1
Okay breakfast burrito that took 15 minutes to prepare.  I questioned it, the girl was rude about it, 15 minutes is normal.  Yet two other customers came and left before mine arrived.  No apology, nothing but push back.  First and last visit. 1
Was a decent Lunch. Had the chicken kabobs with rice. Not much chicken for the price and was a bit dry. But all in all. Was a good meal. 3
Well, the food SMELLED good.  However, upon being seated, we received two pieces of news that precipitated a rapid exit: 1) they were no longer honoring the coupons we had purchased--that prompted us to visit Mirch in the first place--because 2) they were closing in two days.Buh-bye. 1
Wednesday wine flight: 3 tiny glasses of wine (2 oz ish) with a 1-2 bite appie pairing. 2 of the wines were really really good. 1 of appies for example was a small bowl of spiced roasted chickpeas. Wines presented with a brief sentence/story from rep from Capital Wines. The bites were not bad and interestingly paired - Riesling with beet/fennel/anchovy salad, Chard with cucumber, ginger butter on bread, Cab with spiced chickpeas. Seating was open in the lounge/bar area, reservations required. Atmosphere and service: 4 star.Ordered 2 appetizers which were really okay. Not bad. I want to say they were really good. A goat cheese with olive oily crostini and pinenuts, red pepper, garlic. The goat cheese itself was delicious. A galette with cabbage and swiss - mushy crust/bread, lots of cheese and not enough of the delicious red cabbage. I appreciated the unusual filling. The servings were substantial, we felt full and didn't even finish them. They were maybe $8 each so priced well. The other glass of wine I ordered off menu was just okay. I would pay more for more wine and stories from the wine rep with the tasty bites. Maybe more wines and a couple larger bites in the middle. Ooh, and a small dessert bite. 3
I am unsure if the DogStop is getting to big for itself or too busy, but I have had issues with them and wont likely be taking him there again. After the last time my boyfriend went to get my pet's nails cut they informed him that I was told he was too aggressive for them to do his nails. I was never told this and my boyfriend (who took him the time before) was never told. I was unsure if they were confused between two Max's but this upset me. 2
My wife & I are big fan of both Boiling Crab & Hot n Juicy.  Last night, after 10 pm, Hot n Juicy was closed & we accidentally found this place called Urban Crawfish. Never been here before. It was around 10:25 pm and only one table was occupied. Late hours and it was understandable. Bit sketical but we decided to give it a try and ordered carry out. 1 lb Crawfish in spicy, 1 lb shrimp medium spicy & 1 lb shrimp extra mild sauce. What kind of sauces they were are not important in this review because everyone has different taste. Just because I didn't like their sauce doesn't mean it is a bad restaurant.  Different restaurant...different recipe. ...simple.    We got home & finally get settled to enjoy our late dinner on our day off. Well, very disappointing taste of sauce, but like I said, it's only personal preference.  I'm sure there are lot of people who love this recipe.  But Crawfish not being fresh? That's a totally different issue.   If you are Crawfish lover, like I am, you understand the joy of sucking the brain juice out of Crawfish. To me .... that's the best part. But at the same time It's also one of the nastiest tasting thing if it is not fresh. I tried 6 crawfish and ended up throwing them away. Just terrible. I've never been a review writer on Yelp. But paying $ & tasting  not fresh shelfish? Its just very difficult to tolerate.  Expecially when I'm a chef myself.   As I write this review with bad taste in my mouth, my wife is making a sanswich. I'll let you take a guess why. 1
What are you looking for in a restaurant in the suburbs?  If it's lots of beer and a beer hall atmosphere you are going to love National Westhills.  The downtown beer hall comes to a neighbourhood near you with its long tables and benches and incredible craft beer selection.There are currently 72 brands of craft beer from small North American breweries on tap.  Pretty impressive.  All the draught is one price so you can make a decision based on appeal alone.  You can get a glass for $6, pint for $8.5, stein for $14 or a flight for $15. One interesting selection is a mead from Fallentimber.  A family honey business turned meadery in Water Valley, Alberta.Sitting down we could find no kids'menu and the National fare is not sympathetic to young picky eaters.  While we love the oyster bar, charcuterie, beet & goat cheese salad, clam chowder, glory bowl, and lobster sliders our kids were uncertain of most of the content.  Enter macaroni and cheese minus the beef short rib & oxtail ragu.  Our kids also enjoyed the popcorn and tater tots with ranch.The newest National location has a few hiccups that will be smoothed with time.  The servers, who seemed to be just kids themselves, approached us like apologetic fawns.  While we were in the washroom our server cleared my unfinished beer and Nancy's Q water.  She had some water in her glass and one third of the bottle remaining before it was swiftly removed in our absence.If your kids are foodies and Grandma is limber enough to swing a leg over a bench or sit at a bar height table you will have some fun family times at National Westhills.  Otherwise get a sitter and knock back one of the craft beers with your buddies. 2
I was at Oliva's this evening with an acquaintance and within 5 min after we had paid our waiter came to the table to tell us the restaurant was expecting a large number of reservations and to please hurry up.  Only half the restaurant was occupied and there was absolutely no one waiting to be seated. I have never been told that by a waiter before in my life nor have I ever felt so unwelcome. 1
They showed up SO quickly, put in the replacement glass in my bedroom that my dogs broke VERY quickly. It wasn't the cheapest repair ever, but it was done quickly and right so I'm happy! 4
I would give this place 3.5 if it was an option. I live right down the street and customer service is usually pretty good when we come in to eat. I will say that their chicken wing combo is so worth it. Their food is not the best buuuuut you get a lot for your money. $6-7 for a 6 wing combo with your choice of lo mein or rice (wings are always big!) but be weary bc they ask what kind of lo mein and if you chose it with meat they upcharge (which they don't tell you about) They ask like that's how the meal comes. Sushi is mediocre, which I find it to be at most of the places in the area. Nothing to brag about so I usually just get something simple bc I don't believe their $10-14 rolls are worth it. If you're looking for something good but not great this is the place. Don't expect too much but it satisfies when you don't want to drive 20-30 min into clt for the better sushi spots. 3
Not the greatest food, but I like this place all the same. It hasn't changed a bit since it opened. 3
Great fusion Korean. One of the best I've ever had. Works for both native Koreans and Canadians. The kimchi fries were excellent, the tacos were superb, and the service was perfect. We received a couple of dishes on the house which was a pleasant surprise. Definitely will be there again and recommend to friends. 5
Love this place! It is awesome food. I have ordered here a few times and each time I have tried something different and loved it. Glad I found this place 4
I purchased a bunch of Groupons (yup, I'm a cheapie, NOT, just resourceful), and currently staying here for my business trip.The hotel is nothing like the Bellagio or Wynn (which I stayed during previous trips to Las Vegas), but I'm not a hater, but not a lover either of this hotel.  If it wasn't for business or the awesome Groupons, I probably would never have considered this place.There's an awful smell of smoke as you enter the lobby, probably because the "casino" is adjacent.But let's talk about what I have.  The King room is big with a mini-fridge (great), microwave, single person couch, work table and chair, large windows and fair amount of space.  The bathroom is clean, sink is outside of the bathroom.  I like that idea.  Large flat screen TV.  FREE wireless internet, great so I can login and work at no charge to me or my company.There's a little fitness room on the 2nd floor, I couldn't find it initially and asked for hotel staff help.  They are friendly I should say.  There are a couple of bikes, an elliptical that doesn't work, a stairmaster, 2 treadmills and some free weights and nautilus type equipment.  The equipment is not the high end precor or lifestyle type, but it works, and I can get a little sweat, not to say that Las Vegas isn't steaming at 105-110 during my stay!  It's HOT.There's a pool, but haven't checked that out yet.  I'll do that this weekend, get some rays and tan.Parking is self-park by the way, no valet.Will I come back?  Yes, because I have Groupons to use! 3
Five stars for the food.  It's awesome.  I can't dock them stars for being so popular that you have to wait to get in.  I believe it was Cliff Claven who said of a bar that wasn't Cheers, "no one goes there any more.  It's too crowded."  I've always had good service, and I've been about ten times.  Maybe I've just been in less of a rush than other reviewers.  Who's in a rush at brunch, anyway?Tip: unless the weather sucks, get a latte and a scone from Ella's Uncle across the street while you wait for a table.  Makes the wait a pleasure. 5
enjoy the 10% discount when paying with cash. Food is good, my fav is spicy chili chicken, vegetable fried rice and beef with black been sauceTry it out! 4
I thoroughly enjoyed my brunch experience at BSBC. A friend and I went on a game day around 11 am. I expected to have to wait, but was pleasantly surprised that we were seated immediately at the u-shaped bar in the back. Honestly, I think this was a great place to sit on our first visit. It gave us a chance to watch the kitchen, expediters, and other staff, who seemed to congregate back there and see order as they came up. I'm happy to say that this view didn't ruin the experience. The staff was very clean and safe with food handling. Also, everything put in the window looked amazing!Upon being seated, my friend and I ogled the picturesque doughnuts under the glass domes on the counter. We decided that we would get a few to go. Ended up with the Oreo and the chocolate hazelnut-- both fluffy and dense at the same time and perfectly sweet!At the restaurant, we enjoyed three split dishes. 1) the egg of the day, which was red pepper, spinach, and goat cheese. Really tasty and hearty, but nothing we couldn't do at home. The potatoes were really good though-- not overly fried or seasoned. 2) Chicken and a Biscuit. A huuuge piece of crispy fried white meat balanced on a flavorful biscuit. Topped with an egg (I asked for mine scrambled, which they were happy to do) with a flavorful sausage gravy and greens on the side. I'm not sure how one could make sausage gravy look appealing, and I've got to be honest, the look turned me off for a minute. Without being too frank, the peach-orange color and chunks of sausage an corn looked a little bit... uh... gross. That being said, once you get past that, it's really delicious! I swear! The greens on the side were a nice way to balance the heavy dish. 3) Chocolate Pancakes. To. Die. For. But they might as well remove the "pan" part. Between the chocolate in the batter and the chocolate buttercream on top, it's really a dessert. In all, it wasn't the healthiest breakfast, but we were there to go big, and we did. Everything was super tasty and our waitress was really nice, gave great recommendations, and was patient with our indecision on what to order.Also, it's great that they validate parking in the structure! And the place looks nice an stylish. 4
I go here all the time for dinner with my family. They recently renovated to expand the location and it looks amazing. One of the best chinese restaurants I've been to in terms of decor and food.I usually get the Eel Fried Rice and the Crab Salad...can't remember if those are the exact dish names.Dynasty Cuisine at Commerce Gate is pretty good too. I found a deal on HungryBuy.com for a full meal. Check it out. 4
A restaurant I have been visiting for the last 4 years!! From The time I set foot in the US from India. I can easily say this is one of the best restaurants in charlotte!! Shawarma special on hummus is my favorite. my mouth is watering as I am typing :-) Arayes, mixed grilled kebab, falafel, ful muddamus are some of my other favorites!!! I don't experiment too much with other items on menu as have never got bored with the above!!!! Knafeh is the desert I would die for :-)The Ramadan buffet they had was heavenly!!! I ended up going thrice in 3 weeks!!!I didn't give it 5 stars as the service still needs some improvement!!!Wish you could add few new items to menu. 4
After my first time here on a Friday night...I felt compelled to write a review. I went in around 5:30 for a pedicure & manicure.. there was no wait. The pedicure was the best I've ever had with a hot stone massage. It was terrific after a long week of being on my feet. The manicure topped it off with a hand massage & a shoulder massage as my nails dried. The customer service here is amazing. It really is the little things that make the biggest difference. For only $45..I will not be going anywhere else from now on. 5
The meal starts with some really good chips served with a selection of 3 different salsas and a bean dip.  But, that's as impressive as it gets.  The main plates are more about quantity over quality and I felt like the prices were high compared to similar restaurants.  The service was fine, but I just wasn't taken with the food and probably won't be back. 2
I haven't had any issues with pricing, service, or anything else.   They always say it will take about an hour but I usually get my food in about 40 minutes (and I am about a 7 minute drive away). This is my favorite delivery place, hands down.  The thai basil rice is a favorite of mine; the portions are huge, and they have a wide variety of options in both Thai, Chinese, etc.  Highly recommended. 5
I just moved close-by so I walked in for an eyebrow and upper lip threading ($12). The place has definitely been renovated since the last time. Things look much cleaner and more professional. Sadly, I wasn't as happy with the service this time around.There were 3 people working when I walked in and no one greeted me. They all saw me but two just kept dealing with their customers (The place was pretty busy). The threading lady just stared at me awkwardly for a minute without saying anything, so I just sat myself down and waited. About 5 minutes in and threading lady told me just to wait there. She was with a customer only standing and talking to her, NOT actually working (the customer seemed to be done her threading already). I was sort of annoyed but I had nothing else to do so I figured I might as well wait. In the end I waited 25 minutes for that already finished customer and another lady. Totally NOT pleased, since she spent 20 minutes just conversing with people. UGH. While it was my turn she was super friendly and all smiles. She was quick but careful and I was pleased with the outcome. That made things much better. Overall, I'll probably be back just because it's so convenient and cheap for me. However, I'm still expecting bad service the next time around as well. 2
Went to Zibo for lunch - ordered salmon. Specifically warned the waiter to ask the chef to make sure the salmon is not dry.However the salmon was dry and bland and came with grilled peppers and rice that tasted too strong for the fish.My second visit there and both times disappointing. 2
So.............I'm super sad. I only go out to eat every blue moon and when I do it is to the chosen ones. Good Food on Montford has been a chosen one of mine for quite some time. It has been more than few months since I have been in to eat so I was hoping for the same great experience as I had last time.  I'm confused did they get a new chef because it seems something has changed in the food........ I might not have a ton of cooking experience but the tastes seem to excite me more than my recent experience. Like my favorite the steamed bun, which has always made my mouth water, it felt like it was dry and needed salt and the glaze was much weaker.  I was also hoping for some more seasonal options for a seasonal restaurant. The brussel sprouts in the gnocchi seemed a little weird for being almost summer and the bacon was not crispy, it tasted really undercooked, it just was not pleasant for a mouth feel.  Where do you even get brussel sprouts right now, besides Harris Teeter? I just felt that the love for the food wasn't there compared to my previous experiences.  I hope that my opinion matters some what to Chef because I think he is or was truly amazing. I definitely give Good Food another chance, it is still and will still be one of the best restaurants in Charlotte dining no matter what I think.  My taste buds are still sad though................. 3
Ordered from foodora, fast delivery and food was hot hot hot.  Ordered the dinner for two. too much sauce in the red curry chicken ? Pad Thai was okay but I'm not a fan of tofu and there was a lot. Probably won't order again as it didn't really hit the spot. 3
One of my favorite hang-out spots in Vegas!  My friends and I been loungin' at Firefly since 2005 and I have nothing but praises to say.  Sangria and Mojitos are smooth plus their calamari and paella are delicious.  As I said, I have nothing but praises!! 5
I go to Graze often because it is right by my office.  I'm always craving something more from my experience.  The restaurant feels a little cold to me, especially during the day.  One time I ordered the ham sandwich and could barely eat it because there was so much fat (I appreciate that some people might like this).  On the other hand, I really enjoy the beet burger - it's different and delicious.  I'll be back, but hope they can find more consistency with their menu. 3
I had zeitoon parvardeh it was well season and was the perfect appetizer to start with my friend had fasenjaan a great vegetarian dish and  i had aloo ghesi it was pretty filling good mixing of flavors and authentic. the sitting the arrangement is snug and nice 4
Great atmosphere and staff very friendly, hairdresser actually took time to get to know me asked question and gave great suggestions. My hair feels so light and heathy, will definitelygo back and make it my permanent salon. I will recommend to everyone I know. 5
Iasis has gone downhill the last few years. In the age of squeezing every penny they can out a diminishing return healthcare, you see it the staff treatment, (both received and given), and shape of the hosptial and equipment. 3
Just dealt with Jessica in women's department and she was probably the rudest person I've ever met. You can do better Dillard's. 1
Restaurant was empty, but we would be seated down by the pool. Stuck up by the loud and obnoxious lounge.Too dark! Can't read a menu. No suggestions for cocktails. Poor service. No recommendations for food.App: $14 lamb was dry and tough, sent it back. $34 branzino. Head and tail cut off. 4 inches long. Suuuuper fishy. Very salty. TONS of bones. I couldn't finish it, it was too boney. Only food on the plate.$32 braised short ribs. Very greasy, no flavor $9 creamed spinach. Only veg. Barely enough for 2.it was ok.I'll never go back. And it was free. It wasn't worth being free. 2
We decided to try this place out for dinner tonight and I'm glad we did.  We went thru the drive-thru and from the time we ordered till we actually got our food was 12 minutes.  And we ordered 5 meals.  Price wasn't bad....spent $36 for 5 meals + a side of fried zucchini.  My husband ordered the pastrami burger and said it was delicious and had a good amount of pastrami' My daughter had the avocado burger ...needless to say it must have been good cuz it was gone in like 5 minutes.  My youngest daughter and My son both had the Jr. cheeseburger and they said it was delicious.  And I had the bacon burger.  It had a good amount of bacon and the bacon wasn't fatty....I can't stand fatty bacon' so it was perfect.  With the meal we all got fries and My husband and kids said that they could've had a little more salt but for me they were perfect cuz I don't like a lot of salt.  And the bag was a big size cuz we couldn't finish them after eating the burger.  And u get a drink which I think is a medium.  I actually thought it was going to be a small sized cup but it was a decent size as well.  And the fried zuchinji was delicious as well and was just over $3 and u get a lot for the price.  So overall we loved the food and the portion size.   I'm hoping they get slightly quicker at the drive thru so I can give them 5 stars.   But, great place and we will go there again for sure.   We needed a place like this in this area. 4
I definitely love fine dining but I believe for the price of the food the taste did not blow me away. I loved the atmosphere the decor was excellent. I went and dropped 2 bills and leave still hungry is disappointing which I know is typical at some fine dining places but for that price I could have ate at Mastros or another place where the potions are larger. As far as the food I ate a steak with onions as truffle sauce and it was excellent. This place is for the experience not to get full. If you want to leave full expect to at least pay 300. I would a have gave it a higher rating but I wasn't blown away by the taste and I didn't leave thinking it's expensive but worth it. 3
Very informative and entertaining. If you're near Mentor, it's well worth your time to check it out. I took off 1 star because of the bias the exhibits exuded (but just to be fair, I have that criticism about most U.S. Nat Historic Sites). Apparently if Garfield survived, he was such a genius all of our problems would have been solved.Anyway, I don't mean to sound so down on the place. It really is incredibly enjoyable site about a chapter of our history that largely ignored. 3
I have been to a few kennels and never liked leaving my dog there. Stonehaven is excellent, I love Gwen, she is awesome and so loving towards the dogs, I don't worry at all leaving my dog here, he has so much fun. And they post updates and photos of the dogs on their Facebook page. I highly recommend Stonehaven. 5
I have been to the Hoosier Cafe twice. The first time I went it wasn't bad. However, the last time my husband and I went it was horrible. We both ordered buscuits and gravy and coffee. We both were so disappointed with our meals we sent them back. We never do this, but it was unedible! The gravy had no flavor and tasted like jellied milk. The coffee was also quite horrible, it tasted like dirty water. I then ordered blueberry pancakes and my husband ordered blueberry waffles. I really should have sent these back as well. The blueberries tasted rotten. Needless to see we will NEVER be returning here and wasting our money again! 1
The staff was rude. The coffee tasted like water. It was WAY over-priced. Would never recommend this place. 1
I recently started taking my daughter here and couldn't be happier. She loves her teachers and they combine learning with fun. Every time I pick her up she raves about her day. I am thrilled with this daycare and the prices are hard to beat! 5
I came in here ready to buy a few hanks of yarn.  I was looking for a particular brand (Manos del Uruguay) and had been directed to this store.  After looking around unsuccessfully for about 15 minutes ( mind you this is a pretty small store)  I tried to get help from the staff.  I had to ask a sales person 4 times before she acknowledged me. Literally, I said "excuse me," and she acted like she couldn't hear me until the 4th time.  Mind you, she was not speaking with another person.  I don't know if I've ever experienced ruder behavior from a customer service professional.  In the 15 minutes that I was in the store I did not receive one acknowledgment from one of the 2 sales people who were working there.  Even a brief "hello" would have gone a LONG way.  I was trying to locate the yarn I wanted on my own, but I genuinely needed help to find what I was looking for.  In the end, they had very few colors in the brand that I wanted.  I heard them telling another customer that they could make special orders but no such offer was made to me.  Honestly, I will probably not be back here, at least not for a while.  I truly felt unwelcome.  As far as their yarns go, they have a nice but eclectic selection.  There were brands from Lamb's Pride and Cascade on up to much higher end stuff but it was a limited hodgepodge of each.  If you are going in wanting something in a specific weight and color, there is a good chance they might not have what you are looking for.  In my opinion, their decent yarn selection is not worth enduring their insultingly horrible customer service. 2
Terrible service and the food is very mediocre for the prices, would not recommend. The ridiculously loud music also makes it nearly impossible to talk to your friends. 1
In had the opportunity to eat here last December 2014 with some out of town co workers.  I am not a sushi lover so, you ask, why would I go here??  Well I was assured that although sushi was the speciality there were lots of other options.  And I was right.  The menu was full of many different dishes and at $21 per person all you can eat I left full and satisfied.  Serve was quick, friendly and efficient.  Everything was freshly made and tasted awesome. 4
I went to return and exchange a cheaply made pair of earrings that started falling apart the day I bought them. The misogynist old man who seems to run the store informed me that if I were a man he wouldn't accept the exchange but would only agree to exchange them since he doesn't want to be rude to a woman. He was very mad that I didn't have all the broken pieces with me (they fell off the day I bought them on my commute home). And he told me not to come back to return the earrings I exchanged them for. I definitely won't return. 1
Ok, I've been here a number of times and always get the #13 Original Italian.  Not a bad sandwich at all, but I always have to make sure I ask for them to go light on the vinegar and oil or else they FLOOD the sandwich with them.  So, made right it's not a bad sandwich but I prefer other sub places.  The reason I rate them so low is I tried the Philly Cheesesteak today.  WOW, ZERO flavor!!  I ate half the sandwich and gave up.  This by far is the worst and most flavorless cheesesteak I've tried in the Phoenix area so far.  Moving here 3 years ago, I've tried a number of cheesesteak places trying to find one that compared to my favorite place back home.  I've found a few good ones and some bad ones, but this was by far the worst.  I can only recommend that Jersey Mike's PLEASE add some type of seasoning to your meat on these things.  My wife and I both tried them and the only taste was from the other ingredients (cheese only on mine and mushrooms on hers).  I hate giving bad reviews, but really felt I had to put something out there....maybe the restaurant will learn something from it.  If you're going to Jersey Mike's, stick with the subs unless you like a warm cardboard sandwich for lunch, then try the cheesesteak. 2
Nice furniture and a knowledgable friendly sales person but very dishonest delivery information.  When we said yes to the salesman on 5/28 he said they would deliver on 6/8. Seemed like a long time but OK. Then we went to pay and they say they can't deliver until 6/12. 4 days later their customer disservice staff calls to say they won't deliver until 6/18. When I call to complain to the salesman he tells me their prices are sooo low they just can't keep up. We went to Mor and got delivery the next day. 2
Purchased a 3 series several years ago when I used to live out that way.First, I love BMWs and have plans to purchase another one.Second, I will not go back to Budd's to do so.Customer service is not consistent. Sometimes good, sometimes bad.Had a service issue that they could not find the answer to, though their repair technicians are specially trained specifically for BMWs. So I gave up on solving that issue.Service pricing is too high. You would be much better off doing a bit of research and going to a local mechanic that services imports.They snuck in an extra charge on a service call that I caught, fought and eventually was reversed. I suspect that many others don't pay attention and lose out.Their blatant focus on company profits is transparent. This is fine if you want to maximize $ in the short term, but as they gradually degrade customer service, and continue with aggressive pricing schemes, Budd's will eventually disappear, leaving an oily black stain in our memories of car dealerships past. 2
Cool little place, nice atmosphere and staff. Great coffee too, go check em out! 5
Slow serviceBelow average food Ill pass 2
I love me some Bachi Burger! When I found out that the Sahara and Ft Apache location opened I was very excited because now I don't have to drive all the way across town to eat there. I ordered the Pork Belly steamed buns and a side of the salt and pepper fries. I love their fries it was perfectly seasoned and had a kick to it because of the jalapenos. The pork belly steamed buns was okay the cilantro kind of over powered the flavor. My daughter ordered the kids Bachi burger which came with regular fries, carrots, and apple slices. She loved the burger! Overall, the service was great, the food is amazing, and I will definitely be coming back again to this location! 4
Expensive. Bad tasting burger. Gave them two stars because they have healthier meat than other places (their claim) 2
Food is okay but service is terrible. 40 minutes for an order to be 'ready,' they lost track of their order stub, subsequently lost my receipt to help track it, and had problems calculating what a full refund was. 2
Well I had to give a star because required. This place is a star minus. Land scraping does not exist and the up keep is just a grade above a bed bug infested super 8 hotel so what does that tell you. 1
The pizza, which I was looking forward to, disappointed me. I feel however, that it was partially my fault. There is always a caveat when ordering pizza by the slice. The mushrooms weren't cooked and just sat on top of the pizza. The pepperoni was barely warm and didn't even have the grease running yet. The cheese seemed congealed and rubbery. All of these problems could have been solved, in theory at least, if I had ordered a whole pizza and it was fresh. The one shining point in the entire event was the pizookie. Probably one of the best deserts ever, but not quite enough to make up for the pizza. 2
Not enough help; they do not serve "good old fashioned corn beef hash" !You can get it with "swiss cheese"  or with "zucchini"  yuk! 2
We stayed here last weekend. The room is very spacious, which is nice, and parking is free. What stuck out to us the most, however, was the service we received when our car broke down. We assumed it was a dead battery but the maintenance employee, Dave, went out of his way to check it thoroughly (probably over an hour's worth of work) and figured out it was the alternator. When we went to Canadian Tire, they told us it was the battery but after we insisted they check the alternator, lo behold, Dave was spot on. Dave, you're amazing and you deserve a raise. :) 5
Due to a time crunch I didn't have time to order my flowers ahead. I came here and was able to find a beautiful arrangement.  I told them my budget and they did a wonderful job of helping me find exactly what I wanted and they really did look beautiful.  Great service and fast. 5
Bunny spice smoothie delicious! Almond milk, carrot juice, ginger, cinnamon, raw honey. Yum. This was my first of a million visits I'm sure. 5
I live by this park and like going to it for the convenience. It used to be well taken care of, but now people just let their dogs crap all over, not just the dog areas, but the main soccer field. News flash people... no one wants to step in your dog shit! SO CLEAN UP AFTER YOUR DOG! They provide bags, why not use them. Be a little more responsible and considerate to other people. Dog shit carries disease, like parvo. 4
sushi is fresh as usual, but nothing outstanding. The rolls were good. Good service. I think the catch is the rotating belt, but since it is common in Asia so it's not that attractive to me. The plate decoration was pretty though. 3
This I believe is the heart of Las Vegas. When I dream Vegas this amazing fountain . Forever impresses. It's also the best view to have and remember Las Vegas. 5
milieu of older established folk & young hipsters coming together for best music scene in greater cleveland... & super reasonable tix prices! 4
Have gone to this restaurant 3x and unfortunately the food quaility is getting worse every time. The last trip I ordered pho, broth was flavorless, amount of noodles were skimpy. The worst part was the bean sprouts that were brought to the table seemed limp and looked like they were cooked, but they were NOT! Not planning on ever going back. 1
Was excited to see a fish restaurant going in at Summerlin. However, was very dissapointed in this place. Went during the opening week. Arrived about 3:30PM looking for a late lunch. We were told that lunch stopped at 3:00PM and we would have to order from the dinner menu. Same food, different price. We were the only ones there, so it wasn't busy. In fact there were so many servers, moving around it was like a show. For a fishplace, it did not have Oysters, which is what I was looking for. Ordered the Fish and Chips, small portion and very greasy, if fact had an upset stomack later. The wedge salad was nice with lots of blue cheese. That I would order again. I doubt they will do well here. It is too pricey for what you get and I don't find the menu very much to my liking. 3
Good breakfast sandwich, XL brewed iced T, nice people(new owners?) note: looked for BIG "COFFEE" sign in complex. 4
This is my favorite pizza place. Last week, we went for our monthly Meet-up group dinner and it did not disappoint. Everyone raved about the food and the service. The waitress described all the specials (there were many) in great detail and we wanted to try them all. The portions are huge and the prices are reasonable. There is a nice variety on the menu from soups to salads to dinners and dessert. I highly recommend this place. And although they do not take reservations, we had no problem getting a table for 8 at 5:45. 5
Note to self - yelp has a mobile app, use it!I wish I would have read the reviews for this place before stopping in for lunch but I was in the area and figured a chain couldn't be bad. Ha!A sign told us to seat ourselves so we did. A server stopped by and asked if we wanted something to drink. We all ordered but I almost had to argue with the server to get a root beer. She told me it was from the tap and was $4.50; she said this like she was trying to talk me out of it but she did add that I would get free refills. Ha! More on this later. She didn't give us menus and left for about five minutes. When she returned she brought menus but forgot the straws so she disappeared again. I should note that there were three servers for six occupied tables.We finally got to order. I had the parmesan chicken sandwich. It was pretty bland. I got potato salad for a side, also bland. I tried the Philly Cheesesteak and, yep - bland. I also tried the fries. They were OK.The server never did stop by to see if everything was OK or to refill our drinks. I waited patiently for my check and finally got up and hunted her down. She was chatting with the other servers. I got my check, paid cash so I wouldn't have to spend any more time and left. On the way out I noticed a sign that said we were entitled to a free dessert. Someone might want to mention it to the server.Overall, bland food, terrible service and an expensive root beer. 2
this mall had so much potential. Just like mesa, this mall has gone down hill. A pathetic excuse for a mall.The "young shoppers" are absolutely loud and rude. It's a mall, if they want to run around chasing each other they should have gone to a park.The only great thing about this ghetto mall is the Best Buy and Spencer's. Don't waste your time. 2
Madison Mallards games offer fun and family-friendly entertainment for a great price! We paid $10 each for our seats, and honestly, I don't think there is really a bad seat there! I can see the food (priced like a typical sporting venue) driving up the cost of your experience, if you're not careful. But stadium food is always so tempting!The game we attended was a pretty good one, with a home team win, but they do such a good job of keeping the crowd entertained in other ways, that I wouldn't have minded either way! The night I went, there were dozens of giveaways, contests, and even weiner dog races! I can imagine taking kids here, but can also see how it would be incredibly fun with a group of adults! I happened to be enjoying a date-night and I thought the experience was great in that context too!Looking forward to going back and hanging out in the much-hyped Duck Blind. 4
The drive thru is always so awkward, I've come here twice and each time it's a hassle. They switch people during the order and make you repeat yourself way too much. I ordered light cream and light sugar.. I get to the window and I'm handed an iced drink which looked like cream with light coffee. I hate asking for people to remake drinks but I repeated my drink order 3 times. The employee looked at me like "are you really asking for me to make the drink you ordered".. I'm paying for it, so yes. What has happened to customer service?!? Blows me away! 1
Just purchased a 2017 iMac and related products, and had lots and lots of questions - since my "old" iMac is a late 2007 model running Mt. Lion! The service was excellent - emailed questions promptly answered both by email, and with follow-up phone calls. The "guys" were patient, carefully explained everything, and I never felt pressured to buy. They were pleasant and eager to be helpful. Can't wait for my new iMac to be installed - and have every expectation that the service that day will be just as good. 5
It pains me to write this review.  I've been going to Sakana since grad school in 2007, when we'd hit up the 59th Ave. location regularly.  When I moved, I was happy to find this location was close to the house and it became my 'take-out' sushi joint.  Probably went there 20 times in the past year - mostly with called in orders, but often dragging the (non-sushi-eating) boyfriend along for a dine in.  Rolls are big and stuffed with fish, esp. for the price, and the quality is pretty good.So what happened? 2 terrible experiences in a row.  In May, I had a hankerin' for take-out, called in my order, and got the usual "It'll be ready in 30 minutes."  Perfect.  Enough time to drive over, stop at the Safeway and get some beer before picking up the delicious yumminess.  Did that, got the sushi, paid and was halfway home when it occurred to me that there were fewer boxes than usual.  Pulled over, did a check and... sure enough, they forgot my nigiri.  Darn.Called them up, told them what happened, and headed over to pick up my food.  (I had been charged for it, I was going to get it.)  Head to the hostess, tell her who I am, "Oh, ok.  We'll put that order in for you." Uh? You didn't already? "You're going to expedite it, right?" "Oh, of course."So I wait.  And wait.  And wait.  How long does it take to make up 8 rice balls, wasabi them and plop pre-cut fish?! Talk to the hostess... it is coming? My other sushi IS sitting in the car.  "I'll go check."  Ok... so I wait some more.  I've been irritated for a while now, but apparently it is becoming visible.  It has been 30(!!) minutes since my "expedited" order was put in (70 minutes since my original order was phoned in).  The manager sees this and comes over, asking what is wrong.  I tell him.  To his credit, he gets the order handled and gives me a $10 coupon to come back.  Still annoyed, but mollified, I head out.Fast forward to last night.  I have my coupon and a hankerin' for sushi, so wrassle up the boy and head back to give Sakana another chance.  I put our name on the list (30 minute wait) and, because it is crowded & noisy, head outside to wait.  There are several other folks out there and, periodically, the hostess comes out calling names.  Once. Twice.  Three times.  She comes out, calling names.  After a while, someone comes out and lights up a cigarette within smelling range (ew!!!), so the boy and I head inside to wait.  Names are called.  New people come in and get their names on the list.  More people are seated.  It can't be long now! Then the hostess goes out and fetches some of the new people, happily taking them to a table.  WTF?! The boy goes and looks at the list.  We've been crossed off.  WTFF?! Our name hadn't been called - we were in earshot the entire time; why was it crossed off? Forget this - I guess they don't want us to eat here.  So we got up and went across town to my true favorite sushi place.  (If it weren't such a long drive to Scottsdale, we'd always go there.)  Which worked out much better, since the staff recognize us, the fish is better, there is more non-sushi variety for the boy, and it is much less noisy and crowded.I'll be back to Sakana one more time.  I still have that coupon after all and $10 of sushi is $10 of sushi.  But now I'm on the prowl for a new sushi place close by to become my new "take out" place.  It's too bad... I DO like them a lot, but to receive execrable service two times in a row is unacceptable. 2
hole in the wall..definitely take out instead of dining in..food was made fresh & huge portions..fried rice was good..sweet & sour chicken not so much..general tao chicken tasted how dogs smell :( wont return 2
$100 bucks to fix my scuba pro dive computer... batteries for life I find out from Scuba Pro of AZ... and their shop is under contruction... Only paid to mail it in! Not good to over charge people.Then $75 for a 7 foot regulator hose, on line $29 milfex no less... Not good folks.  I'm willing to pay more to have a shop open here and for the face time but your way too expencive! 1
After one bad haircut for my 2 year old, I tried this place again.. The next was a little better, but still not awesome.. (yes he is two, but he stays very still & is VERY cooperative while getting his hair cut, in fact he loves it) I tried once more because its 5 minutes away from my house & LUCKILY there was a sweet lady named Jessica there that did a wonderful job.  I went back today hoping to see Jessica and she wasn't there & the staff was so rude.  Almost like if you "walk-in" its such an inconvenience & they treat you that way..  If you accept walk-ins, you should have more than one person working so that there's not a 45 min wait.. Luckily I have Jessica's number & made an appt for tomorrow with her 30 minutes from my home.. 1
After shopping around for cushion replacement not only did I get the best price and customer service here, but Valerie even came to my home at no additional charge to measure everything. She even offered to discard the old ones for me & if they're in good enough condition they donate them to dog shelters to be used as beds which is such an amazing idea! They had the best selection of fabrics from different manufactures including Sunbrella, Tommy Bahama, Outdura, and Pindler. Valerie was also really helpful to narrow down choices that helped me stay in budget, but as she mentioned you can start here and the sky's the limit! 5
Service was wonderful! Got the BLT and it was good. We happened to be buying a car and got hungry so we just headed over to Mustang Sally's by a door connected to the Ford Country dealership. 5
We are locals and 2nd time here...first time was awesome! Looking forward to our 2nd time but very disappointing. Especially on V day.  The veal was extremely dry and the sauce didn't help...so sad. 1
First and foremost, you'll enjoy this place if you like a more laid back, festive, and friendly environment. The manager, Chad made us feel very welcome and told us the history of the restaurant. Our waiter Regina was attentive and amazing as well. Food was traditional Mexican and very good. So happy we came here and didn't go anywhere else. Prices were fair, employees seemed happy, and we left full and feeling thankful. Definitely worth a visit when in Vegas! 5
Food good, not great. The costumer service is poor and uninviting. I am a regular and have had good experiences in the past but last night was very very unpleasant. Upon arrival they had mentioned they were busy and they were out of rice and we could not dine in since they were closing in 30 minutes. To me as a small restaurant owner I would never tell costumers that they can't dine in because they are closing soon. This is so uninviting and makes me think what is the point of your hours. When your open your open and you should go above and beyond your costumers not trying to get your employees out earlier. Sure enough a couple and a family of 6 came in and after hearing the news they all left. Again who knows if these are first time diners at your establishment. Way to set a good first impression. So my girlfriend and I both ordered west 25th tacos ( 2 each) because they didn't have rice to make burritos.  We also got 2 drinks (one of them was only filled 3/4 of the way) and a bag of chips. When I was checking out since I am a regular I had my club card to stamp. I had 2 of them that had a few stamps on them each. The cashier tried to explain to me that these were for burritos only. I had responded they always did it for me in the past if I got 2 west 25th st tacos since it equals the cost of a burrito and I said anyways we would of gotten burritos if there was rice. She explained to me very snotty that the rice doesn't make the burrito. Its all the other ingredients. She also said we shouldn't of waited till they were about to close to come in. Isn't that the point of business hours? We were there at 8:30 when they close at 9. ( I know their business hours on the website say close at 8 but since again I'm a regular I know on Friday and Saturdays they close at 9).Last thing I'll say as a business owner and former hospitality professor, the costumer is everything. Going above and beyond for them will continue success of a business. Telling a family carryout only when they close in a half hour isn't a way to build business. I don't think this one particular cashier reflects the entire staff but she was a bad apple. She needs to learn how to speak to costumers because she was very abrasive. I teach my staff you treat the first costumer the exact same as the last.Food was good. Still think Chipotle has more flavor but I always try and support local.I don't think I will be back. You should also consider taking the delivery off of your website because I called to deliver another time and they said I couldn't 2
Worst customer service ever. I normally don't write reviews but I had to this time.  I have spent hundreds of dollars dry cleaning my clothes here for years. In each week/every other week with my shirts and pants. Today I was 2 min past the 9a drop off time for same day pick up and was told "sorry you're too late bro". I explained that I was stopped at every light and needed my clothes back tonight for an event and they said it wasn't their problem - 9a means 9a not 902a. For someone who is a regular customer you would think they could make an exception. Of course they told me I would be able to get my clothes back same day before they rang me up and took my payment. Only upon reading the receipt did I see I missed the deadline. I asked for a concession on the time and was told the above. Obviously upset I told them I would like a refund and would not be returning here and asked if they cared they would be losing a regular customer to which the $7/hr girl behind the counter said she didn't care. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER and they lost a regular today. I hope the owner of the establishment reads this and fires the staff who clearly don't care about his business. If I was 10 min late I would understand but this was ridiculous over 2 min. 1
I Brought in some shorts to be altered here- the owner is a sweetheart, was accommodating and nice.Not to mention she's located close to ASU so it's great for students like me to get any thing done they need to their clothes.The most important thing- good vibes.Ignore the negative reviews- I'm sure if they were in even a slightly good mood they would appreciate the obvious experience and welcomingness of the store - not to mention I'm sure the owner would have fixed anything had they simply kindly asked.Thank you ill be back for my alteration needs! 5
Went on a Tuesday night and the place was virtually empty when we arrived. Montreal must have a later dinner crowd, because by the time we left around 10pm it was starting to fill up. Our waitress was new, so she couldn't help with a lot of recommendations as she hadn't tried much yet (other than try to upsell, which she did a lot). We had the salmon tartar, which was fantastic. Also had a bottle of La Crema pinot noir, which is now one of our favorites and we're hoping to find it at home. The space is very cool, and the music was great. Good spot. 3
Went in this evening. No one there to great patrons. After waiting, hostess says can I help you. Looking at 8 empty tables, I ask to be seated. "Noooo" she says.  "I'm sorry. We are totally overwhelmed". I've dined here many many times but that kind of reception will take this place permanently off my list." 1
nice place, prefer this store than those you find in pacific mall. their range of product is impressively huge. contrast to what the other reviewers said, i find the staff very kind and helpful. i would recommend shopping here but not their lash extension service.  i had my lash extension done here and frankly i expected more. 3
Seriously, this restaurant needs to start over.  My wife and I had dinner last night and it was horrible in every regard.  The service was the worse I have ever experienced.  But worse than the slow uncaring service was the cold  tasteless food that was brought to our table.  I would have complained, but the waitress never returned to check on us.  The barbeque fried chicken was a pile of sweet greasy mess and my wife's salmon sandwich was cold and completely unseasoned...awful.  The fried pickles we ordered also arrived at room temperature.  I ordered a half chicken but got lucky when the waitress got it wrong and delivered a quarter.  The corn muffin could have been used as a weapon.  The new decor was nice but the seating is completely cramped and the noise level was off the charts.  Chuckie cheese would be an improvement over this place.  I'll miss the food and ambiance of the old Diamond.  I would think any recent rating of this restaurant with more than 2 stars were done by owners/family or friends. 1
I recently purchased a used car from this dealer and not to blame them so much as they have 3 locations. However, their service dept. needs a lot of work. The car I purchase, 1 month ago, was either not checked out at all or those people have no idea what they are doing. I have had to: replace the battery, air filter was disgustingly filthy and long past due to be changed, no washer fluid at all, coolant needed added to and sway bar bushings on the rear of the car were shot and had to be replaced. They supposedly took care of the noise in the rear (bushings). Will never recommend them to anyone. When told them about the battery, i will say, they did send me a check for 65.00$. Battery was 120.00. Return phone calls   are next to impossible to get. Never again. 1
Just ok.  Meatballs...Not exciting, then had Fughi flatbread and the vinegar on the onions punched me in the face. I tasted no mushroom or truffle oil 2
Food is very good. Often times have to wait for chicken which is a good sign. However, if you order 8 pieces or more, and they are busy, they often substitute pieces for others. I ordered 12 pieces on several occasions and they have substituted chicken breasts with chicken drumsticks because they did not have enough breasts to put into the order. 3
Very good pizza, pretty basic, no bells and whistles or modern/gourmet pizza, just good, classic pizza pie. The rest of the menu is a bit limited, but if you're just looking for pizza, this place is a good bet.  The greek salad is also pretty good, heavy on the feta and black olives, which I love, and onions, which I don't, but are chunky enough to be picked off. If you are having a party for kids, you can go for the huge take out rectangle pizza, but I wouldn't order that for adults (as most pieces are inside slices, without crust)The restaurant itself isn't much in the way of atmosphere, so we've done take out, or in years past delivery.  If you want take out pizza in Mint Hill, this is a great alternative to Hawthorne's. And it's nice to support a local, small business. 3
First time for this buffet because of waiting for check in, the salad bar is good, dessert is beautiful, but the Mid-Eastern station is terrible, after we sat down, the roasted turkey is finished, according to the chef behind the counter, it will be 10 minute for next one coming up. However we wait for over 35 minutes, we still not seeing the turkey on the serving table. Also, there is no instructions for beverages area, waitress never come up and say hello, just pass by and pick up the trash dishes. We are not sure who is our server.I believed I won't come back to this place. 2
1 star for locating the car rental facility in effing Indiana. If you're returning a rental car, be sure to build in an extra 3 hours to get shuttled to the airport.Sweet Jebus 1
Underwhelmed. Cool vibe, very pretty staff, nice choice of background electronic music. Roles were tasty yet they were thin, short and just anemic and incredibly overpriced. The sashimi was good. So if you want to impress a non sushi connoisseur Enso might work or if you have a fix for some sushi, this place works. Just make sure you bring some $$$ scratch!  I left saying that was just "fine" meaning average. 3
40 minuets for a waffle and a kid's French toast.  When the food did come out it was not even close to hot. Flavor was just average.  Don't think I'll be back. 2
I got a deal with Caravan Carpet Cleaners on Groupon. We had moved out and our landlord insisted we clean the carpet even though she was probably going to replace it (it needed replacing before we ever moved in). I scheduled the appointment a week in advance. They called two days before to say there had been some confusion with the schedule and could they please come a day earlier. No problem. They came on time to the rescheduled appointment. As with pretty much any carpet cleaning service, they tried to up-sell me on the pre-treatment. I said no thanks. He threw in one room of pre-treatment for free. That room looked great. They other rooms looked a little better but not as good as the one that was pre-treated. All in all, I was satisfied with the service. I got what I paid for. 3
Got upgraded to one of their luxury suits, but it still felt tacky to me.(This is part my distaste of their pink theme being driven into every detail.)They are trying to be high end.  motorized window shades, bath mirror with remote control and embedded TV screen etc.  Kinda cool stuff, but they just have to take care of the basics before aiming for a level they just cannot achieve.At 6pm when I arrived, they had a line that zigzagged like security check in at an airport.  They were setup with many many back and forth line control fencing.  (This line was not a one time event for them!)  I returned at 11pm only to still wait for over 30 min in a shorter line.In the room my alarm clock was set for 3am.  Calling the operator gets you to a phone robot, not a person.  The AC unit did not function properly.  The amenities were nice, but for me they just don't make up for such lousy execution. 2
I purchased a new PriusV at Right Toyota recently.  The sales associate assisting me was Spencer Koenig, a smart, thoughtful and very polite professional.  Spencer made my experience completely pleasant.  Initially I went to a different dealership and had a very uncomfortable experience with a salesman who was disrespectful of me and gave me a "hard sell" treatment.  I am so glad I came to Right Toyota.  They gave me a great deal with great financing, and the whole process was easy, and actually fun. I even enjoyed the transaction thanks to a man called Nick in the Financing Department who was extra kind and helpful.  I had my first experience with the service department when my seats were traded up for leather seats, and I was given a rental car for free.  I love that the Enterprise rental agency is right there on site within the service office.  Last week I had the first routine maintenance appointment.  The Service Department gets 5 stars for intelligence, friendliness and efficiency. 5
Ordered takeout of Tom kah Kai and spring rolls. Quick service, excellent flavors. Thai hut is family run and the flavors are authentic and rich.Haven't had the chance to dine in yet but if the takeout is any indication,the service and food should be excellent. 4
This restaurant is slow, and the staff is extremely rude. They cannot handle the Lunch/Dinner rush. (Honestly those times tend to bled into one another). The rice was hard and under-cooked, the guacamole looked brown, and the Salsa had a funny aftertaste.When it comes to online ordering, you are better off going to the restaurant and waiting in line (that is at times 15 people deep) because the online orders from this restaurant are never ready when one arrives nor correct. If you tell one of the staff  that the order was incorrectly made, be prepared to receive attitude. Just do yourself a favor and go to a different Chipotle altogether. 1
Bottom Line: This place is strictly for fresh pies (PIZZA PIES for all you non-eastcoasters).  If you catch the kitchen on a good day, you may get lucky and have a good meatball parmesan hero (sub).  And the fresh Italian bread to make heros is really good.  But for the most part, we stick strictly to whats under the glass.I laughed at a reviewer who complained their wasn't a "childrens menu" with mac and cheese.  You went to eat at an Italian Restaurant run by New Yorkers.  I never heard of a childrens menu in NY unless it was a chain restaurant.  If you take your kid to a pizzeria, it's to eat pizza, not mac and cheese, chicken fingers, or grilled cheese. But I will agree that a lot of the food is NOT fresh.  The chicken cutlets are definitely frozen.  I'm from NY and this is probably one of the 2 best places in Phx to get a good slice.  Order a fresh pie, it's better right out the oven.....and remember AZ, for a real NY experience, put down the knife and fork, fold your slice, shake a little garlic on it,  and forget about ranch for dipping........eeeeeew :) 3
I really enjoy Earl of Sandwich.First and foremost, I love that their soups are only $2.99.I am a huge fan of tomato soups and they have a very good tomato soup with croutons.EoS is generally a rather affordable food compared to nearly everything else on the strip.Strangely enough, Kalila and I both wanted soup today. We went to Earl of Sandwich for some Broccoli Cheddar. It was a VERY HEAVY soup. It was good and tasty. I would have liked some more broccoli chunks though.I had a full montague and it was delicious. I really liked the roast beef and the mustard.Kalila had the canonballs and it was also delicious. The sauce seemed to be all over the sandwich wrapper instead of the meatballs, though. Overall, it was kind of dry. We like that the bread is toasted, but after reading Misti's review, she makes a great point about how there are no other bread choices.Based off of the other times Kalila has eaten there:She highly recommends getting a tuna melt sandwich and a tomato soup. Eating them together is reaaaaaallly good!OH, AND!You can order a Grey Lemonade. It's Grey Iced tea and lemonade. Basically, an arnold palmer with a different type of iced tea. Whether or not you like it, depends on your taste buds. I know people who love it and people who can just tolerate it. It is something that they fill your cup behind a wall, but refills are free if you ask at the pick up area. Just try it to see if you like it or not.#foodcrew 4
Had lunch today at Wahoo's with my wife. She had  beef taco with side of black beans. Beans came straight from the can. No flavor at all. I had the reef burrito.  Should have gone to Del Taco   Not up to par. Will not return 2
Ordered the country breakfast (eggs, bacon or sausage, biscuit w. Gravy) and the Monte Cristo sandwich with fries. The food was good but not great however the price is right. The gravy on the biscuits was a little disappointing and the fries were too hard for my liking. Would definitely get a different side next time. Service was awesome. Would go here again for some cheap eats but will try some different dishes. 3
This place is quite a find.  A very eclectic memo and fine service.  I enjoyed a white sauce pizza and my wife enjoyed one of the nightly specials.  Service is good! 4
Alright, but very expensive for what you get. Pork was way over cooked, almost like rubber but the apps were good. I would go somewhere else and others in the party agreed. 2
We went to Avec Bistro for our anniversary in June 2013 and it was beyond our expectations. The food was fabulous and the service was exceptional.  I had the duck and my husband had the lamb. Both were outstanding - I really dislike lamb but this was so good, even I would order the lamb.  We had some questions about wine pairings and suggestions given by our waitress were bang on. Everything about Avec Bistro gave us such a fantastic meal experience that we will definitely be back soon. 5
These people came to my house and try to jack up my price by almost $80 from what we originally discussed on the phone do not call these people 1
Attentive staff, quick service, tasty food, interesting menu options, reasonably priced.  Could be more authentically flavored.  I would return. 4
My favorite Mexican Restaurant in Las Vegas!! I always order the Chilaquiles. My husband and I are Mexican and a little picky of where we eat our Mexican food. This place is our spot!. My 4year old loves it and we get a complimentary photo to take with us, so I have plenty of photos of myself with my family. We get great service and if we want anything special for my 4year old they always accommodate.  I didn't give them a 5 star only because the parking...well it sux to find a good parking spot, however the car shop behind them are very kind and will let us park in their business parking lot. 4
We got married in Las vegas in flamingo and honeymoons in there too. I would highly recommend this budget hotel. Our wedding was perfect, the value for money is excellent, our pictures taken by the hotel photo com. for very cheap price and very good quality, were very professional too, and my bouquet was perfect. Stephanie who manager of this budget hotel was so sweet and was happy to talk us any time we ask for it. We met with her a few days before wedding and she talked us through everything, very friendly and professional. The whole organisation of the wedding in this hotel was very 'fuss free' and simple. honeymoons hotels room was little bit small but very nice bathroom. I was nervous about organising everything over the phone and Internet, and thinking there would be hidden charges. But ther honestly it went through very nicely . 3
We love Ba Shu!  It's always delicious and fresh. If there is a line-up, don't worry its a large restaurant and tables become available quickly.It's a must when in Mississauga. 5
Burger was burnt to a crisp.Pizza was salty as a shaker full of salt.Service was nowhere to be found.Needless to say, we will not be returning. 1
I would have to say this is the best place to get a burrito in Arizona by far.  Got their Carne Asada burrito with rice and sour cream inside.  One of THE BEST burritos here.  The tortilla was just perfect.  Tried their Chorizo burrito, and it was pretty tasty.  They really don't skimp on the meat here.  The chorizo was quite oily though.  I was halfway done with it and it was soaked with oil.  The chips and salsa are really good too.  Low prices, great food.  What more can you ask for. 4
I purchased a stove and dishwasher and paid extra for having the D/W installed by their technician which was scheduled two days after delivery.  I was told by the salesman that delivery guys will remove the old stove but dishwasher has to be removed by installer and he would take it to the curb at no extra cost.when the installer called to confirm the appt. he advised that he will not move the dishwasher unless I pay extra to have it hauled away by them.went back to the store and was told I need to pay extra $25 which I did.the installer who was scheduled to come over on Dec 15 between 9-11 called at 11 to say he has an emergency and will come over on Monday 18th.   he showed up and installed the d/w but said he will not remove the old unit since it's not on his work order. I tried calling the store to have them speak with the installer but there was no answer.  he left the unit outside the main entrance blocking the walkway and left.i went to the Brick for the third time to sort this nightmare and was told they will look into it and call me back......still waiting for the call to come through.also, their delivery guys do not cover their shoes entering your home and do not clean up the snow and dirt they drag into the house with them.in my view even 1* is too much for the service I have received;  safe to say I will NEVER buy anything from the Brick AGAIN.. 1

The food is always really really good. I have become very happy with their fajitas. My office orders for pick up quite often, and every time we order, something gets forgotten. This time it was the tortillas, which kind of ruins the fajita for me. But regardless the food is still great. I would just suggest dining in or triple checking your order if its for pick up. 3
A true Icon of Calgary.  This theatre plays host to some of the most  impressive films in history.  An interesting venue to say the least; has a small town appeal in the mass of a bustling city. A treat for any cinema buff. Original and a Great Escape (hoping to see that one there one day). 4
Went there with a Groupon with my husband on Sunday for a dinner buffet.  As many reviewers have already indicated the buffet options are minimal; that said, they have the most popular Indian food e.g.Food:  overall okay...meh!  Meats:  curry lamb, tandoori chicken, curry basa fish and butter chicken. Vegetarian: curry lentil, mixed veg, basmati rice and some other curry.  Salad Bar: green salad, mixed salad, kale salad, condiments and some deep fried food (spring rolls, samosa, pakora.Naan: ask server for either garlic or plain    **I found the temperature of the food was a bit on the cool side and not hot enough.Service : good service if there aren't a lot of customers- they don't have enough staffOverall: With this Groupon,  it comes with any drinks including beer, house wine and even mango Lassi.   Overall for the price we paid, good value.  But probably won't be coming back...definitely have had better Indian food. 3
The ramen is awesome and the prices are great, you get a lot of food for your money. The broth and noodles are tasty  ! The spicy miso broth is super good and you get a lot of toppings and a hand roll for $10! The young lady who served us was very nice and helpful. Definitely coming back. 5
First time dining at this restaurant. We were greeted and sat at our table quickly. Food was good. Customer service was excellent. I would  recommend trying this place to anyone who is looking for a good Mexican restaurant. The only reason I give it 3 stars is because 3 of the people I was with ordered menudo and they were about to bring out our food and said they ran out of menudo. 3
The absolute worst place I have ever lived. Bugs of every variety, upstairs unit flooded ours, and the worlds most awful manager, Olivia, who likes to verbally attack and threaten children and play favorites with the tenants. Plumbing never works, no hot water, or it is either scalding or freezing. Very unprofessional behavior by all "employees," I use that word loosely, as most of these folk live here, as well as work here. Drug use rampant at this place. More drama than on any soap opera. Look elsewhere if you value your sanity. 1
Absolutely love this place. The owner is nice, the prices are good and the food has so much flavor. This was a nice discovery. With its small dining room and adjacent kitchen area you almost feel as if you're eating in someone's house. I'm not one to notice or care about service usually, just bring me food and I'm happy, but the man here opened the door for us when we arrived, adjusted the window blinds by our table when we sat down, and was very helpful and attentive. . I love it 4
I'd have to agree with a lot of the other reviewers. Suede is a decent restaurant if you're staying at the Westin but not worth the trip if you aren't staying at the hotel.We had the $18.00 breakfast buffet. It had all the essentials: eggs, bacon, sausage, bagels, toast, fruit, waffles. I would've like a few more options but for the price (in Vegas) it was worth it. I thought everything tasted very good and our server was extremely nice and friendly. If I return to the Westin, I will certainly hit up this place again for breakfast. 3
Best shrimp cocktail in the state. Service was excellent. We are excited to go back. Give it a try and cut the location some slack. 4
Like the previous reviews, I was truly amazed after looking at the facility.  I give it that this place is new, clean and big, with many activity rooms (which your kid may or may NOT get to use, given his/her age).  I was going back to work so I wanted the best for my child and this place appeals to you when you first visit.  The tuition is high, but we decided to give it a try.  Teacher/Student Ratio: For my child's age group, I usually experienced that there was a fair ratio.  Whether those teachers were attending to the kids as they should is a different story.  There are always different teachers early in the morning and in the evening (when one of the primary teachers has either not arrived for the day or has already left)Teachers/Staff:I feel like to any parent, teacher(s) is the most important selling point for a preschool/child care.  This is where I have been most disappointed.  My child is not easy and had never been to a daycare before, so I expected some adjustment period.  But after months, I still fail to see an improvement.  The teachers seemed to care moderate amount for the first two weeks, but after that they just seem to ignore my questions when I ask for an update on the improvement.  They just straight up end the conversation and no further details are provided.  For as much money as I pay, I 100% expect better quality of care for my child.  For me, it comes down to this (nurturing/attention/engagement) over those fancy rooms and aquarium.  I am not some crazy parent, who expects to hold my child all day and give him/her constant attention, but I also don't accept that he/she is ignored all day.  I feel like if a child is upset, teachers could do a better job of engaging him/her in an activity.  Most teachers are below average - average, and I am sure there are some exceptions, but I have failed to experience it.  The director Stephanie has not engaged with me at all.  She has not once asked me how my child is doing or had a friendly conversation with me.  When I did have a couple of questions for the director, I received short blunt answers.  If you are expecting a regular parent-teacher update, forget it.  Celena promised to provide an update on how my child is doing when we enrolled, that stopped after first day!  She is there to sell. Period.  Other staff is average.  Front desk is always filled with people, not sure what they do.  Meals:They are average.  I see a lot of repetition.  Nothing  extra ordinary.  My child has some dietary restrictions and I often see same thing for lunch many times a week.  There are many days where my child comes home without eating anything all day.  My child also doesn't seem to be properly hydrated while there.  Activities:They seem to be doing same stuff all the time.  No special supplies (besides cheap paper plates to cut in to shapes) for the tuition amount.  And they need additional $150 for supplies for the upcoming year?! By the way, we were not informed that an annual fee for the supplies will be collected, when we enrolled. I agree with the previous reviewer that they don't have their auto draft figured out.  They frantically called me one day to let me know that my tuition was past due only to find out that they already have my credit card.  Overall, I am not happy with this place.  They fail to meet my expectations for providing my child the attention and care he/she needs for the price I pay. 2
DJ Paul Oakenfold brought back life to Vegas nightclub scene.  I love Rain but Oakenfold makes all the reason why I keep coming back.  Atmosphere is out-of-this-world with neon lights and glass mezzanine plus add lovely ladies in their pyrotechnics rope dance moves.  Definitely Vegas! 4
Definitely one of the better options along green street. The lunch special rolls are by far the best deal. You get a big piece of naan filled with whatever you choose rolled up and served with pakora. I usually eat about half and finish the rest later. If you're vegan sometimes they will accommodate by using Roti instead of Naan.The menu is on eatcu's website. 4
Nice employee but bad flower selection. They tried to sell me dead flowers. 2
Literally just came here for brunch this morning and I just had to write this review now.  The food came out really slow and I am not sure why.  We literally waited for about 45 minutes for the food.  The server told us the kitchen can't handle fast enough when the restaurant is full.  I think the management really needs to step up the game and expand the kitchen.Now onto the food, my sister ordered the veg scramble with salad.  The salad was really wilted down with the dressing and it didn't look fresh.  I ordered the beastwich and the chicken  has absolute no favour at all.  The potato tasted under cooked.  Would I come back again, probably not... 1
its a frigging fast food restaurant people, rating it higher than 1 means youre part of the overweight masses killing this country 1
Jamie is so comforting to work with! I feel confident and relaxed every time I sit in his chair and I leave every time feeling like my best self. 5
Beef is terrible. Stringy, gristly and overcooked. Chicken is good. 3
I'm giving this location a 2 star for delivery!  They don't tell you the truth about delivery time.   And it's excuse after excuse without actually taking responsibility for their issue!  I wouldn't recommend Michael Hill to anyone! 2
I recently went here for dinner and ordered the gazpacho, Drake Salad and the halibut entree. The soup and salad were both simple but fresh. The halibut was cleanly presented and the sauce was well flavored, yet the fish was over cooked and didn't have that flakey texture and buttery mouth feel that well prepared halibut should. The ambiance of the restaurant is trendy but relaxed and the waitstaff was attentive and friendly. Overall, it was a decent meal but none of the dishes were close to being a "Wow". The prices leaned towards the expensive side. 3
Hands down this place is popular and busy, but I've just never had that great of an experience at any of the locations.  I'm happy that a local business has been so successful and been able to expand throughout the state.But there is just always something that steers me wrong.  This trip the waiter informed us that there was dairy in the marinara sauce....well just scratch the bulk of the menu for me.  Sure, Italian meals are heavily based around cheese, but there are very few other options on the menu as an entree.Everyone else walked away happy...so I'm the odd man out.  I was in the mood for pasta and walked away only sampling guacamole, garlic bread, and nibbled on some sweet potatoes fries.  Would really like to see some more health conscious (lighter) options besides a 4lb salad.Pros:Busy and lively atmosphereHuge portions (hopefully to take home)Well pricedGreat for familiesCons:Always a waitFeel like watching 'The Biggest Loser' afterwards 2
Great mussels, which is their specialty. Nice little restaurant for an intimate dinner that isn't dressy and all about the food! 4
Place was empty for a Friday night around 8, but we were starving and wanted to try something new.  I am not going to complain a whole lot about the food quality.  I ordered the Lasagna and it was quite good with a great bolognese sauce and garlic toast.  My wife had a burger that she devoured with good fries as well.  Serving size was average but adequate.  I would give food quality 3.5 stars.However . . . sticker shock was an understatement.  Read the menu for yourself and make your decision, but this food was worth at most 60% of what they charge.  (It's Vegas . . . probably 40% in any given home town place.)The service was spotty . . . the people there acted a little like they didn't know why they were there.  And the most memorable thing?  I think the sound system is being driven by an old CD player - as about every 90 seconds the cookie-cutter pop music would skip for 2-3 seconds like you used to experience when carrying your Sony Disc-man around.  At first I thought it was just a song or two, but it happened in every damn song they played.Unless the prices come down - we will trudge our way to the Food Court for a quick bite, so I expect a new venue to fill this void sooner rather than later. 2
A rustic decor as we entered that reminded me of Italy, without reservations. The food was very appealing but lacked flavour in 5 out of the 7 dishes.  The highlights were the appetizer mussels (white and garlic), the lobster ravioli and gnocchi. One big tip: the spicy flavoured olive oil condiment honestly made my Nona's pizza taste acceptable, as it was traditional stone baked pizza but soooo thin it flopped when held to eat.  The service was VERY friendly and hospitable while being comforting and attentive. The tiramisu dessert was longing on flavour, heavy on lady fingers and missing mascarpone. It was a fail for us, disappointed as they highlighted this dessert as the best.Overall, there are better Italian style restaurants in Mississauga. After all, the food flavour is what draws all yelpers back to a restaurant. 2
I've never had a problem with the in restaurant service. BUT if you are looking to do a to go order prepare to wait a ridiculous amount of time. 30+ minutes AFTER placing your order, I've already been waiting 38 minutes after being told over the phone that the order would be ready in 10 minutes. When I arrived they hadn't even started making my food. I like this location but I would NEVER order to go service and I definitely wouldn't recommend it anyone else. 2
I've never had any trouble here. I bought my car here a couple years ago (2013 Kia Rio). Buying my car was as painless as possible! After it was purchased, for every oil change, tune up, etc., Keith Anderson and his crew have been friendly, helpful and open about anything my car needs or will need in the future. Any time there is a concern, they show me the problem, explain options for a solution and we go from there. I wouldn't even consider going anywhere else! 5
I ordered their (steak of course) fajitas and they were not good ... at all. I LOVE tex-mex, and I couldn't finish them. The onions tasted like they had gone bad, and soured the entire plate. Add to it that there was almost no flavor in the meat (salt and pepper are not the only spices in the world ....) I was extremely disappointed. When your restaurant is NAMED fajitas, you'd better deliver. 1
We went last night, 7/7/12. We don't usually frequent chain restaurants, but we had a gift certificate. We went early to beat the rush and were immediately sat. The hostess was friendly and out waitress greeted us warmly. The service wasn't bad, honestly. For an appetizer we ordered the Awesome Blossom, the big onion. It was awful. Very disappointing. I had been years ago and I remember them being awesome. I was bummed. It seemed like the onion still had skin on it and many of the onion petals were only thin skin, not bites of onion. It was really bad. I barely ate any. Luckily, the salads followed quickly and they were good. I got the small sirloin with sweet potato fries. My husband got a bigger sirloin and a baked potato. The steaks were cooked perfectly, mine was a perfect medium and my husband's was a perfect med. rare. However...the steaks had no flavor. I had to ask for A-1 and I don't even really like the stuff. Another disappointment. The potatoes were fine though. I had some blackberry cocktail and that was super awesome. Sweet cocktails aren't usually my thing, but it looked awesome on the menu and tasted just as great. My husband asked for a draft beer (forget which one exactly) and he got a bottle. He wasn't thrilled about that, but he was happy about the cold mug that came with it. Overall, the food isn't enough to bring me back, but at least the service was good. 3
Incredibly impressed with their customer service. The hotel is swanky, rooms are spacious, location perfect. I had annoying special requests and they accommodated me with a smile. Their valet were also exceptionally helpful. I stay in hundreds of hotels a year and "the 9" was a breathe of fresh air. 4
I should've known it was going to be a problem when I walked into the half empty restaurant on a Sunday morning and had to fight to gain eye contact with anybody that worked there to get seated.  But at that point, when you say "There are two of us", you are sorta committed to the place.  A few minutes later another person came and seated us.  This turned out to then be our waitress also.  It seems that maybe they each seat people as they desire in their sections?  Not sure.  But there were 4 people waiting tables and 11 tables with people.  So I cannot fathom how service could be so incredibly poor.  And when I say that the service was poor, please don't mis-interpret that the staff was rude or otherwise because they were not.  Everybody was fairly friendly and courteous etc...  But they just seemed to be running around aimlessly.   It became comical to a certain extent because we didn't really have anyplace else to be.  But all the tables of people seemed to be rolling eyes at one another at how long it could possibly be to get the check.  Or to order their food or even get a refill of iced tea.  There were tables that had still been left uncleaned from gosh knows how long before we arrived that were still that way after we left.  Our waitress was quick to explain that "They had been crazy" before we got there.  But for the entire hour or more that we were there all four servers were acting like they were in the midst of a "rush", but there was no crowd there.  They ran around and around once in awhile bringing food out with them or something.  I waited 15 minutes for the check after they'd taken my dates plate and left mine empty (so they knew we were done), but our waitress was somehow MIA.  I had to ask one of the other servers.I give them two stars because it wasn't entirely unpleasant.  Once again, all nice people.  But if you've gotta be somewhere...anywhere else that day make sure you think twice before hitting this place up.  Also, the food really was very good.  Almost worth the rest.  As I said to my date "I do have to admit that this is probably the best French Toast I've had in ages", because it was.  But when you spend $13 for two pieces of Toast with no sides it damned well better be the best you've ever had.  And if you want to split anything they charge $3 for that.  Who really does this anymore?  My date ordered the salmon BLT and that was $17.  So the pricing is a little outta whack for breakfast too.Anywhoo...food quite good but too expensive and the service just ridiculous.  Probably not heading back anytime soon.  Sorry guys. 2
Dig this space for coffee and vibe. Compared to the 'bucks down the street this is an oasis of calm. Coffee is from Pilot, and homemade food is yum (cookies and cinnamon rolls). Looks like they're adding more lunch choices which should help them build more traffic (will be 5 stars once they get this up and running). My new "go to" place in the 'hood 4
My favorite part about Tease aside from the friendly atmosphere and the great brands that they carry is my stylist, Casey Rossal. I followed her here from another salon and love coming to see her in her new spot. She really knows hair and can translate a picture to suit your individual complexion and hair type perfectly. She is kind, professional, warm, knowledgeable, talented and completely passionate about her craft. She is a true artist and you will leave feeling like the best version of yourself. I HIGHLY recommend her if you want beautiful hair. 5
Helen owns A&M, and she is such a pleasure to work with. She had creative ideas to fix my problem items, and truly wanted to help me feel satisfied and pleased with my clothes instead of trying to add on unnecessary charges. She'll discuss with you at length instead of rushing through your issue. She keeps working hard and makes tweaks until she gets it perfect, even if it takes time and is more difficult for her. I'm so happy with my end results! Do not hesitate to ask for her - she'll go the extra mile and you won't regret it! 5
Friendly and helpful staff - they take care of you here! We only had appetizers and a beer at the bar, but apps were hot and tasty and good beer variety (we are craft snobs). Ran out of one app, manager (owner?) apologized up and down. Super nice folks. Will come back again. 5
I'm your average wonder bread from mid America, so admittedly the only experience with Asian cuisine I have encountered has only been with in the past few years. Saying this, I still must attest to the genuiness, warmth, and comfort in not only the service  but the food of this modest establishment. Unable to decide,  I ordered the biggest combo, and I finished every bite.  The tempura.... Amazing... Light and crisp with just the right amount of sinful grease, but for me the real cherry on this savory sundae was the beef teriyaki...tender beef and the perfect kiss of sweetness in the sauce.  Needless to say I finished my plate! These folks deserve all the praise they have received. 4
This is pure class all the way. A classic gem amongst Toronto's live venues. I've seen everyone from BB King to John Stewart perform here and the venue has been nothing short of superb. If you are at all on the fence about seeing a live event here then just go. 4
Falafel pitas, with hot sauce?  Delish!Hummus?  Delish!Tabbouleh?  Delish!Babba ganoush?  Delish!Service?  Outstanding!  (The owner loves children... has a gaggle of them himself.)Price?  5 pitas, hummus, tabbouleh, baba ganoush, and a bag of pitas ~$25.00The BEST picnic to-go in Charlotte. 4
I think by now, Wimpy's has worked out some of its kinds which plagued it from their grand opening day.  I'll admit that I won't go throught he drive-thru anymore, because on the two sole occasions doing so--mind you, this is when they first opened, it took about 30 minutes to get my food.  That being said, I have ordered at the counter and have eaten in-house, and the time to get my food wasn't all that long.  The burgers, themselves, are of good size and quality.  While fries are not healthy, they give you a lot of them for your money.  I enjoy their 1/3 pound cheeseburger, their avocado burger, and pastrami burger.  These are not sandwiches for the faint-hearted, because they are all very filling.  For the money, you get a lot.  It is a mom and pop place, and as such, service at the counter can vary.  I'd like to believe that they are doing their best, but the young crew needs a few lessons in public relations.  The place is clean, but there is a pervasive smell of, to me, "sewage," somewhere.  That's probably the only detraction in my review here.  Order out, and you'll avoid the smell entirely. 3
I have a very difficult dog. She finds grooming traumatic. But considering that 3 other groomers have managed to do at least a little bit more than I could in my own home (finish the brushing, half the nails, make her look pretty), and this groomer couldn't do anything but bathe her, I was disappointed. And I forked over more cash than I have anywhere else (even during happy hour). They were nice about it but they told me I need to have my dog put under anesthesia for grooming. She weighs 18 pounds. I'll just take care of her at home, I guess. 2
If you need to replace your watch batteries, don't go to this store.  People who works there doesn't have much knowledge about watches.  After they have replaced the watch battery, they left a huge gap between the watch and the covering.  This can let water leaks into the watch's mechanical parts and causes damages.  They tried to cover their bases by saying they are not responsible for water demages after they have worked on the watch.  To me, it just sounds like an irresponsible store. 1
We're from montreal (the home of Cora's) and are generally a fan, but our experience at this location was aweful.- Server was excellent, friendly and helpful.- 2/2 coffee mugs sent back with lipstick stains (not ours)- tea service complete with hair.- food took 45 minutes (not busy)- french toast was raw (literally uncooked egg soaked bread)- crepes were stone cold (like stale tortillas)- sausage included multiple hairs- eggs were cold- we were splashed with dirty water while bus-girl wrung out her cloth.Had to walk out.Very sad. wanted Cora's. This location has some serious problems though. 1
If I could give 0 stars I would. My friend was sexually harassed here by a supposed friend of the owners/bartenders and they did literally nothing besides provide the harasser with excuses. An unsafe and uncomfortable atmosphere dominated by entitled townies. 1
After reading all the wonderful reviews on Yelp, I decided to give this place a try. First impression was nice, clean, small and cosy. The service was okay but nothing outstanding. My main complaint was with the food. I ordered the sashimi meal where it was well over $10 for a selection of 10 tiny pieces of raw fish (not very generous with their portion sizes) which tasted very bland and chewy. Their maki rolls had too much rice in them which gave it a bit of a dry texture so it wasn't the melt in your mouth kind of sushi. The only highlight for me here was their tempura appetizer which came out with a nice variety of vegetables that were deep fried and came out super crunchy. Conclusion: If you are expecting a true Japanese experience then this is not the place for you. 3
